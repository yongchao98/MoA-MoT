The following 1H NMR data was obtained:\n1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.0 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz), 5.5 (1H, dq), 2.1 (3H, s), 1.6 (3H, d)\nIdentify the unknown compound as either Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate.\n\nA) Cis-propenyl acetate\nB) Trans-butenyl acetate\nC) Trans-propenyl acetate\nD) Cis-butenyl acetate\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning used to identify the unknown compound from the provided 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe provided data is:\n*   **Signal 1:** `2.1 ppm (3H, s)`\n*   **Signal 2:** `1.6 ppm (3H, d)`\n*   **Signal 3:** `5.5 ppm (1H, dq)`\n*   **Signal 4:** `7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)`\n\n**2. Identify the Functional Group from Signal 1**\n\n*   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is typical for protons on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **Integration (3H):** The signal represents 3 equivalent protons, characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   **Multiplicity (s - singlet):** The protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n*   **Conclusion:** A 3H singlet at ~2.1 ppm is a classic signature for an acetate group (-O-CO-CH3). All four possible options are acetates, so this is consistent.\n\n**3. Determine the Alkyl Chain (Propenyl vs. Butenyl)**\n\n*   Let's sum the total number of protons represented in the spectrum: 3H (from 2.1 ppm) + 3H (from 1.6 ppm) + 1H (from 5.5 ppm) + 1H (from 7.0 ppm) = **8 protons**.\n*   Now, let's find the total number of protons in the candidate molecules:\n    *   **Propenyl acetate (CH3COOCH=CHCH3):** The molecular formula is C5H8O2. It has **8 protons**.\n    *   **Butenyl acetate (CH3COOCH=CHCH2CH3):** The molecular formula is C6H10O2. It has **10 protons**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the NMR integration shows a total of 8 protons, the compound must be **propenyl acetate**. This eliminates options B (Trans-butenyl acetate) and C (Cis-butenyl acetate).\n\n**4. Assign the Remaining Signals to the Propenyl Group**\n\nWe are left with two possibilities: Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The structure is **CH3(a)-CH(b)=CH(c)-O-CO-CH3(d)**. We need to assign signals 2, 3, and 4 to protons a, b, and c.\n\n*   **Protons (a):** This is the methyl group on the double bond. It is coupled to one adjacent proton, H(b). Therefore, it should appear as a **doublet (d)**.\n    *   This matches **Signal 2: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**. The chemical shift around 1.6-1.8 ppm is typical for an allylic methyl group.\n\n*   **Protons (c):** This is the vinyl proton attached to the carbon that is also bonded to the oxygen atom. The electronegative oxygen atom will strongly deshield this proton, causing it to appear far downfield (at a high ppm value). It is coupled to one adjacent proton, H(b). Therefore, it should be a **doublet (d)**.\n    *   This matches **Signal 4: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**.\n\n*   **Protons (b):** This is the other vinyl proton. It is coupled to two different sets of protons: H(c) (1 proton) and the H(a) methyl group (3 protons). According to the n+1 rule, this signal should be split into a doublet by H(c) and a quartet by H(a). The resulting multiplicity is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n    *   This matches **Signal 3: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**. Its chemical shift is between the other two protons of the propenyl group, which is expected.\n\n**5. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle is to determine the geometry of the double bond. This is done by examining the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinyl protons, H(b) and H(c).\n\n*   The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value represents the interaction between H(c) and H(b).\n*   The established ranges for vinyl coupling constants are:\n    *   **Trans-coupling (³J_trans):** 12 - 18 Hz\n    *   **Cis-coupling (³J_cis):** 6 - 12 Hz\n*   The observed value of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely within the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of the number of protons, the splitting patterns, and the key coupling constant, the unknown compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Protons and Basic Groups**\n\nFirst, let's sum the integrations of all the signals to find the total number of protons in the molecule:\n1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n\nNow, let's compare this to the number of protons in the possible compounds:\n*   **Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2)**: Has 8 protons.\n*   **Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2)**: Has 10 protons.\n\nSince the NMR data indicates a total of 8 protons, we can immediately eliminate both **Cis-butenyl acetate** and **Trans-butenyl acetate**. The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Assign the Signals to Protons in the Structure**\n\nThe general structure of propenyl acetate is CH3-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH3. Let's assign each signal:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**: A singlet (s) integrating to 3 protons in this chemical shift region is characteristic of the methyl protons of an acetate group (-O-C(=O)-**CH3**). This group is not adjacent to any other protons, hence it's a singlet.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**: A doublet (d) integrating to 3 protons. This corresponds to a methyl group (**CH3**-CH=) that is coupled to a single adjacent proton. This is the methyl group attached to the double bond.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)** and **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**: These two signals correspond to the two protons on the C=C double bond (-**CH**=**CH**-).\n    *   The proton at **7.0 ppm** is significantly deshielded, which is typical for a vinyl proton attached directly to an electronegative oxygen atom (-CH=CH-**O**-). It is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to only one other proton (the other vinyl proton).\n    *   The proton at **5.5 ppm** is less deshielded. Its signal is a doublet of quartets (dq). The doublet splitting comes from coupling to the other vinyl proton (at 7.0 ppm). The quartet splitting (a 1:3:3:1 pattern) comes from coupling to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (at 1.6 ppm).\n\nThis assignment confirms the connectivity of the molecule as propenyl acetate.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nThe final step is to determine the geometry of the double bond using the coupling constant (J value). The coupling constant between the two vinyl protons is given as **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n\n*   For vicinal protons on a double bond, the coupling constant is highly dependent on their stereochemical relationship:\n    *   **Trans** protons typically have a large coupling constant, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis** protons typically have a smaller coupling constant, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nThe observed coupling constant of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely within the typical range for a **trans** configuration. This indicates that the two protons on the double bond are on opposite sides.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the total number of protons, the signal assignments, and the large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz), the unknown compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Proton Count (Integration):**\n    First, let's determine the total number of protons in the molecule from the integration values given in the 1H NMR data.\n    *   Signal 1: 1H\n    *   Signal 2: 1H\n    *   Signal 3: 3H\n    *   Signal 4: 3H\n    *   **Total Protons = 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8H**\n\n2.  **Compare Proton Count with Possible Structures:**\n    Now, let's find the number of protons in each of the proposed compounds.\n    *   **Propenyl acetate:** The propenyl group is C3H5, and the acetate group is C2H3O2. The formula is C5H8O2. It has **8 protons**. This matches our data.\n    *   **Butenyl acetate:** The butenyl group is C4H7, and the acetate group is C2H3O2. The formula is C6H10O2. It has **10 protons**. This does not match our data.\n\n    Based on the total number of protons, we can confidently eliminate both **Cis-butenyl acetate (B)** and **Trans-butenyl acetate (A)**. The correct compound must be a propenyl acetate.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Coupling Constant (J-value) to Determine Stereochemistry:**\n    We are left with two options: Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The key to distinguishing between them is the coupling constant (J) between the two protons on the double bond (vinylic protons).\n    *   The data shows a signal at **7.0 ppm** which is a doublet (**d**) with a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n    *   In 1H NMR spectroscopy, the magnitude of the coupling constant between vinylic protons is highly dependent on their geometric relationship:\n        *   **Trans-protons:** J-values are typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n        *   **Cis-protons:** J-values are smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n    *   The observed coupling constant of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely in the range for a **trans** configuration. This indicates that the two protons on the double bond are on opposite sides.\n\n    This evidence allows us to eliminate **Cis-propenyl acetate (D)**.\n\n4.  **Confirm the Structure of Trans-propenyl acetate:**\n    Let's assign all the signals to the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate to ensure a perfect match.\n    *   **Structure:**\n        ```\n          H(b)   H(a)\n           \\    /\n        CH3(c)-C==C--O--C(=O)--CH3(d)\n        ```\n    *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This is the singlet for the three equivalent protons of the acetate methyl group (**CH3(d)**). It's a singlet because there are no protons on the adjacent carbonyl carbon. This matches.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the vinylic proton **H(a)**. It is shifted far downfield because it is attached to a carbon that is bonded to a deshielding oxygen atom. It is split into a doublet by its trans-neighbor, **H(b)**. This matches perfectly.\n    *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This is the other vinylic proton, **H(b)**. It is split into a doublet by **H(a)** (with the same J=16.0 Hz coupling) and into a quartet by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group **CH3(c)**. This results in a doublet of quartets (dq). This matches.\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This is the methyl group on the double bond, **CH3(c)**. It is split into a doublet by the single adjacent proton, **H(b)**. This matches.\n\nAll aspects of the 1H NMR data are consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Signal at 2.1 ppm:**\n*   **Chemical Shift:** 2.1 ppm\n*   **Integration:** 3H (represents 3 protons)\n*   **Multiplicity:** s (singlet)\nThis signal is characteristic of a methyl group (CH₃) attached to a carbonyl group (C=O). A singlet means these 3 protons are not coupled to any adjacent protons. This perfectly describes the acetyl group (`-OCOCH₃`) present in an acetate ester. All four possible options are acetate esters, so this signal is consistent with all of them.\n\n**2. Analyze the Remaining Signals and Determine the Carbon Chain Length:**\n*   The remaining signals are at 7.0 ppm (1H), 5.5 ppm (1H), and 1.6 ppm (3H).\n*   The total number of protons accounted for by these signals is 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 protons.\n*   Let's compare this to the non-acetate part of the options:\n    *   **Propenyl group** (`-CH=CH-CH₃`): Has 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 protons. This matches the data.\n    *   **Butenyl group** (`-CH=CH-CH₂CH₃`): Has 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7 protons. This does not match the data.\n*   Based on the total number of protons, the compound must be a **propenyl acetate**. This eliminates options A (Cis-butenyl acetate) and C (Trans-butenyl acetate).\n\n**3. Distinguish Between Cis and Trans Isomers using the Coupling Constant (J-value):**\n*   We now need to decide between Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate.\n*   The key piece of information is the coupling constant (J) for the protons on the double bond (the vinylic protons).\n*   The signal at **7.0 ppm** is a doublet with a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**. This coupling arises from the interaction between the two protons on the `C=C` double bond.\n*   There is a well-established rule for the magnitude of vinylic coupling constants:\n    *   **Trans-coupling (`J_trans`)** is typically in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis-coupling (`J_cis`)** is typically in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n*   The observed value of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely in the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**4. Final Confirmation of the Structure:**\nLet's assign all the signals to the structure of **Trans-propenyl acetate**: `CH₃(a)-CH(b)=CH(c)-OCOCH₃(d)`\n*   **Protons (d) at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):** The methyl group of the acetate. Correct.\n*   **Protons (a) at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** The methyl group attached to the double bond. It is split into a doublet (d) because it is coupled to the single adjacent proton H(b). Correct.\n*   **Proton (c) at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz):** The vinylic proton attached to the carbon bearing the oxygen atom. It is highly deshielded (higher ppm value) due to the electronegative oxygen. It is split into a doublet (d) by the other vinylic proton, H(b), with a large trans-coupling constant. Correct.\n*   **Proton (b) at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** The vinylic proton next to the methyl group. It is split by H(c) into a doublet (d) and by the three protons of the methyl group (a) into a quartet (q), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). Correct.\n\nAll the provided data is perfectly consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the given 1H NMR data:**\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates a methyl group (CH3).\n    *   **Splitting (s):** A singlet means there are no adjacent protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group in an acetate ester (CH3-C(=O)O-). This strongly suggests the presence of an acetate group in the molecule. All four options are acetate esters, so this is consistent.\n\n*   **Remaining signals: 7.0 ppm (1H), 5.5 ppm (1H), 1.6 ppm (3H).**\n    *   The total integration for these signals is 1H + 1H + 3H = 5 protons.\n    *   A propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) has 1+1+3 = 5 protons.\n    *   A butenyl group (-CH=CH-CH2-CH3) has 1+1+2+3 = 7 protons.\n    *   Since the remaining protons sum to 5, the unknown compound must have a propenyl group, not a butenyl group. This allows us to eliminate the butenyl acetate options (B and D).\n\n**2. Differentiate between Cis- and Trans-propenyl acetate:**\n\n*   We are now choosing between A) Cis-propenyl acetate and C) Trans-propenyl acetate. The key to distinguishing between cis and trans isomers is the coupling constant (J) between the two protons on the double bond (vinyl protons).\n    *   **Cis coupling (J_cis):** Typically ranges from 6 to 12 Hz.\n    *   **Trans coupling (J_trans):** Typically ranges from 12 to 18 Hz.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   This signal represents one of the vinyl protons.\n    *   It is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to only one other proton (the other vinyl proton).\n    *   The coupling constant is **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value is large and falls squarely in the range for *trans* coupling. This indicates a *trans* configuration for the double bond.\n\n**3. Confirm the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate:**\n\nLet's assign all the signals to the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate:\n**CH3(a)-C(=O)O-CH(b)=CH(c)-CH3(d)** (with H(b) and H(c) being trans)\n\n*   **Signal (a) - Acetate methyl:** No adjacent protons. This corresponds to the singlet at **2.1 ppm**. (Matches)\n*   **Signal (d) - Vinylic methyl:** This CH3 group is adjacent to one proton, H(c). It should be a doublet. This corresponds to the doublet at **1.6 ppm**. (Matches)\n*   **Signal (b) - Vinyl proton:** This proton is adjacent to the oxygen atom, which deshields it, moving it far downfield. It is coupled to one proton, H(c), in a *trans* arrangement. This corresponds to the doublet with a large J-value at **7.0 ppm (J = 16.0 Hz)**. (Matches)\n*   **Signal (c) - Vinyl proton:** This proton is coupled to H(b) (which splits it into a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (d) (which splits it into a quartet). The resulting pattern is a doublet of quartets (dq). This corresponds to the signal at **5.5 ppm (dq)**. (Matches)\n\nAll features of the 1H NMR spectrum are consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe presence of a propenyl group (eliminating B and D) and the large coupling constant of J = 16.0 Hz (indicating a *trans* double bond) definitively identifies the compound as Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the unknown compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, which is characteristic of a methyl group (CH3).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s):** A singlet indicates that these protons have no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is typical for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group, as in an acetyl group (`CH3-C(=O)-`). All four possible compounds are acetates, so they all contain this group. This signal corresponds to the acetate methyl protons.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Another methyl group (CH3).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** A doublet means this methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton (`-CH-CH3`).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This shift is in the allylic region, suggesting the methyl group is attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (`C=C-CH3`).\n\n*   **Signal 3: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** A single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This is in the vinylic region, meaning this proton is attached directly to a carbon of the double bond (`C=CH-`).\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq):** A doublet of quartets indicates this proton is coupled to two different sets of neighbors:\n        *   **Doublet (d):** Coupled to one other proton.\n        *   **Quartet (q):** Coupled to a group of three equivalent protons (a methyl group).\n    *   This proton is the one adjacent to the methyl group at 1.6 ppm (causing the quartet) and adjacent to the other vinyl proton at 7.0 ppm (causing the doublet).\n\n*   **Signal 4: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** A single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** Also in the vinylic region. This proton is significantly deshielded (further downfield), which is characteristic of a vinyl proton attached to a carbon that is also bonded to an electronegative atom like oxygen (`-O-CH=C`).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** A doublet means it's coupled to a single adjacent proton. This must be the proton at 5.5 ppm.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the most crucial piece of information for determining the stereochemistry. The coupling constant between two protons across a double bond (vicinal coupling) is highly dependent on their relative geometry.\n        *   **Trans coupling:** J is typically in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n        *   **Cis coupling:** J is typically in the range of 6-12 Hz.\n        *   A J value of 16.0 Hz is strongly indicative of a **trans** configuration.\n\n**2. Assemble the Structure**\n\n*   From the signals, we have identified the following fragments:\n    1.  An acetate group: `-O-C(=O)-CH3` (from the 2.1 ppm singlet).\n    2.  A propenyl group: `CH3-CH=CH-` (from the signals at 1.6, 5.5, and 7.0 ppm). The `CH3-` corresponds to 1.6 ppm, the `-CH=` next to it corresponds to 5.5 ppm, and the final `-CH=` corresponds to 7.0 ppm.\n*   The presence of a propenyl group eliminates the butenyl acetate options (Cis-butenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate). The choice is now between Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate.\n*   The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) between the two vinyl protons (at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm) confirms that they are in a **trans** orientation.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe molecule is an acetate. The alkyl group is a propenyl group. The stereochemistry of the double bond is trans. Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nLet's visualize the structure and confirm the assignments:\n\n```\n      H(a)\n       \\\n        C=C\n       /   \\\nH3C(c)-   O-C(=O)-CH3(d)\n       /\n     H(b)\n\n```\n\n*   **H(d) (2.1 ppm, s, 3H):** Acetate methyl group.\n*   **H(c) (1.6 ppm, d, 3H):** Propenyl methyl group, coupled to H(b).\n*   **H(b) (5.5 ppm, dq, 1H):** Vinyl proton coupled to H(a) (trans) and H(c).\n*   **H(a) (7.0 ppm, d, 1H, J=16.0 Hz):** Deshielded vinyl proton coupled to H(b) with a large trans coupling constant.\n\nThe data perfectly matches the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n*   **Analysis of 1H NMR Data**\n\n1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is characteristic of protons on a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon (C=O).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, consistent with a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   **Splitting (s):** A singlet indicates that these protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal strongly indicates the presence of an acetyl group (CH3-C(=O)-). Since the compound is an acetate, this is the `CH3-C(=O)-O-` part of the molecule.\n\n2.  **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region, suggesting a methyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   **Splitting (d):** A doublet means this methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton. This suggests a `-CH-CH3` fragment where the CH is part of the double bond.\n\n3.  **Signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm:**\n    *   These signals are in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). They represent the two protons on the double bond, let's call them Ha and Hb.\n    *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n        *   This is one of the vinylic protons (Ha).\n        *   It is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to one other proton (Hb).\n        *   The coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz** is very important. Coupling constants between vinylic protons are stereochemically dependent. A large J-value (typically 14-18 Hz) is characteristic of a **trans** relationship. A smaller J-value (typically 6-12 Hz) indicates a *cis* relationship. The value of 16.0 Hz clearly points to a *trans* double bond.\n        *   The high chemical shift (7.0 ppm) suggests this proton is attached to a carbon that is also bonded to the electronegative oxygen atom of the acetate group (`-O-CH=`), which deshields the proton.\n    *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n        *   This is the other vinylic proton (Hb).\n        *   The splitting pattern is a doublet of quartets (dq). This means it is coupled to two different sets of protons.\n            *   The **doublet (d)** part arises from coupling to the other vinylic proton (Ha). The J-value for this coupling would be 16.0 Hz.\n            *   The **quartet (q)** part arises from coupling to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (the one seen at 1.6 ppm).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure**\n\n1.  We have an acetate group: `CH3-C(=O)-O-` (from the 2.1 ppm signal).\n2.  We have a propenyl group: `-CH=CH-CH3` (from the signals at 7.0, 5.5, and 1.6 ppm).\n3.  The `J = 16.0 Hz` value confirms the double bond has **trans** stereochemistry.\n4.  Putting the pieces together: The acetate group connects to the propenyl group to form `CH3-C(=O)-O-CH=CH-CH3`.\n5.  This structure is **Trans-propenyl acetate**. Let's verify it against the data:\n    *   `CH3(acetyl)-C(=O)-O-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3(c)`\n    *   `CH3(acetyl)`: Singlet at ~2.1 ppm. (Matches `2.1 (3H, s)`)\n    *   `H(a)`: Vinylic H next to oxygen. Coupled to H(b). Expected to be a doublet and downfield. (Matches `7.0 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)`)\n    *   `H(b)`: Vinylic H next to methyl group. Coupled to H(a) (doublet) and CH3(c) (quartet) -> dq. (Matches `5.5 (1H, dq)`)\n    *   `CH3(c)`: Allylic methyl. Coupled to H(b). Expected to be a doublet. (Matches `1.6 (3H, d)`)\n\n*   **Eliminating Other Options**\n\n*   **Cis-propenyl acetate:** Would show a much smaller J-coupling constant (~6-12 Hz) between the vinylic protons.\n*   **Cis- and Trans-butenyl acetate:** These molecules have the formula C6H10O2, meaning they have 10 protons. The NMR data integration (1+1+3+3) sums to 8 protons. Therefore, the butenyl acetates are incorrect.\n\nThe data is a perfect match for Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Total Number of Protons (Integration)**\n\n*   The problem provides signals with the following integrations: 1H, 1H, 3H, and 3H.\n*   Summing these up gives a total of 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 protons in the molecule.\n*   Now let's determine the total number of protons for each of the possible compounds:\n    *   **Propenyl acetate (CH₃COOCH=CHCH₃)**: The acetate part (CH₃CO) has 3 protons. The propenyl part (C₃H₅) has 5 protons. Total = 3 + 5 = 8 protons.\n    *   **Butenyl acetate (CH₃COOCH=CHCH₂CH₃)**: The acetate part (CH₃CO) has 3 protons. The butenyl part (C₄H₇) has 7 protons. Total = 3 + 7 = 10 protons.\n*   Since the NMR data shows a total of 8 protons, we can confidently eliminate both Cis-butenyl acetate (A) and Trans-butenyl acetate (B). The unknown compound must be a propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze Individual Signals**\n\nWe are left with two possibilities: Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. Let's analyze the chemical shifts, splitting patterns (multiplicity), and coupling constants (J) to distinguish between them.\n\nThe general structure is CH₃(a)-COO-CH(b)=CH(c)-CH₃(d).\n\n*   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This corresponds to a methyl (CH₃) group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (C=O), as found in an acetate.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** This indicates that these three protons have no adjacent non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Assignment:** This signal is definitively from the acetate methyl group, CH₃(a). This is consistent with both remaining options.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** A single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is in the alkene (vinylic) region. The downfield shift is due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent electronegative oxygen atom. This proton is CH(b).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This proton is coupled to one other proton, which must be the other vinylic proton, CH(c).\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the most critical piece of information for determining stereochemistry. The coupling constant between two protons across a double bond is highly dependent on their geometry:\n        *   **Trans coupling:** J = 12-18 Hz (protons on opposite sides)\n        *   **Cis coupling:** J = 6-12 Hz (protons on the same side)\n    *   A J value of 16.0 Hz falls squarely in the *trans* range. This strongly indicates that the two vinylic protons, H(b) and H(c), are in a trans configuration.\n\n*   **Signal 3: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** A single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** Also in the vinylic region. This is the other vinylic proton, CH(c).\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This means the proton is split by two different sets of neighboring protons.\n        *   The **doublet (d)** comes from coupling to the single proton H(b). The coupling constant for this interaction would be 16.0 Hz.\n        *   The **quartet (q)** comes from coupling to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group, CH₃(d) (since n+1=4, n=3).\n\n*   **Signal 4: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** A methyl group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is a typical value for an allylic methyl group (a methyl group attached to a double bond). This is CH₃(d).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This indicates the methyl group is coupled to one adjacent proton, which is H(c).\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis of all signals is perfectly consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate. The key piece of evidence is the large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) between the vinylic protons, which is characteristic of a *trans* double bond. If the compound were Cis-propenyl acetate, this coupling constant would be significantly smaller (around 6-12 Hz).\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Proton Count and Chemical Formula:**\n*   First, let's sum the integrations of the signals: 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons in total.\n*   Now, let's determine the number of protons in each of the possible options:\n    *   **Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2)**: The structure is CH3-COO-CH=CH-CH3. The total number of protons is 3 (from the acetate CH3) + 1 (vinylic H) + 1 (vinylic H) + 3 (from the propenyl CH3) = 8 protons. This matches the data.\n    *   **Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2)**: The structure would be CH3-COO-CH=CH-CH2-CH3. The total number of protons is 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 10 protons. This does not match the data.\n*   **Conclusion**: Based on the total proton count, we can immediately eliminate both \"butenyl acetate\" options (C and D). The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze the Signals and their Multiplicities:**\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**: A singlet (s) for 3 protons at ~2.1 ppm is highly characteristic of the methyl group in an acetate functional group (CH3-COO-). Both remaining options, Cis- and Trans-propenyl acetate, contain this group.\n\n*   **The Vinylic Protons and J-Coupling:** We have two signals in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond):\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   These two protons are on the double bond and are coupled to each other. The key piece of information here is the coupling constant, **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n    *   The magnitude of the coupling constant between two vinylic protons is stereochemically dependent:\n        *   **Trans** coupling (protons on opposite sides of the double bond) typically ranges from **12-18 Hz**.\n        *   **Cis** coupling (protons on the same side of the double bond) typically ranges from **6-12 Hz**.\n    *   The observed J-value of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely in the range for *trans* coupling. This strongly indicates a *trans* configuration for the double bond.\n\n*   **Assembling the Rest of the Molecule:**\n    *   The signal at **7.0 ppm** is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to only one other proton (the one at 5.5 ppm). This proton is the most deshielded because it is on the same carbon as the electronegative oxygen atom of the ester group (-O-CH=).\n    *   The signal at **5.5 ppm** is a doublet of quartets (dq). The doublet (d) is due to coupling with the trans proton at 7.0 ppm. The quartet (q) must be due to coupling with a neighboring group of three protons (a CH3 group).\n    *   The signal at **1.6 ppm (3H, d)** confirms this. It's a methyl group (3H) that is split into a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to a single proton. This is the vinylic proton at 5.5 ppm.\n\n**3. Final Identification:**\n*   The molecule has an acetate group.\n*   It has a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n*   The two protons on the double bond are in a *trans* configuration (J = 16.0 Hz).\n\nPutting it all together, the structure is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nLet's check this against the options:\nA) Cis-propenyl acetate: Incorrect, would have a smaller J-coupling constant.\nB) Trans-propenyl acetate: Correct, matches all aspects of the NMR data (proton count, chemical shifts, multiplicities, and coupling constant).\nC) Trans-butenyl acetate: Incorrect, has the wrong number of protons.\nD) Cis-butenyl acetate: Incorrect, has the wrong number of protons and would have a smaller J-coupling.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n\n    1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is characteristic of protons on a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon (C=O).\n        *   **Integration (3H):** The signal represents three equivalent protons, consistent with a methyl group (-CH₃).\n        *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The signal is a singlet, meaning these protons are not coupled to any adjacent protons.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This signal strongly indicates the presence of an acetyl group (CH₃-C(=O)-). All four given options contain an acetate group (CH₃COO-), so this is consistent.\n\n    2.  **Signals in the Alkene Region (7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm):**\n        *   These two signals are in the chemical shift range for protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (vinyl protons). The presence of two such signals, each with an integration of 1H, indicates a -CH=CH- fragment.\n\n    3.  **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n        *   **Integration (1H):** This signal corresponds to one vinyl proton.\n        *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This proton is coupled to one neighboring proton.\n        *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** The magnitude of the coupling constant is crucial for determining stereochemistry. A J value of ~12-18 Hz for vinyl protons is characteristic of a *trans* configuration. A *cis* configuration would show a smaller J value (typically 6-12 Hz).\n        *   **Conclusion:** This signal represents one of the vinyl protons in a *trans* double bond.\n\n    4.  **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n        *   **Integration (1H):** This is the second vinyl proton.\n        *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons.\n            *   The **doublet (d)** splitting comes from coupling to the other vinyl proton (the one at 7.0 ppm). The coupling constant for this interaction must be 16.0 Hz.\n            *   The **quartet (q)** splitting means this proton is also coupled to a group of three equivalent protons (a methyl group).\n\n    5.  **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region, typical for a methyl group attached to a double bond.\n        *   **Integration (3H):** This represents a methyl group.\n        *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton. This confirms the 'quartet' splitting seen for the proton at 5.5 ppm.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have an acetate group: `CH₃COO-`.\n    *   We have a `trans`-substituted double bond with two protons: `-CH=CH-`.\n    *   One of the vinyl carbons is attached to a methyl group: `-CH=CH-CH₃`.\n    *   The coupling pattern confirms this arrangement. The proton at 5.5 ppm is the one adjacent to the methyl group (`=CH-CH₃`), which causes its signal to be a doublet of quartets. The methyl group itself is split into a doublet by this proton. The other vinyl proton (at 7.0 ppm) is only coupled to the first vinyl proton, resulting in a simple doublet.\n    *   The full structure is `CH₃COO-CH=CH-CH₃`, where the double bond has a *trans* geometry.\n    *   This compound is named **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) Cis-propenyl acetate: Incorrect. The J-coupling constant (16.0 Hz) indicates a trans, not cis, configuration.\n    *   B) Trans-butenyl acetate: Incorrect. A butenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₂CH₃`) would show signals for an ethyl group, not a single methyl group attached directly to the double bond. The splitting pattern would be much more complex.\n    *   C) Trans-propenyl acetate: Correct. This structure perfectly matches all aspects of the provided 1H NMR data: the acetyl singlet, the two trans-coupled vinyl protons, the methyl group on the double bond, and all corresponding splitting patterns and integrations.\n    *   D) Cis-butenyl acetate: Incorrect. This is wrong on both the stereochemistry (cis) and the carbon chain length (butenyl).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown organic compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Signals:**\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates a methyl group (CH3).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s - singlet):** Means this methyl group has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (an acetyl group, CH3-C=O). All four possible compounds are acetates, so this signal is consistent with the acetate methyl group.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates another methyl group (CH3).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d - doublet):** Means this methyl group is adjacent to a single proton (-CH).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is a typical shift for an allylic methyl group (a methyl group attached to a C=C double bond).\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Indicates a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq - doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to one other proton (giving the doublet) and to a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet). This matches a vinyl proton (-CH=) that is next to another vinyl proton and a methyl group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This is in the vinyl proton region (protons on a C=C double bond).\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Indicates a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d - doublet):** This proton is coupled to one other proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is also in the vinyl proton region. The high value (deshielding) is due to the adjacent electronegative oxygen atom from the acetate group (-O-CH=).\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This value is crucial for determining the stereochemistry.\n\n**2. Determine the Carbon Skeleton (Propenyl vs. Butenyl):**\n\n*   Let's sum the protons from the integration data: 3H (acetate) + 3H (methyl) + 1H (vinyl) + 1H (vinyl) = 8 protons in total.\n*   **Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2):** The formula corresponds to 8 hydrogen atoms. The propenyl group is -CH=CH-CH3. This fits our analysis: an acetate group, a vinyl proton coupled to another vinyl proton and a methyl group, another vinyl proton, and a methyl group coupled to a vinyl proton.\n*   **Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2):** The formula corresponds to 10 hydrogen atoms. This does not match the integration data.\n\nTherefore, the compound must be a propenyl acetate. This eliminates options B) Cis-butenyl acetate and D) Trans-butenyl acetate.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n\nThe distinction between cis and trans isomers is made by looking at the coupling constant (J-value) between the two protons on the double bond.\n\n*   For **trans** isomers, the protons are on opposite sides of the double bond, and their coupling constant (³J_HH) is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n*   For **cis** isomers, the protons are on the same side of the double bond, and their coupling constant (³J_HH) is smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nThe provided data shows a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz** for the signal at 7.0 ppm, which arises from the coupling between the two vinyl protons. This large value falls squarely within the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe data corresponds to a molecule with an acetate group and a trans-propenyl group. The compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** Acetate CH3\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz):** H on the double bond next to the Oxygen, trans to the other vinyl H.\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** H on the double bond next to the methyl group.\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** CH3 on the double bond.\n\nAll data points are consistent with this structure.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the given 1H NMR data:**\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal represents 3 protons that are a singlet (s). A singlet means these protons have no adjacent non-equivalent protons. A chemical shift of ~2.1 ppm is characteristic of a methyl group (CH3) attached to a carbonyl group (C=O), which is an acetyl group (`CH3CO-`). All four potential compounds are acetates, so they all contain this group.\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal represents 3 protons that are a doublet (d). A doublet means these protons are adjacent to a single proton (-CH). This signal is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a double bond (`CH3-CH=`).\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal represents 1 proton that is a doublet of quartets (dq). This means the proton is coupled to one adjacent proton (giving the doublet) and three other adjacent protons (giving the quartet). This is consistent with the proton (`-CH=`) that is adjacent to both another proton on the double bond and the methyl group we identified at 1.6 ppm.\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal represents 1 proton that is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to one other proton. The chemical shift is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). The most critical piece of information here is the coupling constant, **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n\n**2. Interpret the Coupling Constant (J-value):**\nFor protons on a double bond, the magnitude of the coupling constant (J) reveals their stereochemical relationship:\n*   **trans-coupling:** J is typically in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n*   **cis-coupling:** J is typically in the range of 6-12 Hz.\n\nThe observed coupling constant of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely in the range for a **trans** configuration. This allows us to eliminate the *cis* isomers.\n*   **Eliminated:** B) Cis-propenyl acetate and C) Cis-butenyl acetate.\n\n**3. Differentiate between Propenyl and Butenyl Structures:**\nWe are left with Trans-propenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate. Let's analyze the expected number of protons and signals.\n\n*   **Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2):** The formula is `CH3-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3`. This molecule has 3+1+1+3 = **8 protons**. The integration in the NMR data is 3H + 3H + 1H + 1H = **8H**. This matches.\n*   **Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2):** The formula would be something like `CH3-CH2-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3` or an isomer. This molecule has **10 protons**. The NMR data only accounts for 8 protons. Therefore, the compound cannot be butenyl acetate.\n*   **Eliminated:** D) Trans-butenyl acetate.\n\n**4. Confirm the Structure of Trans-propenyl acetate:**\nLet's assign the signals to the protons in Trans-propenyl acetate.\nStructure: `trans-CH3(c)-CH(b)=CH(a)-O-C(=O)-CH3(d)`\n\n*   **H(d):** The acetyl methyl group. No adjacent protons. This corresponds to the **2.1 ppm (3H, s)** signal.\n*   **H(c):** The methyl group on the double bond. It's adjacent to one proton, H(b). This corresponds to the **1.6 ppm (3H, d)** signal.\n*   **H(b):** The vinylic proton adjacent to both H(a) and H(c). It's split into a doublet by H(a) and a quartet by the three H(c) protons. This corresponds to the **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)** signal.\n*   **H(a):** The vinylic proton attached to the oxygen atom. It is highly deshielded by the electronegative oxygen, shifting it far downfield. It is coupled only to H(b). This corresponds to the **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz)** signal.\n\nAll pieces of the 1H NMR data perfectly match the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown organic compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n        *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons.\n        *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** A chemical shift around 2.0-2.2 ppm is characteristic of a methyl group (CH₃) attached to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n        *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** This indicates that these three protons have no adjacent non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This signal is highly indicative of an acetate group (CH₃-COO-). All four possible options contain an acetate group, so this is consistent.\n\n    *   **Analyze the remaining signals:** The other signals at 7.0 ppm, 5.5 ppm, and 1.6 ppm must describe the rest of the molecule (the \"propenyl\" or \"butenyl\" part).\n\n2.  **Determine the Number of Protons in the Alkene Chain:**\n    *   Let's sum the integration of the remaining signals: 1H (at 7.0 ppm) + 1H (at 5.5 ppm) + 3H (at 1.6 ppm) = 5 protons.\n    *   This means the alkyl/alkenyl group attached to the acetate oxygen has a total of 5 protons.\n\n3.  **Eliminate Incorrect Structures based on Proton Count:**\n    *   **Propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃):** This group has 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 protons.

This does not match.\n*   This initial analysis immediately rules out both Cis-butenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate, as they have the wrong number of protons. The compound must be a propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze Individual Signals for Propenyl Acetate**\n\nNow we need to distinguish between the *cis* and *trans* isomers of propenyl acetate. The structure is CH3-C(=O)-O-CH=CH-CH3.\n\n*   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents 3 protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This is a typical chemical shift for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon in an acetate group (CH3-COO-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** Indicates these protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with. This fits the acetate methyl group. This signal is present in both cis and trans isomers.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents 3 protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region, characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-**CH3**).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** Indicates this methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton. This matches the structure, as it's coupled to the neighboring vinyl proton.\n\n*   **Signal 3 & 4: The Vinylic Protons and Stereochemistry**\n    We have two signals left for the two protons on the double bond (O-CH=CH-CH3).\n    *   **Signal 3: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n        *   **Integration (1H):** One proton.\n        *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is in the vinylic region (C=C-H). The high value is due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent oxygen atom (O-**CH**=CH-).\n        *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This proton is coupled to only one other proton, which is the other vinylic proton.\n        *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the most crucial piece of information. The magnitude of the coupling constant (J) between two protons on a double bond reveals their stereochemistry.\n            *   **Trans coupling (protons on opposite sides): J is typically large, in the range of 12-18 Hz.**\n            *   **Cis coupling (protons on the same side): J is typically smaller, in the range of 6-12 Hz.**\n        *   A J-value of **16.0 Hz** strongly indicates a **trans** configuration.\n\n    *   **Signal 4: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n        *   **Integration (1H):** One proton.\n        *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** The other vinylic proton (O-CH=**CH**-CH3).\n        *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This means the proton is split by two different sets of neighbors. It is split into a **doublet** by the other single vinylic proton (at 7.0 ppm), and it is further split into a **quartet** by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (at 1.6 ppm). This splitting pattern perfectly matches the structure.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe number of protons (8H) indicates the compound is a propenyl acetate. The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) between the two vinylic protons is definitive evidence for a *trans* arrangement across the double bond. All other signals (chemical shifts, integrations, and multiplicities) are fully consistent with the structure of trans-propenyl acetate.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Total Number of Protons and Functional Groups**\n\n*   **Integration:** The sum of the integrations for the given signals is 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n*   **Molecular Formulas:**\n    *   Propenyl acetate (Cis or Trans) has the formula C5H8O2, which contains 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Butenyl acetate (Cis or Trans) has the formula C6H10O2, which contains 10 hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the total number of protons is 8, the unknown compound must be a propenyl acetate. This eliminates options B (Trans-butenyl acetate) and C (Cis-butenyl acetate).\n\n**2. Analyze Individual Signals**\n\nWe are now left with two possibilities: Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. Let's analyze the signals in detail.\n\n*   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl (CH3) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** Indicates this methyl group has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~2.1 ppm):** This is the typical region for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl in an acetate functional group (CH3-COO-).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal confirms the presence of the acetate group in the molecule.\n\n*   **Remaining Signals for the Propenyl Group (CH3-CH=CH-):**\n    The remaining signals at 7.0 ppm (1H), 5.5 ppm (1H), and 1.6 ppm (3H) must correspond to the three distinct proton environments in the propenyl group. Let's label the protons: CH3(c)-CH(b)=CH(a)-.\n    *   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This corresponds to the methyl group protons, H(c). They are split by the adjacent vinylic proton H(b), resulting in a doublet (d). The chemical shift is appropriate for an allylic methyl group.\n    *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This corresponds to the vinylic proton H(b). It is split into a doublet by H(a) and into a quartet by the three H(c) protons, resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq).\n    *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This corresponds to the vinylic proton H(a). It is the most deshielded proton because it's on a carbon atom bonded to the electronegative oxygen of the acetate group. It is split into a doublet by H(b).\n\n**3. Distinguish Between Cis and Trans Isomers**\n\nThe key to distinguishing between the cis and trans isomers is the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinylic protons, H(a) and H(b).\n\n*   **Trans Isomers:** The coupling constant for two protons in a *trans* configuration across a double bond (³J_trans) is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n*   **Cis Isomers:** The coupling constant for two protons in a *cis* configuration (³J_cis) is smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nThe problem states that the signal at 7.0 ppm has a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value falls squarely within the range for a *trans* coupling.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe integration data rules out the butenyl acetate options. The large coupling constant (16.0 Hz) between the vinylic protons is characteristic of a trans double bond. Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data:**\n\n*   **Signal 1: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This value is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). The high value (downfield shift) suggests the proton is attached to a carbon that is also bonded to an electronegative atom, like oxygen.\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal corresponds to a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** The signal is split into a doublet, which means this proton is coupled to (is adjacent to) one other non-equivalent proton.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a crucial piece of information. For protons across a double bond (vinylic coupling), a large J value (typically 12-18 Hz) is characteristic of a *trans* stereochemical relationship. A *cis* relationship would show a smaller J value (typically 6-12 Hz). This strongly indicates a *trans* double bond.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This is also in the vinylic region, representing the other proton on the double bond.\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal corresponds to one proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to two different groups of protons.\n        *   The **doublet (d)** splitting is due to coupling with the other vinylic proton at 7.0 ppm.\n        *   The **quartet (q)** splitting means it is also coupled to a group of three equivalent protons, which must be a methyl (-CH3) group.\n\n*   **Signal 3: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is very characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon of an acetate group (CH3-C(=O)-O-).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** The signal represents three protons, consistent with a methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The signal is a singlet, meaning this methyl group has no adjacent protons to couple with. This fits the acetate structure, as the carbonyl carbon has no protons.\n\n*   **Signal 4: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region (protons on a carbon adjacent to a C=C double bond).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three protons, another methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This methyl group is coupled to a single proton. This confirms the observation from the signal at 5.5 ppm, which was a quartet due to coupling with this methyl group.\n\n**2. Assemble the Molecular Structure:**\n\n*   From the signal at 2.1 ppm, we identify an **acetate group**: CH3-C(=O)O-\n*   From the signals at 7.0 ppm, 5.5 ppm, and 1.6 ppm, we can deduce the rest of the molecule. We have a double bond with two protons and an adjacent methyl group. The structure fragment is **-CH=CH-CH3**.\n*   The J value of 16.0 Hz tells us the two protons on the double bond are **trans** to each other.\n*   The proton at 7.0 ppm is only a doublet, so it's only coupled to the other vinylic proton. Its high chemical shift means it's attached to the oxygen of the acetate group.\n*   The proton at 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets, meaning it's coupled to the other vinylic proton and the adjacent methyl group.\n\nCombining these pieces gives the following structure:\n\n```\n      O\n     //\nCH3--C\n     \\\n      O         H\n       \\       /\n        C == C\n       /       \\\n      H         CH3\n```\nThis structure is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Given Options:**\n\n*   **A) Trans-propenyl acetate:** This matches our deduced structure perfectly. The name indicates a three-carbon \"propenyl\" group, an \"acetate\" group, and a \"trans\" configuration, all of which are supported by the NMR data.\n*   **B) Cis-butenyl acetate:** \"Cis\" is incorrect due to the large J value. \"Butenyl\" (4-carbon chain) is incorrect as the proton count and splitting pattern do not match a butenyl group.\n*   **C) Trans-butenyl acetate:** \"Butenyl\" is incorrect.\n*   **D) Cis-propenyl acetate:** \"Cis\" is incorrect due to the large J value (16.0 Hz).\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nWe are given the following signals:\n*   **Signal 1:** 2.1 ppm (3H, s)\n*   **Signal 2:** 1.6 ppm (3H, d)\n*   **Signal 3:** 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)\n*   **Signal 4:** 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)\n\nLet's interpret each signal to build the structure piece by piece.\n\n*   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, which is characteristic of a methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** A singlet means there are no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is typical for an acetyl methyl group (CH₃-C=O). All four possible compounds are acetates, so they all contain this group. This signal is consistent with all options.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This is another methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** A doublet means this methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton. This suggests a `CH₃-CH-` fragment.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~1.6 ppm):** This shift is common for a methyl group attached to a C=C double bond (a vinylic methyl group).\n\n*   **Signal 3 & 4: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) and 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Integration (1H each):** These signals each represent a single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5-7 ppm):** This region is characteristic of protons on a C=C double bond (vinylic protons). The presence of two such signals indicates a disubstituted double bond of the type `-CH=CH-`.\n    *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This vinylic proton is a doublet, meaning it's coupled to only one other proton (the one at 5.5 ppm). The key piece of information is the coupling constant, **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n    *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This vinylic proton is a doublet of quartets.\n        *   The **doublet** part arises from coupling to the other vinylic proton (at 7.0 ppm).\n        *   The **quartet** part arises from coupling to three adjacent protons, which must be the methyl group we identified at 1.6 ppm.\n\n### **2. Assemble the Pieces**\n\nBased on the fragments identified:\n*   We have an acetyl group: `CH₃-C(=O)-O-`\n*   We have a `-CH=CH-` group.\n*   We have a `CH₃-` group attached to the double bond.\n\nPutting these together gives the structure of **propenyl acetate**: `CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n\n### **3. Rule out Butenyl Acetate**\n\nLet's check the total number of protons.\n*   The NMR data shows a total integration of 3H + 3H + 1H + 1H = **8 protons**.\n*   The molecular formula for propenyl acetate is C₅H₈O₂ (8 protons). This matches.\n*   The molecular formula for butenyl acetate is C₆H₁₀O₂ (10 protons). This does not match.\n\nTherefore, we can confidently eliminate both **Cis-butenyl acetate** and **Trans-butenyl acetate**.\n\n### **4. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nThe choice is now between Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The deciding factor is the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinylic protons.\n\n*   The signal at 7.0 ppm shows a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   **Rule of thumb for vinylic coupling:**\n    *   *trans*-coupling (protons on opposite sides of the C=C bond) has a large J-value, typically in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   *cis*-coupling (protons on the same side of the C=C bond) has a smaller J-value, typically in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nSince the observed J-value is 16.0 Hz, it falls squarely in the *trans* range. This indicates that the two protons on the double bond are in a **trans** configuration.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe data corresponds to a propenyl acetate with a trans double bond. The unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nLet's verify the full assignment for Trans-propenyl acetate:\n```\n      H(c)   H(b)\n       \\    /\n        C = C\n       /    \\\nCH₃(d)-C      O-C(=O)-CH₃(a)\n```\n*   **H(a) at 2.1 ppm (s):** Acetyl methyl. Correct.\n*   **H(b) at 7.0 ppm (d):** Vinylic proton next to the deshielding oxygen atom. Coupled to H(c) with a large trans-coupling constant (J=16.0 Hz). Correct.\n*   **H(c) at 5.5 ppm (dq):** Vinylic proton coupled to H(b) (doublet) and the three H(d) protons (quartet). Correct.\n*   **H(d) at 1.6 ppm (d):** Methyl group on the double bond, coupled to the single proton H(c). Correct.\n\nThe data is a perfect match for Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown organic compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe provided data is:\n*   **Signal 1:** 2.1 ppm (3H, s)\n*   **Signal 2:** 1.6 ppm (3H, d)\n*   **Signal 3:** 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)\n*   **Signal 4:** 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)\n\n**2. Interpret Each Signal**\n\n*   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, which is characteristic of a methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is typical for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (C=O), such as in an acetate (CH₃COO-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s - singlet):** The singlet indicates that these protons are not coupled to any neighboring protons.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal confirms the presence of an acetate group in the molecule. All four possible answers are acetates, so this is consistent.\n\n*   **Analyze the Remaining Protons**\n    *   The remaining signals at 1.6 ppm, 5.5 ppm, and 7.0 ppm account for 3H + 1H + 1H = 5 protons.\n    *   This group of 5 protons must belong to the \"alkenyl\" part of the \"alkenyl acetate\" molecule.\n    *   Let's check the number of protons on the alkenyl chains of the proposed structures:\n        *   **Propenyl group** (-CH=CH-CH₃): This has 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 protons. This **matches** our data.\n        *   **Butenyl group** (e.g., -CH=CH-CH₂CH₃ or -CH₂-CH=CH-CH₃): Both common butenyl isomers have 7 protons. This **does not match** our data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Based on the total proton count, the molecule must be a **propenyl acetate**, not a butenyl acetate. This eliminates options A (Cis-butenyl acetate) and C (Trans-butenyl acetate).\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nWe are now left with two possibilities: Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The stereochemistry of the double bond can be determined by the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinylic protons (the protons directly attached to the C=C double bond).\n\n*   **Let's analyze the vinylic proton signals:**\n    *   The signals at **7.0 ppm** and **5.5 ppm** both represent one proton (1H), which is consistent with the two vinylic protons in a propenyl group (-CH=CH-).\n    *   **Signal 4: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n        *   This is one of the vinylic protons. It is a doublet (d), meaning it is split by one adjacent proton (the other vinylic proton).\n        *   The crucial piece of information is the coupling constant, **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n\n*   **Applying the Rules for Vinylic Coupling:**\n    *   The coupling constant between two protons on opposite sides of a double bond (**trans**) is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   The coupling constant between two protons on the same side of a double bond (**cis**) is typically smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the observed coupling constant is **16.0 Hz**, it falls squarely within the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**4. Final Confirmation of the Structure**\n\nLet's assemble the entire structure of **Trans-propenyl acetate** and see if all the data fits.\n\n*   **Structure:** CH₃(a)-COO-CH(b)=CH(c)-CH₃(d) (with H(b) and H(c) in a trans arrangement).\n    *   **CH₃(a):** Acetate methyl. Corresponds to **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**. Correct.\n    *   **CH₃(d):** Vinylic methyl group. It is adjacent to one proton, H(c), so it should be a doublet (d). This corresponds to **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**. Correct.\n    *   **CH(c):** Vinylic proton. It is adjacent to H(b) (1 proton) and the methyl group CH₃(d) (3 protons). It should be split into a doublet by H(b) and a quartet by CH₃(d), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). This corresponds to **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**. Correct.\n    *   **CH(b):** Vinylic proton next to the ester oxygen. It is adjacent only to H(c), so it should be a doublet (d). The coupling constant should be large and trans (~16.0 Hz). This corresponds to **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**. Correct.\n\nAll pieces of the 1H NMR data perfectly match the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Total Number of Protons:**\n\nFirst, let's sum the integrations of all the signals to determine the total number of protons in the molecule.\n*   Signal 1: 1H\n*   Signal 2: 1H\n*   Signal 3: 3H\n*   Signal 4: 3H\n*   **Total Protons = 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8H**\n\nNow, let's determine the number of protons in each of the possible options:\n*   **Propenyl acetate:** The propenyl group is C3H5. The acetate group is CH3CO2. The formula is CH3CO2C3H5, which is C5H8O2. It has **8 protons**.\n*   **Butenyl acetate:** The butenyl group is C4H7. The acetate group is CH3CO2. The formula is CH3CO2C4H7, which is C6H10O2. It has **10 protons**.\n\nSince the NMR data shows a total of 8 protons, we can immediately eliminate the butenyl acetate options (Cis-butenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate). The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze Individual Signals and Assign them to the Propenyl Acetate Structure:**\n\nThe general structure of propenyl acetate is: CH3(a)-C(=O)-O-CH(b)=CH(c)-CH3(d)\n\nLet's assign each signal from the NMR data to the protons in this structure.\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s - singlet):** This means the methyl group has no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon (an acetyl group).\n    *   **Assignment:** This signal corresponds to the acetyl methyl protons, **CH3(a)**.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d - doublet):** This means the methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton.\n    *   **Assignment:** This signal corresponds to the methyl group attached to the double bond, **CH3(d)**. It is split into a doublet by the adjacent vinylic proton, H(c).\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Represents a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq - doublet of quartets):** This proton is split into a doublet by one adjacent proton and into a quartet by three other adjacent protons.\n    *   **Assignment:** This signal corresponds to the vinylic proton **H(c)**. It is coupled to H(b) (giving the doublet) and to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group CH3(d) (giving the quartet).\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Represents a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d - doublet):** This proton is coupled to a single adjacent proton. The coupling constant (J) is 16.0 Hz.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This high chemical shift (deshielding) is typical for a vinylic proton attached to a carbon that is also bonded to an electronegative oxygen atom.\n    *   **Assignment:** This signal corresponds to the vinylic proton **H(b)**. It is coupled only to H(c).\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n\nThe final step is to distinguish between the cis and trans isomers. The key piece of information is the coupling constant (J value) between the two vinylic protons, H(b) and H(c).\n\n*   The signal for H(b) at 7.0 ppm shows a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   The magnitude of the coupling constant between protons on a double bond is dependent on their geometric relationship:\n    *   **Trans-coupling (J_trans):** Typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis-coupling (J_cis):** Typically smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nSince the observed coupling constant is 16.0 Hz, it falls squarely within the range for trans protons. Therefore, the protons H(b) and H(c) are in a **trans** configuration.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound has 8 protons, an acetyl group, and a propenyl group with a trans double bond. The unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Signal at 2.1 ppm:**\n*   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is typical for protons on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **Integration (3H):** The signal corresponds to three equivalent protons, suggesting a methyl group (CH₃).\n*   **Multiplicity (s):** A singlet indicates that these protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n*   **Conclusion:** A 3H singlet at ~2.1 ppm is a classic signature for the methyl group in an acetate functional group (-O-CO-C**H₃**). All four possible compounds are acetates, so this signal is consistent with all options.\n\n**2. Analyze the Alkene and Alkyl Signals:**\nThe remaining signals at 7.0 ppm, 5.5 ppm, and 1.6 ppm must describe the \"propenyl\" or \"butenyl\" part of the molecule.\n*   **Propenyl group:** -CH=CH-CH₃ (has 2 vinylic protons and 3 allylic protons)\n*   **Butenyl group:** Would have one more carbon and two more protons (e.g., -CH=CH-CH₂CH₃ or -CH₂-CH=CH-CH₃). The number of signals and their integrations do not match a butenyl structure. For example, a but-1-enyl group would show signals for an ethyl group (a quartet and a triplet), which are not present. A but-2-enyl group attached to the oxygen via a CH₂ (crotyl acetate) would show a CH₂ signal around 4.5 ppm. Therefore, we can rule out the butenyl acetate options (C and D).\n\nThis leaves us with **Cis-propenyl acetate** and **Trans-propenyl acetate**. The general structure is CH₃-CH=CH-O-CO-CH₃. Let's assign the remaining protons to this structure.\n\n**Structure:** C**H₃**(c)-C**H**(b)=C**H**(a)-O-CO-CH₃\n\n*   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   This is a single vinylic proton (**H**(a)). Its downfield chemical shift (7.0 ppm) is due to the strong deshielding effect of the adjacent electronegative oxygen atom of the acetate group.\n    *   It is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to only one other proton, which must be **H**(b).\n    *   The key piece of information is the coupling constant, **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n\n*   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   This is the other vinylic proton (**H**(b)).\n    *   Its multiplicity is a doublet of quartets (dq). The doublet arises from coupling to **H**(a). The quartet arises from coupling to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group, **CH₃**(c).\n\n*   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   These are the three protons of the methyl group attached to the double bond (**CH₃**(c)).\n    *   This signal is a doublet (d) because the methyl group is coupled to the single adjacent vinylic proton, **H**(b).\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\nThe stereochemistry of the double bond is determined by the magnitude of the coupling constant (J) between the two vinylic protons, **H**(a) and **H**(b).\n\n*   **Trans coupling:** Protons are on opposite sides of the double bond. The coupling constant (³J_trans) is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n*   **Cis coupling:** Protons are on the same side of the double bond. The coupling constant (³J_cis) is smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nThe observed coupling constant is **J = 16.0 Hz**, which falls squarely in the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe compound has an acetate group, a propenyl group, and the stereochemistry of the double bond is trans. Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Analyze the number of protons and basic structural units.**\n    *   The total number of protons from the integration is 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n    *   Let's check the number of protons for the options:\n        *   Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2): 3 (from CH3) + 1 + 1 (from -CH=CH-) + 3 (from acetate CH3) = 8 protons. This matches.\n        *   Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2): Total of 10 protons. This does not match the data.\n    *   Based on the proton count, we can immediately rule out **Cis-butenyl acetate** and **Trans-butenyl acetate**. The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n2.  **Assign the signals to specific parts of the propenyl acetate structure.**\n    The general structure is `CH3-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH3`. Let's label the protons for easier reference:\n    `CH3(b)-CH(c)=CH(d)-O-C(=O)-CH3(a)`\n\n    *   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet (s) for 3 protons around 2.1 ppm is highly characteristic of the methyl group of an acetate (`-C(=O)-CH3`). This corresponds to `CH3(a)`. It is a singlet because it has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n\n    *   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** A doublet (d) for 3 protons in the allylic region (~1.6-1.8 ppm) corresponds to the methyl group attached to the double bond (`CH3-C=`). This is `CH3(b)`. It is a doublet because it is coupled to the single adjacent proton, `H(c)`.\n\n    *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal for one proton is a doublet of quartets (dq). This means the proton is split by two different sets of neighbors: one neighboring proton (giving the doublet) and three neighboring protons (giving the quartet, 3+1=4). This perfectly describes proton `H(c)`, which is adjacent to `H(d)` (1 proton) and the `CH3(b)` group (3 protons).\n\n    *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal for one proton is a doublet (d). This corresponds to proton `H(d)`. It is coupled only to `H(c)`. Its chemical shift is far downfield (7.0 ppm) because it is on a double bond and attached to a very electronegative oxygen atom (`=CH-O-`), which deshields the proton significantly.\n\n3.  **Use the coupling constant (J) to determine the stereochemistry.**\n    *   The most crucial piece of information for distinguishing between cis and trans isomers is the coupling constant (J) between the two protons on the double bond (`H(c)` and `H(d)`).\n    *   The data for the signal at 7.0 ppm explicitly gives **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n    *   The established rules for vinyl proton coupling are:\n        *   **J_trans ≈ 12-18 Hz** (for protons on opposite sides of the double bond)\n        *   **J_cis ≈ 6-12 Hz** (for protons on the same side of the double bond)\n    *   Since the observed coupling constant is 16.0 Hz, which falls squarely in the range for a trans coupling, the geometry of the double bond must be **trans**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion.**\n    Based on the analysis, the compound has a propenyl acetate structure with a trans configuration on the double bond. Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown organic compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Protons and Signals**\n\n*   The 1H NMR spectrum shows four distinct signals, which means there are four different types of protons in the molecule.\n*   Let's sum the integrations for each signal to find the total number of protons represented in the spectrum: 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n\nNow, let's check the number of protons in the possible structures:\n*   **Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2)**: A propenyl group (C3H5) plus an acetate group (C2H3O2). Total protons = 5 + 3 = 8. This matches the data.\n*   **Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2)**: A butenyl group (C4H7) plus an acetate group (C2H3O2). Total protons = 7 + 3 = 10. This does not match the data.\n\nBased on the total proton count, we can confidently eliminate the butenyl acetate options (A and D). The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Signal**\n\nLet's look at each signal individually to deduce the structure.\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**:\n    *   **Integration (3H)**: Represents a methyl (CH3) group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm)**: This region is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group of an ester or ketone. This signal corresponds to the methyl protons of the acetate group (CH3-COO-).\n    *   **Splitting (s)**: A singlet means this methyl group has no adjacent protons to couple with, which is consistent with the structure of an acetate group.\n\n*   **Remaining Signals (7.0, 5.5, and 1.6 ppm)**: These three signals must describe the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to the acetate oxygen.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**:\n    *   **Integration (3H)**: Another methyl group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm)**: This is a typical shift for a methyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (an allylic methyl group). This is the CH3 in -CH=CH-CH3.\n    *   **Splitting (d)**: A doublet means this methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton. This is the vinylic proton next to it.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz) and 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**:\n    *   These two signals represent the two protons on the carbon-carbon double bond (the vinylic protons). Let's call them Ha and Hb: R-O-C(Ha)=C(Hb)-CH3.\n    *   The proton at **7.0 ppm** is significantly downfield, which is expected for a vinylic proton attached to an oxygen atom (Ha) due to the oxygen's deshielding effect. It's a doublet, meaning it's split only by the other vinylic proton (Hb).\n    *   The proton at **5.5 ppm** is the other vinylic proton (Hb), which is attached to the carbon bearing the methyl group. Its splitting pattern is a doublet of quartets (dq). The doublet comes from coupling to Ha, and the quartet comes from coupling to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group. This confirms our assignments.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nThe key to distinguishing between the cis and trans isomers lies in the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinylic protons (Ha and Hb).\n\n*   For **trans** vinylic protons, the coupling constant (³J_trans) is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n*   For **cis** vinylic protons, the coupling constant (³J_cis) is typically smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nThe observed coupling constant for the signal at 7.0 ppm is **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value falls squarely within the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   The proton count and signal analysis indicate the compound is a propenyl acetate.\n*   The large vinylic coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) definitively points to a trans geometry around the double bond.\n*   Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Data**\n\n1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**:\n    *   **Integration (3H)**: Indicates a methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet)**: This methyl group has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~2.1 ppm)**: This is a characteristic chemical shift for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group, specifically an acetyl group (-C(O)CH₃). This suggests the presence of an acetate functional group in the molecule.\n\n2.  **Signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm**:\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~5.0 - 7.5 ppm)**: These signals are in the vinylic region, indicating protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C-H).\n    *   The molecule must contain a double bond.\n\n3.  **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**:\n    *   **Integration (3H)**: Indicates another methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet)**: This methyl group is adjacent to a single proton (CH).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~1.6 ppm)**: This is a typical shift for an allylic methyl group, which is a methyl group attached to a double bond (CH₃-C=C).\n\n4.  **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**:\n    *   **Integration (1H)**: A single vinylic proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets)**: This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighbors. The \"d\" (doublet) means it is coupled to one other proton. The \"q\" (quartet) means it is coupled to an adjacent methyl group (3 protons). This confirms the presence of a -CH=CH-CH₃ moiety. This proton is the one in the middle, `C-CH-CH₃`.\n\n5.  **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**:\n    *   **Integration (1H)**: The second single vinylic proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet)**: This proton is coupled to one other proton, which must be the proton at 5.5 ppm.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz)**: This is the most crucial piece of information for determining the stereochemistry (cis or trans). The coupling constant (J) between two protons on a double bond is typically:\n        *   **~12-18 Hz for a *trans* configuration.**\n        *   **~6-12 Hz for a *cis* configuration.**\n    *   Since the observed J value is 16.0 Hz, this strongly indicates a **trans** relationship between the two vinylic protons.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the fragments identified:\n*   An acetyl group (-O-C(O)CH₃), from the singlet at 2.1 ppm.\n*   A propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃), from the signals at 7.0, 5.5, and 1.6 ppm.\n\nCombining these fragments gives **propenyl acetate**. The structure is CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(O)-CH₃.\n\nThe total proton count from the data is 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8H. Propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂) has 8 protons, which is consistent. Butenyl acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂) has 10 protons, so C and D can be eliminated based on proton count alone.\n\nThe J-coupling constant of 16.0 Hz for the vinylic protons confirms the double bond has a *trans* configuration.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nLet's assign all the peaks to the Trans-propenyl acetate structure:\n*   **d) Acetyl CH₃**: Signal at 2.1 ppm (singlet).\n*   **a) Allylic CH₃**: Signal at 1.6 ppm (doublet, coupled to proton b).\n*   **b) Vinylic H**: Signal at 5.5 ppm (doublet of quartets, coupled to proton c and allylic methyl group a).\n*   **c) Vinylic H**: Signal at 7.0 ppm (doublet, coupled to proton b, J=16.0 Hz confirms trans). The high chemical shift is due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent oxygen atom.\n\nThe data is a perfect match for Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Signals and Integrations:**\n*   There are four distinct signals in the spectrum.\n*   The integrations are 1H, 1H, 3H, and 3H, for a total of 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 protons in the molecule.\n\nLet's check the number of protons for each option:\n*   Propenyl acetate (CH₃COOCH=CHCH₃): C₅H₈O₂. It has 3+1+1+3 = 8 protons. This matches.\n*   Butenyl acetate (CH₃COOCH₂CH=CHCH₃): C₆H₁₀O₂. It has 3+2+1+1+3 = 10 protons. This does not match the integration data.\n\nTherefore, we can immediately rule out both Cis-butenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate (options B and C). The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Signal in Detail:**\n\n*   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is typical for protons on a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Confirms it's a methyl (CH₃) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The methyl group has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal corresponds to the acetate methyl group (CH₃COO-).\n\n*   **Signal 2: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This region is typical for an allylic methyl group (a methyl group attached to a double bond).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Confirms it's a methyl (CH₃) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This methyl group is split by one adjacent proton.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal corresponds to the methyl group at the end of the propenyl chain (=CH-CH₃).\n\n*   **Signal 3: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This is in the alkene/vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond).\n    *   **Integration (1H):** It is a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons. The \"doublet\" part means it is coupled to one proton. The \"quartet\" part means it is coupled to three equivalent protons (a methyl group).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is the vinylic proton adjacent to the methyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). It is split into a quartet by the CH₃ group (at 1.6 ppm) and into a doublet by the other vinylic proton (at 7.0 ppm).\n\n*   **Signal 4: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is also in the vinylic region. It is further downfield (more deshielded) because it is directly attached to the carbon that is bonded to the electronegative oxygen atom of the ester (O-CH=).\n    *   **Integration (1H):** It is a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This proton is coupled to one adjacent proton, which must be the other vinylic proton at 5.5 ppm.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the key piece of information for determining the stereochemistry. The magnitude of the J-coupling constant between two protons on a double bond is dependent on their geometry.\n        *   **Trans protons:** J-coupling is typically large, in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n        *   **Cis protons:** J-coupling is typically smaller, in the range of 6-12 Hz.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The observed J-value of 16.0 Hz is a classic value for *trans* vinylic protons.\n\n**3. Synthesize the Findings:**\n\n*   The molecule has an acetate group (CH₃COO-) and a propenyl group (-CH=CHCH₃).\n*   The two protons on the double bond show a coupling constant of 16.0 Hz, which definitively indicates a **trans** configuration.\n*   Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is the reasoning process to identify the unknown organic compound from the provided 1H NMR data.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis of the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe provided data is:\n*   **7.0 ppm:** 1H, doublet (d), J = 16.0 Hz\n*   **5.5 ppm:** 1H, doublet of quartets (dq)\n*   **2.1 ppm:** 3H, singlet (s)\n*   **1.6 ppm:** 3H, doublet (d)\n\nThe possible compounds are:\n*   Cis-propenyl acetate\n*   Trans-propenyl acetate\n*   Cis-butenyl acetate\n*   Trans-butenyl acetate\n\nLet's analyze each signal:\n\n1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, which is consistent with a methyl (CH₃) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s):** A singlet means these protons have no adjacent non-equivalent protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a methyl group attached to the carbonyl of an ester or acetate group (CH₃-C=O). All four possible compounds are acetates, so they all contain this group. This signal is consistent with all options.\n\n2.  **Determine the Carbon Skeleton (Propenyl vs. Butenyl):**\n    *   Let's sum the number of protons from the integration values: 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = **8 protons** in total.\n    *   Now, let's count the protons in the possible structures:\n        *   **Propenyl acetate (CH₃-CH=CH-O-COCH₃):**\n            *   CH₃ (propenyl part) = 3H\n            *   CH=CH (vinyl part) = 2H\n            *   CH₃ (acetyl part) = 3H\n            *   Total = 3 + 2 + 3 = **8 protons**. This matches the NMR data.\n        *   **Butenyl acetate (e.g., But-2-enyl acetate: CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-O-COCH₃):**\n            *   CH₃ (butenyl part) = 3H\n            *   CH=CH (vinyl part) = 2H\n            *   CH₂ (methylene part) = 2H\n            *   CH₃ (acetyl part) = 3H\n            *   Total = 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 = **10 protons**. This does not match the NMR data.\n    *   Since the total proton count is 8, we can confidently eliminate both **Cis-butenyl acetate** and **Trans-butenyl acetate**. The unknown compound must be either Cis- or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Remaining Signals for Propenyl Acetate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃(a)-CH(b)=CH(c)-O-COCH₃.\n    *   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This corresponds to the methyl group, CH₃(a). It is a doublet because it is coupled to the single adjacent vinyl proton, H(b).\n    *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This corresponds to the vinyl proton H(b). It is split into a doublet by the adjacent vinyl proton H(c) and into a quartet by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group CH₃(a). Thus, it appears as a doublet of quartets.\n    *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d):** This corresponds to the vinyl proton H(c). It is split into a doublet by the adjacent vinyl proton H(b). The higher chemical shift (downfield) is due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent oxygen atom.\n\n4.  **Distinguish between Cis and Trans Isomers:**\n    *   The stereochemistry of the double bond is determined by the magnitude of the coupling constant (J) between the two vinyl protons, H(b) and H(c).\n    *   The general rule for vinyl proton coupling is:\n        *   **³J_trans (trans-coupling):** Typically large, in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n        *   **³J_cis (cis-coupling):** Typically smaller, in the range of 6-12 Hz.\n    *   The data for the signal at 7.0 ppm shows it is a doublet with a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n    *   This large J-value falls squarely in the range for *trans*-coupling. Therefore, the protons H(b) and H(c) are in a trans configuration relative to each other.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   The proton count (8H) indicates a **propenyl acetate**.\n*   The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) between the vinylic protons indicates a **trans** configuration.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning used to identify the unknown compound from the provided 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n\n*   **1H NMR data:**\n    *   `7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)`\n    *   `5.5 ppm (1H, dq)`\n    *   `2.1 ppm (3H, s)`\n    *   `1.6 ppm (3H, d)`\n\n**2. Decipher Each Signal:**\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is typical for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group within an acetate functional group (CH₃-C(=O)O-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s - singlet):** A singlet means there are no adjacent protons to couple with. This confirms the methyl group is isolated, which is consistent with an acetate group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal indicates the presence of an acetate group (`-OAc` or `-O-C(=O)-CH₃`). All four options are acetates, so this is consistent.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm signals:**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.0 - 7.5 ppm):** These chemical shifts are in the vinylic region, indicating the presence of protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   **Integration (1H each):** There are two distinct protons on the double bond.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This is another methyl group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This shift is characteristic of an allylic methyl group, meaning a methyl group attached directly to a double bond (CH₃-C=C).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d - doublet):** A doublet means this methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton.\n\n**3. Determine the Carbon Skeleton:**\n\n*   We have identified three key fragments:\n    1.  An acetate group: `-O-C(=O)-CH₃`\n    2.  A double bond with two protons: `-CH=CH-`\n    3.  A methyl group attached to the double bond: `CH₃-`\n*   Putting these pieces together, the structure must be `CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n*   This structure is named **propenyl acetate**. A \"propenyl\" group is `CH₃-CH=CH-`.\n*   The options involving \"butenyl acetate\" would require an additional -CH₂- group (forming an ethyl group `CH₃CH₂-` attached to the double bond), which is not supported by the data. Therefore, we can eliminate options C) Cis-butenyl acetate and D) Trans-butenyl acetate.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n\n*   The remaining choice is between Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The stereochemistry of the double bond can be determined from the coupling constant (J value) between the two vinylic protons.\n*   The signal at **7.0 ppm** is a doublet with a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   The coupling constant between protons on a double bond is highly dependent on their relative geometry:\n    *   **Trans protons:** J-value is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis protons:** J-value is smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n*   The observed J-value of 16.0 Hz falls squarely within the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion:**\n\n*   The carbon skeleton is that of a propenyl acetate.\n*   The stereochemistry of the double bond is trans.\n*   Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nLet's do a final check by assigning all protons to the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate: `CH₃(a)-CH(b)=CH(c)-O-C(=O)-CH₃(d)`\n\n*   **CH₃(d) at 2.1 ppm (s):** This is the acetate methyl group, which is a singlet as it has no adjacent protons. (Correct)\n*   **CH₃(a) at 1.6 ppm (d):** This is the methyl group on the double bond. It is coupled to one proton, H(b), so it appears as a doublet. (Correct)\n*   **H(c) at 7.0 ppm (d, J=16.0 Hz):** This vinylic proton is attached to the carbon bearing the oxygen atom, making it more deshielded (higher ppm). It is coupled only to H(b), so it appears as a doublet. The large J-value confirms it is trans to H(b). (Correct)\n*   **H(b) at 5.5 ppm (dq):** This vinylic proton is coupled to H(c) (one proton, making it a doublet 'd') and also to the three protons of CH₃(a) (making it a quartet 'q'). Thus, it appears as a doublet of quartets. (Correct)\n\nAll data points are perfectly consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's break down the information provided by each signal in the spectrum:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is characteristic of a methyl group (CH3) attached to a carbonyl group (C=O), specifically an acetate group (`-OCOCH3`).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, consistent with a methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The signal is a single peak, meaning these protons are not coupled to any neighboring protons. This confirms the presence of an isolated `CH3-C=O` fragment.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This shift is typical for an allylic methyl group, which is a methyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (`CH3-C=C`).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** The signal is split into a doublet, meaning this methyl group is coupled to one adjacent proton.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). The high chemical shift suggests it is attached to an electron-withdrawing atom, like the oxygen of the acetate group (`=CH-O-`).\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Represents a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** It is coupled to one other proton.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a very important piece of information. For protons on a double bond, a large coupling constant (typically 12-18 Hz) indicates a **trans** stereochemistry. A smaller coupling constant (6-12 Hz) would indicate a *cis* relationship.\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** Also in the vinylic region.\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Represents a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons. It is split into a doublet by one adjacent proton and into a quartet by three adjacent protons.\n\n**2. Assemble the Fragments**\n\nFrom the analysis, we have the following pieces:\n*   An acetate group: `-OCOCH3` (from the 2.1 ppm signal).\n*   A `CH3-CH=` fragment: The `CH3` group is the 1.6 ppm doublet, and it's coupled to the `CH` proton.\n*   A `=CH-O` fragment: The `CH` proton is the 7.0 ppm doublet.\n*   The vinylic proton from the `CH3-CH=` fragment must be the 5.5 ppm signal. It's coupled to the other vinylic proton (giving the doublet part of 'dq') and the allylic `CH3` group (giving the quartet part of 'dq').\n*   The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) between the two vinylic protons confirms they are in a **trans** arrangement.\n\nPutting these pieces together gives the structure:\n`CH3(a)-CH(b)=CH(c)-OCOCH3(d)` where protons (b) and (c) are trans to each other.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **A) Cis-propenyl acetate:** This structure has a *cis* double bond. It would show a smaller vinylic coupling constant (J ≈ 6-12 Hz). This does not match the data.\n*   **B) Trans-propenyl acetate:** This structure has a *trans* double bond, which would result in a large vinylic coupling constant (J ≈ 12-18 Hz). This perfectly matches the `J = 16.0 Hz` value from the data. The rest of the predicted signals also match the data.\n*   **C) Cis-butenyl acetate & D) Trans-butenyl acetate:** The molecular formula for butenyl acetate is C6H10O2. It contains 10 protons. The NMR data shows a total integration of 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons. Therefore, these compounds can be ruled out based on the proton count. Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2) has 8 protons, which matches the data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe 1H NMR data, particularly the coupling constant of 16.0 Hz, unequivocally identifies the compound as having a trans-substituted double bond. Combined with the other signal information and the total proton count, the only structure that fits is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the signal at 2.1 ppm.**\n    *   The signal at **2.1 ppm** has an integration of **3H** (three protons) and is a **singlet (s)**.\n    *   A singlet means these protons have no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   A chemical shift around 2.1 ppm for a 3H singlet is characteristic of the methyl protons of an acetyl group (CH₃-C=O). All four possible compounds are acetates, so they all contain this group. This signal is consistent with all options.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the signals in the alkene region (5-8 ppm) and the coupling constant.**\n    *   There are two signals in this region: **7.0 ppm** and **5.5 ppm**. These are the two vinylic protons on the carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-).\n    *   The signal at **7.0 ppm** is a **doublet (d)** with a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n    *   The coupling constant (J) between two protons on a double bond is highly dependent on their stereochemistry.\n        *   A **trans** arrangement typically results in a large coupling constant, J = 12-18 Hz.\n        *   A **cis** arrangement results in a smaller coupling constant, J = 6-12 Hz.\n    *   The observed J value of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely in the trans range. This strongly indicates that the two protons on the double bond are **trans** to each other.\n    *   This finding immediately eliminates the *cis* isomers: (B) Cis-propenyl acetate and (C) Cis-butenyl acetate.\n\n*   **Step 3: Distinguish between Trans-propenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate based on the remaining signals.**\n    *   We are left with two options: (A) Trans-butenyl acetate and (D) Trans-propenyl acetate. Let's analyze their expected structures and NMR signals.\n    *   **Structure of Trans-propenyl acetate:** CH₃-C(=O)O-CH=CH-CH₃\n    *   **Structure of Trans-butenyl acetate (1-butenyl isomer):** CH₃-C(=O)O-CH=CH-CH₂-CH₃\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze the splitting patterns to determine the full structure.**\n    *   Let's analyze the remaining signals from the provided data:\n        *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This is the second vinylic proton. The multiplicity is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. This means the proton is being split by two different sets of neighbors: one single proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet). This matches the `=CH-CH₃` fragment perfectly. The proton (`=CH-`) is split into a doublet by the other vinylic proton and into a quartet by the adjacent methyl (`-CH₃`) group.\n        *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal is for three protons and is a **doublet (d)**. This indicates a methyl group (`CH₃`) that is adjacent to a single proton (`-CH-`). This is consistent with the methyl group in the `=CH-CH₃` fragment.\n\n*   **Step 5: Compare the observed data with the expected signals for the remaining options.**\n    *   **For Trans-propenyl acetate (CH₃-COO-CH=CH-CH₃):**\n        *   CH₃-COO: singlet (matches 2.1 ppm signal).\n        *   -O-CH=: doublet (split by the other vinylic H) and very downfield due to the adjacent oxygen (matches 7.0 ppm signal).\n        *   =CH-CH₃: doublet of quartets (split by the other vinylic H and the methyl group) (matches 5.5 ppm signal).\n        *   =CH-CH₃: doublet (split by the adjacent vinylic H) (matches 1.6 ppm signal).\n        *   The observed data is a perfect match for Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n    *   **For Trans-butenyl acetate (CH₃-COO-CH=CH-CH₂-CH₃):**\n        *   This structure contains an ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃) instead of a methyl group attached to the double bond.\n        *   It would show a signal for a CH₂ group (a multiplet) and a CH₃ group that is a triplet (split by the adjacent CH₂ group).\n        *   The provided data has no triplet signal and has a methyl signal that is a doublet, not a triplet. Therefore, this structure is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound that matches all aspects of the 1H NMR data (chemical shifts, integrations, multiplicities, and coupling constant) is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Data:**\n\n    1.  **Identify Functional Groups and Fragments:**\n        *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet integrating to 3 protons in this region is highly characteristic of an acetate methyl group (CH₃-C=O). All four options contain an acetate group, so this is consistent.\n        *   **Proton Count:** The total number of protons is 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n            *   Propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂) has 3 (on propene) + 2 (on propene) + 3 (on acetate) = 8 hydrogens (wait, let's write it out: CH₃-CH=CH-O-Ac, so 3+1+1+3 = 8H). This matches.\n            *   Butenyl acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂) has 10 hydrogens. This does not match.\n            *   Therefore, we can immediately eliminate the butenyl acetate options (B and C). We are left with Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n    2.  **Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n        *   We have two signals in the alkene (vinylic) region: 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm. These correspond to the two protons on the C=C double bond.\n        *   The signal at **7.0 ppm** is a doublet with a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n        *   The coupling constant (J-value) between two vinylic protons is highly diagnostic of the double bond's geometry.\n            *   A **trans** arrangement typically shows a large coupling constant, usually in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n            *   A **cis** arrangement shows a smaller coupling constant, typically **6-12 Hz**.\n        *   Since the observed coupling constant is 16.0 Hz, this strongly indicates a **trans** configuration. This eliminates the Cis-propenyl acetate option (D).\n\n    3.  **Confirm the Structure of Trans-propenyl acetate:**\n        *   The proposed structure is **Trans-propenyl acetate**:\n            ```\n                O\n               //\n            H-C----C-O-C-CH₃(a)\n              |    |\n              H(b) H(c)-CH₃(d)\n            ```\n        *   Let's assign the signals to the protons in this structure:\n            *   **Protons (a):** The acetate methyl group. It has no adjacent protons, so it appears as a singlet. This corresponds to the signal at **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**.\n            *   **Protons (d):** The methyl group on the double bond. It is coupled to the single proton (c) on the adjacent carbon, so it appears as a doublet. This corresponds to the signal at **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**.\n            *   **Proton (c):** This vinylic proton is coupled to proton (b) (one proton, giving a doublet) and the methyl group (d) (three protons, giving a quartet). The signal should be a doublet of quartets (dq). This corresponds to the signal at **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**.\n            *   **Proton (b):** This vinylic proton is coupled to proton (c) (one proton), so it appears as a doublet. It is attached to the carbon bonded to the electronegative oxygen atom, which deshields it, causing it to appear further downfield (at a higher ppm value). This corresponds to the signal at **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The NMR data perfectly matches the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate. The proton count eliminates the butenyl options, and the large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) confirms the trans stereochemistry.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Data:**\n\n    1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet (s) integrating to 3 protons in this region (~2.0-2.2 ppm) is highly characteristic of the methyl protons of an acetate group (CH₃-COO-). All four options contain an acetate group, so this is consistent.\n\n    2.  **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** A doublet (d) integrating to 3 protons suggests a methyl group (CH₃-) that is coupled to a single adjacent proton (-CH-). This points towards a CH₃-CH= structure.\n\n    3.  **Signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm:** These signals are in the vinylic region (5-8 ppm), indicating protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n        *   The signal at **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)** is for a single proton. The multiplicity, a doublet of quartets (dq), means it is coupled to two different sets of protons: one single proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet). This fits perfectly with a proton on a double bond that is adjacent to another vinylic proton and a methyl group: `CH₃-CH=`. This proton is the one at the `-CH=` part.\n        *   The signal at **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)** is for the other single vinylic proton. It is a doublet, meaning it's coupled to only one other proton (the one at 5.5 ppm). The high chemical shift (7.0 ppm) is due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent electronegative oxygen atom from the acetate group (`=CH-O-`).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    Putting the pieces together: we have an acetate group (CH₃COO-), and a `CH₃-CH=CH-` group. This forms a propenyl acetate structure: `CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n    This eliminates the butenyl acetate options (C and D), as their fragmentation patterns would be different and they would have 10 protons, not 8 as indicated by the integration (3+3+1+1=8).\n\n*   **Determining Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n    The key to distinguishing between the cis and trans isomers is the coupling constant (J value) between the two vinylic protons (the ones at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm).\n    *   **Trans coupling (³J_trans):** Protons on opposite sides of the double bond typically have a large coupling constant, usually in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis coupling (³J_cis):** Protons on the same side of the double bond typically have a smaller coupling constant, usually in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n    The provided J value for the doublet at 7.0 ppm is **16.0 Hz**. This value falls squarely within the typical range for a trans configuration.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The NMR data (proton count, chemical shifts, splitting patterns, and coupling constant) is fully consistent with the structure of **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Analyze each signal in the 1H NMR spectrum:**\n\n    *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal represents three equivalent protons (3H) that are not coupled to any neighboring protons, hence a singlet (s). A singlet around 2.0-2.2 ppm is highly characteristic of the methyl protons of an acetate group (-O-C(=O)-CH₃). All four options contain an acetate group, so this is consistent.\n\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal is for one proton (1H) in the vinylic region (i.e., a proton attached to a C=C double bond), indicated by the high chemical shift (~7.0 ppm). It is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to one adjacent proton. The most critical piece of information here is the coupling constant, J = 16.0 Hz. Coupling constants between vinylic protons are stereochemically dependent:\n        *   *Trans* coupling (protons on opposite sides of the double bond) typically shows J = 12-18 Hz.\n        *   *Cis* coupling (protons on the same side of the double bond) typically shows J = 6-12 Hz.\n        *   A J value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates a **trans** relationship between the two vinylic protons.\n\n    *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This is another signal for one proton (1H) in the vinylic region. Its multiplicity is a doublet of quartets (dq). This means the proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons: one single proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet, from a -CH₃ group).\n\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal represents three protons (3H) in the allylic region (i.e., on a carbon adjacent to a C=C double bond). It is a doublet (d), which means these three protons are coupled to a single adjacent proton. This signal is consistent with a methyl group attached to a double bond (-CH=CH-CH₃).\n\n2.  **Assemble the structure based on the fragments:**\n\n    *   From the signals at 5.5 ppm (dq) and 1.6 ppm (d), we can deduce the presence of a **CH₃-CH=** fragment. The proton on the double bond (at 5.5 ppm) is split into a quartet by the adjacent CH₃ group and into a doublet by another proton.\n    *   From the signal at 7.0 ppm (d), we know there's another proton on the double bond coupled to the one at 5.5 ppm. This gives us the **CH₃-CH=CH-** fragment.\n    *   Combining this with the acetate group from the 2.1 ppm signal (-O-C(=O)-CH₃), the most likely structure is propenyl acetate: **CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃**.\n    *   This structure has the correct number of protons and carbons. It excludes the butenyl acetate options, which would have an additional CH₂ group and different splitting patterns.\n\n3.  **Determine the stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n\n    *   As established in step 1, the large coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz** between the two vinylic protons (the ones at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm) is definitive for a **trans** configuration around the double bond.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n\n    *   The compound has a propenyl group, not a butenyl group.\n    *   The geometry of the double bond is trans.\n    *   Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nLet's check the assignments for Trans-propenyl acetate:\n```\n      H(b) H(a)\n       \\  /\n    C = C\n   /     \\\nCH3(c)    O-CO-CH3(d)\n```\n*   **H(a) (7.0 ppm):** Deshielded by the adjacent oxygen. Coupled only to H(b). Expected: doublet. Matches **(1H, d)**.\n*   **H(b) (5.5 ppm):** Coupled to H(a) (doublet) and the three H(c) protons (quartet). Expected: doublet of quartets. Matches **(1H, dq)**.\n*   **H(c) (1.6 ppm):** Methyl group coupled to H(b). Expected: doublet. Matches **(3H, d)**.\n*   **H(d) (2.1 ppm):** Acetate methyl group, no adjacent protons. Expected: singlet. Matches **(3H, s)**.\n*   **J(ab) coupling:** Protons H(a) and H(b) are trans. Expected: J ~12-18 Hz. Matches **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n\nAll data points are perfectly consistent with Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the total number of protons.**\n    The integration values for the signals are 1H, 1H, 3H, and 3H.\n    The total number of protons in the molecule is 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 protons.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the molecular formula from the options.**\n    Let's check the number of protons for the given options:\n    *   Propenyl acetate (CH3-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3) has the formula C5H8O2. The number of hydrogen atoms is 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8. This matches our data.\n    *   Butenyl acetate (CH3-CH2-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3) has the formula C6H10O2. The number of hydrogen atoms is 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 10. This does not match our data.\n    *   Therefore, the unknown compound must be a propenyl acetate, not a butenyl acetate. This eliminates options B) Trans-butenyl acetate and C) Cis-butenyl acetate.\n\n*   **Step 3: Differentiate between Cis and Trans isomers.**\n    We are left with two possibilities: Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The key to differentiating between these two stereoisomers lies in the coupling constant (J-value) of the two protons on the carbon-carbon double bond (the vinyl protons).\n    *   The provided data includes a signal at 7.0 ppm which is a doublet (d) with a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**. This signal corresponds to one of the vinyl protons being split by the other vinyl proton.\n    *   In 1H NMR spectroscopy, the magnitude of the coupling constant between two vicinal protons on a double bond is highly dependent on their stereochemistry:\n        *   **Trans-coupling (³J_trans)** is typically large, falling in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n        *   **Cis-coupling (³J_cis)** is significantly smaller, falling in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n    *   The observed coupling constant of 16.0 Hz falls squarely within the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n*   **Step 4: Assign all signals to the proposed structure (Trans-propenyl acetate).**\n    Let's check if all the data fits the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate: CH3(c)-CH(a)=CH(b)-O-CO-CH3(d)\n    *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal corresponds to the methyl protons of the acetate group, CH3(d). They are not coupled to any other protons, hence they appear as a singlet. This is a characteristic chemical shift for an acetate methyl.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This is one of the vinyl protons, H(b). It is deshielded (has a higher ppm value) because it is attached to the carbon that is bonded to the electronegative oxygen atom. It is split into a doublet by the other vinyl proton, H(a), with a large trans-coupling constant.\n    *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This is the other vinyl proton, H(a). It is split into a doublet by H(b) (J ≈ 16 Hz) and into a quartet by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group, CH3(c). Therefore, its multiplicity is a doublet of quartets (dq).\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal corresponds to the methyl group attached to the double bond, CH3(c). It is split into a doublet by the adjacent vinyl proton, H(a).\n\nAll the provided 1H NMR data are perfectly consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Signals and Integrations:**\nThe 1H NMR spectrum shows four distinct signals with the following integrations (number of protons):\n*   Signal 1: 1H (a single proton)\n*   Signal 2: 1H (a single proton)\n*   Signal 3: 3H (a methyl group)\n*   Signal 4: 3H (another methyl group)\nThe total number of protons is 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 protons.\n\nLet's check the chemical formulas of the options:\n*   Propenyl acetate (CH3-COO-CH=CH-CH3): C5H8O2. This has 3+1+1+3 = 8 protons. This matches.\n*   Butenyl acetate (CH3-COO-CH=CH-CH2-CH3): C6H10O2. This has 3+1+1+2+3 = 10 protons. This does not match.\n\nThis initial analysis immediately rules out both Cis-butenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate, as they do not have 8 protons. We are left with Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Signal in Detail:**\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This corresponds to a methyl group (CH3).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is typical for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (an acyl methyl group).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The protons are not coupled to any adjacent protons.\n    *   **Assignment:** This signal is characteristic of the acetate methyl group (`CH3-COO-`) in all the proposed structures.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This corresponds to a second methyl group (CH3).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** According to the n+1 rule, this methyl group is adjacent to a carbon with one proton (a CH group).\n    *   **Assignment:** This signal must be the methyl group attached to the double bond (`=CH-CH3`).\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This is a single proton on the double bond (a vinylic proton).\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons.\n        *   The 'd' (doublet) part means it's coupled to one other proton. This must be the other proton on the double bond.\n        *   The 'q' (quartet) part means it's coupled to three equivalent protons (a CH3 group). This must be the methyl group at 1.6 ppm.\n    *   **Assignment:** This is the vinylic proton adjacent to the methyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This is the second vinylic proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is significantly downfield, which is expected for a vinylic proton attached to an electronegative oxygen atom (`-O-CH=`).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This proton is coupled to only one other proton, which is the proton at 5.5 ppm.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the most crucial piece of information for determining the stereochemistry. The coupling constant (J) between two protons across a double bond is highly dependent on their relative positions:\n        *   **Trans-coupling (³J_trans):** Typically in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n        *   **Cis-coupling (³J_cis):** Typically in the range of 6-12 Hz.\n    *   The observed value of 16.0 Hz falls squarely within the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\n*   The number of protons rules out the butenyl acetate options.\n*   The coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) between the two vinylic protons (at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm) definitively indicates a *trans* stereochemistry.\n*   Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nLet's draw the final structure and confirm the assignments:\n\n```\n      H(b) 7.0 ppm (d)\n     /\nH3C(d)-C(c) 5.5 ppm (dq)\n     \\\\\n      C(b) - O - C(=O) - CH3(a) 2.1 ppm (s)\n     /\n    H(c)\n(Structure shown in a simplified way)\n\nCorrected drawing and assignments:\n\n      H(b) 7.0 ppm         CH3(a) 2.1 ppm\n        \\                  /\n         C = C - O - C = O\n        /     \\\n       H(c)   CH3(d)\n    5.5 ppm    1.6 ppm\n\n- H(b) and H(c) are trans to each other, resulting in a large J-coupling (J = 16.0 Hz).\n- H(b) is a doublet because it only couples to H(c).\n- H(c) is a doublet of quartets because it couples to H(b) (d) and the three protons of CH3(d) (q).\n- CH3(d) is a doublet because it couples to H(c).\n- CH3(a) is a singlet because it has no adjacent protons.\n```\nAll data points are consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\n*   **Step-by-step Derivations:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the total number of protons:**\n    The problem provides signals corresponding to 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n    Let's check the molecular formula and proton count for the options:\n    *   Propenyl acetate (CH3-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3) has the formula C5H8O2. The number of hydrogen atoms is 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8. This matches the data.\n    *   Butenyl acetate (e.g., CH3-CH2-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3) has the formula C6H10O2. The number of hydrogen atoms is 10. This does not match the data.\n    *   Therefore, we can immediately rule out Cis-butenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate. The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n2.  **Analyze the signal at 2.1 ppm:**\n    *   The signal at `2.1 ppm (3H, s)` indicates three equivalent protons that are not coupled to any neighboring protons (a singlet). This is highly characteristic of the methyl group in an acetate ester (-O-C(=O)-**CH3**). Both propenyl acetate options contain this group.\n\n3.  **Analyze the signals for the propenyl group (CH3-CH=CH-):**\n    Let's label the protons: H3(a)-C-H(b)=C-H(c)-O-\n    *   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This represents the methyl group H(a). It is a doublet (d), which means it is coupled to a single adjacent proton, H(b). This is consistent with the `CH3-CH=` structure.\n    *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This represents a single proton, H(b). It is a doublet of quartets (dq). This means it is coupled to one other proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three protons (giving the quartet). This proton is H(b), which is coupled to H(c) (1 proton) and the methyl group H(a) (3 protons). This perfectly matches the `CH3-CH=CH-` structure.\n    *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This represents the final proton, H(c). It is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to a single adjacent proton, H(b). Its chemical shift is far downfield (7.0 ppm) because it is attached to the deshielding oxygen atom (-CH=CH-**O**-).\n\n4.  **Determine the stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n    *   The key piece of information is the coupling constant (J) for the vinylic protons, H(b) and H(c). The signal for H(c) at 7.0 ppm shows a coupling constant of `J = 16.0 Hz`.\n    *   For protons on a double bond:\n        *   A *trans* relationship results in a large coupling constant, typically in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n        *   A *cis* relationship results in a smaller coupling constant, typically in the range of 6-12 Hz.\n    *   Since the observed coupling constant is 16.0 Hz, this indicates a **trans** configuration for the double bond.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The NMR data is consistent with a propenyl acetate structure with a trans double bond. Therefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the Functional Groups from the 1H NMR Data.**\n    *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet integrating to 3 protons around 2.1 ppm is highly characteristic of the protons of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl, specifically an acetate group (CH₃-C(=O)-O-). All four possible options are acetates, so this fits.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d) and 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** These signals are in the vinylic region (4.5-7.5 ppm), indicating two protons on a carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-). The integration (1H each) confirms this.\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** A doublet integrating to 3 protons suggests a methyl group (CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (-CH-).\n\n*   **Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Compare with Options.**\n    *   We have an acetate group (CH₃COO-), a double bond with two protons (-CH=CH-), and a methyl group attached to the double bond (CH₃-CH=).\n    *   Putting these together gives the structure of propenyl acetate: CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   Let's check the options.\n        *   **Propenyl acetate (A and D):** This structure fits the fragments we identified.\n        *   **Butenyl acetate (B and C):** Let's assume the most likely isomer, but-2-enyl acetate: CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-O-C(=O)-CH₃. This structure contains a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to the oxygen. A signal for this group (typically a doublet around 4.5 ppm) is absent from the provided data. Therefore, we can eliminate the butenyl acetate options (B and C).\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans).**\n    *   The choice is now between Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The key to differentiating between them is the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinylic protons.\n    *   The data provides a signal at **7.0 ppm** which is a doublet with **J = 16.0 Hz**. This J-value represents the coupling between the two protons on the double bond.\n    *   **Rule of thumb for vinylic coupling constants:**\n        *   **³J_trans (protons are trans to each other):** Typically large, in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n        *   **³J_cis (protons are cis to each other):** Typically smaller, in the range of 6-12 Hz.\n    *   The observed coupling constant of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely in the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n*   **Step 4: Final Conclusion.**\n    *   The structure is propenyl acetate.\n    *   The J-value of 16.0 Hz indicates a trans double bond.\n    *   Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nLet's briefly confirm the splitting patterns for Trans-propenyl acetate:\n*   `CH₃(c)-CH(b)=CH(a)-O-C(=O)-CH₃(d)`\n*   **H(a) at ~7.0 ppm:** Coupled to H(b), appears as a doublet (d). The J value is 16.0 Hz. This matches.\n*   **H(b) at ~5.5 ppm:** Coupled to H(a) (makes it a doublet) and the three H(c) protons (makes it a quartet). The overall pattern is a doublet of quartets (dq). This matches.\n*   **H(c) at ~1.6 ppm:** Coupled to H(b), appears as a doublet (d). This matches.\n*   **H(d) at ~2.1 ppm:** No adjacent protons, appears as a singlet (s). This matches.\nAll data points are consistent with Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to identify the unknown compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nWe are given the following signals:\n*   **Signal 1:** 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)\n*   **Signal 2:** 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)\n*   **Signal 3:** 2.1 ppm (3H, s)\n*   **Signal 4:** 1.6 ppm (3H, d)\n\nLet's interpret each signal:\n\n*   **Signal 3: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~2.1 ppm):** This is a typical chemical shift for a methyl group (CH₃) attached to a carbonyl group of an ester or ketone. In this case, it corresponds to the methyl protons of the acetate group (CH₃COO-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s):** A singlet indicates that these protons have no adjacent protons to couple with. This is consistent with an acetate group. All four possible compounds are acetates, so they all contain this group.\n\n*   **Signal 1: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents one proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This value is in the alkene (or vinylic) region (typically 5-7.5 ppm), indicating a proton attached to a carbon-carbon double bond. Its downfield position suggests it's attached to a carbon that is also bonded to an electronegative atom like oxygen (-O-CH=).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** A doublet means this proton is coupled to only one other proton.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the most crucial piece of information for determining stereochemistry. The magnitude of the coupling constant between two protons on a double bond tells us about their relative positions:\n        *   **trans-coupling:** J ≈ 12-18 Hz\n        *   **cis-coupling:** J ≈ 6-12 Hz\n    *   A J-value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates that the two coupled vinylic protons are **trans** to each other. This immediately eliminates the *cis* isomers: Cis-propenyl acetate (D) and Cis-butenyl acetate (A).\n\n*   **Signal 4: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is a typical value for an allylic methyl group (a methyl group attached to a double bond, C=C-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** A doublet indicates this methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton. This confirms the presence of a CH₃-CH= fragment.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Represents one proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** Also in the vinylic region.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq):** A doublet of quartets. This complex splitting pattern means the proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   **Doublet (d):** It's coupled to one other proton. This must be the other vinylic proton (the one at 7.0 ppm), and the coupling constant for this split must be 16.0 Hz.\n        *   **Quartet (q):** It's coupled to a group of three equivalent protons (n+1 = 3+1 = 4). This corresponds to coupling with the adjacent methyl group we identified from the signal at 1.6 ppm.\n\n**2. Assemble the Structure**\n\nLet's piece together the fragments we've identified:\n1.  An acetate group: **-O-CO-CH₃** (from the 2.1 ppm signal).\n2.  A trans double bond with two protons: **-CH=CH-** (from the 7.0 ppm signal's J-value).\n3.  A methyl group attached to the double bond: **CH₃-CH=** (from the 1.6 ppm and 5.5 ppm signals).\n\nCombining these pieces gives us the following structure:\n**CH₃ - CH = CH - O - CO - CH₃**\n\nThe stereochemistry is **trans**, as determined by the J = 16.0 Hz coupling constant.\n\nThis structure is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **A) Cis-butenyl acetate:** Incorrect. The stereochemistry is cis, and it's a butenyl group, not a propenyl group. A butenyl group would have signals for an ethyl group (CH₃CH₂-), which are not observed.\n*   **B) Trans-butenyl acetate:** Incorrect. While the stereochemistry is trans, this compound has a butenyl group. We would expect signals for an ethyl group, not the observed doublet for a methyl group attached to the double bond.\n*   **C) Trans-propenyl acetate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all aspects of the 1H NMR data: the trans stereochemistry (J=16.0 Hz), the acetate singlet (2.1 ppm), the allylic methyl doublet (1.6 ppm), and the two distinct vinylic protons with their characteristic splitting patterns and chemical shifts (7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm).\n*   **D) Cis-propenyl acetate:** Incorrect. The stereochemistry is cis (J ≈ 6-12 Hz), which contradicts the observed J = 16.0 Hz.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound from its 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Signal 1: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). The value is relatively high (downfield), suggesting the proton is attached to a carbon that is bonded to an electron-withdrawing atom, like oxygen.\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents one proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** The signal is split into a doublet, which means it has one neighboring proton.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a large coupling constant for vinylic protons. The magnitude of the J-coupling constant between two protons on a double bond is indicative of their stereochemistry. A value of ~12-18 Hz is characteristic of a *trans* relationship, while a value of ~6-12 Hz indicates a *cis* relationship. The value of 16.0 Hz strongly suggests a *trans* configuration.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** Also in the vinylic region.\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents one proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This means the proton is coupled to two different sets of neighbors. The \"d\" (doublet) indicates coupling to one proton, and the \"q\" (quartet) indicates coupling to three equivalent protons (a methyl group).\n\n*   **Signal 3: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This is the typical region for protons of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (CH₃-C=O), which is characteristic of an acetate group.\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The signal is not split, meaning there are no protons on the adjacent atom. This is consistent with an acetate methyl group.\n\n*   **Signal 4: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region (protons on a carbon adjacent to a C=C double bond).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, a methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** The signal is split into a doublet, meaning it is coupled to one neighboring proton.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Candidate Structures**\n\nFirst, let's check the total number of protons. The data accounts for 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n\n*   **Propenyl Acetate (C₅H₈O₂):** The structure is CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃. The total number of protons is 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8. This matches the data.\n*   **Butenyl Acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂):** The structure would be CH₃-CH₂-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃ (or another isomer). The total number of protons is 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 10. This does not match the data. Therefore, we can eliminate both Cis- and Trans-butenyl acetate.\n\nNow we only need to distinguish between Cis- and Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**3. Assign the Signals to Trans-propenyl acetate**\n\nLet's look at the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate:\n```\n      H(b)   H(a)\n       \\    /\n        C == C\n       /      \\\n CH₃(c)        O-C(=O)-CH₃(d)\n```\n\n*   **Protons (d) - Acetate methyl:** These 3 protons are isolated and have no neighbors. They should be a singlet. This matches the signal at **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**.\n*   **Protons (c) - Allylic methyl:** These 3 protons are adjacent to proton (b). They are coupled to this single proton, so they should appear as a doublet. This matches the signal at **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**.\n*   **Proton (b) - Vinylic proton:** This proton is coupled to proton (a) (one proton, so it will be a doublet) and also to the three protons of the methyl group (c) (three protons, so it will be a quartet). The resulting multiplicity is a doublet of quartets. This perfectly matches the signal at **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**.\n*   **Proton (a) - Vinylic proton:** This proton is adjacent to the electronegative oxygen atom, which shifts it downfield. It is coupled only to proton (b), so it should appear as a doublet. This matches the signal at **7.0 ppm (1H, d)**.\n\n**4. Confirm Stereochemistry**\n\nThe final and most crucial piece of evidence is the coupling constant of the doublet at 7.0 ppm, which is **J = 16.0 Hz**. This large value is characteristic of protons in a *trans* configuration on a double bond. If the compound were Cis-propenyl acetate, the coupling constant would be much smaller (typically 6-12 Hz).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll pieces of the 1H NMR data (chemical shifts, integrations, multiplicities, and the key coupling constant) are perfectly consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown organic compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Number of Protons and Structure Size**\n\nFirst, let's sum the integrations of all the signals in the 1H NMR spectrum to determine the total number of protons in the molecule.\n- Integration: 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8H.\nThe unknown compound has a total of 8 protons.\n\nNow, let's determine the number of protons for the possible options:\n- **Propenyl acetate:** The molecular formula is C5H8O2. The structure is CH3-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3. The total number of protons is 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8H. This matches the NMR data.\n- **Butenyl acetate:** The molecular formula is C6H10O2. For example, 1-butenyl acetate (CH3CH2CH=CH-O-CO-CH3) has 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 10H. This does not match the NMR data.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound must be a propenyl acetate. This eliminates options A (Cis-butenyl acetate) and C (Trans-butenyl acetate). We are left with Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Signals and Assign them to the Propenyl Acetate Structure**\n\nThe structure is `CH3(c)-CH(b)=CH(a)-O-CO-CH3(d)`. Let's analyze each signal:\n\n- **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet in the region of ~2.0-2.2 ppm integrating to 3 protons is characteristic of an acetyl methyl group (-O-CO-C**H**3). This proton group (d) has no adjacent protons, so it appears as a singlet. This is consistent with an acetate structure.\n\n- **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This is a methyl group attached to the double bond (`C**H**3(c)-CH=`). It integrates to 3 protons and is a doublet because it is coupled to the single adjacent vinylic proton, H(b).\n\n- **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal is for a single proton, H(b). It is split into a doublet by the adjacent vinylic proton H(a), and into a quartet by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (c). This results in a doublet of quartets (dq). Its chemical shift is in the vinylic region.\n\n- **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal is for the other single vinylic proton, H(a). It is attached to the carbon bearing the electronegative oxygen atom, which deshields it significantly, shifting it far downfield. It is split into a doublet by the single adjacent vinylic proton, H(b).\n\n### **3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nThe key to distinguishing between the cis and trans isomers is the coupling constant (J) between the two vinylic protons, H(a) and H(b).\n\n- The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a reported coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n- For vinylic protons:\n    - A **trans** configuration typically shows a large coupling constant, usually in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    - A **cis** configuration typically shows a smaller coupling constant, usually in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nSince the observed coupling constant is 16.0 Hz, which falls squarely in the range for a trans coupling, the two vinylic protons are in a **trans** orientation relative to each other.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the total number of protons (8H) and the large vinylic coupling constant (16.0 Hz), the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nThe structure is:\n      H\n     /\nCH3-C=C-O-CO-CH3\n   /\n  H\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Protons (Integration)**\n\nFirst, let's sum the integration values from the 1H NMR data to find the total number of protons in the molecule.\n*   Integration = 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n\nNow, let's determine the total number of protons for the possible compounds. All options are acetates, which have a -OCOCH3 group containing 3 protons.\n*   **Propenyl acetate:** A propenyl group is C3H5. So, propenyl acetate (C3H5OCOCH3) has 5 + 3 = **8 protons**. This matches our data.\n*   **Butenyl acetate:** A butenyl group is C4H7. So, butenyl acetate (C4H7OCOCH3) has 7 + 3 = **10 protons**. This does not match our data.\n\nThis initial analysis immediately rules out the butenyl acetate options. The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**Eliminated Options:**\n*   B) Trans-butenyl acetate\n*   D) Cis-butenyl acetate\n\n**2. Analyze the Coupling Constant (J-value)**\n\nWe are left with two possibilities: Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The key to distinguishing between them is the coupling constant (J) between the two vinylic protons (the protons on the C=C double bond).\n\n*   The provided data shows a signal at **7.0 ppm** which is a doublet (d) with a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   The magnitude of the coupling constant between vinylic protons is dependent on their stereochemistry:\n    *   **Trans** coupling (protons on opposite sides of the double bond) results in a large J-value, typically in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis** coupling (protons on the same side of the double bond) results in a smaller J-value, typically in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nSince the observed coupling constant is 16.0 Hz, it falls squarely within the range for a **trans** double bond. This allows us to conclude that the compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**Eliminated Option:**\n*   C) Cis-propenyl acetate\n\n**3. Confirm the Structure by Assigning All Signals**\n\nThe only remaining option is **Trans-propenyl acetate**. Let's verify that all the signals in the spectrum match this structure.\n\n**Structure of Trans-propenyl acetate:**\n\n      H(c)   H(b)\n       \\    /\n        C==C\n       /    \\\n    H3C(d)    O-C(=O)-CH3(a)\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This corresponds to the three protons of the acetate methyl group **(a)**. They are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons, so they appear as a singlet. This is a characteristic chemical shift for an acetate group. This is a perfect match.\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This corresponds to the vinylic proton **(b)**, which is attached to the same carbon as the oxygen atom. The electronegative oxygen deshields this proton, shifting it far downfield. It is coupled only to proton **(c)** in a *trans* configuration, resulting in a doublet with a large J-value. This is a perfect match.\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This corresponds to the other vinylic proton **(c)**. It is coupled to proton **(b)** (which splits it into a doublet) and also to the three protons of the methyl group **(d)** (which splits it into a quartet). The resulting pattern is a doublet of quartets (dq). This is a perfect match.\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This corresponds to the three protons of the methyl group **(d)**, which is attached to the double bond. These protons are coupled to the single vinylic proton **(c)**, splitting their signal into a doublet. This is a perfect match.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll pieces of the 1H NMR data (chemical shifts, integrations, and splitting patterns including the crucial coupling constant) are fully consistent with the structure of **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This indicates a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s):** A singlet means this methyl group has no protons on the adjacent carbon atom.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a methyl group attached to the carbonyl of an acetate ester (-O-C(=O)-CH₃). All four possible compounds are acetates, so this signal is consistent with all of them.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This is another methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** A doublet means this methyl group is adjacent to a carbon with one proton (-CH-). This suggests an allylic methyl group, like CH₃-CH=.\n\n*   **Signal 3: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal corresponds to a single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~5.5 ppm):** This value is in the vinyl region, meaning the proton is part of a carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq):** A doublet of quartets means this proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons: one single proton (giving the doublet, 'd') and a set of three protons (giving the quartet, 'q'). This is consistent with a proton in a CH₃-C**H**=CH- fragment.\n\n*   **Signal 4: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal corresponds to a single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~7.0 ppm):** This is also in the vinyl region (-CH=CH-). The high chemical shift (downfield) suggests it's attached to a carbon that is also bonded to the electron-withdrawing oxygen atom (-CH=CH-O-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** A doublet means this proton is coupled to only one adjacent proton.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the most crucial piece of information for determining the stereochemistry.\n\n**2. Determine the Carbon Skeleton (Propenyl vs. Butenyl)**\n\nLet's count the total protons described by the signals, excluding the acetate methyl group:\n*   1.6 ppm (3H) + 5.5 ppm (1H) + 7.0 ppm (1H) = 5 protons.\n\nNow let's compare this to the possible structures:\n*   **Propenyl group (CH₃-CH=CH-):** Has 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 protons. This matches the data.\n*   **Butenyl group (e.g., CH₃CH₂-CH=CH-):** Has 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 7 protons. This does not match the data.\n\nTherefore, the compound must be a **propenyl acetate**, which eliminates options A (Trans-butenyl acetate) and B (Cis-butenyl acetate).\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nThe choice is now between Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The geometry of the double bond is determined by the coupling constant (J) between the two vinyl protons (the signals at 5.5 ppm and 7.0 ppm).\n\n*   The signal at 7.0 ppm has a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   The established rules for vinyl proton coupling are:\n    *   **Trans**-coupling (protons on opposite sides of the double bond) typically have a large J-value of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis**-coupling (protons on the same side of the double bond) have a smaller J-value of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nSince the observed coupling constant is 16.0 Hz, it falls squarely in the range for a **trans** double bond.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis leads to the following conclusions:\n*   The compound is an **acetate**. (from 2.1 ppm signal)\n*   The alkyl group is **propenyl**. (from proton count)\n*   The double bond has a **trans** configuration. (from J = 16.0 Hz)\n\nCombining these facts, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nThe user wants me to identify an unknown organic compound from the provided 1H NMR data and choose from four possible options.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nLet's break down the information provided for each signal:\n*   **Signal 1:** `2.1 ppm (3H, s)`\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents 3 protons, likely a methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is typical for protons on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O), specifically an acetyl methyl group (CH₃-C=O).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s - singlet):** There are no protons on the adjacent atom, which is consistent with the `CH₃-C=O-O-` structure of an acetate group.\n\n*   **Signal 2:** `1.6 ppm (3H, d)`\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents another methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d - doublet):** The signal is split into two peaks, which means this methyl group is adjacent to a single proton (-CH-). This suggests a `CH-CH₃` fragment.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the region for an allylic methyl group (a methyl group attached to a C=C double bond).\n\n*   **Signal 3:** `7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)`\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Represents a single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is in the vinyl region (protons on a C=C double bond). The significant downfield shift suggests this proton is attached to a carbon that is also bonded to an electronegative atom, like the oxygen in an ester (`-O-CH=`).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d - doublet):** This proton is coupled to one other adjacent proton.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This value is crucial for determining stereochemistry.\n\n*   **Signal 4:** `5.5 ppm (1H, dq)`\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Represents a single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** Also in the vinyl region.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq - doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons. The 'doublet' part comes from coupling to one other proton (the one at 7.0 ppm). The 'quartet' part comes from coupling to the three protons of a methyl group (the one at 1.6 ppm).\n\n**2. Assemble the Fragments**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n*   An acetate group: `CH₃COO-` (from the signal at 2.1 ppm).\n*   A propenyl group with a specific arrangement: `-CH=CH-CH₃` (from the signals at 1.6, 5.5, and 7.0 ppm).\n\nCombining these gives the structure for propenyl acetate: `CH₃-COO-CH=CH-CH₃`.\nThis confirms the compound is either cis- or trans-propenyl acetate, and we can rule out the butenyl acetate options (B and C). Butenyl acetate would have 10 protons (C₆H₁₀O₂), while our data shows 8 protons (1+1+3+3), matching the formula for propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂).\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nThe distinction between the cis and trans isomers is made using the vicinal coupling constant (`³J`) between the two protons on the double bond.\n*   **Rule of thumb:**\n    *   For `trans` protons on a double bond, `J` is typically large: **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   For `cis` protons on a double bond, `J` is typically smaller: **6-12 Hz**.\n\nThe given coupling constant is **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value falls squarely within the range for a `trans` configuration.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe molecular formula, fragment analysis, and splitting patterns all point to propenyl acetate. The large coupling constant of 16.0 Hz between the vinylic protons is definitive evidence for a `trans` geometry. Therefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n*   Structure: Trans-propenyl acetate (`CH₃-COO-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH₃(c)`)\n*   Signal at 2.1 ppm: Acetate `CH₃` (singlet, 3H) - ✓\n*   Signal at 1.6 ppm: `CH₃(c)` (doublet, split by H(b), 3H) - ✓\n*   Signal at 7.0 ppm: `H(a)` (downfield due to oxygen, doublet from H(b), J_trans ≈ 16 Hz, 1H) - ✓\n*   Signal at 5.5 ppm: `H(b)` (doublet from H(a), quartet from CH₃(c), 1H) - ✓\nAll data matches perfectly.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Integration (Number of Protons):**\nFirst, let's sum the number of protons represented by each signal:\n1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons in total.\n\nNow let's check the proton counts for the possible options:\n*   **Propenyl acetate** (CH₃-CH=CH-O-CO-CH₃): 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8 protons. This matches the data.\n*   **Butenyl acetate** (e.g., Crotyl acetate, CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-O-CO-CH₃): 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 10 protons. This does not match. Other butenyl acetate isomers also have more than 8 protons.\n\nBased on the total number of protons, we can immediately rule out Cis-butenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate. The choice is now between Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze the Chemical Shifts and Multiplicities:**\n\nLet's break down each signal from the provided data:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This represents a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** This methyl group has no adjacent protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~2.1 ppm):** This is a characteristic shift for the protons of an acetyl group (CH₃-C=O). This fits the \"acetate\" part of the name.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This is another methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This methyl group is coupled to one adjacent proton (according to the n+1 rule). This implies a -CH-CH₃ fragment.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~1.6 ppm):** This shift is typical for an allylic methyl group (a methyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond). This signal corresponds to the CH₃ group on the propenyl part of the molecule.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz) and 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Integration (1H each):** These are two single protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~5-7 ppm):** These shifts are in the vinylic region, meaning these protons are attached directly to the carbons of the C=C double bond.\n    *   The proton at 7.0 ppm is significantly downfield (deshielded) because it is on the same carbon as the electron-withdrawing oxygen atom of the acetate group (-O-CH=). It's a doublet because it's only coupled to the other vinylic proton.\n    *   The proton at 5.5 ppm is coupled to two different sets of protons, hence the \"dq\" (doublet of quartets) multiplicity. The \"doublet\" part comes from splitting by the other vinylic proton (at 7.0 ppm), and the \"quartet\" part comes from splitting by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (at 1.6 ppm).\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n\nThe key to distinguishing between the Cis and Trans isomers is the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinylic protons.\n*   The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   The magnitude of the coupling constant between vinylic protons is dependent on the angle between them:\n    *   **Trans** coupling (protons on opposite sides of the double bond) results in a large J-value, typically in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis** coupling (protons on the same side of the double bond) results in a smaller J-value, typically in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nSince the observed coupling constant is 16.0 Hz, it falls squarely within the range for trans-vinylic protons. This indicates that the molecule has a trans configuration at the double bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis of the 1H NMR spectrum points to a structure with 8 protons, containing an acetyl group and a trans-propenyl group. This corresponds to **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown organic compound.\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula from Integration:**\n\n*   First, sum the integration values of all the signals: 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8H.\n*   This means the molecule contains a total of 8 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Let's check the number of hydrogens in the possible compounds:\n    *   Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2): Has 8 hydrogens.\n    *   Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2): Has 10 hydrogens.\n*   Since the total integration corresponds to 8 hydrogens, the unknown compound must be a propenyl acetate. This eliminates options A (Trans-butenyl acetate) and D (Cis-butenyl acetate).\n\n**2. Assign the Signals to the Protons of Propenyl Acetate:**\n\nThe structure of propenyl acetate is CH3-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3. We have four distinct sets of protons.\n\n*   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   This is a singlet (s), meaning it has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   The integration is 3H.\n    *   The chemical shift of ~2.1 ppm is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (the acetate methyl). This perfectly matches the -O-CO-**CH3** group.\n\n*   **Signals for the Propenyl Group (CH3-CH=CH-):**\n    We have three signals left for the three types of protons in this group.\n    *   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This is a doublet (d) with an integration of 3H. This corresponds to the methyl group (**CH3**-CH=) on the double bond. It is split into a doublet because it is coupled to the single adjacent vinyl proton.\n    *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a doublet (d) for one proton (1H). It is the most downfield signal (highest ppm value), which indicates it is heavily deshielded. In an enol acetate structure like this, the proton on the carbon attached to the oxygen (=CH-O) is the most deshielded. So, this signal corresponds to the -CH=**CH**-O- proton. It is a doublet because it is coupled to the other vinyl proton.\n    *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This is a doublet of quartets (dq) for one proton (1H). This signal must correspond to the remaining proton in the middle of the propenyl chain (-**CH**=CH-O-).\n        *   It is coupled to the adjacent vinyl proton (at 7.0 ppm), causing it to split into a **doublet**.\n        *   It is also coupled to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (at 1.6 ppm), causing it to split into a **quartet** (3+1=4).\n        *   Therefore, the multiplicity is a doublet of quartets, which matches the data.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n\n*   The distinction between cis and trans isomers is determined by the coupling constant (J) between the two vinyl protons (the ones on the double bond).\n*   The typical range for the vicinal coupling constant (³J) across a double bond is:\n    *   **Trans:** 12 - 18 Hz (large coupling)\n    *   **Cis:** 6 - 12 Hz (small coupling)\n*   The data for the signal at 7.0 ppm shows a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   This large value falls squarely in the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the total number of protons (8H), the signal assignments, and particularly the large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz), the unknown compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the unknown compound from its 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n\nLet's examine each signal provided:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon, specifically an acetate group (CH₃-C=O).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** A singlet means these protons are not coupled to any neighboring protons. This is consistent with an isolated acetate methyl group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This peak corresponds to the methyl group of the acetate ester, which is present in all four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal also represents three protons, so it is a methyl group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~1.6 ppm):** This shift is typical for an allylic methyl group (a methyl group attached to a C=C double bond).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** A doublet means this methyl group is coupled to one adjacent proton (n+1 rule: 2 peaks = n+1, so n=1). This indicates a `CH₃-CH=` structural fragment.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal eliminates the butenyl acetate options. Butenyl acetate (`CH₃COOCH=CHCH₂CH₃`) would have a terminal ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`), which would show up as a triplet for the `CH₃` and a quartet for the `CH₂`, not a methyl doublet. Therefore, the compound must be a propenyl acetate.\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This is a single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~5.5 ppm):** This shift is in the vinylic region (a proton on a C=C double bond).\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This is a complex splitting pattern which tells us this proton is being split by two different sets of neighbors.\n        *   The **doublet (\"d\")** part comes from being coupled to one other proton. This must be the other proton on the double bond.\n        *   The **quartet (\"q\")** part comes from being coupled to three equivalent protons (n+1 rule: 4 peaks = n+1, so n=3). This must be the neighboring allylic methyl group (`CH₃`) we identified at 1.6 ppm.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This proton is the one on the double bond that is also adjacent to the methyl group: `=CH-CH₃`.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This is the other single vinylic proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~7.0 ppm):** This proton is significantly downfield (higher ppm value) compared to the other vinylic proton. This is due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent electronegative oxygen atom from the ester group (`-O-CH=`).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This proton is coupled only to the other vinylic proton (at 5.5 ppm).\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the key piece of information to determine the stereochemistry. The magnitude of the coupling constant (J value) between two protons on a double bond is dependent on their geometry:\n        *   **Trans protons:** J values are typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n        *   **Cis protons:** J values are smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The observed J value of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely in the trans range. This confirms the two vinylic protons are on opposite sides of the double bond.\n\n**2. Assembling the Structure:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have:\n*   An acetate group: `CH₃COO-`\n*   A propenyl group with a trans double bond: `-CH=CH-CH₃`\n*   The vinylic proton at 7.0 ppm is attached to the oxygen, and the vinylic proton at 5.5 ppm is attached to the methyl group.\n\nPutting it all together, the structure is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n      H₃C                H\n         \\              /\n          C = C\n         /     \\\n      H₃C-C-O        H\n         ||\n         O\n\n**3. Matching with Options:**\n\n*   A) Trans-butenyl acetate - Incorrect, not a butenyl chain.\n*   B) Cis-propenyl acetate - Incorrect, J value would be smaller.\n*   C) Trans-propenyl acetate - Correct. All data points match this structure.\n*   D) Cis-butenyl acetate - Incorrect, not a butenyl chain and wrong stereochemistry.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Total Proton Count:** First, let's determine the total number of protons represented in the spectrum. By adding the integrations (the number of protons for each signal), we get 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n\n2.  **Compare Proton Count with Possible Compounds:**\n    *   **Propenyl acetate:** The molecular formula is C5H8O2. This molecule has 8 hydrogen atoms (protons). This matches our proton count.\n    *   **Butenyl acetate:** The molecular formula is C6H10O2. This molecule has 10 hydrogen atoms (protons). This does not match our proton count.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Based on the integration alone, we can rule out both Cis-butenyl acetate (D) and Trans-butenyl acetate (A). The unknown compound must be either Cis- or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Signals in Detail to Determine the Isomer (Cis vs. Trans):**\n\n    *   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet (s) for 3 protons at ~2.1 ppm is highly characteristic of an acetate methyl group (CH₃-C=O). This is present in all the propenyl acetate options.\n\n    *   **Signals in the Alkene Region (7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm):** These two signals are for protons on a carbon-carbon double bond (vinylic protons). Let's call them Hₐ and Hₑ.\n\n    *   **Key Signal: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n        *   This is a single vinylic proton.\n        *   It is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to (split by) only one other proton.\n        *   The crucial piece of information is the coupling constant, **J = 16.0 Hz**. For vinylic protons, a large coupling constant (typically 12-18 Hz) indicates a **trans** relationship across the double bond. A smaller coupling constant (typically 6-12 Hz) would indicate a *cis* relationship.\n        *   The J value of 16.0 Hz strongly suggests a **trans** isomer.\n\n    *   **Let's confirm the other signals fit a Trans-propenyl acetate structure:**\n        *   Structure:\n            \n           CH₃(c)-CH(b)=CH(a)-O-C(=O)-CH₃(d)\n\n        *   **Proton H(a):** This proton is attached to the carbon bonded to the electronegative oxygen atom, which deshields it, causing it to appear at a higher chemical shift (downfield). It is coupled to H(b). This perfectly matches the signal at **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz)**.\n\n        *   **Proton H(b):** This proton is coupled to H(a) (giving a doublet, J=16.0 Hz) and is also coupled to the three protons of the methyl group CH₃(c) (giving a quartet). The resulting splitting pattern is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. This matches the signal at **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**.\n\n        *   **Protons H(c):** This is the methyl group (CH₃) attached to the double bond. It is coupled to the single proton H(b), so it will appear as a **doublet (d)**. This matches the signal at **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**.\n\n        *   **Protons H(d):** This is the acetate methyl group. It has no adjacent protons, so it is a **singlet (s)**. This matches the signal at **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The total proton count rules out the butenyl acetate options. The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) between the vinylic protons is characteristic of a trans-alkene. All signals in the spectrum perfectly match the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown organic compound from the provided 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's break down each signal provided in the 1H NMR spectrum:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is characteristic of protons on a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** The signal represents three equivalent protons, consistent with a methyl (CH₃) group.\n    *   **Splitting (s):** A singlet indicates that this methyl group has no adjacent protons.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal corresponds to an acetyl group (CH₃C=O).\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic/vinylic region, suggesting a methyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal also represents a methyl (CH₃) group.\n    *   **Splitting (d):** A doublet indicates this methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a CH₃-CH= group.\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This is in the alkene (vinylic) region for a proton directly on a double bond.\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents a single proton.\n    *   **Splitting (dq):** A doublet of quartets means this proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons: one single proton (causing the doublet splitting) and a group of three equivalent protons (causing the quartet splitting).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This proton is on the double bond and is adjacent to both another single proton on the double bond and the methyl group we identified at 1.6 ppm. This confirms the `CH₃-CH=` fragment from the previous signal.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is also in the vinylic region, quite downfield, which suggests it is attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen (e.g., in an enol ether or enol ester).\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents a single proton.\n    *   **Splitting (d):** A doublet means this proton is coupled to one adjacent proton. This must be the proton at 5.5 ppm.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a crucial piece of information. The magnitude of the coupling constant (J-value) between two protons across a double bond tells us about their stereochemical relationship. A large J-value (typically 12-18 Hz) is characteristic of a *trans* arrangement. A smaller J-value (typically 6-12 Hz) would indicate a *cis* arrangement.\n\n**2. Assemble the Structure**\n\nLet's put the pieces together:\n1.  We have an acetyl group: `CH₃-C(=O)-`.\n2.  We have a `CH₃-CH=` fragment.\n3.  We have a vinylic proton `=-CH-` that is coupled to the `CH₃-CH=` proton and is also deshielded, suggesting it's bonded to an oxygen.\n\nCombining these fragments gives the structure of propenyl acetate: `CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n\nLet's verify this structure against the data:\n*   `CH₃` (acetyl): Singlet, 3H -> Matches 2.1 ppm signal.\n*   `CH₃` (vinylic): Coupled to one proton (`=CH-`), so it's a doublet, 3H -> Matches 1.6 ppm signal.\n*   `=CH-` (next to methyl): Coupled to the other vinylic proton (doublet) and the vinylic methyl (quartet), so it's a doublet of quartets, 1H -> Matches 5.5 ppm signal.\n*   `=CH-O-`: Coupled to the other vinylic proton, so it's a doublet, 1H -> Matches 7.0 ppm signal.\n\nThe proposed structure of propenyl acetate perfectly fits the connectivity implied by the splitting patterns.\n\n**3. Eliminate Incorrect Options**\n\nThe options include \"butenyl acetate\".\n*   **Propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂):** The total number of protons is 3+1+1+3 = 8. This matches the integration values from the spectrum (3+3+1+1=8).\n*   **Butenyl acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂):** The total number of protons is 10. This does not match the integration from the spectrum.\nTherefore, we can eliminate options B (Cis-butenyl acetate) and D (Trans-butenyl acetate).\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry**\n\nWe are left with Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The decision is made based on the coupling constant of the vinylic protons.\n\n*   The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   As stated before, a J-value between 12-18 Hz is definitive for a **trans** configuration of protons on a double bond.\n*   If the compound were cis, the J-value would be in the 6-12 Hz range.\n\nThus, the unknown compound must have a trans double bond.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe compound has the structure of propenyl acetate and the vinylic protons are in a trans configuration. The correct identification is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown organic compound from the provided 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Protons and Signals**\n\n*   The provided 1H NMR data shows four distinct signals.\n*   The integration values for these signals are 1H, 1H, 3H, and 3H.\n*   The total number of hydrogen atoms (protons) in the molecule is the sum of these integrations: 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 protons.\n\nNow, let's determine the total number of protons for each of the possible compounds:\n*   **Propenyl acetate (Cis or Trans):** The molecular formula is C5H8O2. This corresponds to 8 hydrogen atoms. This is consistent with the NMR data.\n    *   Structure: CH3-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3\n    *   Protons: 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8H.\n*   **Butenyl acetate (Cis or Trans):** The molecular formula is C6H10O2. This corresponds to 10 hydrogen atoms. This is inconsistent with the NMR data.\n    *   Structure: CH3-CH2-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3\n    *   Protons: 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 10H.\n\nSince the total proton count from the NMR data is 8, we can confidently **eliminate Cis-butenyl acetate (D) and Trans-butenyl acetate (C)**. The compound must be either Cis- or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze the Chemical Shifts and Splitting Patterns**\n\nLet's analyze the remaining two options, Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate, and match the signals to the protons in the structure: CH3(a)-CH(b)=CH(c)-O-CO-CH3(d).\n\n*   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   This is a singlet (s), meaning it has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   It integrates to 3 protons, suggesting a methyl (CH3) group.\n    *   A chemical shift of ~2.1 ppm is characteristic of the methyl protons of an acetate group (-O-CO-**CH3**). This corresponds to **CH3(d)**. This signal is expected for both cis and trans isomers.\n\n*   **Signals for the Propenyl Group (CH3(a)-CH(b)=CH(c)-):** We have three remaining signals: 7.0 ppm (1H, d), 5.5 ppm (1H, dq), and 1.6 ppm (3H, d).\n    *   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This is a doublet (d) integrating to 3H. This is characteristic of a methyl group (**CH3(a)**) that is coupled to a single adjacent proton (CH(b)). The splitting into a doublet confirms this coupling.\n    *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a vinyl proton (a proton on a C=C double bond). The high chemical shift (downfield) is due to its attachment to the deshielding oxygen atom of the ester group. This signal corresponds to proton **H(c)**. It is split into a doublet (d) because it is coupled to the other vinyl proton, H(b).\n    *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal corresponds to the remaining vinyl proton, **H(b)**. It is split by two different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   It is coupled to the single proton H(c), splitting the signal into a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   It is also coupled to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group CH3(a), which splits the signal further into a **quartet (q)**.\n        *   The combined splitting pattern is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n\nThe assignment of all signals, their integrations, and their splitting patterns is fully consistent with the structure of propenyl acetate.\n\n**3. Use the Coupling Constant (J) to Determine Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nThe final and most crucial piece of evidence is the coupling constant (J-value) of the signal at 7.0 ppm, which is **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value represents the coupling between the two vinyl protons, H(b) and H(c).\n\nThe magnitude of the coupling constant between vicinal protons on a double bond is highly dependent on their stereochemical relationship:\n*   **Trans-coupling (³J_trans):** Protons are on opposite sides of the double bond. The coupling constant is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n*   **Cis-coupling (³J_cis):** Protons are on the same side of the double bond. The coupling constant is smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nThe observed coupling constant of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely within the range for a **trans** configuration. This indicates that the two vinyl protons are on opposite sides of the double bond.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the total proton count, the chemical shifts, the splitting patterns, and particularly the large vicinal coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz), the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown organic compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's break down the provided information:\n*   **Signal 1:** `7.0 ppm`, Integration: `1H`, Multiplicity: `d` (doublet), Coupling constant: `J = 16.0 Hz`. This signal represents one proton and is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). The multiplicity indicates it's coupled to one neighboring proton. The large coupling constant is significant.\n*   **Signal 2:** `5.5 ppm`, Integration: `1H`, Multiplicity: `dq` (doublet of quartets). This is another vinylic proton. The complex multiplicity suggests it's coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons: one proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three protons (giving the quartet).\n*   **Signal 3:** `2.1 ppm`, Integration: `3H`, Multiplicity: `s` (singlet). This signal represents a methyl group (3H) with no adjacent protons. Its chemical shift is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (C=O), specifically an acetate group (CH₃-C(=O)O-).\n*   **Signal 4:** `1.6 ppm`, Integration: `3H`, Multiplicity: `d` (doublet). This represents another methyl group. The doublet multiplicity means it is coupled to one adjacent proton.\n\n**2. Determine the Molecular Formula and Basic Structure**\n\n*   **Total Protons:** Summing the integrations (1H + 1H + 3H + 3H) gives a total of 8 protons in the molecule.\n*   **Presence of Acetate Group:** The signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s) strongly indicates an acetate group (CH₃COO-). All four options are acetates, so this is consistent.\n*   **\"Propenyl\" vs. \"Butenyl\":**\n    *   **Propenyl acetate (C₃H₅-O-CO-CH₃):** The molecular formula is C₅H₈O₂. It has 5 protons from the propenyl group and 3 from the acetate group, totaling 8 protons. This matches the integration data.\n    *   **Butenyl acetate (C₄H₇-O-CO-CH₃):** The molecular formula is C₆H₁₀O₂. It has 7 protons from the butenyl group and 3 from the acetate group, totaling 10 protons. This does **not** match the integration data.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound must be a **propenyl acetate**. This eliminates options B (Trans-butenyl acetate) and D (Cis-butenyl acetate).\n\n**3. Distinguish between Cis and Trans Isomers**\n\nWe are left with two possibilities: Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The key to distinguishing them lies in the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinylic protons (the ones on the C=C double bond).\n\n*   **General Rule for Vinylic Coupling:**\n    *   **Trans-coupling (J_trans):** Protons are on opposite sides of the double bond. The coupling constant is typically large, ranging from **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis-coupling (J_cis):** Protons are on the same side of the double bond. The coupling constant is smaller, ranging from **6-12 Hz**.\n\n*   **Applying the Rule:**\n    *   The data provides a signal at 7.0 ppm with a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n    *   This value falls squarely in the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**4. Assemble the Full Structure and Assign the Peaks**\n\nLet's draw Trans-propenyl acetate and see if all the data fits.\n\n**Structure of Trans-propenyl acetate:**\n```\n        H(b)      O-CO-CH₃(d)\n         \\         /\n          C = C\n         /     \\\n  H₃C(c)        H(a)\n```\n\n*   **Protons H(d):** The acetate methyl group. It has no adjacent protons.\n    *   Expected: 3H, singlet (s), ~2.1 ppm.\n    *   **Matches:** `2.1 ppm (3H, s)`.\n*   **Protons H(a) and H(b):** The vinylic protons on the double bond. They are coupled to each other.\n    *   H(a) is attached to the carbon bonded to the electron-withdrawing oxygen, so it will be the most downfield (highest ppm). It is coupled to one proton, H(b), so it will be a doublet.\n    *   Expected for H(a): 1H, doublet (d), downfield.\n    *   **Matches:** `7.0 ppm (1H, d)`. The coupling constant with H(b) is J = 16.0 Hz, confirming the trans geometry.\n    *   H(b) is coupled to H(a) (1 proton, creating a doublet) and the three H(c) protons (creating a quartet). Thus, H(b) will be a doublet of quartets (dq).\n    *   Expected for H(b): 1H, doublet of quartets (dq), between H(a) and H(c).\n    *   **Matches:** `5.5 ppm (1H, dq)`.\n*   **Protons H(c):** The methyl group on the double bond. It is coupled to one proton, H(b).\n    *   Expected: 3H, doublet (d), ~1.6-1.8 ppm.\n    *   **Matches:** `1.6 ppm (3H, d)`.\n\nThe provided 1H NMR data perfectly matches the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate in every aspect: chemical shift, integration, multiplicity, and coupling constant.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nWe are given the following signals:\n*   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, which is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The signal is a singlet, meaning these protons are not adjacent to any other protons. This is typical for a methyl group attached to an atom with no hydrogens, such as the carbonyl carbon of an acetyl group (CH3-C=O).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is right in the range for an acetyl methyl group. All four choices are \"acetates,\" so this signal confirms the presence of the `CH3COO-` functional group.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This is another methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** According to the n+1 rule, this methyl group is coupled to one adjacent proton (1+1=2 lines, a doublet). This indicates a `-CH-CH3` fragment.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This shift is in the allylic region, suggesting the methyl group is attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (`C=C-CH3`).\n\n*   **Signal 3: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons.\n        *   The **quartet (q)** part of the splitting arises from being coupled to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (from signal 2). (3+1=4 lines, a quartet).\n        *   The **doublet (d)** part of the splitting arises from being coupled to one other single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This shift is in the vinylic region, meaning this proton is directly attached to a double bond carbon (`C=CH-`). This proton is part of the `-CH=CH-CH3` system.\n\n*   **Signal 4: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This proton is coupled to one adjacent proton (the one at 5.5 ppm).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is also in the vinylic region. Its high chemical shift (deshielding) suggests it is on a carbon atom directly attached to the electron-withdrawing oxygen atom of the acetate group (`=CH-O-`).\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This value is crucial for determining the geometry (stereochemistry) of the double bond. For protons on a double bond:\n        *   A **trans** arrangement (protons on opposite sides) gives a large coupling constant, typically in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n        *   A **cis** arrangement (protons on the same side) gives a smaller coupling constant, typically 6-12 Hz.\n        The observed J-value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates a **trans** double bond.\n\n**2. Assemble the Structure**\n\n*   From the integration of the signals not related to the acetate group (1H + 3H + 1H = 5H), we can deduce that the alkenyl part is a propenyl group (C3H5). This eliminates the butenyl acetate options (C and D).\n*   The signals describe a `CH3-CH=CH-` fragment attached to the acetate oxygen.\n*   The coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) between the two vinylic protons (at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm) confirms they are in a **trans** configuration.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe compound has an acetate group, a propenyl group, and the double bond has a trans geometry. Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nLet's check this against the options:\nA) Cis-propenyl acetate: Incorrect, the coupling constant would be smaller (~6-12 Hz).\nB) Trans-butenyl acetate: Incorrect, the NMR spectrum for a butenyl group would be different and the total hydrogen count for the alkenyl part doesn't match.\nC) Cis-butenyl acetate: Incorrect, for the same reasons as B and A.\nD) **Trans-propenyl acetate**: Correct. The structure matches all the provided 1H NMR data: four distinct signals with the correct integration, chemical shifts, splitting patterns, and a large coupling constant indicative of a trans double bond.\n\nThe structure of Trans-propenyl acetate and the assignment of protons is:\n\n        H (7.0 ppm, d, J=16 Hz)     H (5.5 ppm, dq)\n         \\                           /\n          C === C\n         /       \\\n      O-CO-CH3 (2.1 ppm, s)           CH3 (1.6 ppm, d)\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Data:**\n\n    1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n        *   Integration (3H) suggests a methyl group (CH3).\n        *   Multiplicity (s, singlet) means this methyl group has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n        *   Chemical shift (~2.1 ppm) is characteristic of the methyl group of an acetate ester (`-O-C(=O)-CH3`).\n        *   This strongly suggests the molecule is an acetate ester. All four options are acetate esters, so this is consistent.\n\n    2.  **Signals at 7.0, 5.5, and 1.6 ppm:**\n        *   These three signals must describe the \"alkyl\" part of the ester (the propenyl or butenyl group).\n        *   The total number of protons from the data is 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n        *   Let's check the number of protons in the proposed structures:\n            *   **Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2):** CH3(3H) + CH(1H) + CH(1H) + OCOCH3(3H) = 8 protons. This matches the data.\n            *   **Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2):** e.g., 2-butenyl acetate has 10 protons. This does not match the data.\n        *   Therefore, we can eliminate the butenyl acetate options (B and C). The compound must be either Cis- or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n    3.  **Structure of Propenyl Acetate (`CH3-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH3`):**\n        *   Let's analyze the remaining signals for the propenyl group (`CH3-CH=CH-`).\n        *   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This corresponds to the methyl group (`CH3-`) attached to the double bond. It is split into a doublet (d) because it is coupled to the adjacent vinyl proton (`-CH=`). This is a correct assignment.\n        *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This corresponds to the vinyl proton (`-CH=`) that is adjacent to the methyl group. It is split by the other vinyl proton (into a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (into a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). This is a correct assignment.\n        *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This corresponds to the vinyl proton (`=CH-`) attached directly to the electronegative oxygen atom. This explains its high chemical shift (deshielding). It is split into a doublet (d) because it is only coupled to the other vinyl proton. This is a correct assignment.\n\n*   **Determining Cis vs. Trans Stereochemistry:**\n\n    *   The stereochemistry (cis or trans) of the double bond is determined by the magnitude of the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinyl protons (`-CH=CH-`).\n    *   The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n    *   For protons on a double bond:\n        *   A **trans** arrangement leads to a large coupling constant, typically in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n        *   A **cis** arrangement leads to a smaller coupling constant, typically in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n    *   Since the observed coupling constant is 16.0 Hz, this is characteristic of a **trans** double bond.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n\n    *   The compound has an acetate group and a propenyl group, ruling out butenyl acetates.\n    *   The coupling constant of 16.0 Hz between the vinylic protons confirms a trans configuration for the double bond.\n    *   Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Total Number of Protons (Integration):**\n    First, let's sum the integration values from the 1H NMR data to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule.\n    Total Protons = 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8H.\n    The unknown compound has a total of 8 hydrogen atoms.\n\n2.  **Compare with the Molecular Formulas of the Options:**\n    *   **Propenyl acetate:** The propenyl group is C3H5 and the acetate group is C2H3O2. The molecular formula is C5H8O2. This molecule has 8 hydrogens, which matches our data.\n    *   **Butenyl acetate:** The butenyl group is C4H7 and the acetate group is C2H3O2. The molecular formula is C6H10O2. This molecule has 10 hydrogens.\n\n    Since the unknown compound has 8 hydrogens, it must be a **propenyl acetate**. We can therefore eliminate the butenyl acetate options: Cis-butenyl acetate (C) and Trans-butenyl acetate (B).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Chemical Shifts and Splitting Patterns:**\n    The remaining options are Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The structure is CH3-COO-CH=CH-CH3. Let's analyze the expected signals and compare them to the given data.\n\n    *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal is a singlet, meaning the protons are not coupled to any neighbors. It integrates to 3 protons. This is characteristic of the methyl group of an acetate (CH3-COO-). Its chemical shift is also typical for this group.\n    *   **Vinyl Group Protons (-CH=CH-):** There are two protons on the double bond.\n        *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This proton is significantly downfield (high ppm), which is consistent with the vinylic proton attached directly to the electronegative oxygen atom (CH3-COO-**CH**=). It is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to one adjacent proton, which is the other vinylic proton.\n        *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This is the other vinylic proton (=-**CH**-CH3). It's a doublet of quartets (dq) because it is split by the other vinylic proton (creating the doublet) and by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (creating the quartet).\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This is the methyl group attached to the double bond (-CH=CH-**CH3**). It is a doublet (d) because it is coupled to the single proton on the adjacent vinylic carbon.\n\n    The chemical shifts, integrations, and splitting patterns all perfectly match the structure of propenyl acetate.\n\n4.  **Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n    The key to distinguishing between the cis and trans isomers is the coupling constant (J) between the two vinylic protons. The J-value represents the magnitude of the interaction between coupled protons, and its size is highly dependent on their spatial orientation.\n    *   **Trans-coupling (J_trans):** Protons on opposite sides of a double bond have a large coupling constant, typically in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis-coupling (J_cis):** Protons on the same side of a double bond have a smaller coupling constant, typically in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\n    The data for the signal at 7.0 ppm shows a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value is large and falls squarely within the expected range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the number of protons and the detailed analysis of the NMR signals, particularly the large J-coupling constant of 16.0 Hz, the unknown compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown organic compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n**1.

All four possible options contain an acetate group, so this is consistent.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This is another methyl group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is a typical shift for an allylic or vinylic methyl group (a CH3 group attached to a C=C double bond).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** The signal is a doublet, meaning this methyl group is coupled to one adjacent proton.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This indicates a CH3-CH= fragment.\n\n*   **Signal 3: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents one proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This is in the alkene (vinyl) region, typical for a proton on a C=C double bond.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons. The \"d\" (doublet) indicates it is coupled to one proton. The \"q\" (quartet) indicates it is coupled to three equivalent protons (a methyl group).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This confirms the CH3-CH=CH- fragment. This proton is the one in the middle (=CH-), coupled to the adjacent vinyl proton (creating the doublet) and the adjacent methyl group (creating the quartet).\n\n*   **Signal 4: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal also represents one proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a vinyl proton. This strong deshielding effect is caused by an adjacent electronegative atom, in this case, the oxygen of the acetate group. So, this proton is part of a C=CH-O fragment.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** It is coupled to one adjacent proton (the one at 5.5 ppm).\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This value is crucial for determining stereochemistry. For protons across a double bond (vicinal coupling), a large coupling constant (typically 12-18 Hz) indicates a **trans** configuration. A smaller J value (6-12 Hz) would indicate a *cis* configuration.\n\n**2. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options:**\n\n*   **Fragments Identified:** We have an acetate group (CH3COO-), and a propenyl group (CH3-CH=CH-). The linkage is confirmed by the proton at 7.0 ppm being attached to the oxygen. The full structure is **CH3-CH=CH-O-COCH3**. This is named **propenyl acetate** (specifically, prop-1-en-1-yl acetate).\n*   This rules out **Cis-butenyl acetate** and **Trans-butenyl acetate**, as those molecules would contain a four-carbon butenyl group and would produce a different NMR spectrum. For instance, a butenyl group would introduce additional protons (e.g., from an ethyl group or a methylene group) that are not seen in the provided data.\n*   **Determine Stereochemistry:** The decision is now between Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The coupling constant between the two vinyl protons (the ones at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm) is given as **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value falls squarely in the range for a **trans** relationship.\n*   **Final Conclusion:** The compound has a propenyl acetate structure with a trans configuration at the double bond. Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nLet's visualize the final compound and its protons to confirm:\n\n```\n      H(c)   O\n       \\    /\n        C = C      (Trans configuration)\n       /    \\\n H(b)-C-H(d)  H(a)\n    |\n   H(b)\n```\n*   **H(a) (proton at 7.0 ppm):** Vinyl proton next to oxygen. Split into a doublet by H(d). J = 16.0 Hz (trans coupling).\n*   **H(d) (proton at 5.5 ppm):** Vinyl proton next to the methyl group. Split into a doublet by H(a) (J = 16.0 Hz) and a quartet by the three H(b) protons (J ~ 7 Hz). This makes it a doublet of quartets (dq).\n*   **H(b) (protons at 1.6 ppm):** Methyl group protons. Split into a doublet by H(d) (J ~ 7 Hz).\n*   **H(c) (protons at 2.1 ppm):** Acetate methyl group protons. No adjacent protons, so it is a singlet.\n\nThe data perfectly matches the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A signal for three equivalent protons (3H) that is a singlet (s) is characteristic of a methyl group with no adjacent protons. A chemical shift of ~2.1 ppm is very typical for an acetyl methyl group (-C(=O)CH3). This suggests the presence of an acetate group in the molecule.\n    *   **Protons on a double bond:** There are two signals in the vinylic region (chemical shifts > 4.5 ppm), which indicates the presence of a C=C double bond with protons on it.\n        *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a signal for a single proton (1H). The chemical shift of 7.0 ppm is in the downfield vinylic region, suggesting it's attached to a carbon that is also attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen (C=CH-O-). The splitting pattern is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to only one other proton. The coupling constant (J-value) of 16.0 Hz is very important. This large value is characteristic of a *trans* relationship between two protons on a double bond.\n        *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This is the other vinylic proton (1H). Its splitting pattern is a doublet of quartets (dq). This means it is coupled to one proton (giving the doublet, this would be the proton at 7.0 ppm) and to a group of three protons (giving the quartet).\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal corresponds to three equivalent protons (3H). It is a doublet (d), which means it's coupled to one adjacent proton. This is consistent with a methyl group attached to a CH group, i.e., a -CH-CH3 fragment.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Structural Fragments:**\n    *   From `2.1 ppm (3H, s)`, we have an **acetyl group**: ` -O-C(=O)CH3 `.\n    *   From the signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm, we have a disubstituted double bond ` -CH=CH- `. The J-value of 16.0 Hz tells us it has a **trans configuration**.\n    *   The `dq` splitting at 5.5 ppm and the `d` splitting at 1.6 ppm connect the second vinylic proton and the methyl group. This confirms the fragment **`CH3-CH=CH-`**.\n    *   The vinylic proton at 7.0 ppm is significantly deshielded, which is consistent with it being attached to the oxygen of the acetate group.\n\n3.  **Construct the Final Structure:**\n    *   Let's combine the fragments: `CH3-CH=CH-` and `-O-C(=O)CH3`.\n    *   The connection point is the vinylic carbon. This gives the structure: `CH3-CH=CH-O-C(=O)CH3`.\n    *   The stereochemistry is determined by the J-value. Since J = 16.0 Hz, the two vinylic protons are *trans* to each other.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) Cis-butenyl acetate & B) Trans-butenyl acetate: A butenyl group (C4) attached to an acetate would most commonly be crotyl acetate, `CH3-CH=CH-CH2-O-C(=O)CH3`. This structure contains a CH2 group, which would give a signal for 2H in the NMR spectrum. The provided data has no 2H signals, only 1H, 1H, 3H, and 3H. Thus, butenyl acetate isomers can be ruled out.\n    *   D) Cis-propenyl acetate: This structure is consistent in terms of connectivity and proton count. However, the coupling constant between cis-vinylic protons is typically in the range of 6-12 Hz, not 16.0 Hz.\n    *   C) Trans-propenyl acetate: This structure is fully consistent with all aspects of the data: the chemical shifts, the proton count for each signal, the splitting patterns (s, d, dq, d), and especially the large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) indicating a trans double bond.\n\n**Conclusion:** The provided 1H NMR data perfectly matches the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Data:**\n\n    1.  **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This value is in the vinyl proton region (protons on a C=C double bond). The high chemical shift suggests it is attached to a carbon that is also bonded to an electronegative atom, like oxygen.\n        *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents one proton.\n        *   **Splitting (d, doublet):** The signal is split into a doublet, meaning this proton is coupled to one adjacent proton.\n        *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a large coupling constant for protons across a double bond. A J-value in the range of 12-18 Hz is characteristic of a *trans* configuration between two vinyl protons. A *cis* configuration would show a smaller J-value (typically 6-12 Hz). This is the key piece of information for determining the stereochemistry.\n\n    2.  **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** Also in the vinyl proton region.\n        *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents one proton.\n        *   **Splitting (dq, doublet of quartets):** This complex splitting pattern indicates the proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons.\n            *   The \"d\" (doublet) part arises from coupling to the single proton at 7.0 ppm (with the same J = 16.0 Hz).\n            *   The \"q\" (quartet) part arises from coupling to a group of three equivalent protons (n+1=4, so n=3), which must be a methyl (-CH3) group.\n\n    3.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is typical for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group in an acetate ester (`CH3-C(=O)O-`).\n        *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three protons, consistent with a methyl group.\n        *   **Splitting (s, singlet):** The signal is a singlet, meaning these protons have no adjacent protons to couple with, which is consistent with an acetate group.\n\n    4.  **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This chemical shift is typical for an allylic methyl group (a methyl group attached to a C=C double bond).\n        *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three protons, consistent with a methyl group.\n        *   **Splitting (d, doublet):** The signal is a doublet, meaning these three protons are coupled to a single adjacent proton. This matches the \"q\" splitting seen for the proton at 5.5 ppm (which is coupled to these three methyl protons).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   The molecule contains an acetate group (`CH3COO-`) from the singlet at 2.1 ppm.\n    *   The total integration (1+1+3+3 = 8 protons) corresponds to the formula for propenyl acetate (`C5H8O2`), not butenyl acetate (`C6H10O2`, which would have 10 protons). This eliminates options A and B.\n    *   The remaining fragments are `CH=CH-CH3`.\n    *   Putting it together, the structure is `CH3-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH3`.\n    *   The final step is to determine the stereochemistry around the double bond. The large coupling constant, `J = 16.0 Hz`, between the two vinyl protons (at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm) definitively indicates a *trans* relationship.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The data corresponds to Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n    *   `trans-CH3(d)-CH(b)=CH(a)-O-C(=O)-CH3(c)`\n    *   H(a): ~7.0 ppm, doublet, coupled to H(b). Downfield due to attached oxygen.\n    *   H(b): ~5.5 ppm, doublet of quartets, coupled to H(a) and the CH3(d) group.\n    *   CH3(c): ~2.1 ppm, singlet, acetate methyl group.\n    *   CH3(d): ~1.6 ppm, doublet, coupled to H(b).\n    *   The `J = 16.0 Hz` confirms the *trans* geometry.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Protons**\n\nFirst, let's sum the integrations of the signals given in the 1H NMR data to determine the total number of protons in the molecule.\n- Signal 1: 1H\n- Signal 2: 1H\n- Signal 3: 3H\n- Signal 4: 3H\n- **Total Protons = 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 Protons**\n\nNow, let's determine the number of protons in each of the possible compounds:\n- **Propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂):** 8 protons. This matches our data.\n- **Butenyl acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂):** 10 protons. This does not match our data.\n\nBased on the proton count, we can immediately eliminate Cis-butenyl acetate (A) and Trans-butenyl acetate (B). The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze the Individual Signals**\n\nLet's look at the structure of propenyl acetate: `CH₃(a)-C(=O)-O-CH(b)=CH(c)-CH₃(d)`. There are four distinct proton environments, which corresponds to the four signals observed in the spectrum.\n\n*   **`2.1 ppm (3H, s)`:**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is typical for a methyl group adjacent to a carbonyl group (an acetyl group).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents three protons, consistent with a methyl (CH₃) group.\n    *   **Splitting (s):** A singlet indicates that these protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons.\n    *   **Assignment:** This signal corresponds to the acetyl methyl group, `CH₃(a)`.\n\n*   **The remaining signals (`7.0`, `5.5`, `1.6` ppm) must belong to the propenyl group `(-CH(b)=CH(c)-CH₃(d))`.**\n\n*   **`1.6 ppm (3H, d)`:**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region, typical for a methyl group attached to a double bond.\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a CH₃ group.\n    *   **Splitting (d):** A doublet means it is coupled to one neighboring proton.\n    *   **Assignment:** This signal is the propenyl methyl group, `CH₃(d)`, which is split into a doublet by the adjacent vinyl proton `H(c)`.\n\n*   **`7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)` and `5.5 ppm (1H, dq)`:** These two signals are for the two protons on the double bond (vinyl protons), `H(b)` and `H(c)`.\n    *   **Proton `H(b)`:** This proton (`-O-CH(b)=`) is attached to the carbon bonded to the electronegative oxygen atom, which deshields it, causing it to appear at a higher chemical shift (further downfield). It is coupled to proton `H(c)`.\n    *   **Proton `H(c)`:** This proton (`=CH(c)-CH₃`) is coupled to proton `H(b)` (making it a doublet) and to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group `CH₃(d)` (making it a quartet). The combination of these splittings results in a doublet of quartets (`dq`).\n    *   **Assignment:**\n        *   The signal at `7.0 ppm` is proton `H(b)`. It is a doublet because it's only split by `H(c)`.\n        *   The signal at `5.5 ppm` is proton `H(c)`. Its splitting is correctly described as a `dq`.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nThe key to distinguishing between the cis and trans isomers lies in the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinyl protons, `H(b)` and `H(c)`.\n*   The signal at `7.0 ppm` for `H(b)` is a doublet with a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value represents the interaction between `H(b)` and `H(c)`.\n\n*   The established rules for vinyl proton coupling are:\n    *   **Trans coupling (protons on opposite sides of the double bond):** `J_trans` is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis coupling (protons on the same side of the double bond):** `J_cis` is typically smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nThe observed coupling constant of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely in the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe 1H NMR data indicates a propenyl acetate structure with a trans geometry at the double bond. Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to identify the unknown compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nWe are given the following signals:\n*   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, which is typical for a methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon (C=O). In the given options, all are acetates, which contain the acetyl group (CH₃-C(=O)-). This signal is the acetyl methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s):** A singlet means this methyl group has no adjacent protons. This is consistent with an acetyl group, as the methyl is attached to a carbonyl carbon with no protons.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal also represents a methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** A doublet means this methyl group is coupled to one adjacent proton (according to the n+1 rule, 2 peaks means n=1 proton). This suggests a `CH-CH₃` fragment.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This shift is in the allylic region, which is typical for a methyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (`=C-CH₃`).\n\n*   **Signal 3: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents a single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This shift is in the vinylic region, meaning this proton is attached directly to a carbon-carbon double bond (`C=CH`).\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq):** A doublet of quartets means this proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   The **quartet (q)** arises from coupling to a group of 3 equivalent protons (n+1 = 4, so n=3). This corresponds to the methyl group at 1.6 ppm.\n        *   The **doublet (d)** arises from coupling to one other proton (n+1 = 2, so n=1). This must be another vinylic proton on the double bond.\n    *   This confirms the existence of a `CH=CH-CH₃` fragment, and this signal corresponds to the `CH` that is in between the other vinylic proton and the methyl group.\n\n*   **Signal 4: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents a single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is a highly deshielded vinylic proton. Such a large chemical shift for a vinylic proton indicates it is attached to a very electronegative atom, in this case, the oxygen of the acetate ester (`-O-CH=C`).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** A doublet means this proton is coupled to one adjacent proton, which is the other vinylic proton at 5.5 ppm.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the key piece of information for determining the stereochemistry (cis vs. trans).\n        *   A coupling constant (J) for **trans** protons on a double bond is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n        *   A coupling constant for **cis** protons is smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n    *   The observed value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates that the two vinylic protons are in a **trans** configuration.\n\n**2. Assemble the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis, we can assemble the fragments:\n*   We have an acetate group: `CH₃-C(=O)-O-` (from the 2.1 ppm singlet).\n*   We have a `CH=CH-CH₃` fragment (from the other three signals).\n*   The connection is through the ester oxygen to the double bond: `CH₃-C(=O)-O-CH=CH-CH₃`.\n*   The total number of carbons in the alkenyl group (the part derived from the alcohol) is 3 (`-CH=CH-CH₃`), so it is a **propenyl** group, not a butenyl group.\n*   The stereochemistry of the double bond is **trans** (from J = 16.0 Hz).\n\nPutting it all together, the structure is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   A) Trans-butenyl acetate: Incorrect. A butenyl group would have 4 carbons, which doesn't match the NMR data (we'd expect different signals, likely a `CH₂CH₃` group instead of a `CH₃` on the double bond).\n*   B) **Trans-propenyl acetate:** Correct. Matches all aspects of the NMR data: the number of signals, integration, chemical shifts, splitting patterns, and the crucial trans coupling constant.\n*   C) Cis-butenyl acetate: Incorrect. Wrong carbon count and wrong stereochemistry.\n*   D) Cis-propenyl acetate: Incorrect. A cis isomer would show a much smaller coupling constant (J ≈ 6-12 Hz).\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is in the alkene (vinylic) region, indicating a proton attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C-H). The relatively high shift (deshielded) suggests this proton is attached to a carbon that is also bonded to an electronegative atom, like oxygen.\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents one proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** The signal is split into a doublet, which means it is coupled to (i.e., adjacent to) only one other proton.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This value is crucial for determining stereochemistry. A large J-value (typically 12-18 Hz) for vinylic protons is characteristic of a **trans** relationship across the double bond.\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** Also in the vinylic region, indicating another proton on the double bond.\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents one proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This means the proton is coupled to two different sets of neighbors. The \"doublet\" part means it's coupled to one adjacent proton (this would be the proton at 7.0 ppm). The \"quartet\" part means it's coupled to three equivalent adjacent protons (typically a methyl, -CH3, group).\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of the protons of an acetyl group (CH3-C=O).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, consistent with a methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The signal is a singlet, meaning there are no protons on the adjacent atom (the carbonyl carbon). This confirms the acetate fragment: -O-C(=O)-CH3.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the alkyl/allylic region.\n    *   **Integration (3H):** The signal represents three equivalent protons, consistent with a methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** The signal is a doublet, which means this methyl group is adjacent to a carbon with a single proton (a -CH group).\n\n### **2. Assemble the Molecular Fragments**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following pieces:\n1.  An acetate group: **-O-C(=O)-CH3** (from the 3H singlet at 2.1 ppm).\n2.  A trans double bond with two protons: **-CH=CH-** (from the two vinylic signals, with J=16.0 Hz confirming *trans*).\n3.  A methyl group attached to one of the vinylic protons: **CH3-CH=** (from the 3H doublet at 1.6 ppm being coupled to the 1H vinylic proton, which must be the one showing quartet splitting at 5.5 ppm).\n\n### **3. Construct the Final Structure**\n\nLet's put the fragments together:\n\n*   The signal at 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets (dq). This proton is on the double bond (`=CH-`), is split by one other proton across the double bond (the doublet), and is split by a methyl group (the quartet). This corresponds to the **CH3-CH=** fragment.\n*   The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet. This proton is on the double bond (`=CH-`) and is only split by the other vinylic proton. This proton is also highly deshielded, indicating it's attached to the carbon bonded to the acetate's oxygen. This corresponds to the **=CH-O-** fragment.\n*   The J-value of 16.0 Hz confirms these two vinylic protons are in a *trans* configuration.\n\nCombining these pieces gives the structure of **Trans-propenyl acetate**:\n\n```\n      H(5.5 ppm)    O\n      |            //\nCH3-C ------- C-O-C-CH3(2.1 ppm)\n(1.6 ppm)    |\n             H(7.0 ppm, J=16.0 Hz)\n```\n\nThis structure is fully consistent with all the NMR data:\n*   **Trans** double bond protons with J=16.0 Hz.\n*   An **acetate methyl group** as a singlet.\n*   A **methyl group on the double bond** appearing as a doublet.\n*   The correct multiplicities for both vinylic protons.\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **A) Trans-butenyl acetate & D) Cis-butenyl acetate:** These structures would contain an ethyl group (CH3-CH2-) instead of the methyl group attached to the double bond. This would result in different signals (e.g., a triplet and a multiplet for the ethyl group), which are not present in the given spectrum. Therefore, the butenyl acetate options are incorrect.\n*   **B) Cis-propenyl acetate:** This would have a smaller coupling constant (J ≈ 6-12 Hz) between the vinylic protons. The observed J=16.0 Hz rules out this isomer.\n*   **C) Trans-propenyl acetate:** This structure and stereochemistry perfectly match the provided 1H NMR data.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Protons and Carbon Skeleton**\n\n*   First, let's sum the number of protons (the integration value) from the NMR data: 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons in total.\n*   Now, let's determine the number of protons for each possible compound:\n    *   **Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2)**: The chemical formula is C5H8O2. The number of hydrogens is 8. This matches the data.\n    *   **Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2)**: The chemical formula is C6H10O2. The number of hydrogens is 10. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound must be a propenyl acetate. This eliminates options A) Cis-butenyl acetate and D) Trans-butenyl acetate. We only need to decide between Cis-propenyl acetate (B) and Trans-propenyl acetate (C).\n\n**2. Analyze the Splitting Pattern and Coupling Constants**\n\nThe key to distinguishing between cis and trans isomers lies in the coupling constant (J value) between the protons on the double bond (vinyl protons).\n\n*   **The Data:** We have a signal at **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**.\n    *   This signal represents a single vinyl proton.\n    *   It is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to one other proton.\n    *   The coupling constant is **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n\n*   **Stereochemistry Rule:** The magnitude of the vicinal coupling constant (3JHH) for protons on a double bond is stereospecific:\n    *   **Trans protons:** Typically have a large coupling constant, J_trans ≈ 12-18 Hz.\n    *   **Cis protons:** Typically have a smaller coupling constant, J_cis ≈ 6-12 Hz.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The observed coupling constant of 16.0 Hz falls squarely in the range for a **trans** double bond. This strongly indicates the compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**3. Assign All Signals to the Trans-propenyl acetate Structure**\n\nLet's verify that all signals in the spectrum match the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**Structure: Trans-propenyl acetate**\n```\n      H(b)\n     /\nCH3(d)-C   = C - O - C(=O) - CH3(c)\n       \\   /\n        H(a)\n```\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This corresponds to proton **H(a)**. It is on the same carbon as the electron-withdrawing acetate group (-OAc), which shifts it far downfield. It is coupled only to H(b), giving a doublet with a large (trans) J value of 16.0 Hz. This assignment is a perfect match.\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This corresponds to proton **H(b)**. It is coupled to H(a) (which splits it into a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group CH3(d) (which splits it into a quartet). The resulting pattern is a doublet of quartets (dq). This is also a perfect match.\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This corresponds to the methyl group of the acetate, **CH3(c)**. These protons have no adjacent protons to couple with, so they appear as a singlet. The chemical shift of ~2.1 ppm is characteristic of an acetate methyl. This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This corresponds to the methyl group on the double bond, **CH3(d)**. It is coupled to the single adjacent proton H(b), splitting its signal into a doublet. This is a perfect match.\n\nAll pieces of the 1H NMR data are consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate. The structure of Cis-propenyl acetate is ruled out primarily by the large coupling constant of 16.0 Hz.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the total number of protons.**\n\nThe 1H NMR data provides the integration (relative number of protons) for each signal:\n*   7.0 ppm: 1H\n*   5.5 ppm: 1H\n*   2.1 ppm: 3H\n*   1.6 ppm: 3H\n\nThe total number of protons giving rise to these signals is 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = **8 protons**.\n\n### **Step 2: Compare the total proton count with the possible structures.**\n\nLet's determine the number of protons in each of the potential compounds.\n*   **Propenyl acetate:** The formula is C5H8O2. The most likely structure is `CH3-COO-CH=CH-CH3`. The number of hydrogen atoms is 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = **8H**. This matches the NMR data.\n*   **Butenyl acetate:** The formula is C6H10O2. The most likely structure is `CH3-COO-CH=CH-CH2-CH3`. The number of hydrogen atoms is 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = **10H**. This does not match the NMR data.\n\n**Conclusion from Step 2:** The total integration (8H) matches propenyl acetate but not butenyl acetate. Therefore, we can eliminate options A (Trans-butenyl acetate) and B (Cis-butenyl acetate). The unknown compound must be either Trans-propenyl acetate or Cis-propenyl acetate.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans) using the coupling constant (J).**\n\nThe choice between the cis and trans isomers depends on the coupling constant between the two protons on the double bond (the vinylic protons).\n*   The signal at 7.0 ppm is described as a doublet with a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**. This splitting is due to its interaction with the other vinylic proton (at 5.5 ppm).\n*   In 1H NMR spectroscopy, the magnitude of the vicinal coupling constant (³J_HH) across a double bond is stereochemically dependent:\n    *   **J_trans** (protons are on opposite sides of the double bond) is typically in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **J_cis** (protons are on the same side of the double bond) is typically in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n*   The observed coupling constant of **16.0 Hz** falls directly within the expected range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**Conclusion from Step 3:** The large coupling constant indicates a trans double bond. Therefore, the compound is Trans-propenyl acetate. This eliminates option D (Cis-propenyl acetate).\n\n### **Step 4: Confirm the full assignment for Trans-propenyl acetate.**\n\nLet's assign all the signals to the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate: `CH3(a)-COO-CH(b)=CH(c)-CH3(d)`\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal corresponds to the acetate methyl protons, H(a). It is a singlet (s) because it has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal corresponds to the vinylic proton H(b), which is attached to the oxygen atom, causing it to be significantly deshielded (shifted downfield). It is split into a doublet (d) by the other vinylic proton, H(c), with a large trans-coupling constant.\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal corresponds to the vinylic proton H(c). It is split by H(b) (giving a doublet, J ≈ 16 Hz) and also by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group H(d) (giving a quartet). The resulting pattern is a doublet of quartets (dq).\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal corresponds to the methyl protons H(d) attached to the double bond. They are split by the single adjacent vinylic proton H(c), resulting in a doublet (d).\n\nAll aspects of the provided 1H NMR data are consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown organic compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nLet's break down each signal provided:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates three equivalent protons, likely a methyl (CH3) group.\n    *   **Splitting (s):** A singlet means this methyl group has no adjacent protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon in an ester or ketone. Given the options, this is the acetate methyl group (CH3-C=O).\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Another methyl (CH3) group.\n    *   **Splitting (d):** A doublet means this methyl group is adjacent to a single proton (a CH group).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region, suggesting a methyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C-CH3).\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** A single proton.\n    *   **Splitting (dq):** A doublet of quartets means this proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   **Doublet (d):** Coupled to one adjacent proton.\n        *   **Quartet (q):** Coupled to three adjacent, equivalent protons (a CH3 group).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This is in the vinylic region, indicating a proton on a carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=).\n    *   Putting it together, this signal corresponds to a vinylic proton that has another vinylic proton as a neighbor (giving the doublet) and is also next to a methyl group (giving the quartet). This fits the fragment: **=CH-CH3**.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** A single proton.\n    *   **Splitting (d):** A doublet means this proton is adjacent to only one other proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is also in the vinylic region (-CH=). Its downfield position suggests it is attached to a carbon atom that is also bonded to an electronegative atom, like the oxygen from the acetate group (-O-CH=).\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This value is the most critical piece of information for determining the stereochemistry. A large vicinal coupling constant (J > 12 Hz) across a double bond is characteristic of protons that are in a **trans** configuration. A cis configuration would show a smaller J-value (typically 6-12 Hz).\n\n**2. Assemble the Structure**\n\nLet's combine the fragments we've identified:\n\n1.  From `2.1 ppm (s, 3H)`, we have an acetate group: `CH3-C(=O)-O-`\n2.  From the remaining signals, we have a `CH=CH-CH3` fragment.\n3.  Let's connect them. The `7.0 ppm` proton is on a carbon attached to the oxygen, so the structure is `CH3-C(=O)-O-CH=CH-CH3`. This is a propenyl acetate. This eliminates the \"butenyl acetate\" options.\n4.  The coupling constant `J = 16.0 Hz` between the two vinylic protons (at 7.0 and 5.5 ppm) confirms they are in a **trans** arrangement.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **A) Trans-butenyl acetate:** Incorrect. The structure is a propenyl (3-carbon) derivative, not a butenyl (4-carbon) one.\n*   **B) Cis-propenyl acetate:** Incorrect. The large coupling constant (16.0 Hz) is indicative of a trans double bond, not cis.\n*   **C) Trans-propenyl acetate:** **Correct.** All features of the 1H NMR spectrum are consistent with this structure.\n    *   Acetate CH3: Singlet at ~2.1 ppm. (Matches `2.1 (3H, s)`)\n    *   Alkene CH3: Doublet at ~1.6 ppm. (Matches `1.6 (3H, d)`)\n    *   =CH-CH3 proton: Doublet of quartets at ~5.5 ppm. (Matches `5.5 (1H, dq)`)\n    *   O-CH= proton: Doublet at ~7.0 ppm. (Matches `7.0 (1H, d)`)\n    *   Coupling constant for trans vinylic protons: ~12-18 Hz. (Matches `J = 16.0 Hz`)\n*   **D) Cis-butenyl acetate:** Incorrect. Wrong carbon chain length and wrong stereochemistry.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>.",

Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe provided data is:\n*   **Signal 1:** `2.1 ppm (3H, s)`\n*   **Signal 2:** `1.6 ppm (3H, d)`\n*   **Signal 3:** `5.5 ppm (1H, dq)`\n*   **Signal 4:** `7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)`\n\n**2. Identify the Functional Group from Signal 1**\n\n*   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is typical for protons on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **Integration (3H):** The signal represents 3 equivalent protons, characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   **Multiplicity (s - singlet):** The protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n*   **Conclusion:** A 3H singlet at ~2.1 ppm is a classic signature for an acetate group (-O-CO-CH3). All four possible options are acetates, so this is consistent.\n\n**3. Determine the Alkyl Chain (Propenyl vs. Butenyl)**\n\n*   Let's sum the total number of protons represented in the spectrum: 3H (from 2.1 ppm) + 3H (from 1.6 ppm) + 1H (from 5.5 ppm) + 1H (from 7.0 ppm) = **8 protons**.\n*   Now, let's find the total number of protons in the candidate molecules:\n    *   **Propenyl acetate (CH3COOCH=CHCH3):** The molecular formula is C5H8O2. It has **8 protons**.\n    *   **Butenyl acetate (CH3COOCH=CHCH2CH3):** The molecular formula is C6H10O2. It has **10 protons**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the NMR integration shows a total of 8 protons, the compound must be **propenyl acetate**. This eliminates options B (Trans-butenyl acetate) and C (Cis-butenyl acetate).\n\n**4. Assign the Remaining Signals to the Propenyl Group**\n\nWe are left with two possibilities: Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The structure is **CH3(a)-CH(b)=CH(c)-O-CO-CH3(d)**. We need to assign signals 2, 3, and 4 to protons a, b, and c.\n\n*   **Protons (a):** This is the methyl group on the double bond. It is coupled to one adjacent proton, H(b). Therefore, it should appear as a **doublet (d)**.\n    *   This matches **Signal 2: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**. The chemical shift around 1.6-1.8 ppm is typical for an allylic methyl group.\n\n*   **Protons (c):** This is the vinyl proton attached to the carbon that is also bonded to the oxygen atom. The electronegative oxygen atom will strongly deshield this proton, causing it to appear far downfield (at a high ppm value). It is coupled to one adjacent proton, H(b). Therefore, it should be a **doublet (d)**.\n    *   This matches **Signal 4: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**.\n\n*   **Protons (b):** This is the other vinyl proton. It is coupled to two different sets of protons: H(c) (1 proton) and the H(a) methyl group (3 protons). According to the n+1 rule, this signal should be split into a doublet by H(c) and a quartet by H(a). The resulting multiplicity is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n    *   This matches **Signal 3: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**. Its chemical shift is between the other two protons of the propenyl group, which is expected.\n\n**5. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle is to determine the geometry of the double bond. This is done by examining the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinyl protons, H(b) and H(c).\n\n*   The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value represents the interaction between H(c) and H(b).\n*   The established ranges for vinyl coupling constants are:\n    *   **Trans-coupling (³J_trans):** 12 - 18 Hz\n    *   **Cis-coupling (³J_cis):** 6 - 12 Hz\n*   The observed value of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely within the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of the number of protons, the splitting patterns, and the key coupling constant, the unknown compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Protons and Basic Groups**\n\nFirst, let's sum the integrations of all the signals to find the total number of protons in the molecule:\n1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n\nNow, let's compare this to the number of protons in the possible compounds:\n*   **Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2)**: Has 8 protons.\n*   **Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2)**: Has 10 protons.\n\nSince the NMR data indicates a total of 8 protons, we can immediately eliminate both **Cis-butenyl acetate** and **Trans-butenyl acetate**. The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Assign the Signals to Protons in the Structure**\n\nThe general structure of propenyl acetate is CH3-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH3. Let's assign each signal:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**: A singlet (s) integrating to 3 protons in this chemical shift region is characteristic of the methyl protons of an acetate group (-O-C(=O)-**CH3**). This group is not adjacent to any other protons, hence it's a singlet.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**: A doublet (d) integrating to 3 protons. This corresponds to a methyl group (**CH3**-CH=) that is coupled to a single adjacent proton. This is the methyl group attached to the double bond.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)** and **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**: These two signals correspond to the two protons on the C=C double bond (-**CH**=**CH**-).\n    *   The proton at **7.0 ppm** is significantly deshielded, which is typical for a vinyl proton attached directly to an electronegative oxygen atom (-CH=CH-**O**-). It is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to only one other proton (the other vinyl proton).\n    *   The proton at **5.5 ppm** is less deshielded. Its signal is a doublet of quartets (dq). The doublet splitting comes from coupling to the other vinyl proton (at 7.0 ppm). The quartet splitting (a 1:3:3:1 pattern) comes from coupling to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (at 1.6 ppm).\n\nThis assignment confirms the connectivity of the molecule as propenyl acetate.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nThe final step is to determine the geometry of the double bond using the coupling constant (J value). The coupling constant between the two vinyl protons is given as **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n\n*   For vicinal protons on a double bond, the coupling constant is highly dependent on their stereochemical relationship:\n    *   **Trans** protons typically have a large coupling constant, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis** protons typically have a smaller coupling constant, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nThe observed coupling constant of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely within the typical range for a **trans** configuration. This indicates that the two protons on the double bond are on opposite sides.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the total number of protons, the signal assignments, and the large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz), the unknown compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Proton Count (Integration):**\n    First, let's determine the total number of protons in the molecule from the integration values given in the 1H NMR data.\n    *   Signal 1: 1H\n    *   Signal 2: 1H\n    *   Signal 3: 3H\n    *   Signal 4: 3H\n    *   **Total Protons = 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8H**\n\n2.  **Compare Proton Count with Possible Structures:**\n    Now, let's find the number of protons in each of the proposed compounds.\n    *   **Propenyl acetate:** The propenyl group is C3H5, and the acetate group is C2H3O2. The formula is C5H8O2. It has **8 protons**. This matches our data.\n    *   **Butenyl acetate:** The butenyl group is C4H7, and the acetate group is C2H3O2. The formula is C6H10O2. It has **10 protons**. This does not match our data.\n\n    Based on the total number of protons, we can confidently eliminate both **Cis-butenyl acetate (B)** and **Trans-butenyl acetate (A)**. The correct compound must be a propenyl acetate.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Coupling Constant (J-value) to Determine Stereochemistry:**\n    We are left with two options: Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The key to distinguishing between them is the coupling constant (J) between the two protons on the double bond (vinylic protons).\n    *   The data shows a signal at **7.0 ppm** which is a doublet (**d**) with a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n    *   In 1H NMR spectroscopy, the magnitude of the coupling constant between vinylic protons is highly dependent on their geometric relationship:\n        *   **Trans-protons:** J-values are typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n        *   **Cis-protons:** J-values are smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n    *   The observed coupling constant of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely in the range for a **trans** configuration. This indicates that the two protons on the double bond are on opposite sides.\n\n    This evidence allows us to eliminate **Cis-propenyl acetate (D)**.\n\n4.  **Confirm the Structure of Trans-propenyl acetate:**\n    Let's assign all the signals to the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate to ensure a perfect match.\n    *   **Structure:**\n        ```\n          H(b)   H(a)\n           \\    /\n        CH3(c)-C==C--O--C(=O)--CH3(d)\n        ```\n    *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This is the singlet for the three equivalent protons of the acetate methyl group (**CH3(d)**). It's a singlet because there are no protons on the adjacent carbonyl carbon. This matches.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the vinylic proton **H(a)**. It is shifted far downfield because it is attached to a carbon that is bonded to a deshielding oxygen atom. It is split into a doublet by its trans-neighbor, **H(b)**. This matches perfectly.\n    *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This is the other vinylic proton, **H(b)**. It is split into a doublet by **H(a)** (with the same J=16.0 Hz coupling) and into a quartet by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group **CH3(c)**. This results in a doublet of quartets (dq). This matches.\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This is the methyl group on the double bond, **CH3(c)**. It is split into a doublet by the single adjacent proton, **H(b)**.

Analyze the Signal at 2.1 ppm:**\n*   **Chemical Shift:** 2.1 ppm\n*   **Integration:** 3H (represents 3 protons)\n*   **Multiplicity:** s (singlet)\nThis signal is characteristic of a methyl group (CH₃) attached to a carbonyl group (C=O). A singlet means these 3 protons are not coupled to any adjacent protons. This perfectly describes the acetyl group (`-OCOCH₃`) present in an acetate ester. All four possible options are acetate esters, so this signal is consistent with all of them.\n\n**2. Analyze the Remaining Signals and Determine the Carbon Chain Length:**\n*   The remaining signals are at 7.0 ppm (1H), 5.5 ppm (1H), and 1.6 ppm (3H).\n*   The total number of protons accounted for by these signals is 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 protons.\n*   Let's compare this to the non-acetate part of the options:\n    *   **Propenyl group** (`-CH=CH-CH₃`): Has 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 protons. This matches the data.\n    *   **Butenyl group** (`-CH=CH-CH₂CH₃`): Has 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7 protons. This does not match the data.\n*   Based on the total number of protons, the compound must be a **propenyl acetate**. This eliminates options A (Cis-butenyl acetate) and C (Trans-butenyl acetate).\n\n**3. Distinguish Between Cis and Trans Isomers using the Coupling Constant (J-value):**\n*   We now need to decide between Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate.\n*   The key piece of information is the coupling constant (J) for the protons on the double bond (the vinylic protons).\n*   The signal at **7.0 ppm** is a doublet with a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**. This coupling arises from the interaction between the two protons on the `C=C` double bond.\n*   There is a well-established rule for the magnitude of vinylic coupling constants:\n    *   **Trans-coupling (`J_trans`)** is typically in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis-coupling (`J_cis`)** is typically in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n*   The observed value of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely in the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**4. Final Confirmation of the Structure:**\nLet's assign all the signals to the structure of **Trans-propenyl acetate**: `CH₃(a)-CH(b)=CH(c)-OCOCH₃(d)`\n*   **Protons (d) at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):** The methyl group of the acetate. Correct.\n*   **Protons (a) at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** The methyl group attached to the double bond. It is split into a doublet (d) because it is coupled to the single adjacent proton H(b). Correct.\n*   **Proton (c) at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz):** The vinylic proton attached to the carbon bearing the oxygen atom. It is highly deshielded (higher ppm value) due to the electronegative oxygen. It is split into a doublet (d) by the other vinylic proton, H(b), with a large trans-coupling constant. Correct.\n*   **Proton (b) at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** The vinylic proton next to the methyl group. It is split by H(c) into a doublet (d) and by the three protons of the methyl group (a) into a quartet (q), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). Correct.\n\nAll the provided data is perfectly consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the given 1H NMR data:**\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates a methyl group (CH3).\n    *   **Splitting (s):** A singlet means there are no adjacent protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group in an acetate ester (CH3-C(=O)O-). This strongly suggests the presence of an acetate group in the molecule. All four options are acetate esters, so this is consistent.\n\n*   **Remaining signals: 7.0 ppm (1H), 5.5 ppm (1H), 1.6 ppm (3H).**\n    *   The total integration for these signals is 1H + 1H + 3H = 5 protons.\n    *   A propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) has 1+1+3 = 5 protons.\n    *   A butenyl group (-CH=CH-CH2-CH3) has 1+1+2+3 = 7 protons.\n    *   Since the remaining protons sum to 5, the unknown compound must have a propenyl group, not a butenyl group. This allows us to eliminate the butenyl acetate options (B and D).\n\n**2. Differentiate between Cis- and Trans-propenyl acetate:**\n\n*   We are now choosing between A) Cis-propenyl acetate and C) Trans-propenyl acetate. The key to distinguishing between cis and trans isomers is the coupling constant (J) between the two protons on the double bond (vinyl protons).\n    *   **Cis coupling (J_cis):** Typically ranges from 6 to 12 Hz.\n    *   **Trans coupling (J_trans):** Typically ranges from 12 to 18 Hz.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   This signal represents one of the vinyl protons.\n    *   It is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to only one other proton (the other vinyl proton).\n    *   The coupling constant is **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value is large and falls squarely in the range for *trans* coupling. This indicates a *trans* configuration for the double bond.\n\n**3. Confirm the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate:**\n\nLet's assign all the signals to the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate:\n**CH3(a)-C(=O)O-CH(b)=CH(c)-CH3(d)** (with H(b) and H(c) being trans)\n\n*   **Signal (a) - Acetate methyl:** No adjacent protons. This corresponds to the singlet at **2.1 ppm**. (Matches)\n*   **Signal (d) - Vinylic methyl:** This CH3 group is adjacent to one proton, H(c). It should be a doublet. This corresponds to the doublet at **1.6 ppm**. (Matches)\n*   **Signal (b) - Vinyl proton:** This proton is adjacent to the oxygen atom, which deshields it, moving it far downfield. It is coupled to one proton, H(c), in a *trans* arrangement. This corresponds to the doublet with a large J-value at **7.0 ppm (J = 16.0 Hz)**. (Matches)\n*   **Signal (c) - Vinyl proton:** This proton is coupled to H(b) (which splits it into a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (d) (which splits it into a quartet). The resulting pattern is a doublet of quartets (dq). This corresponds to the signal at **5.5 ppm (dq)**. (Matches)\n\nAll features of the 1H NMR spectrum are consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe presence of a propenyl group (eliminating B and D) and the large coupling constant of J = 16.0 Hz (indicating a *trans* double bond) definitively identifies the compound as Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the unknown compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, which is characteristic of a methyl group (CH3).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s):** A singlet indicates that these protons have no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is typical for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group, as in an acetyl group (`CH3-C(=O)-`). All four possible compounds are acetates, so they all contain this group. This signal corresponds to the acetate methyl protons.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Another methyl group (CH3).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** A doublet means this methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton (`-CH-CH3`).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This shift is in the allylic region, suggesting the methyl group is attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (`C=C-CH3`).\n\n*   **Signal 3: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** A single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This is in the vinylic region, meaning this proton is attached directly to a carbon of the double bond (`C=CH-`).\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq):** A doublet of quartets indicates this proton is coupled to two different sets of neighbors:\n        *   **Doublet (d):** Coupled to one other proton.\n        *   **Quartet (q):** Coupled to a group of three equivalent protons (a methyl group).\n    *   This proton is the one adjacent to the methyl group at 1.6 ppm (causing the quartet) and adjacent to the other vinyl proton at 7.0 ppm (causing the doublet).\n\n*   **Signal 4: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** A single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** Also in the vinylic region. This proton is significantly deshielded (further downfield), which is characteristic of a vinyl proton attached to a carbon that is also bonded to an electronegative atom like oxygen (`-O-CH=C`).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** A doublet means it's coupled to a single adjacent proton. This must be the proton at 5.5 ppm.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the most crucial piece of information for determining the stereochemistry. The coupling constant between two protons across a double bond (vicinal coupling) is highly dependent on their relative geometry.\n        *   **Trans coupling:** J is typically in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n        *   **Cis coupling:** J is typically in the range of 6-12 Hz.\n        *   A J value of 16.0 Hz is strongly indicative of a **trans** configuration.\n\n**2. Assemble the Structure**\n\n*   From the signals, we have identified the following fragments:\n    1.  An acetate group: `-O-C(=O)-CH3` (from the 2.1 ppm singlet).\n    2.  A propenyl group: `CH3-CH=CH-` (from the signals at 1.6, 5.5, and 7.0 ppm). The `CH3-` corresponds to 1.6 ppm, the `-CH=` next to it corresponds to 5.5 ppm, and the final `-CH=` corresponds to 7.0 ppm.\n*   The presence of a propenyl group eliminates the butenyl acetate options (Cis-butenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate). The choice is now between Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate.\n*   The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) between the two vinyl protons (at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm) confirms that they are in a **trans** orientation.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe molecule is an acetate. The alkyl group is a propenyl group. The stereochemistry of the double bond is trans. Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nLet's visualize the structure and confirm the assignments:\n\n```\n      H(a)\n       \\\n        C=C\n       /   \\\nH3C(c)-   O-C(=O)-CH3(d)\n       /\n     H(b)\n\n```\n\n*   **H(d) (2.1 ppm, s, 3H):** Acetate methyl group.\n*   **H(c) (1.6 ppm, d, 3H):** Propenyl methyl group, coupled to H(b).\n*   **H(b) (5.5 ppm, dq, 1H):** Vinyl proton coupled to H(a) (trans) and H(c).\n*   **H(a) (7.0 ppm, d, 1H, J=16.0 Hz):** Deshielded vinyl proton coupled to H(b) with a large trans coupling constant.\n\nThe data perfectly matches the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n*   **Analysis of 1H NMR Data**\n\n1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is characteristic of protons on a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon (C=O).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, consistent with a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   **Splitting (s):** A singlet indicates that these protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal strongly indicates the presence of an acetyl group (CH3-C(=O)-). Since the compound is an acetate, this is the `CH3-C(=O)-O-` part of the molecule.\n\n2.  **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region, suggesting a methyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   **Splitting (d):** A doublet means this methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton. This suggests a `-CH-CH3` fragment where the CH is part of the double bond.\n\n3.  **Signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm:**\n    *   These signals are in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). They represent the two protons on the double bond, let's call them Ha and Hb.\n    *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n        *   This is one of the vinylic protons (Ha).\n        *   It is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to one other proton (Hb).\n        *   The coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz** is very important. Coupling constants between vinylic protons are stereochemically dependent. A large J-value (typically 14-18 Hz) is characteristic of a **trans** relationship. A smaller J-value (typically 6-12 Hz) indicates a *cis* relationship. The value of 16.0 Hz clearly points to a *trans* double bond.\n        *   The high chemical shift (7.0 ppm) suggests this proton is attached to a carbon that is also bonded to the electronegative oxygen atom of the acetate group (`-O-CH=`), which deshields the proton.\n    *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n        *   This is the other vinylic proton (Hb).\n        *   The splitting pattern is a doublet of quartets (dq). This means it is coupled to two different sets of protons.\n            *   The **doublet (d)** part arises from coupling to the other vinylic proton (Ha). The J-value for this coupling would be 16.0 Hz.\n            *   The **quartet (q)** part arises from coupling to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (the one seen at 1.6 ppm).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure**\n\n1.  We have an acetate group: `CH3-C(=O)-O-` (from the 2.1 ppm signal).\n2.  We have a propenyl group: `-CH=CH-CH3` (from the signals at 7.0, 5.5, and 1.6 ppm).\n3.  The `J = 16.0 Hz` value confirms the double bond has **trans** stereochemistry.\n4.  Putting the pieces together: The acetate group connects to the propenyl group to form `CH3-C(=O)-O-CH=CH-CH3`.\n5.  This structure is **Trans-propenyl acetate**. Let's verify it against the data:\n    *   `CH3(acetyl)-C(=O)-O-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH3(c)`\n    *   `CH3(acetyl)`: Singlet at ~2.1 ppm. (Matches `2.1 (3H, s)`)\n    *   `H(a)`: Vinylic H next to oxygen. Coupled to H(b). Expected to be a doublet and downfield. (Matches `7.0 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)`)\n    *   `H(b)`: Vinylic H next to methyl group. Coupled to H(a) (doublet) and CH3(c) (quartet) -> dq. (Matches `5.5 (1H, dq)`)\n    *   `CH3(c)`: Allylic methyl. Coupled to H(b). Expected to be a doublet. (Matches `1.6 (3H, d)`)\n\n*   **Eliminating Other Options**\n\n*   **Cis-propenyl acetate:** Would show a much smaller J-coupling constant (~6-12 Hz) between the vinylic protons.\n*   **Cis- and Trans-butenyl acetate:** These molecules have the formula C6H10O2, meaning they have 10 protons. The NMR data integration (1+1+3+3) sums to 8 protons. Therefore, the butenyl acetates are incorrect.\n\nThe data is a perfect match for Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Total Number of Protons (Integration)**\n\n*   The problem provides signals with the following integrations: 1H, 1H, 3H, and 3H.\n*   Summing these up gives a total of 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 protons in the molecule.\n*   Now let's determine the total number of protons for each of the possible compounds:\n    *   **Propenyl acetate (CH₃COOCH=CHCH₃)**: The acetate part (CH₃CO) has 3 protons. The propenyl part (C₃H₅) has 5 protons. Total = 3 + 5 = 8 protons.\n    *   **Butenyl acetate (CH₃COOCH=CHCH₂CH₃)**: The acetate part (CH₃CO) has 3 protons. The butenyl part (C₄H₇) has 7 protons. Total = 3 + 7 = 10 protons.\n*   Since the NMR data shows a total of 8 protons, we can confidently eliminate both Cis-butenyl acetate (A) and Trans-butenyl acetate (B). The unknown compound must be a propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze Individual Signals**\n\nWe are left with two possibilities: Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. Let's analyze the chemical shifts, splitting patterns (multiplicity), and coupling constants (J) to distinguish between them.\n\nThe general structure is CH₃(a)-COO-CH(b)=CH(c)-CH₃(d).\n\n*   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This corresponds to a methyl (CH₃) group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (C=O), as found in an acetate.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** This indicates that these three protons have no adjacent non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Assignment:** This signal is definitively from the acetate methyl group, CH₃(a). This is consistent with both remaining options.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** A single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is in the alkene (vinylic) region. The downfield shift is due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent electronegative oxygen atom. This proton is CH(b).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This proton is coupled to one other proton, which must be the other vinylic proton, CH(c).\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the most critical piece of information for determining stereochemistry. The coupling constant between two protons across a double bond is highly dependent on their geometry:\n        *   **Trans coupling:** J = 12-18 Hz (protons on opposite sides)\n        *   **Cis coupling:** J = 6-12 Hz (protons on the same side)\n    *   A J value of 16.0 Hz falls squarely in the *trans* range. This strongly indicates that the two vinylic protons, H(b) and H(c), are in a trans configuration.\n\n*   **Signal 3: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** A single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** Also in the vinylic region. This is the other vinylic proton, CH(c).\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This means the proton is split by two different sets of neighboring protons.\n        *   The **doublet (d)** comes from coupling to the single proton H(b). The coupling constant for this interaction would be 16.0 Hz.\n        *   The **quartet (q)** comes from coupling to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group, CH₃(d) (since n+1=4, n=3).\n\n*   **Signal 4: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** A methyl group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is a typical value for an allylic methyl group (a methyl group attached to a double bond). This is CH₃(d).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This indicates the methyl group is coupled to one adjacent proton, which is H(c).\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis of all signals is perfectly consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate. The key piece of evidence is the large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) between the vinylic protons, which is characteristic of a *trans* double bond. If the compound were Cis-propenyl acetate, this coupling constant would be significantly smaller (around 6-12 Hz).\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Proton Count and Chemical Formula:**\n*   First, let's sum the integrations of the signals: 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons in total.\n*   Now, let's determine the number of protons in each of the possible options:\n    *   **Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2)**: The structure is CH3-COO-CH=CH-CH3. The total number of protons is 3 (from the acetate CH3) + 1 (vinylic H) + 1 (vinylic H) + 3 (from the propenyl CH3) = 8 protons. This matches the data.\n    *   **Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2)**: The structure would be CH3-COO-CH=CH-CH2-CH3. The total number of protons is 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 10 protons. This does not match the data.\n*   **Conclusion**: Based on the total proton count, we can immediately eliminate both \"butenyl acetate\" options (C and D). The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze the Signals and their Multiplicities:**\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**: A singlet (s) for 3 protons at ~2.1 ppm is highly characteristic of the methyl group in an acetate functional group (CH3-COO-). Both remaining options, Cis- and Trans-propenyl acetate, contain this group.\n\n*   **The Vinylic Protons and J-Coupling:** We have two signals in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond):\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   These two protons are on the double bond and are coupled to each other. The key piece of information here is the coupling constant, **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n    *   The magnitude of the coupling constant between two vinylic protons is stereochemically dependent:\n        *   **Trans** coupling (protons on opposite sides of the double bond) typically ranges from **12-18 Hz**.\n        *   **Cis** coupling (protons on the same side of the double bond) typically ranges from **6-12 Hz**.\n    *   The observed J-value of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely in the range for *trans* coupling. This strongly indicates a *trans* configuration for the double bond.\n\n*   **Assembling the Rest of the Molecule:**\n    *   The signal at **7.0 ppm** is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to only one other proton (the one at 5.5 ppm). This proton is the most deshielded because it is on the same carbon as the electronegative oxygen atom of the ester group (-O-CH=).\n    *   The signal at **5.5 ppm** is a doublet of quartets (dq). The doublet (d) is due to coupling with the trans proton at 7.0 ppm. The quartet (q) must be due to coupling with a neighboring group of three protons (a CH3 group).\n    *   The signal at **1.6 ppm (3H, d)** confirms this. It's a methyl group (3H) that is split into a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to a single proton. This is the vinylic proton at 5.5 ppm.\n\n**3. Final Identification:**\n*   The molecule has an acetate group.\n*   It has a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n*   The two protons on the double bond are in a *trans* configuration (J = 16.0 Hz).\n\nPutting it all together, the structure is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nLet's check this against the options:\nA) Cis-propenyl acetate: Incorrect, would have a smaller J-coupling constant.\nB) Trans-propenyl acetate: Correct, matches all aspects of the NMR data (proton count, chemical shifts, multiplicities, and coupling constant).\nC) Trans-butenyl acetate: Incorrect, has the wrong number of protons.\nD) Cis-butenyl acetate: Incorrect, has the wrong number of protons and would have a smaller J-coupling.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n\n    1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is characteristic of protons on a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon (C=O).\n        *   **Integration (3H):** The signal represents three equivalent protons, consistent with a methyl group (-CH₃).\n        *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The signal is a singlet, meaning these protons are not coupled to any adjacent protons.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This signal strongly indicates the presence of an acetyl group (CH₃-C(=O)-). All four given options contain an acetate group (CH₃COO-), so this is consistent.\n\n    2.  **Signals in the Alkene Region (7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm):**\n        *   These two signals are in the chemical shift range for protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (vinyl protons). The presence of two such signals, each with an integration of 1H, indicates a -CH=CH- fragment.\n\n    3.  **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n        *   **Integration (1H):** This signal corresponds to one vinyl proton.\n        *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This proton is coupled to one neighboring proton.\n        *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** The magnitude of the coupling constant is crucial for determining stereochemistry. A J value of ~12-18 Hz for vinyl protons is characteristic of a *trans* configuration. A *cis* configuration would show a smaller J value (typically 6-12 Hz).\n        *   **Conclusion:** This signal represents one of the vinyl protons in a *trans* double bond.\n\n    4.  **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n        *   **Integration (1H):** This is the second vinyl proton.\n        *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons.\n            *   The **doublet (d)** splitting comes from coupling to the other vinyl proton (the one at 7.0 ppm). The coupling constant for this interaction must be 16.0 Hz.\n            *   The **quartet (q)** splitting means this proton is also coupled to a group of three equivalent protons (a methyl group).\n\n    5.  **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region, typical for a methyl group attached to a double bond.\n        *   **Integration (3H):** This represents a methyl group.\n        *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton. This confirms the 'quartet' splitting seen for the proton at 5.5 ppm.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have an acetate group: `CH₃COO-`.\n    *   We have a `trans`-substituted double bond with two protons: `-CH=CH-`.\n    *   One of the vinyl carbons is attached to a methyl group: `-CH=CH-CH₃`.\n    *   The coupling pattern confirms this arrangement. The proton at 5.5 ppm is the one adjacent to the methyl group (`=CH-CH₃`), which causes its signal to be a doublet of quartets. The methyl group itself is split into a doublet by this proton. The other vinyl proton (at 7.0 ppm) is only coupled to the first vinyl proton, resulting in a simple doublet.\n    *   The full structure is `CH₃COO-CH=CH-CH₃`, where the double bond has a *trans* geometry.\n    *   This compound is named **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) Cis-propenyl acetate: Incorrect. The J-coupling constant (16.0 Hz) indicates a trans, not cis, configuration.\n    *   B) Trans-butenyl acetate: Incorrect. A butenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₂CH₃`) would show signals for an ethyl group, not a single methyl group attached directly to the double bond. The splitting pattern would be much more complex.\n    *   C) Trans-propenyl acetate: Correct. This structure perfectly matches all aspects of the provided 1H NMR data: the acetyl singlet, the two trans-coupled vinyl protons, the methyl group on the double bond, and all corresponding splitting patterns and integrations.\n    *   D) Cis-butenyl acetate: Incorrect. This is wrong on both the stereochemistry (cis) and the carbon chain length (butenyl).\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown organic compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Signals:**\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates a methyl group (CH3).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s - singlet):** Means this methyl group has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (an acetyl group, CH3-C=O). All four possible compounds are acetates, so this signal is consistent with the acetate methyl group.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates another methyl group (CH3).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d - doublet):** Means this methyl group is adjacent to a single proton (-CH).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is a typical shift for an allylic methyl group (a methyl group attached to a C=C double bond).\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Indicates a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq - doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to one other proton (giving the doublet) and to a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet). This matches a vinyl proton (-CH=) that is next to another vinyl proton and a methyl group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This is in the vinyl proton region (protons on a C=C double bond).\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Indicates a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d - doublet):** This proton is coupled to one other proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is also in the vinyl proton region. The high value (deshielding) is due to the adjacent electronegative oxygen atom from the acetate group (-O-CH=).\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This value is crucial for determining the stereochemistry.\n\n**2. Determine the Carbon Skeleton (Propenyl vs. Butenyl):**\n\n*   Let's sum the protons from the integration data: 3H (acetate) + 3H (methyl) + 1H (vinyl) + 1H (vinyl) = 8 protons in total.\n*   **Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2):** The formula corresponds to 8 hydrogen atoms. The propenyl group is -CH=CH-CH3. This fits our analysis: an acetate group, a vinyl proton coupled to another vinyl proton and a methyl group, another vinyl proton, and a methyl group coupled to a vinyl proton.\n*   **Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2):** The formula corresponds to 10 hydrogen atoms. This does not match the integration data.\n\nTherefore, the compound must be a propenyl acetate. This eliminates options B) Cis-butenyl acetate and D) Trans-butenyl acetate.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n\nThe distinction between cis and trans isomers is made by looking at the coupling constant (J-value) between the two protons on the double bond.\n\n*   For **trans** isomers, the protons are on opposite sides of the double bond, and their coupling constant (³J_HH) is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n*   For **cis** isomers, the protons are on the same side of the double bond, and their coupling constant (³J_HH) is smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nThe provided data shows a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz** for the signal at 7.0 ppm, which arises from the coupling between the two vinyl protons. This large value falls squarely within the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe data corresponds to a molecule with an acetate group and a trans-propenyl group. The compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** Acetate CH3\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz):** H on the double bond next to the Oxygen, trans to the other vinyl H.\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** H on the double bond next to the methyl group.\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** CH3 on the double bond.\n\nAll data points are consistent with this structure.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the given 1H NMR data:**\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal represents 3 protons that are a singlet (s). A singlet means these protons have no adjacent non-equivalent protons. A chemical shift of ~2.1 ppm is characteristic of a methyl group (CH3) attached to a carbonyl group (C=O), which is an acetyl group (`CH3CO-`). All four potential compounds are acetates, so they all contain this group.\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal represents 3 protons that are a doublet (d). A doublet means these protons are adjacent to a single proton (-CH). This signal is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a double bond (`CH3-CH=`).\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal represents 1 proton that is a doublet of quartets (dq). This means the proton is coupled to one adjacent proton (giving the doublet) and three other adjacent protons (giving the quartet). This is consistent with the proton (`-CH=`) that is adjacent to both another proton on the double bond and the methyl group we identified at 1.6 ppm.\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal represents 1 proton that is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to one other proton. The chemical shift is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). The most critical piece of information here is the coupling constant, **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n\n**2. Interpret the Coupling Constant (J-value):**\nFor protons on a double bond, the magnitude of the coupling constant (J) reveals their stereochemical relationship:\n*   **trans-coupling:** J is typically in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n*   **cis-coupling:** J is typically in the range of 6-12 Hz.\n\nThe observed coupling constant of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely in the range for a **trans** configuration. This allows us to eliminate the *cis* isomers.\n*   **Eliminated:** B) Cis-propenyl acetate and C) Cis-butenyl acetate.\n\n**3. Differentiate between Propenyl and Butenyl Structures:**\nWe are left with Trans-propenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate. Let's analyze the expected number of protons and signals.\n\n*   **Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2):** The formula is `CH3-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3`. This molecule has 3+1+1+3 = **8 protons**. The integration in the NMR data is 3H + 3H + 1H + 1H = **8H**. This matches.\n*   **Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2):** The formula would be something like `CH3-CH2-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3` or an isomer. This molecule has **10 protons**. The NMR data only accounts for 8 protons. Therefore, the compound cannot be butenyl acetate.\n*   **Eliminated:** D) Trans-butenyl acetate.\n\n**4. Confirm the Structure of Trans-propenyl acetate:**\nLet's assign the signals to the protons in Trans-propenyl acetate.\nStructure: `trans-CH3(c)-CH(b)=CH(a)-O-C(=O)-CH3(d)`\n\n*   **H(d):** The acetyl methyl group. No adjacent protons. This corresponds to the **2.1 ppm (3H, s)** signal.\n*   **H(c):** The methyl group on the double bond. It's adjacent to one proton, H(b). This corresponds to the **1.6 ppm (3H, d)** signal.\n*   **H(b):** The vinylic proton adjacent to both H(a) and H(c). It's split into a doublet by H(a) and a quartet by the three H(c) protons. This corresponds to the **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)** signal.\n*   **H(a):** The vinylic proton attached to the oxygen atom. It is highly deshielded by the electronegative oxygen, shifting it far downfield. It is coupled only to H(b). This corresponds to the **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz)** signal.\n\nAll pieces of the 1H NMR data perfectly match the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown organic compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n        *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons.\n        *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** A chemical shift around 2.0-2.2 ppm is characteristic of a methyl group (CH₃) attached to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n        *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** This indicates that these three protons have no adjacent non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This signal is highly indicative of an acetate group (CH₃-COO-). All four possible options contain an acetate group, so this is consistent.\n\n    *   **Analyze the remaining signals:** The other signals at 7.0 ppm, 5.5 ppm, and 1.6 ppm must describe the rest of the molecule (the \"propenyl\" or \"butenyl\" part).\n\n2.  **Determine the Number of Protons in the Alkene Chain:**\n    *   Let's sum the integration of the remaining signals: 1H (at 7.0 ppm) + 1H (at 5.5 ppm) + 3H (at 1.6 ppm) = 5 protons.\n    *   This means the alkyl/alkenyl group attached to the acetate oxygen has a total of 5 protons.\n\n3.  **Eliminate Incorrect Structures based on Proton Count:**\n    *   **Propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃):** This group has 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 protons. This matches our data.\n    *   **Butenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₂-CH₃):** This group has 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7 protons. This does not match our data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The unknown compound must be a propenyl acetate, not a butenyl acetate. This eliminates options B) Cis-butenyl acetate and D) Trans-butenyl acetate.\n\n4.  **Distinguish Between Cis and Trans Isomers:**\n    *   We are left with two possibilities: Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate.\n    *   The key to distinguishing between cis and trans isomers on a double bond is the coupling constant (J-value) between the vinylic protons (the H atoms on the C=C bond).\n    *   The general rules for vinylic coupling constants are:\n        *   **J_trans ≈ 12-18 Hz** (for protons in a trans relationship)\n        *   **J_cis ≈ 6-12 Hz** (for protons in a cis relationship)\n    *   Let's look at the signals corresponding to the vinylic protons: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz) and 5.5 ppm (1H, dq). These two protons are coupled to each other.\n    *   The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n    *   This value (16.0 Hz) falls squarely within the typical range for a trans coupling.\n\n5.  **Final Assignment and Confirmation:**\n    *   The structure is **Trans-propenyl acetate**. Let's confirm that all signals match this structure.\n        *   **Structure:** CH₃(a)-COO-CH(b)=CH(c)-CH₃(d) (with H(b) and H(c) in a trans configuration).\n        *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** Corresponds to the acetate methyl protons (a).\n        *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** Corresponds to the terminal methyl protons (d), which are split into a doublet by the adjacent vinylic proton (c).\n        *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** Corresponds to the vinylic proton (c). It is split into a quartet by the three methyl protons (d) and further split into a doublet by the trans vinylic proton (b), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq).\n        *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** Corresponds to the vinylic proton (b), which is attached to the electronegative oxygen atom, making it the most deshielded (highest ppm). It is split into a doublet by the adjacent vinylic proton (c) with a large trans coupling constant of 16.0 Hz.\n\nAll parts of the 1H NMR spectrum are consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Protons and Basic Groups**\n\n*   First, let's sum the number of protons (the 'H' value in each signal description): 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons in total.\n*   Let's check the proton count for the options:\n    *   Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2): Has 8 protons. This matches.\n    *   Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2): Has 10 protons. This does not match.\n*   This initial analysis immediately rules out both Cis-butenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate, as they have the wrong number of protons. The compound must be a propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze Individual Signals for Propenyl Acetate**\n\nNow we need to distinguish between the *cis* and *trans* isomers of propenyl acetate. The structure is CH3-C(=O)-O-CH=CH-CH3.\n\n*   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents 3 protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This is a typical chemical shift for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon in an acetate group (CH3-COO-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** Indicates these protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with. This fits the acetate methyl group. This signal is present in both cis and trans isomers.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents 3 protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region, characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-**CH3**).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** Indicates this methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton. This matches the structure, as it's coupled to the neighboring vinyl proton.\n\n*   **Signal 3 & 4: The Vinylic Protons and Stereochemistry**\n    We have two signals left for the two protons on the double bond (O-CH=CH-CH3).\n    *   **Signal 3: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n        *   **Integration (1H):** One proton.\n        *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is in the vinylic region (C=C-H). The high value is due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent oxygen atom (O-**CH**=CH-).\n        *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This proton is coupled to only one other proton, which is the other vinylic proton.\n        *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the most crucial piece of information. The magnitude of the coupling constant (J) between two protons on a double bond reveals their stereochemistry.\n            *   **Trans coupling (protons on opposite sides): J is typically large, in the range of 12-18 Hz.**\n            *   **Cis coupling (protons on the same side): J is typically smaller, in the range of 6-12 Hz.**\n        *   A J-value of **16.0 Hz** strongly indicates a **trans** configuration.\n\n    *   **Signal 4: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n        *   **Integration (1H):** One proton.\n        *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** The other vinylic proton (O-CH=**CH**-CH3).\n        *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This means the proton is split by two different sets of neighbors. It is split into a **doublet** by the other single vinylic proton (at 7.0 ppm), and it is further split into a **quartet** by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (at 1.6 ppm). This splitting pattern perfectly matches the structure.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe number of protons (8H) indicates the compound is a propenyl acetate. The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) between the two vinylic protons is definitive evidence for a *trans* arrangement across the double bond. All other signals (chemical shifts, integrations, and multiplicities) are fully consistent with the structure of trans-propenyl acetate.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Total Number of Protons and Functional Groups**\n\n*   **Integration:** The sum of the integrations for the given signals is 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n*   **Molecular Formulas:**\n    *   Propenyl acetate (Cis or Trans) has the formula C5H8O2, which contains 8 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Butenyl acetate (Cis or Trans) has the formula C6H10O2, which contains 10 hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the total number of protons is 8, the unknown compound must be a propenyl acetate. This eliminates options B (Trans-butenyl acetate) and C (Cis-butenyl acetate).\n\n**2. Analyze Individual Signals**\n\nWe are now left with two possibilities: Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. Let's analyze the signals in detail.\n\n*   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl (CH3) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** Indicates this methyl group has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~2.1 ppm):** This is the typical region for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl in an acetate functional group (CH3-COO-).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal confirms the presence of the acetate group in the molecule.\n\n*   **Remaining Signals for the Propenyl Group (CH3-CH=CH-):**\n    The remaining signals at 7.0 ppm (1H), 5.5 ppm (1H), and 1.6 ppm (3H) must correspond to the three distinct proton environments in the propenyl group. Let's label the protons: CH3(c)-CH(b)=CH(a)-.\n    *   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This corresponds to the methyl group protons, H(c). They are split by the adjacent vinylic proton H(b), resulting in a doublet (d). The chemical shift is appropriate for an allylic methyl group.\n    *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This corresponds to the vinylic proton H(b). It is split into a doublet by H(a) and into a quartet by the three H(c) protons, resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq).\n    *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This corresponds to the vinylic proton H(a). It is the most deshielded proton because it's on a carbon atom bonded to the electronegative oxygen of the acetate group. It is split into a doublet by H(b).\n\n**3. Distinguish Between Cis and Trans Isomers**\n\nThe key to distinguishing between the cis and trans isomers is the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinylic protons, H(a) and H(b).\n\n*   **Trans Isomers:** The coupling constant for two protons in a *trans* configuration across a double bond (³J_trans) is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n*   **Cis Isomers:** The coupling constant for two protons in a *cis* configuration (³J_cis) is smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nThe problem states that the signal at 7.0 ppm has a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value falls squarely within the range for a *trans* coupling.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe integration data rules out the butenyl acetate options. The large coupling constant (16.0 Hz) between the vinylic protons is characteristic of a trans double bond. Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data:**\n\n*   **Signal 1: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This value is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). The high value (downfield shift) suggests the proton is attached to a carbon that is also bonded to an electronegative atom, like oxygen.\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal corresponds to a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** The signal is split into a doublet, which means this proton is coupled to (is adjacent to) one other non-equivalent proton.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a crucial piece of information. For protons across a double bond (vinylic coupling), a large J value (typically 12-18 Hz) is characteristic of a *trans* stereochemical relationship. A *cis* relationship would show a smaller J value (typically 6-12 Hz). This strongly indicates a *trans* double bond.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This is also in the vinylic region, representing the other proton on the double bond.\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal corresponds to one proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to two different groups of protons.\n        *   The **doublet (d)** splitting is due to coupling with the other vinylic proton at 7.0 ppm.\n        *   The **quartet (q)** splitting means it is also coupled to a group of three equivalent protons, which must be a methyl (-CH3) group.\n\n*   **Signal 3: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is very characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon of an acetate group (CH3-C(=O)-O-).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** The signal represents three protons, consistent with a methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The signal is a singlet, meaning this methyl group has no adjacent protons to couple with. This fits the acetate structure, as the carbonyl carbon has no protons.\n\n*   **Signal 4: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region (protons on a carbon adjacent to a C=C double bond).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three protons, another methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This methyl group is coupled to a single proton. This confirms the observation from the signal at 5.5 ppm, which was a quartet due to coupling with this methyl group.\n\n**2. Assemble the Molecular Structure:**\n\n*   From the signal at 2.1 ppm, we identify an **acetate group**: CH3-C(=O)O-\n*   From the signals at 7.0 ppm, 5.5 ppm, and 1.6 ppm, we can deduce the rest of the molecule. We have a double bond with two protons and an adjacent methyl group. The structure fragment is **-CH=CH-CH3**.\n*   The J value of 16.0 Hz tells us the two protons on the double bond are **trans** to each other.\n*   The proton at 7.0 ppm is only a doublet, so it's only coupled to the other vinylic proton. Its high chemical shift means it's attached to the oxygen of the acetate group.\n*   The proton at 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets, meaning it's coupled to the other vinylic proton and the adjacent methyl group.\n\nCombining these pieces gives the following structure:\n\n```\n      O\n     //\nCH3--C\n     \\\n      O         H\n       \\       /\n        C == C\n       /       \\\n      H         CH3\n```\nThis structure is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Given Options:**\n\n*   **A) Trans-propenyl acetate:** This matches our deduced structure perfectly. The name indicates a three-carbon \"propenyl\" group, an \"acetate\" group, and a \"trans\" configuration, all of which are supported by the NMR data.\n*   **B) Cis-butenyl acetate:** \"Cis\" is incorrect due to the large J value. \"Butenyl\" (4-carbon chain) is incorrect as the proton count and splitting pattern do not match a butenyl group.\n*   **C) Trans-butenyl acetate:** \"Butenyl\" is incorrect.\n*   **D) Cis-propenyl acetate:** \"Cis\" is incorrect due to the large J value (16.0 Hz).\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nWe are given the following signals:\n*   **Signal 1:** 2.1 ppm (3H, s)\n*   **Signal 2:** 1.6 ppm (3H, d)\n*   **Signal 3:** 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)\n*   **Signal 4:** 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)\n\nLet's interpret each signal to build the structure piece by piece.\n\n*   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, which is characteristic of a methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** A singlet means there are no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is typical for an acetyl methyl group (CH₃-C=O). All four possible compounds are acetates, so they all contain this group. This signal is consistent with all options.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This is another methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** A doublet means this methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton. This suggests a `CH₃-CH-` fragment.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~1.6 ppm):** This shift is common for a methyl group attached to a C=C double bond (a vinylic methyl group).\n\n*   **Signal 3 & 4: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) and 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Integration (1H each):** These signals each represent a single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5-7 ppm):** This region is characteristic of protons on a C=C double bond (vinylic protons). The presence of two such signals indicates a disubstituted double bond of the type `-CH=CH-`.\n    *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This vinylic proton is a doublet, meaning it's coupled to only one other proton (the one at 5.5 ppm). The key piece of information is the coupling constant, **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n    *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This vinylic proton is a doublet of quartets.\n        *   The **doublet** part arises from coupling to the other vinylic proton (at 7.0 ppm).\n        *   The **quartet** part arises from coupling to three adjacent protons, which must be the methyl group we identified at 1.6 ppm.\n\n### **2. Assemble the Pieces**\n\nBased on the fragments identified:\n*   We have an acetyl group: `CH₃-C(=O)-O-`\n*   We have a `-CH=CH-` group.\n*   We have a `CH₃-` group attached to the double bond.\n\nPutting these together gives the structure of **propenyl acetate**: `CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n\n### **3. Rule out Butenyl Acetate**\n\nLet's check the total number of protons.\n*   The NMR data shows a total integration of 3H + 3H + 1H + 1H = **8 protons**.\n*   The molecular formula for propenyl acetate is C₅H₈O₂ (8 protons). This matches.\n*   The molecular formula for butenyl acetate is C₆H₁₀O₂ (10 protons). This does not match.\n\nTherefore, we can confidently eliminate both **Cis-butenyl acetate** and **Trans-butenyl acetate**.\n\n### **4. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nThe choice is now between Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The deciding factor is the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinylic protons.\n\n*   The signal at 7.0 ppm shows a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   **Rule of thumb for vinylic coupling:**\n    *   *trans*-coupling (protons on opposite sides of the C=C bond) has a large J-value, typically in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   *cis*-coupling (protons on the same side of the C=C bond) has a smaller J-value, typically in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nSince the observed J-value is 16.0 Hz, it falls squarely in the *trans* range. This indicates that the two protons on the double bond are in a **trans** configuration.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe data corresponds to a propenyl acetate with a trans double bond. The unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nLet's verify the full assignment for Trans-propenyl acetate:\n```\n      H(c)   H(b)\n       \\    /\n        C = C\n       /    \\\nCH₃(d)-C      O-C(=O)-CH₃(a)\n```\n*   **H(a) at 2.1 ppm (s):** Acetyl methyl. Correct.\n*   **H(b) at 7.0 ppm (d):** Vinylic proton next to the deshielding oxygen atom. Coupled to H(c) with a large trans-coupling constant (J=16.0 Hz). Correct.\n*   **H(c) at 5.5 ppm (dq):** Vinylic proton coupled to H(b) (doublet) and the three H(d) protons (quartet). Correct.\n*   **H(d) at 1.6 ppm (d):** Methyl group on the double bond, coupled to the single proton H(c). Correct.\n\nThe data is a perfect match for Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown organic compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe provided data is:\n*   **Signal 1:** 2.1 ppm (3H, s)\n*   **Signal 2:** 1.6 ppm (3H, d)\n*   **Signal 3:** 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)\n*   **Signal 4:** 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)\n\n**2. Interpret Each Signal**\n\n*   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, which is characteristic of a methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is typical for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (C=O), such as in an acetate (CH₃COO-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s - singlet):** The singlet indicates that these protons are not coupled to any neighboring protons.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal confirms the presence of an acetate group in the molecule. All four possible answers are acetates, so this is consistent.\n\n*   **Analyze the Remaining Protons**\n    *   The remaining signals at 1.6 ppm, 5.5 ppm, and 7.0 ppm account for 3H + 1H + 1H = 5 protons.\n    *   This group of 5 protons must belong to the \"alkenyl\" part of the \"alkenyl acetate\" molecule.\n    *   Let's check the number of protons on the alkenyl chains of the proposed structures:\n        *   **Propenyl group** (-CH=CH-CH₃): This has 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 protons. This **matches** our data.\n        *   **Butenyl group** (e.g., -CH=CH-CH₂CH₃ or -CH₂-CH=CH-CH₃): Both common butenyl isomers have 7 protons. This **does not match** our data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Based on the total proton count, the molecule must be a **propenyl acetate**, not a butenyl acetate. This eliminates options A (Cis-butenyl acetate) and C (Trans-butenyl acetate).\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nWe are now left with two possibilities: Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The stereochemistry of the double bond can be determined by the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinylic protons (the protons directly attached to the C=C double bond).\n\n*   **Let's analyze the vinylic proton signals:**\n    *   The signals at **7.0 ppm** and **5.5 ppm** both represent one proton (1H), which is consistent with the two vinylic protons in a propenyl group (-CH=CH-).\n    *   **Signal 4: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n        *   This is one of the vinylic protons. It is a doublet (d), meaning it is split by one adjacent proton (the other vinylic proton).\n        *   The crucial piece of information is the coupling constant, **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n\n*   **Applying the Rules for Vinylic Coupling:**\n    *   The coupling constant between two protons on opposite sides of a double bond (**trans**) is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   The coupling constant between two protons on the same side of a double bond (**cis**) is typically smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the observed coupling constant is **16.0 Hz**, it falls squarely within the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**4. Final Confirmation of the Structure**\n\nLet's assemble the entire structure of **Trans-propenyl acetate** and see if all the data fits.\n\n*   **Structure:** CH₃(a)-COO-CH(b)=CH(c)-CH₃(d) (with H(b) and H(c) in a trans arrangement).\n    *   **CH₃(a):** Acetate methyl. Corresponds to **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**. Correct.\n    *   **CH₃(d):** Vinylic methyl group. It is adjacent to one proton, H(c), so it should be a doublet (d). This corresponds to **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**. Correct.\n    *   **CH(c):** Vinylic proton. It is adjacent to H(b) (1 proton) and the methyl group CH₃(d) (3 protons). It should be split into a doublet by H(b) and a quartet by CH₃(d), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). This corresponds to **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**. Correct.\n    *   **CH(b):** Vinylic proton next to the ester oxygen. It is adjacent only to H(c), so it should be a doublet (d). The coupling constant should be large and trans (~16.0 Hz). This corresponds to **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**. Correct.\n\nAll pieces of the 1H NMR data perfectly match the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Total Number of Protons:**\n\nFirst, let's sum the integrations of all the signals to determine the total number of protons in the molecule.\n*   Signal 1: 1H\n*   Signal 2: 1H\n*   Signal 3: 3H\n*   Signal 4: 3H\n*   **Total Protons = 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8H**\n\nNow, let's determine the number of protons in each of the possible options:\n*   **Propenyl acetate:** The propenyl group is C3H5. The acetate group is CH3CO2. The formula is CH3CO2C3H5, which is C5H8O2. It has **8 protons**.\n*   **Butenyl acetate:** The butenyl group is C4H7. The acetate group is CH3CO2. The formula is CH3CO2C4H7, which is C6H10O2. It has **10 protons**.\n\nSince the NMR data shows a total of 8 protons, we can immediately eliminate the butenyl acetate options (Cis-butenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate). The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze Individual Signals and Assign them to the Propenyl Acetate Structure:**\n\nThe general structure of propenyl acetate is: CH3(a)-C(=O)-O-CH(b)=CH(c)-CH3(d)\n\nLet's assign each signal from the NMR data to the protons in this structure.\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s - singlet):** This means the methyl group has no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon (an acetyl group).\n    *   **Assignment:** This signal corresponds to the acetyl methyl protons, **CH3(a)**.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d - doublet):** This means the methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton.\n    *   **Assignment:** This signal corresponds to the methyl group attached to the double bond, **CH3(d)**. It is split into a doublet by the adjacent vinylic proton, H(c).\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Represents a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq - doublet of quartets):** This proton is split into a doublet by one adjacent proton and into a quartet by three other adjacent protons.\n    *   **Assignment:** This signal corresponds to the vinylic proton **H(c)**. It is coupled to H(b) (giving the doublet) and to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group CH3(d) (giving the quartet).\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Represents a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d - doublet):** This proton is coupled to a single adjacent proton. The coupling constant (J) is 16.0 Hz.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This high chemical shift (deshielding) is typical for a vinylic proton attached to a carbon that is also bonded to an electronegative oxygen atom.\n    *   **Assignment:** This signal corresponds to the vinylic proton **H(b)**. It is coupled only to H(c).\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n\nThe final step is to distinguish between the cis and trans isomers. The key piece of information is the coupling constant (J value) between the two vinylic protons, H(b) and H(c).\n\n*   The signal for H(b) at 7.0 ppm shows a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   The magnitude of the coupling constant between protons on a double bond is dependent on their geometric relationship:\n    *   **Trans-coupling (J_trans):** Typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis-coupling (J_cis):** Typically smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nSince the observed coupling constant is 16.0 Hz, it falls squarely within the range for trans protons. Therefore, the protons H(b) and H(c) are in a **trans** configuration.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound has 8 protons, an acetyl group, and a propenyl group with a trans double bond. The unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Signal at 2.1 ppm:**\n*   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is typical for protons on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **Integration (3H):** The signal corresponds to three equivalent protons, suggesting a methyl group (CH₃).\n*   **Multiplicity (s):** A singlet indicates that these protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n*   **Conclusion:** A 3H singlet at ~2.1 ppm is a classic signature for the methyl group in an acetate functional group (-O-CO-C**H₃**). All four possible compounds are acetates, so this signal is consistent with all options.\n\n**2. Analyze the Alkene and Alkyl Signals:**\nThe remaining signals at 7.0 ppm, 5.5 ppm, and 1.6 ppm must describe the \"propenyl\" or \"butenyl\" part of the molecule.\n*   **Propenyl group:** -CH=CH-CH₃ (has 2 vinylic protons and 3 allylic protons)\n*   **Butenyl group:** Would have one more carbon and two more protons (e.g., -CH=CH-CH₂CH₃ or -CH₂-CH=CH-CH₃). The number of signals and their integrations do not match a butenyl structure. For example, a but-1-enyl group would show signals for an ethyl group (a quartet and a triplet), which are not present. A but-2-enyl group attached to the oxygen via a CH₂ (crotyl acetate) would show a CH₂ signal around 4.5 ppm. Therefore, we can rule out the butenyl acetate options (C and D).\n\nThis leaves us with **Cis-propenyl acetate** and **Trans-propenyl acetate**. The general structure is CH₃-CH=CH-O-CO-CH₃. Let's assign the remaining protons to this structure.\n\n**Structure:** C**H₃**(c)-C**H**(b)=C**H**(a)-O-CO-CH₃\n\n*   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   This is a single vinylic proton (**H**(a)). Its downfield chemical shift (7.0 ppm) is due to the strong deshielding effect of the adjacent electronegative oxygen atom of the acetate group.\n    *   It is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to only one other proton, which must be **H**(b).\n    *   The key piece of information is the coupling constant, **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n\n*   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   This is the other vinylic proton (**H**(b)).\n    *   Its multiplicity is a doublet of quartets (dq). The doublet arises from coupling to **H**(a). The quartet arises from coupling to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group, **CH₃**(c).\n\n*   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   These are the three protons of the methyl group attached to the double bond (**CH₃**(c)).\n    *   This signal is a doublet (d) because the methyl group is coupled to the single adjacent vinylic proton, **H**(b).\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\nThe stereochemistry of the double bond is determined by the magnitude of the coupling constant (J) between the two vinylic protons, **H**(a) and **H**(b).\n\n*   **Trans coupling:** Protons are on opposite sides of the double bond. The coupling constant (³J_trans) is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n*   **Cis coupling:** Protons are on the same side of the double bond. The coupling constant (³J_cis) is smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nThe observed coupling constant is **J = 16.0 Hz**, which falls squarely in the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe compound has an acetate group, a propenyl group, and the stereochemistry of the double bond is trans. Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Analyze the number of protons and basic structural units.**\n    *   The total number of protons from the integration is 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n    *   Let's check the number of protons for the options:\n        *   Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2): 3 (from CH3) + 1 + 1 (from -CH=CH-) + 3 (from acetate CH3) = 8 protons. This matches.\n        *   Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2): Total of 10 protons. This does not match the data.\n    *   Based on the proton count, we can immediately rule out **Cis-butenyl acetate** and **Trans-butenyl acetate**. The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n2.  **Assign the signals to specific parts of the propenyl acetate structure.**\n    The general structure is `CH3-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH3`. Let's label the protons for easier reference:\n    `CH3(b)-CH(c)=CH(d)-O-C(=O)-CH3(a)`\n\n    *   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet (s) for 3 protons around 2.1 ppm is highly characteristic of the methyl group of an acetate (`-C(=O)-CH3`). This corresponds to `CH3(a)`. It is a singlet because it has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n\n    *   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** A doublet (d) for 3 protons in the allylic region (~1.6-1.8 ppm) corresponds to the methyl group attached to the double bond (`CH3-C=`). This is `CH3(b)`. It is a doublet because it is coupled to the single adjacent proton, `H(c)`.\n\n    *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal for one proton is a doublet of quartets (dq). This means the proton is split by two different sets of neighbors: one neighboring proton (giving the doublet) and three neighboring protons (giving the quartet, 3+1=4). This perfectly describes proton `H(c)`, which is adjacent to `H(d)` (1 proton) and the `CH3(b)` group (3 protons).\n\n    *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal for one proton is a doublet (d). This corresponds to proton `H(d)`. It is coupled only to `H(c)`. Its chemical shift is far downfield (7.0 ppm) because it is on a double bond and attached to a very electronegative oxygen atom (`=CH-O-`), which deshields the proton significantly.\n\n3.  **Use the coupling constant (J) to determine the stereochemistry.**\n    *   The most crucial piece of information for distinguishing between cis and trans isomers is the coupling constant (J) between the two protons on the double bond (`H(c)` and `H(d)`).\n    *   The data for the signal at 7.0 ppm explicitly gives **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n    *   The established rules for vinyl proton coupling are:\n        *   **J_trans ≈ 12-18 Hz** (for protons on opposite sides of the double bond)\n        *   **J_cis ≈ 6-12 Hz** (for protons on the same side of the double bond)\n    *   Since the observed coupling constant is 16.0 Hz, which falls squarely in the range for a trans coupling, the geometry of the double bond must be **trans**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion.**\n    Based on the analysis, the compound has a propenyl acetate structure with a trans configuration on the double bond. Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown organic compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Protons and Signals**\n\n*   The 1H NMR spectrum shows four distinct signals, which means there are four different types of protons in the molecule.\n*   Let's sum the integrations for each signal to find the total number of protons represented in the spectrum: 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n\nNow, let's check the number of protons in the possible structures:\n*   **Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2)**: A propenyl group (C3H5) plus an acetate group (C2H3O2). Total protons = 5 + 3 = 8. This matches the data.\n*   **Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2)**: A butenyl group (C4H7) plus an acetate group (C2H3O2). Total protons = 7 + 3 = 10. This does not match the data.\n\nBased on the total proton count, we can confidently eliminate the butenyl acetate options (A and D). The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Signal**\n\nLet's look at each signal individually to deduce the structure.\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**:\n    *   **Integration (3H)**: Represents a methyl (CH3) group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm)**: This region is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group of an ester or ketone. This signal corresponds to the methyl protons of the acetate group (CH3-COO-).\n    *   **Splitting (s)**: A singlet means this methyl group has no adjacent protons to couple with, which is consistent with the structure of an acetate group.\n\n*   **Remaining Signals (7.0, 5.5, and 1.6 ppm)**: These three signals must describe the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3) attached to the acetate oxygen.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**:\n    *   **Integration (3H)**: Another methyl group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm)**: This is a typical shift for a methyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (an allylic methyl group). This is the CH3 in -CH=CH-CH3.\n    *   **Splitting (d)**: A doublet means this methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton. This is the vinylic proton next to it.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz) and 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**:\n    *   These two signals represent the two protons on the carbon-carbon double bond (the vinylic protons). Let's call them Ha and Hb: R-O-C(Ha)=C(Hb)-CH3.\n    *   The proton at **7.0 ppm** is significantly downfield, which is expected for a vinylic proton attached to an oxygen atom (Ha) due to the oxygen's deshielding effect. It's a doublet, meaning it's split only by the other vinylic proton (Hb).\n    *   The proton at **5.5 ppm** is the other vinylic proton (Hb), which is attached to the carbon bearing the methyl group. Its splitting pattern is a doublet of quartets (dq). The doublet comes from coupling to Ha, and the quartet comes from coupling to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group. This confirms our assignments.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nThe key to distinguishing between the cis and trans isomers lies in the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinylic protons (Ha and Hb).\n\n*   For **trans** vinylic protons, the coupling constant (³J_trans) is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n*   For **cis** vinylic protons, the coupling constant (³J_cis) is typically smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nThe observed coupling constant for the signal at 7.0 ppm is **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value falls squarely within the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   The proton count and signal analysis indicate the compound is a propenyl acetate.\n*   The large vinylic coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) definitively points to a trans geometry around the double bond.\n*   Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Data**\n\n1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**:\n    *   **Integration (3H)**: Indicates a methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet)**: This methyl group has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~2.1 ppm)**: This is a characteristic chemical shift for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group, specifically an acetyl group (-C(O)CH₃). This suggests the presence of an acetate functional group in the molecule.\n\n2.  **Signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm**:\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~5.0 - 7.5 ppm)**: These signals are in the vinylic region, indicating protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C-H).\n    *   The molecule must contain a double bond.\n\n3.  **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**:\n    *   **Integration (3H)**: Indicates another methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet)**: This methyl group is adjacent to a single proton (CH).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~1.6 ppm)**: This is a typical shift for an allylic methyl group, which is a methyl group attached to a double bond (CH₃-C=C).\n\n4.  **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**:\n    *   **Integration (1H)**: A single vinylic proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets)**: This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighbors. The \"d\" (doublet) means it is coupled to one other proton. The \"q\" (quartet) means it is coupled to an adjacent methyl group (3 protons). This confirms the presence of a -CH=CH-CH₃ moiety. This proton is the one in the middle, `C-CH-CH₃`.\n\n5.  **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**:\n    *   **Integration (1H)**: The second single vinylic proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet)**: This proton is coupled to one other proton, which must be the proton at 5.5 ppm.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz)**: This is the most crucial piece of information for determining the stereochemistry (cis or trans). The coupling constant (J) between two protons on a double bond is typically:\n        *   **~12-18 Hz for a *trans* configuration.**\n        *   **~6-12 Hz for a *cis* configuration.**\n    *   Since the observed J value is 16.0 Hz, this strongly indicates a **trans** relationship between the two vinylic protons.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure**\n\nBased on the fragments identified:\n*   An acetyl group (-O-C(O)CH₃), from the singlet at 2.1 ppm.\n*   A propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃), from the signals at 7.0, 5.5, and 1.6 ppm.\n\nCombining these fragments gives **propenyl acetate**. The structure is CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(O)-CH₃.\n\nThe total proton count from the data is 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8H. Propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂) has 8 protons, which is consistent. Butenyl acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂) has 10 protons, so C and D can be eliminated based on proton count alone.\n\nThe J-coupling constant of 16.0 Hz for the vinylic protons confirms the double bond has a *trans* configuration.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nLet's assign all the peaks to the Trans-propenyl acetate structure:\n*   **d) Acetyl CH₃**: Signal at 2.1 ppm (singlet).\n*   **a) Allylic CH₃**: Signal at 1.6 ppm (doublet, coupled to proton b).\n*   **b) Vinylic H**: Signal at 5.5 ppm (doublet of quartets, coupled to proton c and allylic methyl group a).\n*   **c) Vinylic H**: Signal at 7.0 ppm (doublet, coupled to proton b, J=16.0 Hz confirms trans). The high chemical shift is due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent oxygen atom.\n\nThe data is a perfect match for Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Signals and Integrations:**\n*   There are four distinct signals in the spectrum.\n*   The integrations are 1H, 1H, 3H, and 3H, for a total of 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 protons in the molecule.\n\nLet's check the number of protons for each option:\n*   Propenyl acetate (CH₃COOCH=CHCH₃): C₅H₈O₂. It has 3+1+1+3 = 8 protons. This matches.\n*   Butenyl acetate (CH₃COOCH₂CH=CHCH₃): C₆H₁₀O₂. It has 3+2+1+1+3 = 10 protons. This does not match the integration data.\n\nTherefore, we can immediately rule out both Cis-butenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate (options B and C). The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Signal in Detail:**\n\n*   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is typical for protons on a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Confirms it's a methyl (CH₃) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The methyl group has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal corresponds to the acetate methyl group (CH₃COO-).\n\n*   **Signal 2: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This region is typical for an allylic methyl group (a methyl group attached to a double bond).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Confirms it's a methyl (CH₃) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This methyl group is split by one adjacent proton.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal corresponds to the methyl group at the end of the propenyl chain (=CH-CH₃).\n\n*   **Signal 3: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This is in the alkene/vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond).\n    *   **Integration (1H):** It is a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons. The \"doublet\" part means it is coupled to one proton. The \"quartet\" part means it is coupled to three equivalent protons (a methyl group).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is the vinylic proton adjacent to the methyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). It is split into a quartet by the CH₃ group (at 1.6 ppm) and into a doublet by the other vinylic proton (at 7.0 ppm).\n\n*   **Signal 4: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is also in the vinylic region. It is further downfield (more deshielded) because it is directly attached to the carbon that is bonded to the electronegative oxygen atom of the ester (O-CH=).\n    *   **Integration (1H):** It is a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This proton is coupled to one adjacent proton, which must be the other vinylic proton at 5.5 ppm.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the key piece of information for determining the stereochemistry. The magnitude of the J-coupling constant between two protons on a double bond is dependent on their geometry.\n        *   **Trans protons:** J-coupling is typically large, in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n        *   **Cis protons:** J-coupling is typically smaller, in the range of 6-12 Hz.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The observed J-value of 16.0 Hz is a classic value for *trans* vinylic protons.\n\n**3. Synthesize the Findings:**\n\n*   The molecule has an acetate group (CH₃COO-) and a propenyl group (-CH=CHCH₃).\n*   The two protons on the double bond show a coupling constant of 16.0 Hz, which definitively indicates a **trans** configuration.\n*   Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is the reasoning process to identify the unknown organic compound from the provided 1H NMR data.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis of the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe provided data is:\n*   **7.0 ppm:** 1H, doublet (d), J = 16.0 Hz\n*   **5.5 ppm:** 1H, doublet of quartets (dq)\n*   **2.1 ppm:** 3H, singlet (s)\n*   **1.6 ppm:** 3H, doublet (d)\n\nThe possible compounds are:\n*   Cis-propenyl acetate\n*   Trans-propenyl acetate\n*   Cis-butenyl acetate\n*   Trans-butenyl acetate\n\nLet's analyze each signal:\n\n1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, which is consistent with a methyl (CH₃) group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s):** A singlet means these protons have no adjacent non-equivalent protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a methyl group attached to the carbonyl of an ester or acetate group (CH₃-C=O). All four possible compounds are acetates, so they all contain this group. This signal is consistent with all options.\n\n2.  **Determine the Carbon Skeleton (Propenyl vs. Butenyl):**\n    *   Let's sum the number of protons from the integration values: 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = **8 protons** in total.\n    *   Now, let's count the protons in the possible structures:\n        *   **Propenyl acetate (CH₃-CH=CH-O-COCH₃):**\n            *   CH₃ (propenyl part) = 3H\n            *   CH=CH (vinyl part) = 2H\n            *   CH₃ (acetyl part) = 3H\n            *   Total = 3 + 2 + 3 = **8 protons**. This matches the NMR data.\n        *   **Butenyl acetate (e.g., But-2-enyl acetate: CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-O-COCH₃):**\n            *   CH₃ (butenyl part) = 3H\n            *   CH=CH (vinyl part) = 2H\n            *   CH₂ (methylene part) = 2H\n            *   CH₃ (acetyl part) = 3H\n            *   Total = 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 = **10 protons**. This does not match the NMR data.\n    *   Since the total proton count is 8, we can confidently eliminate both **Cis-butenyl acetate** and **Trans-butenyl acetate**. The unknown compound must be either Cis- or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Remaining Signals for Propenyl Acetate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃(a)-CH(b)=CH(c)-O-COCH₃.\n    *   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This corresponds to the methyl group, CH₃(a). It is a doublet because it is coupled to the single adjacent vinyl proton, H(b).\n    *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This corresponds to the vinyl proton H(b). It is split into a doublet by the adjacent vinyl proton H(c) and into a quartet by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group CH₃(a). Thus, it appears as a doublet of quartets.\n    *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d):** This corresponds to the vinyl proton H(c). It is split into a doublet by the adjacent vinyl proton H(b). The higher chemical shift (downfield) is due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent oxygen atom.\n\n4.  **Distinguish between Cis and Trans Isomers:**\n    *   The stereochemistry of the double bond is determined by the magnitude of the coupling constant (J) between the two vinyl protons, H(b) and H(c).\n    *   The general rule for vinyl proton coupling is:\n        *   **³J_trans (trans-coupling):** Typically large, in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n        *   **³J_cis (cis-coupling):** Typically smaller, in the range of 6-12 Hz.\n    *   The data for the signal at 7.0 ppm shows it is a doublet with a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n    *   This large J-value falls squarely in the range for *trans*-coupling. Therefore, the protons H(b) and H(c) are in a trans configuration relative to each other.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   The proton count (8H) indicates a **propenyl acetate**.\n*   The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) between the vinylic protons indicates a **trans** configuration.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning used to identify the unknown compound from the provided 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n\n*   **1H NMR data:**\n    *   `7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)`\n    *   `5.5 ppm (1H, dq)`\n    *   `2.1 ppm (3H, s)`\n    *   `1.6 ppm (3H, d)`\n\n**2. Decipher Each Signal:**\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is typical for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group within an acetate functional group (CH₃-C(=O)O-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s - singlet):** A singlet means there are no adjacent protons to couple with. This confirms the methyl group is isolated, which is consistent with an acetate group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal indicates the presence of an acetate group (`-OAc` or `-O-C(=O)-CH₃`). All four options are acetates, so this is consistent.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm signals:**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.0 - 7.5 ppm):** These chemical shifts are in the vinylic region, indicating the presence of protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   **Integration (1H each):** There are two distinct protons on the double bond.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This is another methyl group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This shift is characteristic of an allylic methyl group, meaning a methyl group attached directly to a double bond (CH₃-C=C).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d - doublet):** A doublet means this methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton.\n\n**3. Determine the Carbon Skeleton:**\n\n*   We have identified three key fragments:\n    1.  An acetate group: `-O-C(=O)-CH₃`\n    2.  A double bond with two protons: `-CH=CH-`\n    3.  A methyl group attached to the double bond: `CH₃-`\n*   Putting these pieces together, the structure must be `CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n*   This structure is named **propenyl acetate**. A \"propenyl\" group is `CH₃-CH=CH-`.\n*   The options involving \"butenyl acetate\" would require an additional -CH₂- group (forming an ethyl group `CH₃CH₂-` attached to the double bond), which is not supported by the data. Therefore, we can eliminate options C) Cis-butenyl acetate and D) Trans-butenyl acetate.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n\n*   The remaining choice is between Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The stereochemistry of the double bond can be determined from the coupling constant (J value) between the two vinylic protons.\n*   The signal at **7.0 ppm** is a doublet with a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   The coupling constant between protons on a double bond is highly dependent on their relative geometry:\n    *   **Trans protons:** J-value is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis protons:** J-value is smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n*   The observed J-value of 16.0 Hz falls squarely within the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion:**\n\n*   The carbon skeleton is that of a propenyl acetate.\n*   The stereochemistry of the double bond is trans.\n*   Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nLet's do a final check by assigning all protons to the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate: `CH₃(a)-CH(b)=CH(c)-O-C(=O)-CH₃(d)`\n\n*   **CH₃(d) at 2.1 ppm (s):** This is the acetate methyl group, which is a singlet as it has no adjacent protons. (Correct)\n*   **CH₃(a) at 1.6 ppm (d):** This is the methyl group on the double bond. It is coupled to one proton, H(b), so it appears as a doublet. (Correct)\n*   **H(c) at 7.0 ppm (d, J=16.0 Hz):** This vinylic proton is attached to the carbon bearing the oxygen atom, making it more deshielded (higher ppm). It is coupled only to H(b), so it appears as a doublet. The large J-value confirms it is trans to H(b). (Correct)\n*   **H(b) at 5.5 ppm (dq):** This vinylic proton is coupled to H(c) (one proton, making it a doublet 'd') and also to the three protons of CH₃(a) (making it a quartet 'q'). Thus, it appears as a doublet of quartets. (Correct)\n\nAll data points are perfectly consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 27:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's break down the information provided by each signal in the spectrum:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is characteristic of a methyl group (CH3) attached to a carbonyl group (C=O), specifically an acetate group (`-OCOCH3`).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, consistent with a methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The signal is a single peak, meaning these protons are not coupled to any neighboring protons. This confirms the presence of an isolated `CH3-C=O` fragment.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This shift is typical for an allylic methyl group, which is a methyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (`CH3-C=C`).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** The signal is split into a doublet, meaning this methyl group is coupled to one adjacent proton.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). The high chemical shift suggests it is attached to an electron-withdrawing atom, like the oxygen of the acetate group (`=CH-O-`).\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Represents a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** It is coupled to one other proton.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a very important piece of information. For protons on a double bond, a large coupling constant (typically 12-18 Hz) indicates a **trans** stereochemistry. A smaller coupling constant (6-12 Hz) would indicate a *cis* relationship.\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** Also in the vinylic region.\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Represents a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons. It is split into a doublet by one adjacent proton and into a quartet by three adjacent protons.\n\n**2. Assemble the Fragments**\n\nFrom the analysis, we have the following pieces:\n*   An acetate group: `-OCOCH3` (from the 2.1 ppm signal).\n*   A `CH3-CH=` fragment: The `CH3` group is the 1.6 ppm doublet, and it's coupled to the `CH` proton.\n*   A `=CH-O` fragment: The `CH` proton is the 7.0 ppm doublet.\n*   The vinylic proton from the `CH3-CH=` fragment must be the 5.5 ppm signal. It's coupled to the other vinylic proton (giving the doublet part of 'dq') and the allylic `CH3` group (giving the quartet part of 'dq').\n*   The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) between the two vinylic protons confirms they are in a **trans** arrangement.\n\nPutting these pieces together gives the structure:\n`CH3(a)-CH(b)=CH(c)-OCOCH3(d)` where protons (b) and (c) are trans to each other.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **A) Cis-propenyl acetate:** This structure has a *cis* double bond. It would show a smaller vinylic coupling constant (J ≈ 6-12 Hz). This does not match the data.\n*   **B) Trans-propenyl acetate:** This structure has a *trans* double bond, which would result in a large vinylic coupling constant (J ≈ 12-18 Hz). This perfectly matches the `J = 16.0 Hz` value from the data. The rest of the predicted signals also match the data.\n*   **C) Cis-butenyl acetate & D) Trans-butenyl acetate:** The molecular formula for butenyl acetate is C6H10O2. It contains 10 protons. The NMR data shows a total integration of 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons. Therefore, these compounds can be ruled out based on the proton count. Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2) has 8 protons, which matches the data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe 1H NMR data, particularly the coupling constant of 16.0 Hz, unequivocally identifies the compound as having a trans-substituted double bond. Combined with the other signal information and the total proton count, the only structure that fits is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the signal at 2.1 ppm.**\n    *   The signal at **2.1 ppm** has an integration of **3H** (three protons) and is a **singlet (s)**.\n    *   A singlet means these protons have no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   A chemical shift around 2.1 ppm for a 3H singlet is characteristic of the methyl protons of an acetyl group (CH₃-C=O). All four possible compounds are acetates, so they all contain this group. This signal is consistent with all options.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the signals in the alkene region (5-8 ppm) and the coupling constant.**\n    *   There are two signals in this region: **7.0 ppm** and **5.5 ppm**. These are the two vinylic protons on the carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-).\n    *   The signal at **7.0 ppm** is a **doublet (d)** with a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n    *   The coupling constant (J) between two protons on a double bond is highly dependent on their stereochemistry.\n        *   A **trans** arrangement typically results in a large coupling constant, J = 12-18 Hz.\n        *   A **cis** arrangement results in a smaller coupling constant, J = 6-12 Hz.\n    *   The observed J value of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely in the trans range. This strongly indicates that the two protons on the double bond are **trans** to each other.\n    *   This finding immediately eliminates the *cis* isomers: (B) Cis-propenyl acetate and (C) Cis-butenyl acetate.\n\n*   **Step 3: Distinguish between Trans-propenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate based on the remaining signals.**\n    *   We are left with two options: (A) Trans-butenyl acetate and (D) Trans-propenyl acetate. Let's analyze their expected structures and NMR signals.\n    *   **Structure of Trans-propenyl acetate:** CH₃-C(=O)O-CH=CH-CH₃\n    *   **Structure of Trans-butenyl acetate (1-butenyl isomer):** CH₃-C(=O)O-CH=CH-CH₂-CH₃\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze the splitting patterns to determine the full structure.**\n    *   Let's analyze the remaining signals from the provided data:\n        *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This is the second vinylic proton. The multiplicity is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. This means the proton is being split by two different sets of neighbors: one single proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet). This matches the `=CH-CH₃` fragment perfectly. The proton (`=CH-`) is split into a doublet by the other vinylic proton and into a quartet by the adjacent methyl (`-CH₃`) group.\n        *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal is for three protons and is a **doublet (d)**. This indicates a methyl group (`CH₃`) that is adjacent to a single proton (`-CH-`). This is consistent with the methyl group in the `=CH-CH₃` fragment.\n\n*   **Step 5: Compare the observed data with the expected signals for the remaining options.**\n    *   **For Trans-propenyl acetate (CH₃-COO-CH=CH-CH₃):**\n        *   CH₃-COO: singlet (matches 2.1 ppm signal).\n        *   -O-CH=: doublet (split by the other vinylic H) and very downfield due to the adjacent oxygen (matches 7.0 ppm signal).\n        *   =CH-CH₃: doublet of quartets (split by the other vinylic H and the methyl group) (matches 5.5 ppm signal).\n        *   =CH-CH₃: doublet (split by the adjacent vinylic H) (matches 1.6 ppm signal).\n        *   The observed data is a perfect match for Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n    *   **For Trans-butenyl acetate (CH₃-COO-CH=CH-CH₂-CH₃):**\n        *   This structure contains an ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃) instead of a methyl group attached to the double bond.\n        *   It would show a signal for a CH₂ group (a multiplet) and a CH₃ group that is a triplet (split by the adjacent CH₂ group).\n        *   The provided data has no triplet signal and has a methyl signal that is a doublet, not a triplet. Therefore, this structure is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound that matches all aspects of the 1H NMR data (chemical shifts, integrations, multiplicities, and coupling constant) is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Data:**\n\n    1.  **Identify Functional Groups and Fragments:**\n        *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet integrating to 3 protons in this region is highly characteristic of an acetate methyl group (CH₃-C=O). All four options contain an acetate group, so this is consistent.\n        *   **Proton Count:** The total number of protons is 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n            *   Propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂) has 3 (on propene) + 2 (on propene) + 3 (on acetate) = 8 hydrogens (wait, let's write it out: CH₃-CH=CH-O-Ac, so 3+1+1+3 = 8H). This matches.\n            *   Butenyl acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂) has 10 hydrogens. This does not match.\n            *   Therefore, we can immediately eliminate the butenyl acetate options (B and C). We are left with Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n    2.  **Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n        *   We have two signals in the alkene (vinylic) region: 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm. These correspond to the two protons on the C=C double bond.\n        *   The signal at **7.0 ppm** is a doublet with a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n        *   The coupling constant (J-value) between two vinylic protons is highly diagnostic of the double bond's geometry.\n            *   A **trans** arrangement typically shows a large coupling constant, usually in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n            *   A **cis** arrangement shows a smaller coupling constant, typically **6-12 Hz**.\n        *   Since the observed coupling constant is 16.0 Hz, this strongly indicates a **trans** configuration. This eliminates the Cis-propenyl acetate option (D).\n\n    3.  **Confirm the Structure of Trans-propenyl acetate:**\n        *   The proposed structure is **Trans-propenyl acetate**:\n            ```\n                O\n               //\n            H-C----C-O-C-CH₃(a)\n              |    |\n              H(b) H(c)-CH₃(d)\n            ```\n        *   Let's assign the signals to the protons in this structure:\n            *   **Protons (a):** The acetate methyl group. It has no adjacent protons, so it appears as a singlet. This corresponds to the signal at **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**.\n            *   **Protons (d):** The methyl group on the double bond. It is coupled to the single proton (c) on the adjacent carbon, so it appears as a doublet. This corresponds to the signal at **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**.\n            *   **Proton (c):** This vinylic proton is coupled to proton (b) (one proton, giving a doublet) and the methyl group (d) (three protons, giving a quartet). The signal should be a doublet of quartets (dq). This corresponds to the signal at **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**.\n            *   **Proton (b):** This vinylic proton is coupled to proton (c) (one proton), so it appears as a doublet. It is attached to the carbon bonded to the electronegative oxygen atom, which deshields it, causing it to appear further downfield (at a higher ppm value). This corresponds to the signal at **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The NMR data perfectly matches the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate. The proton count eliminates the butenyl options, and the large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) confirms the trans stereochemistry.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Data:**\n\n    1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet (s) integrating to 3 protons in this region (~2.0-2.2 ppm) is highly characteristic of the methyl protons of an acetate group (CH₃-COO-). All four options contain an acetate group, so this is consistent.\n\n    2.  **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** A doublet (d) integrating to 3 protons suggests a methyl group (CH₃-) that is coupled to a single adjacent proton (-CH-). This points towards a CH₃-CH= structure.\n\n    3.  **Signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm:** These signals are in the vinylic region (5-8 ppm), indicating protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n        *   The signal at **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)** is for a single proton. The multiplicity, a doublet of quartets (dq), means it is coupled to two different sets of protons: one single proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet). This fits perfectly with a proton on a double bond that is adjacent to another vinylic proton and a methyl group: `CH₃-CH=`. This proton is the one at the `-CH=` part.\n        *   The signal at **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)** is for the other single vinylic proton. It is a doublet, meaning it's coupled to only one other proton (the one at 5.5 ppm). The high chemical shift (7.0 ppm) is due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent electronegative oxygen atom from the acetate group (`=CH-O-`).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    Putting the pieces together: we have an acetate group (CH₃COO-), and a `CH₃-CH=CH-` group. This forms a propenyl acetate structure: `CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n    This eliminates the butenyl acetate options (C and D), as their fragmentation patterns would be different and they would have 10 protons, not 8 as indicated by the integration (3+3+1+1=8).\n\n*   **Determining Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n    The key to distinguishing between the cis and trans isomers is the coupling constant (J value) between the two vinylic protons (the ones at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm).\n    *   **Trans coupling (³J_trans):** Protons on opposite sides of the double bond typically have a large coupling constant, usually in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis coupling (³J_cis):** Protons on the same side of the double bond typically have a smaller coupling constant, usually in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n    The provided J value for the doublet at 7.0 ppm is **16.0 Hz**. This value falls squarely within the typical range for a trans configuration.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The NMR data (proton count, chemical shifts, splitting patterns, and coupling constant) is fully consistent with the structure of **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Analyze each signal in the 1H NMR spectrum:**\n\n    *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal represents three equivalent protons (3H) that are not coupled to any neighboring protons, hence a singlet (s). A singlet around 2.0-2.2 ppm is highly characteristic of the methyl protons of an acetate group (-O-C(=O)-CH₃). All four options contain an acetate group, so this is consistent.\n\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal is for one proton (1H) in the vinylic region (i.e., a proton attached to a C=C double bond), indicated by the high chemical shift (~7.0 ppm). It is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to one adjacent proton. The most critical piece of information here is the coupling constant, J = 16.0 Hz. Coupling constants between vinylic protons are stereochemically dependent:\n        *   *Trans* coupling (protons on opposite sides of the double bond) typically shows J = 12-18 Hz.\n        *   *Cis* coupling (protons on the same side of the double bond) typically shows J = 6-12 Hz.\n        *   A J value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates a **trans** relationship between the two vinylic protons.\n\n    *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This is another signal for one proton (1H) in the vinylic region. Its multiplicity is a doublet of quartets (dq). This means the proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons: one single proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet, from a -CH₃ group).\n\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal represents three protons (3H) in the allylic region (i.e., on a carbon adjacent to a C=C double bond). It is a doublet (d), which means these three protons are coupled to a single adjacent proton. This signal is consistent with a methyl group attached to a double bond (-CH=CH-CH₃).\n\n2.  **Assemble the structure based on the fragments:**\n\n    *   From the signals at 5.5 ppm (dq) and 1.6 ppm (d), we can deduce the presence of a **CH₃-CH=** fragment. The proton on the double bond (at 5.5 ppm) is split into a quartet by the adjacent CH₃ group and into a doublet by another proton.\n    *   From the signal at 7.0 ppm (d), we know there's another proton on the double bond coupled to the one at 5.5 ppm. This gives us the **CH₃-CH=CH-** fragment.\n    *   Combining this with the acetate group from the 2.1 ppm signal (-O-C(=O)-CH₃), the most likely structure is propenyl acetate: **CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃**.\n    *   This structure has the correct number of protons and carbons. It excludes the butenyl acetate options, which would have an additional CH₂ group and different splitting patterns.\n\n3.  **Determine the stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n\n    *   As established in step 1, the large coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz** between the two vinylic protons (the ones at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm) is definitive for a **trans** configuration around the double bond.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n\n    *   The compound has a propenyl group, not a butenyl group.\n    *   The geometry of the double bond is trans.\n    *   Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nLet's check the assignments for Trans-propenyl acetate:\n```\n      H(b) H(a)\n       \\  /\n    C = C\n   /     \\\nCH3(c)    O-CO-CH3(d)\n```\n*   **H(a) (7.0 ppm):** Deshielded by the adjacent oxygen. Coupled only to H(b). Expected: doublet. Matches **(1H, d)**.\n*   **H(b) (5.5 ppm):** Coupled to H(a) (doublet) and the three H(c) protons (quartet). Expected: doublet of quartets. Matches **(1H, dq)**.\n*   **H(c) (1.6 ppm):** Methyl group coupled to H(b). Expected: doublet. Matches **(3H, d)**.\n*   **H(d) (2.1 ppm):** Acetate methyl group, no adjacent protons. Expected: singlet. Matches **(3H, s)**.\n*   **J(ab) coupling:** Protons H(a) and H(b) are trans. Expected: J ~12-18 Hz. Matches **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n\nAll data points are perfectly consistent with Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the total number of protons.**\n    The integration values for the signals are 1H, 1H, 3H, and 3H.\n    The total number of protons in the molecule is 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 protons.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the molecular formula from the options.**\n    Let's check the number of protons for the given options:\n    *   Propenyl acetate (CH3-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3) has the formula C5H8O2. The number of hydrogen atoms is 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8. This matches our data.\n    *   Butenyl acetate (CH3-CH2-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3) has the formula C6H10O2. The number of hydrogen atoms is 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 10. This does not match our data.\n    *   Therefore, the unknown compound must be a propenyl acetate, not a butenyl acetate. This eliminates options B) Trans-butenyl acetate and C) Cis-butenyl acetate.\n\n*   **Step 3: Differentiate between Cis and Trans isomers.**\n    We are left with two possibilities: Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The key to differentiating between these two stereoisomers lies in the coupling constant (J-value) of the two protons on the carbon-carbon double bond (the vinyl protons).\n    *   The provided data includes a signal at 7.0 ppm which is a doublet (d) with a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**. This signal corresponds to one of the vinyl protons being split by the other vinyl proton.\n    *   In 1H NMR spectroscopy, the magnitude of the coupling constant between two vicinal protons on a double bond is highly dependent on their stereochemistry:\n        *   **Trans-coupling (³J_trans)** is typically large, falling in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n        *   **Cis-coupling (³J_cis)** is significantly smaller, falling in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n    *   The observed coupling constant of 16.0 Hz falls squarely within the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n*   **Step 4: Assign all signals to the proposed structure (Trans-propenyl acetate).**\n    Let's check if all the data fits the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate: CH3(c)-CH(a)=CH(b)-O-CO-CH3(d)\n    *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal corresponds to the methyl protons of the acetate group, CH3(d). They are not coupled to any other protons, hence they appear as a singlet. This is a characteristic chemical shift for an acetate methyl.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This is one of the vinyl protons, H(b). It is deshielded (has a higher ppm value) because it is attached to the carbon that is bonded to the electronegative oxygen atom. It is split into a doublet by the other vinyl proton, H(a), with a large trans-coupling constant.\n    *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This is the other vinyl proton, H(a). It is split into a doublet by H(b) (J ≈ 16 Hz) and into a quartet by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group, CH3(c). Therefore, its multiplicity is a doublet of quartets (dq).\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal corresponds to the methyl group attached to the double bond, CH3(c). It is split into a doublet by the adjacent vinyl proton, H(a).\n\nAll the provided 1H NMR data are perfectly consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Signals and Integrations:**\nThe 1H NMR spectrum shows four distinct signals with the following integrations (number of protons):\n*   Signal 1: 1H (a single proton)\n*   Signal 2: 1H (a single proton)\n*   Signal 3: 3H (a methyl group)\n*   Signal 4: 3H (another methyl group)\nThe total number of protons is 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 protons.\n\nLet's check the chemical formulas of the options:\n*   Propenyl acetate (CH3-COO-CH=CH-CH3): C5H8O2. This has 3+1+1+3 = 8 protons. This matches.\n*   Butenyl acetate (CH3-COO-CH=CH-CH2-CH3): C6H10O2. This has 3+1+1+2+3 = 10 protons. This does not match.\n\nThis initial analysis immediately rules out both Cis-butenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate, as they do not have 8 protons. We are left with Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Signal in Detail:**\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This corresponds to a methyl group (CH3).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is typical for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (an acyl methyl group).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The protons are not coupled to any adjacent protons.\n    *   **Assignment:** This signal is characteristic of the acetate methyl group (`CH3-COO-`) in all the proposed structures.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This corresponds to a second methyl group (CH3).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** According to the n+1 rule, this methyl group is adjacent to a carbon with one proton (a CH group).\n    *   **Assignment:** This signal must be the methyl group attached to the double bond (`=CH-CH3`).\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This is a single proton on the double bond (a vinylic proton).\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons.\n        *   The 'd' (doublet) part means it's coupled to one other proton. This must be the other proton on the double bond.\n        *   The 'q' (quartet) part means it's coupled to three equivalent protons (a CH3 group). This must be the methyl group at 1.6 ppm.\n    *   **Assignment:** This is the vinylic proton adjacent to the methyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This is the second vinylic proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is significantly downfield, which is expected for a vinylic proton attached to an electronegative oxygen atom (`-O-CH=`).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This proton is coupled to only one other proton, which is the proton at 5.5 ppm.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the most crucial piece of information for determining the stereochemistry. The coupling constant (J) between two protons across a double bond is highly dependent on their relative positions:\n        *   **Trans-coupling (³J_trans):** Typically in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n        *   **Cis-coupling (³J_cis):** Typically in the range of 6-12 Hz.\n    *   The observed value of 16.0 Hz falls squarely within the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**3.

The number of hydrogen atoms is 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8. This matches the data.\n    *   Butenyl acetate (e.g., CH3-CH2-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3) has the formula C6H10O2. The number of hydrogen atoms is 10. This does not match the data.\n    *   Therefore, we can immediately rule out Cis-butenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate. The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n2.  **Analyze the signal at 2.1 ppm:**\n    *   The signal at `2.1 ppm (3H, s)` indicates three equivalent protons that are not coupled to any neighboring protons (a singlet). This is highly characteristic of the methyl group in an acetate ester (-O-C(=O)-**CH3**). Both propenyl acetate options contain this group.\n\n3.  **Analyze the signals for the propenyl group (CH3-CH=CH-):**\n    Let's label the protons: H3(a)-C-H(b)=C-H(c)-O-\n    *   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This represents the methyl group H(a). It is a doublet (d), which means it is coupled to a single adjacent proton, H(b). This is consistent with the `CH3-CH=` structure.\n    *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This represents a single proton, H(b). It is a doublet of quartets (dq). This means it is coupled to one other proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three protons (giving the quartet). This proton is H(b), which is coupled to H(c) (1 proton) and the methyl group H(a) (3 protons). This perfectly matches the `CH3-CH=CH-` structure.\n    *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This represents the final proton, H(c). It is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to a single adjacent proton, H(b). Its chemical shift is far downfield (7.0 ppm) because it is attached to the deshielding oxygen atom (-CH=CH-**O**-).\n\n4.  **Determine the stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n    *   The key piece of information is the coupling constant (J) for the vinylic protons, H(b) and H(c). The signal for H(c) at 7.0 ppm shows a coupling constant of `J = 16.0 Hz`.\n    *   For protons on a double bond:\n        *   A *trans* relationship results in a large coupling constant, typically in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n        *   A *cis* relationship results in a smaller coupling constant, typically in the range of 6-12 Hz.\n    *   Since the observed coupling constant is 16.0 Hz, this indicates a **trans** configuration for the double bond.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The NMR data is consistent with a propenyl acetate structure with a trans double bond.

All four possible options are acetates, so this fits.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d) and 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** These signals are in the vinylic region (4.5-7.5 ppm), indicating two protons on a carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-). The integration (1H each) confirms this.\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** A doublet integrating to 3 protons suggests a methyl group (CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (-CH-).\n\n*   **Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Compare with Options.**\n    *   We have an acetate group (CH₃COO-), a double bond with two protons (-CH=CH-), and a methyl group attached to the double bond (CH₃-CH=).\n    *   Putting these together gives the structure of propenyl acetate: CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   Let's check the options.\n        *   **Propenyl acetate (A and D):** This structure fits the fragments we identified.\n        *   **Butenyl acetate (B and C):** Let's assume the most likely isomer, but-2-enyl acetate: CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-O-C(=O)-CH₃. This structure contains a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to the oxygen. A signal for this group (typically a doublet around 4.5 ppm) is absent from the provided data. Therefore, we can eliminate the butenyl acetate options (B and C).\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans).**\n    *   The choice is now between Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The key to differentiating between them is the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinylic protons.\n    *   The data provides a signal at **7.0 ppm** which is a doublet with **J = 16.0 Hz**. This J-value represents the coupling between the two protons on the double bond.\n    *   **Rule of thumb for vinylic coupling constants:**\n        *   **³J_trans (protons are trans to each other):** Typically large, in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n        *   **³J_cis (protons are cis to each other):** Typically smaller, in the range of 6-12 Hz.\n    *   The observed coupling constant of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely in the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n*   **Step 4: Final Conclusion.**\n    *   The structure is propenyl acetate.\n    *   The J-value of 16.0 Hz indicates a trans double bond.\n    *   Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nLet's briefly confirm the splitting patterns for Trans-propenyl acetate:\n*   `CH₃(c)-CH(b)=CH(a)-O-C(=O)-CH₃(d)`\n*   **H(a) at ~7.0 ppm:** Coupled to H(b), appears as a doublet (d). The J value is 16.0 Hz. This matches.\n*   **H(b) at ~5.5 ppm:** Coupled to H(a) (makes it a doublet) and the three H(c) protons (makes it a quartet). The overall pattern is a doublet of quartets (dq). This matches.\n*   **H(c) at ~1.6 ppm:** Coupled to H(b), appears as a doublet (d). This matches.\n*   **H(d) at ~2.1 ppm:** No adjacent protons, appears as a singlet (s). This matches.\nAll data points are consistent with Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to identify the unknown compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nWe are given the following signals:\n*   **Signal 1:** 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)\n*   **Signal 2:** 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)\n*   **Signal 3:** 2.1 ppm (3H, s)\n*   **Signal 4:** 1.6 ppm (3H, d)\n\nLet's interpret each signal:\n\n*   **Signal 3: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~2.1 ppm):** This is a typical chemical shift for a methyl group (CH₃) attached to a carbonyl group of an ester or ketone. In this case, it corresponds to the methyl protons of the acetate group (CH₃COO-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s):** A singlet indicates that these protons have no adjacent protons to couple with. This is consistent with an acetate group. All four possible compounds are acetates, so they all contain this group.\n\n*   **Signal 1: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents one proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This value is in the alkene (or vinylic) region (typically 5-7.5 ppm), indicating a proton attached to a carbon-carbon double bond. Its downfield position suggests it's attached to a carbon that is also bonded to an electronegative atom like oxygen (-O-CH=).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** A doublet means this proton is coupled to only one other proton.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the most crucial piece of information for determining stereochemistry. The magnitude of the coupling constant between two protons on a double bond tells us about their relative positions:\n        *   **trans-coupling:** J ≈ 12-18 Hz\n        *   **cis-coupling:** J ≈ 6-12 Hz\n    *   A J-value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates that the two coupled vinylic protons are **trans** to each other. This immediately eliminates the *cis* isomers: Cis-propenyl acetate (D) and Cis-butenyl acetate (A).\n\n*   **Signal 4: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is a typical value for an allylic methyl group (a methyl group attached to a double bond, C=C-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** A doublet indicates this methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton. This confirms the presence of a CH₃-CH= fragment.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Represents one proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** Also in the vinylic region.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq):** A doublet of quartets. This complex splitting pattern means the proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   **Doublet (d):** It's coupled to one other proton. This must be the other vinylic proton (the one at 7.0 ppm), and the coupling constant for this split must be 16.0 Hz.\n        *   **Quartet (q):** It's coupled to a group of three equivalent protons (n+1 = 3+1 = 4). This corresponds to coupling with the adjacent methyl group we identified from the signal at 1.6 ppm.\n\n**2. Assemble the Structure**\n\nLet's piece together the fragments we've identified:\n1.  An acetate group: **-O-CO-CH₃** (from the 2.1 ppm signal).\n2.  A trans double bond with two protons: **-CH=CH-** (from the 7.0 ppm signal's J-value).\n3.  A methyl group attached to the double bond: **CH₃-CH=** (from the 1.6 ppm and 5.5 ppm signals).\n\nCombining these pieces gives us the following structure:\n**CH₃ - CH = CH - O - CO - CH₃**\n\nThe stereochemistry is **trans**, as determined by the J = 16.0 Hz coupling constant.\n\nThis structure is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **A) Cis-butenyl acetate:** Incorrect. The stereochemistry is cis, and it's a butenyl group, not a propenyl group. A butenyl group would have signals for an ethyl group (CH₃CH₂-), which are not observed.\n*   **B) Trans-butenyl acetate:** Incorrect. While the stereochemistry is trans, this compound has a butenyl group. We would expect signals for an ethyl group, not the observed doublet for a methyl group attached to the double bond.\n*   **C) Trans-propenyl acetate:** Correct. This structure perfectly matches all aspects of the 1H NMR data: the trans stereochemistry (J=16.0 Hz), the acetate singlet (2.1 ppm), the allylic methyl doublet (1.6 ppm), and the two distinct vinylic protons with their characteristic splitting patterns and chemical shifts (7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm).\n*   **D) Cis-propenyl acetate:** Incorrect. The stereochemistry is cis (J ≈ 6-12 Hz), which contradicts the observed J = 16.0 Hz.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound from its 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Signal 1: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). The value is relatively high (downfield), suggesting the proton is attached to a carbon that is bonded to an electron-withdrawing atom, like oxygen.\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents one proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** The signal is split into a doublet, which means it has one neighboring proton.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a large coupling constant for vinylic protons. The magnitude of the J-coupling constant between two protons on a double bond is indicative of their stereochemistry. A value of ~12-18 Hz is characteristic of a *trans* relationship, while a value of ~6-12 Hz indicates a *cis* relationship. The value of 16.0 Hz strongly suggests a *trans* configuration.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** Also in the vinylic region.\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents one proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This means the proton is coupled to two different sets of neighbors. The \"d\" (doublet) indicates coupling to one proton, and the \"q\" (quartet) indicates coupling to three equivalent protons (a methyl group).\n\n*   **Signal 3: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This is the typical region for protons of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (CH₃-C=O), which is characteristic of an acetate group.\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The signal is not split, meaning there are no protons on the adjacent atom. This is consistent with an acetate methyl group.\n\n*   **Signal 4: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region (protons on a carbon adjacent to a C=C double bond).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, a methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** The signal is split into a doublet, meaning it is coupled to one neighboring proton.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Candidate Structures**\n\nFirst, let's check the total number of protons. The data accounts for 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n\n*   **Propenyl Acetate (C₅H₈O₂):** The structure is CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃. The total number of protons is 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8. This matches the data.\n*   **Butenyl Acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂):** The structure would be CH₃-CH₂-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃ (or another isomer). The total number of protons is 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 10. This does not match the data. Therefore, we can eliminate both Cis- and Trans-butenyl acetate.\n\nNow we only need to distinguish between Cis- and Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**3. Assign the Signals to Trans-propenyl acetate**\n\nLet's look at the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate:\n```\n      H(b)   H(a)\n       \\    /\n        C == C\n       /      \\\n CH₃(c)        O-C(=O)-CH₃(d)\n```\n\n*   **Protons (d) - Acetate methyl:** These 3 protons are isolated and have no neighbors. They should be a singlet. This matches the signal at **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**.\n*   **Protons (c) - Allylic methyl:** These 3 protons are adjacent to proton (b). They are coupled to this single proton, so they should appear as a doublet. This matches the signal at **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**.\n*   **Proton (b) - Vinylic proton:** This proton is coupled to proton (a) (one proton, so it will be a doublet) and also to the three protons of the methyl group (c) (three protons, so it will be a quartet). The resulting multiplicity is a doublet of quartets. This perfectly matches the signal at **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**.\n*   **Proton (a) - Vinylic proton:** This proton is adjacent to the electronegative oxygen atom, which shifts it downfield. It is coupled only to proton (b), so it should appear as a doublet. This matches the signal at **7.0 ppm (1H, d)**.\n\n**4. Confirm Stereochemistry**\n\nThe final and most crucial piece of evidence is the coupling constant of the doublet at 7.0 ppm, which is **J = 16.0 Hz**. This large value is characteristic of protons in a *trans* configuration on a double bond. If the compound were Cis-propenyl acetate, the coupling constant would be much smaller (typically 6-12 Hz).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll pieces of the 1H NMR data (chemical shifts, integrations, multiplicities, and the key coupling constant) are perfectly consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown organic compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Number of Protons and Structure Size**\n\nFirst, let's sum the integrations of all the signals in the 1H NMR spectrum to determine the total number of protons in the molecule.\n- Integration: 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8H.\nThe unknown compound has a total of 8 protons.\n\nNow, let's determine the number of protons for the possible options:\n- **Propenyl acetate:** The molecular formula is C5H8O2. The structure is CH3-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3. The total number of protons is 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8H. This matches the NMR data.\n- **Butenyl acetate:** The molecular formula is C6H10O2. For example, 1-butenyl acetate (CH3CH2CH=CH-O-CO-CH3) has 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 10H. This does not match the NMR data.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound must be a propenyl acetate. This eliminates options A (Cis-butenyl acetate) and C (Trans-butenyl acetate). We are left with Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Signals and Assign them to the Propenyl Acetate Structure**\n\nThe structure is `CH3(c)-CH(b)=CH(a)-O-CO-CH3(d)`. Let's analyze each signal:\n\n- **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet in the region of ~2.0-2.2 ppm integrating to 3 protons is characteristic of an acetyl methyl group (-O-CO-C**H**3). This proton group (d) has no adjacent protons, so it appears as a singlet. This is consistent with an acetate structure.\n\n- **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This is a methyl group attached to the double bond (`C**H**3(c)-CH=`). It integrates to 3 protons and is a doublet because it is coupled to the single adjacent vinylic proton, H(b).\n\n- **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal is for a single proton, H(b). It is split into a doublet by the adjacent vinylic proton H(a), and into a quartet by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (c). This results in a doublet of quartets (dq). Its chemical shift is in the vinylic region.\n\n- **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal is for the other single vinylic proton, H(a). It is attached to the carbon bearing the electronegative oxygen atom, which deshields it significantly, shifting it far downfield. It is split into a doublet by the single adjacent vinylic proton, H(b).\n\n### **3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nThe key to distinguishing between the cis and trans isomers is the coupling constant (J) between the two vinylic protons, H(a) and H(b).\n\n- The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a reported coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n- For vinylic protons:\n    - A **trans** configuration typically shows a large coupling constant, usually in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    - A **cis** configuration typically shows a smaller coupling constant, usually in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nSince the observed coupling constant is 16.0 Hz, which falls squarely in the range for a trans coupling, the two vinylic protons are in a **trans** orientation relative to each other.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the total number of protons (8H) and the large vinylic coupling constant (16.0 Hz), the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nThe structure is:\n      H\n     /\nCH3-C=C-O-CO-CH3\n   /\n  H\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Protons (Integration)**\n\nFirst, let's sum the integration values from the 1H NMR data to find the total number of protons in the molecule.\n*   Integration = 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n\nNow, let's determine the total number of protons for the possible compounds. All options are acetates, which have a -OCOCH3 group containing 3 protons.\n*   **Propenyl acetate:** A propenyl group is C3H5. So, propenyl acetate (C3H5OCOCH3) has 5 + 3 = **8 protons**. This matches our data.\n*   **Butenyl acetate:** A butenyl group is C4H7. So, butenyl acetate (C4H7OCOCH3) has 7 + 3 = **10 protons**. This does not match our data.\n\nThis initial analysis immediately rules out the butenyl acetate options. The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**Eliminated Options:**\n*   B) Trans-butenyl acetate\n*   D) Cis-butenyl acetate\n\n**2. Analyze the Coupling Constant (J-value)**\n\nWe are left with two possibilities: Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The key to distinguishing between them is the coupling constant (J) between the two vinylic protons (the protons on the C=C double bond).\n\n*   The provided data shows a signal at **7.0 ppm** which is a doublet (d) with a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   The magnitude of the coupling constant between vinylic protons is dependent on their stereochemistry:\n    *   **Trans** coupling (protons on opposite sides of the double bond) results in a large J-value, typically in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis** coupling (protons on the same side of the double bond) results in a smaller J-value, typically in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nSince the observed coupling constant is 16.0 Hz, it falls squarely within the range for a **trans** double bond. This allows us to conclude that the compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**Eliminated Option:**\n*   C) Cis-propenyl acetate\n\n**3. Confirm the Structure by Assigning All Signals**\n\nThe only remaining option is **Trans-propenyl acetate**. Let's verify that all the signals in the spectrum match this structure.\n\n**Structure of Trans-propenyl acetate:**\n\n      H(c)   H(b)\n       \\    /\n        C==C\n       /    \\\n    H3C(d)    O-C(=O)-CH3(a)\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This corresponds to the three protons of the acetate methyl group **(a)**. They are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons, so they appear as a singlet. This is a characteristic chemical shift for an acetate group. This is a perfect match.\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This corresponds to the vinylic proton **(b)**, which is attached to the same carbon as the oxygen atom. The electronegative oxygen deshields this proton, shifting it far downfield. It is coupled only to proton **(c)** in a *trans* configuration, resulting in a doublet with a large J-value. This is a perfect match.\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This corresponds to the other vinylic proton **(c)**. It is coupled to proton **(b)** (which splits it into a doublet) and also to the three protons of the methyl group **(d)** (which splits it into a quartet). The resulting pattern is a doublet of quartets (dq). This is a perfect match.\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This corresponds to the three protons of the methyl group **(d)**, which is attached to the double bond. These protons are coupled to the single vinylic proton **(c)**, splitting their signal into a doublet. This is a perfect match.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll pieces of the 1H NMR data (chemical shifts, integrations, and splitting patterns including the crucial coupling constant) are fully consistent with the structure of **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This indicates a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s):** A singlet means this methyl group has no protons on the adjacent carbon atom.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a methyl group attached to the carbonyl of an acetate ester (-O-C(=O)-CH₃). All four possible compounds are acetates, so this signal is consistent with all of them.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This is another methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** A doublet means this methyl group is adjacent to a carbon with one proton (-CH-). This suggests an allylic methyl group, like CH₃-CH=.\n\n*   **Signal 3: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal corresponds to a single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~5.5 ppm):** This value is in the vinyl region, meaning the proton is part of a carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq):** A doublet of quartets means this proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons: one single proton (giving the doublet, 'd') and a set of three protons (giving the quartet, 'q'). This is consistent with a proton in a CH₃-C**H**=CH- fragment.\n\n*   **Signal 4: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal corresponds to a single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~7.0 ppm):** This is also in the vinyl region (-CH=CH-). The high chemical shift (downfield) suggests it's attached to a carbon that is also bonded to the electron-withdrawing oxygen atom (-CH=CH-O-).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** A doublet means this proton is coupled to only one adjacent proton.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the most crucial piece of information for determining the stereochemistry.\n\n**2. Determine the Carbon Skeleton (Propenyl vs. Butenyl)**\n\nLet's count the total protons described by the signals, excluding the acetate methyl group:\n*   1.6 ppm (3H) + 5.5 ppm (1H) + 7.0 ppm (1H) = 5 protons.\n\nNow let's compare this to the possible structures:\n*   **Propenyl group (CH₃-CH=CH-):** Has 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 protons. This matches the data.\n*   **Butenyl group (e.g., CH₃CH₂-CH=CH-):** Has 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 7 protons. This does not match the data.\n\nTherefore, the compound must be a **propenyl acetate**, which eliminates options A (Trans-butenyl acetate) and B (Cis-butenyl acetate).\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nThe choice is now between Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The geometry of the double bond is determined by the coupling constant (J) between the two vinyl protons (the signals at 5.5 ppm and 7.0 ppm).\n\n*   The signal at 7.0 ppm has a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   The established rules for vinyl proton coupling are:\n    *   **Trans**-coupling (protons on opposite sides of the double bond) typically have a large J-value of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis**-coupling (protons on the same side of the double bond) have a smaller J-value of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nSince the observed coupling constant is 16.0 Hz, it falls squarely in the range for a **trans** double bond.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis leads to the following conclusions:\n*   The compound is an **acetate**. (from 2.1 ppm signal)\n*   The alkyl group is **propenyl**. (from proton count)\n*   The double bond has a **trans** configuration. (from J = 16.0 Hz)\n\nCombining these facts, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nThe user wants me to identify an unknown organic compound from the provided 1H NMR data and choose from four possible options.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nLet's break down the information provided for each signal:\n*   **Signal 1:** `2.1 ppm (3H, s)`\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents 3 protons, likely a methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is typical for protons on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O), specifically an acetyl methyl group (CH₃-C=O).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s - singlet):** There are no protons on the adjacent atom, which is consistent with the `CH₃-C=O-O-` structure of an acetate group.\n\n*   **Signal 2:** `1.6 ppm (3H, d)`\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents another methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d - doublet):** The signal is split into two peaks, which means this methyl group is adjacent to a single proton (-CH-). This suggests a `CH-CH₃` fragment.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the region for an allylic methyl group (a methyl group attached to a C=C double bond).\n\n*   **Signal 3:** `7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)`\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Represents a single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is in the vinyl region (protons on a C=C double bond). The significant downfield shift suggests this proton is attached to a carbon that is also bonded to an electronegative atom, like the oxygen in an ester (`-O-CH=`).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d - doublet):** This proton is coupled to one other adjacent proton.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This value is crucial for determining stereochemistry.\n\n*   **Signal 4:** `5.5 ppm (1H, dq)`\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Represents a single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** Also in the vinyl region.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq - doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons. The 'doublet' part comes from coupling to one other proton (the one at 7.0 ppm). The 'quartet' part comes from coupling to the three protons of a methyl group (the one at 1.6 ppm).\n\n**2. Assemble the Fragments**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following fragments:\n*   An acetate group: `CH₃COO-` (from the signal at 2.1 ppm).\n*   A propenyl group with a specific arrangement: `-CH=CH-CH₃` (from the signals at 1.6, 5.5, and 7.0 ppm).\n\nCombining these gives the structure for propenyl acetate: `CH₃-COO-CH=CH-CH₃`.\nThis confirms the compound is either cis- or trans-propenyl acetate, and we can rule out the butenyl acetate options (B and C). Butenyl acetate would have 10 protons (C₆H₁₀O₂), while our data shows 8 protons (1+1+3+3), matching the formula for propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂).\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nThe distinction between the cis and trans isomers is made using the vicinal coupling constant (`³J`) between the two protons on the double bond.\n*   **Rule of thumb:**\n    *   For `trans` protons on a double bond, `J` is typically large: **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   For `cis` protons on a double bond, `J` is typically smaller: **6-12 Hz**.\n\nThe given coupling constant is **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value falls squarely within the range for a `trans` configuration.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe molecular formula, fragment analysis, and splitting patterns all point to propenyl acetate. The large coupling constant of 16.0 Hz between the vinylic protons is definitive evidence for a `trans` geometry. Therefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n*   Structure: Trans-propenyl acetate (`CH₃-COO-CH(a)=CH(b)-CH₃(c)`)\n*   Signal at 2.1 ppm: Acetate `CH₃` (singlet, 3H) - ✓\n*   Signal at 1.6 ppm: `CH₃(c)` (doublet, split by H(b), 3H) - ✓\n*   Signal at 7.0 ppm: `H(a)` (downfield due to oxygen, doublet from H(b), J_trans ≈ 16 Hz, 1H) - ✓\n*   Signal at 5.5 ppm: `H(b)` (doublet from H(a), quartet from CH₃(c), 1H) - ✓\nAll data matches perfectly.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Integration (Number of Protons):**\nFirst, let's sum the number of protons represented by each signal:\n1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons in total.\n\nNow let's check the proton counts for the possible options:\n*   **Propenyl acetate** (CH₃-CH=CH-O-CO-CH₃): 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8 protons. This matches the data.\n*   **Butenyl acetate** (e.g., Crotyl acetate, CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-O-CO-CH₃): 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 10 protons. This does not match. Other butenyl acetate isomers also have more than 8 protons.\n\nBased on the total number of protons, we can immediately rule out Cis-butenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate. The choice is now between Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze the Chemical Shifts and Multiplicities:**\n\nLet's break down each signal from the provided data:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This represents a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** This methyl group has no adjacent protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~2.1 ppm):** This is a characteristic shift for the protons of an acetyl group (CH₃-C=O). This fits the \"acetate\" part of the name.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This is another methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This methyl group is coupled to one adjacent proton (according to the n+1 rule). This implies a -CH-CH₃ fragment.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~1.6 ppm):** This shift is typical for an allylic methyl group (a methyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond). This signal corresponds to the CH₃ group on the propenyl part of the molecule.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz) and 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Integration (1H each):** These are two single protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~5-7 ppm):** These shifts are in the vinylic region, meaning these protons are attached directly to the carbons of the C=C double bond.\n    *   The proton at 7.0 ppm is significantly downfield (deshielded) because it is on the same carbon as the electron-withdrawing oxygen atom of the acetate group (-O-CH=). It's a doublet because it's only coupled to the other vinylic proton.\n    *   The proton at 5.5 ppm is coupled to two different sets of protons, hence the \"dq\" (doublet of quartets) multiplicity. The \"doublet\" part comes from splitting by the other vinylic proton (at 7.0 ppm), and the \"quartet\" part comes from splitting by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (at 1.6 ppm).\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n\nThe key to distinguishing between the Cis and Trans isomers is the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinylic protons.\n*   The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   The magnitude of the coupling constant between vinylic protons is dependent on the angle between them:\n    *   **Trans** coupling (protons on opposite sides of the double bond) results in a large J-value, typically in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis** coupling (protons on the same side of the double bond) results in a smaller J-value, typically in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nSince the observed coupling constant is 16.0 Hz, it falls squarely within the range for trans-vinylic protons. This indicates that the molecule has a trans configuration at the double bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis of the 1H NMR spectrum points to a structure with 8 protons, containing an acetyl group and a trans-propenyl group. This corresponds to **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown organic compound.\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula from Integration:**\n\n*   First, sum the integration values of all the signals: 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8H.\n*   This means the molecule contains a total of 8 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Let's check the number of hydrogens in the possible compounds:\n    *   Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2): Has 8 hydrogens.\n    *   Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2): Has 10 hydrogens.\n*   Since the total integration corresponds to 8 hydrogens, the unknown compound must be a propenyl acetate. This eliminates options A (Trans-butenyl acetate) and D (Cis-butenyl acetate).\n\n**2. Assign the Signals to the Protons of Propenyl Acetate:**\n\nThe structure of propenyl acetate is CH3-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3. We have four distinct sets of protons.\n\n*   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   This is a singlet (s), meaning it has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   The integration is 3H.\n    *   The chemical shift of ~2.1 ppm is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (the acetate methyl). This perfectly matches the -O-CO-**CH3** group.\n\n*   **Signals for the Propenyl Group (CH3-CH=CH-):**\n    We have three signals left for the three types of protons in this group.\n    *   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This is a doublet (d) with an integration of 3H. This corresponds to the methyl group (**CH3**-CH=) on the double bond. It is split into a doublet because it is coupled to the single adjacent vinyl proton.\n    *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a doublet (d) for one proton (1H). It is the most downfield signal (highest ppm value), which indicates it is heavily deshielded. In an enol acetate structure like this, the proton on the carbon attached to the oxygen (=CH-O) is the most deshielded. So, this signal corresponds to the -CH=**CH**-O- proton. It is a doublet because it is coupled to the other vinyl proton.\n    *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This is a doublet of quartets (dq) for one proton (1H). This signal must correspond to the remaining proton in the middle of the propenyl chain (-**CH**=CH-O-).\n        *   It is coupled to the adjacent vinyl proton (at 7.0 ppm), causing it to split into a **doublet**.\n        *   It is also coupled to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (at 1.6 ppm), causing it to split into a **quartet** (3+1=4).\n        *   Therefore, the multiplicity is a doublet of quartets, which matches the data.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n\n*   The distinction between cis and trans isomers is determined by the coupling constant (J) between the two vinyl protons (the ones on the double bond).\n*   The typical range for the vicinal coupling constant (³J) across a double bond is:\n    *   **Trans:** 12 - 18 Hz (large coupling)\n    *   **Cis:** 6 - 12 Hz (small coupling)\n*   The data for the signal at 7.0 ppm shows a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   This large value falls squarely in the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the total number of protons (8H), the signal assignments, and particularly the large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz), the unknown compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the unknown compound from its 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n\nLet's examine each signal provided:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon, specifically an acetate group (CH₃-C=O).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** A singlet means these protons are not coupled to any neighboring protons. This is consistent with an isolated acetate methyl group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This peak corresponds to the methyl group of the acetate ester, which is present in all four possible compounds.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal also represents three protons, so it is a methyl group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~1.6 ppm):** This shift is typical for an allylic methyl group (a methyl group attached to a C=C double bond).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** A doublet means this methyl group is coupled to one adjacent proton (n+1 rule: 2 peaks = n+1, so n=1). This indicates a `CH₃-CH=` structural fragment.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal eliminates the butenyl acetate options. Butenyl acetate (`CH₃COOCH=CHCH₂CH₃`) would have a terminal ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`), which would show up as a triplet for the `CH₃` and a quartet for the `CH₂`, not a methyl doublet. Therefore, the compound must be a propenyl acetate.\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This is a single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~5.5 ppm):** This shift is in the vinylic region (a proton on a C=C double bond).\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This is a complex splitting pattern which tells us this proton is being split by two different sets of neighbors.\n        *   The **doublet (\"d\")** part comes from being coupled to one other proton. This must be the other proton on the double bond.\n        *   The **quartet (\"q\")** part comes from being coupled to three equivalent protons (n+1 rule: 4 peaks = n+1, so n=3). This must be the neighboring allylic methyl group (`CH₃`) we identified at 1.6 ppm.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This proton is the one on the double bond that is also adjacent to the methyl group: `=CH-CH₃`.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This is the other single vinylic proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~7.0 ppm):** This proton is significantly downfield (higher ppm value) compared to the other vinylic proton. This is due to the deshielding effect of the adjacent electronegative oxygen atom from the ester group (`-O-CH=`).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This proton is coupled only to the other vinylic proton (at 5.5 ppm).\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the key piece of information to determine the stereochemistry. The magnitude of the coupling constant (J value) between two protons on a double bond is dependent on their geometry:\n        *   **Trans protons:** J values are typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n        *   **Cis protons:** J values are smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The observed J value of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely in the trans range. This confirms the two vinylic protons are on opposite sides of the double bond.\n\n**2. Assembling the Structure:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have:\n*   An acetate group: `CH₃COO-`\n*   A propenyl group with a trans double bond: `-CH=CH-CH₃`\n*   The vinylic proton at 7.0 ppm is attached to the oxygen, and the vinylic proton at 5.5 ppm is attached to the methyl group.\n\nPutting it all together, the structure is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n      H₃C                H\n         \\              /\n          C = C\n         /     \\\n      H₃C-C-O        H\n         ||\n         O\n\n**3. Matching with Options:**\n\n*   A) Trans-butenyl acetate - Incorrect, not a butenyl chain.\n*   B) Cis-propenyl acetate - Incorrect, J value would be smaller.\n*   C) Trans-propenyl acetate - Correct. All data points match this structure.\n*   D) Cis-butenyl acetate - Incorrect, not a butenyl chain and wrong stereochemistry.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Total Proton Count:** First, let's determine the total number of protons represented in the spectrum. By adding the integrations (the number of protons for each signal), we get 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n\n2.  **Compare Proton Count with Possible Compounds:**\n    *   **Propenyl acetate:** The molecular formula is C5H8O2. This molecule has 8 hydrogen atoms (protons). This matches our proton count.\n    *   **Butenyl acetate:** The molecular formula is C6H10O2. This molecule has 10 hydrogen atoms (protons). This does not match our proton count.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Based on the integration alone, we can rule out both Cis-butenyl acetate (D) and Trans-butenyl acetate (A). The unknown compound must be either Cis- or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Signals in Detail to Determine the Isomer (Cis vs. Trans):**\n\n    *   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet (s) for 3 protons at ~2.1 ppm is highly characteristic of an acetate methyl group (CH₃-C=O). This is present in all the propenyl acetate options.\n\n    *   **Signals in the Alkene Region (7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm):** These two signals are for protons on a carbon-carbon double bond (vinylic protons). Let's call them Hₐ and Hₑ.\n\n    *   **Key Signal: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n        *   This is a single vinylic proton.\n        *   It is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to (split by) only one other proton.\n        *   The crucial piece of information is the coupling constant, **J = 16.0 Hz**. For vinylic protons, a large coupling constant (typically 12-18 Hz) indicates a **trans** relationship across the double bond. A smaller coupling constant (typically 6-12 Hz) would indicate a *cis* relationship.\n        *   The J value of 16.0 Hz strongly suggests a **trans** isomer.\n\n    *   **Let's confirm the other signals fit a Trans-propenyl acetate structure:**\n        *   Structure:\n            \n           CH₃(c)-CH(b)=CH(a)-O-C(=O)-CH₃(d)\n\n        *   **Proton H(a):** This proton is attached to the carbon bonded to the electronegative oxygen atom, which deshields it, causing it to appear at a higher chemical shift (downfield). It is coupled to H(b). This perfectly matches the signal at **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz)**.\n\n        *   **Proton H(b):** This proton is coupled to H(a) (giving a doublet, J=16.0 Hz) and is also coupled to the three protons of the methyl group CH₃(c) (giving a quartet). The resulting splitting pattern is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. This matches the signal at **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**.\n\n        *   **Protons H(c):** This is the methyl group (CH₃) attached to the double bond. It is coupled to the single proton H(b), so it will appear as a **doublet (d)**. This matches the signal at **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**.\n\n        *   **Protons H(d):** This is the acetate methyl group. It has no adjacent protons, so it is a **singlet (s)**. This matches the signal at **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The total proton count rules out the butenyl acetate options. The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) between the vinylic protons is characteristic of a trans-alkene. All signals in the spectrum perfectly match the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown organic compound from the provided 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's break down each signal provided in the 1H NMR spectrum:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is characteristic of protons on a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** The signal represents three equivalent protons, consistent with a methyl (CH₃) group.\n    *   **Splitting (s):** A singlet indicates that this methyl group has no adjacent protons.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal corresponds to an acetyl group (CH₃C=O).\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic/vinylic region, suggesting a methyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal also represents a methyl (CH₃) group.\n    *   **Splitting (d):** A doublet indicates this methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a CH₃-CH= group.\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This is in the alkene (vinylic) region for a proton directly on a double bond.\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents a single proton.\n    *   **Splitting (dq):** A doublet of quartets means this proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons: one single proton (causing the doublet splitting) and a group of three equivalent protons (causing the quartet splitting).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This proton is on the double bond and is adjacent to both another single proton on the double bond and the methyl group we identified at 1.6 ppm. This confirms the `CH₃-CH=` fragment from the previous signal.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is also in the vinylic region, quite downfield, which suggests it is attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen (e.g., in an enol ether or enol ester).\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents a single proton.\n    *   **Splitting (d):** A doublet means this proton is coupled to one adjacent proton. This must be the proton at 5.5 ppm.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a crucial piece of information. The magnitude of the coupling constant (J-value) between two protons across a double bond tells us about their stereochemical relationship. A large J-value (typically 12-18 Hz) is characteristic of a *trans* arrangement. A smaller J-value (typically 6-12 Hz) would indicate a *cis* arrangement.\n\n**2. Assemble the Structure**\n\nLet's put the pieces together:\n1.  We have an acetyl group: `CH₃-C(=O)-`.\n2.  We have a `CH₃-CH=` fragment.\n3.  We have a vinylic proton `=-CH-` that is coupled to the `CH₃-CH=` proton and is also deshielded, suggesting it's bonded to an oxygen.\n\nCombining these fragments gives the structure of propenyl acetate: `CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃`.\n\nLet's verify this structure against the data:\n*   `CH₃` (acetyl): Singlet, 3H -> Matches 2.1 ppm signal.\n*   `CH₃` (vinylic): Coupled to one proton (`=CH-`), so it's a doublet, 3H -> Matches 1.6 ppm signal.\n*   `=CH-` (next to methyl): Coupled to the other vinylic proton (doublet) and the vinylic methyl (quartet), so it's a doublet of quartets, 1H -> Matches 5.5 ppm signal.\n*   `=CH-O-`: Coupled to the other vinylic proton, so it's a doublet, 1H -> Matches 7.0 ppm signal.\n\nThe proposed structure of propenyl acetate perfectly fits the connectivity implied by the splitting patterns.\n\n**3. Eliminate Incorrect Options**\n\nThe options include \"butenyl acetate\".\n*   **Propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂):** The total number of protons is 3+1+1+3 = 8. This matches the integration values from the spectrum (3+3+1+1=8).\n*   **Butenyl acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂):** The total number of protons is 10. This does not match the integration from the spectrum.\nTherefore, we can eliminate options B (Cis-butenyl acetate) and D (Trans-butenyl acetate).\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry**\n\nWe are left with Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The decision is made based on the coupling constant of the vinylic protons.\n\n*   The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   As stated before, a J-value between 12-18 Hz is definitive for a **trans** configuration of protons on a double bond.\n*   If the compound were cis, the J-value would be in the 6-12 Hz range.\n\nThus, the unknown compound must have a trans double bond.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe compound has the structure of propenyl acetate and the vinylic protons are in a trans configuration. The correct identification is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown organic compound from the provided 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Protons and Signals**\n\n*   The provided 1H NMR data shows four distinct signals.\n*   The integration values for these signals are 1H, 1H, 3H, and 3H.\n*   The total number of hydrogen atoms (protons) in the molecule is the sum of these integrations: 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 protons.\n\nNow, let's determine the total number of protons for each of the possible compounds:\n*   **Propenyl acetate (Cis or Trans):** The molecular formula is C5H8O2. This corresponds to 8 hydrogen atoms. This is consistent with the NMR data.\n    *   Structure: CH3-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3\n    *   Protons: 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8H.\n*   **Butenyl acetate (Cis or Trans):** The molecular formula is C6H10O2. This corresponds to 10 hydrogen atoms. This is inconsistent with the NMR data.\n    *   Structure: CH3-CH2-CH=CH-O-CO-CH3\n    *   Protons: 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 10H.\n\nSince the total proton count from the NMR data is 8, we can confidently **eliminate Cis-butenyl acetate (D) and Trans-butenyl acetate (C)**. The compound must be either Cis- or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze the Chemical Shifts and Splitting Patterns**\n\nLet's analyze the remaining two options, Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate, and match the signals to the protons in the structure: CH3(a)-CH(b)=CH(c)-O-CO-CH3(d).\n\n*   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   This is a singlet (s), meaning it has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   It integrates to 3 protons, suggesting a methyl (CH3) group.\n    *   A chemical shift of ~2.1 ppm is characteristic of the methyl protons of an acetate group (-O-CO-**CH3**). This corresponds to **CH3(d)**. This signal is expected for both cis and trans isomers.\n\n*   **Signals for the Propenyl Group (CH3(a)-CH(b)=CH(c)-):** We have three remaining signals: 7.0 ppm (1H, d), 5.5 ppm (1H, dq), and 1.6 ppm (3H, d).\n    *   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This is a doublet (d) integrating to 3H. This is characteristic of a methyl group (**CH3(a)**) that is coupled to a single adjacent proton (CH(b)). The splitting into a doublet confirms this coupling.\n    *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a vinyl proton (a proton on a C=C double bond). The high chemical shift (downfield) is due to its attachment to the deshielding oxygen atom of the ester group. This signal corresponds to proton **H(c)**. It is split into a doublet (d) because it is coupled to the other vinyl proton, H(b).\n    *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal corresponds to the remaining vinyl proton, **H(b)**. It is split by two different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   It is coupled to the single proton H(c), splitting the signal into a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   It is also coupled to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group CH3(a), which splits the signal further into a **quartet (q)**.\n        *   The combined splitting pattern is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n\nThe assignment of all signals, their integrations, and their splitting patterns is fully consistent with the structure of propenyl acetate.\n\n**3. Use the Coupling Constant (J) to Determine Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nThe final and most crucial piece of evidence is the coupling constant (J-value) of the signal at 7.0 ppm, which is **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value represents the coupling between the two vinyl protons, H(b) and H(c).\n\nThe magnitude of the coupling constant between vicinal protons on a double bond is highly dependent on their stereochemical relationship:\n*   **Trans-coupling (³J_trans):** Protons are on opposite sides of the double bond. The coupling constant is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n*   **Cis-coupling (³J_cis):** Protons are on the same side of the double bond. The coupling constant is smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nThe observed coupling constant of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely within the range for a **trans** configuration. This indicates that the two vinyl protons are on opposite sides of the double bond.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the total proton count, the chemical shifts, the splitting patterns, and particularly the large vicinal coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz), the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown organic compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's break down the provided information:\n*   **Signal 1:** `7.0 ppm`, Integration: `1H`, Multiplicity: `d` (doublet), Coupling constant: `J = 16.0 Hz`. This signal represents one proton and is in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond). The multiplicity indicates it's coupled to one neighboring proton. The large coupling constant is significant.\n*   **Signal 2:** `5.5 ppm`, Integration: `1H`, Multiplicity: `dq` (doublet of quartets). This is another vinylic proton. The complex multiplicity suggests it's coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons: one proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three protons (giving the quartet).\n*   **Signal 3:** `2.1 ppm`, Integration: `3H`, Multiplicity: `s` (singlet). This signal represents a methyl group (3H) with no adjacent protons. Its chemical shift is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (C=O), specifically an acetate group (CH₃-C(=O)O-).\n*   **Signal 4:** `1.6 ppm`, Integration: `3H`, Multiplicity: `d` (doublet). This represents another methyl group. The doublet multiplicity means it is coupled to one adjacent proton.\n\n**2. Determine the Molecular Formula and Basic Structure**\n\n*   **Total Protons:** Summing the integrations (1H + 1H + 3H + 3H) gives a total of 8 protons in the molecule.\n*   **Presence of Acetate Group:** The signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s) strongly indicates an acetate group (CH₃COO-). All four options are acetates, so this is consistent.\n*   **\"Propenyl\" vs. \"Butenyl\":**\n    *   **Propenyl acetate (C₃H₅-O-CO-CH₃):** The molecular formula is C₅H₈O₂. It has 5 protons from the propenyl group and 3 from the acetate group, totaling 8 protons. This matches the integration data.\n    *   **Butenyl acetate (C₄H₇-O-CO-CH₃):** The molecular formula is C₆H₁₀O₂. It has 7 protons from the butenyl group and 3 from the acetate group, totaling 10 protons. This does **not** match the integration data.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound must be a **propenyl acetate**. This eliminates options B (Trans-butenyl acetate) and D (Cis-butenyl acetate).\n\n**3. Distinguish between Cis and Trans Isomers**\n\nWe are left with two possibilities: Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The key to distinguishing them lies in the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinylic protons (the ones on the C=C double bond).\n\n*   **General Rule for Vinylic Coupling:**\n    *   **Trans-coupling (J_trans):** Protons are on opposite sides of the double bond. The coupling constant is typically large, ranging from **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis-coupling (J_cis):** Protons are on the same side of the double bond. The coupling constant is smaller, ranging from **6-12 Hz**.\n\n*   **Applying the Rule:**\n    *   The data provides a signal at 7.0 ppm with a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n    *   This value falls squarely in the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**4. Assemble the Full Structure and Assign the Peaks**\n\nLet's draw Trans-propenyl acetate and see if all the data fits.\n\n**Structure of Trans-propenyl acetate:**\n```\n        H(b)      O-CO-CH₃(d)\n         \\         /\n          C = C\n         /     \\\n  H₃C(c)        H(a)\n```\n\n*   **Protons H(d):** The acetate methyl group. It has no adjacent protons.\n    *   Expected: 3H, singlet (s), ~2.1 ppm.\n    *   **Matches:** `2.1 ppm (3H, s)`.\n*   **Protons H(a) and H(b):** The vinylic protons on the double bond. They are coupled to each other.\n    *   H(a) is attached to the carbon bonded to the electron-withdrawing oxygen, so it will be the most downfield (highest ppm). It is coupled to one proton, H(b), so it will be a doublet.\n    *   Expected for H(a): 1H, doublet (d), downfield.\n    *   **Matches:** `7.0 ppm (1H, d)`. The coupling constant with H(b) is J = 16.0 Hz, confirming the trans geometry.\n    *   H(b) is coupled to H(a) (1 proton, creating a doublet) and the three H(c) protons (creating a quartet). Thus, H(b) will be a doublet of quartets (dq).\n    *   Expected for H(b): 1H, doublet of quartets (dq), between H(a) and H(c).\n    *   **Matches:** `5.5 ppm (1H, dq)`.\n*   **Protons H(c):** The methyl group on the double bond. It is coupled to one proton, H(b).\n    *   Expected: 3H, doublet (d), ~1.6-1.8 ppm.\n    *   **Matches:** `1.6 ppm (3H, d)`.\n\nThe provided 1H NMR data perfectly matches the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate in every aspect: chemical shift, integration, multiplicity, and coupling constant.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 49:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nWe are given the following signals:\n*   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, which is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The signal is a singlet, meaning these protons are not adjacent to any other protons. This is typical for a methyl group attached to an atom with no hydrogens, such as the carbonyl carbon of an acetyl group (CH3-C=O).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is right in the range for an acetyl methyl group. All four choices are \"acetates,\" so this signal confirms the presence of the `CH3COO-` functional group.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This is another methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** According to the n+1 rule, this methyl group is coupled to one adjacent proton (1+1=2 lines, a doublet). This indicates a `-CH-CH3` fragment.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This shift is in the allylic region, suggesting the methyl group is attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (`C=C-CH3`).\n\n*   **Signal 3: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons.\n        *   The **quartet (q)** part of the splitting arises from being coupled to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (from signal 2). (3+1=4 lines, a quartet).\n        *   The **doublet (d)** part of the splitting arises from being coupled to one other single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This shift is in the vinylic region, meaning this proton is directly attached to a double bond carbon (`C=CH-`). This proton is part of the `-CH=CH-CH3` system.\n\n*   **Signal 4: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** This proton is coupled to one adjacent proton (the one at 5.5 ppm).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is also in the vinylic region. Its high chemical shift (deshielding) suggests it is on a carbon atom directly attached to the electron-withdrawing oxygen atom of the acetate group (`=CH-O-`).\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This value is crucial for determining the geometry (stereochemistry) of the double bond. For protons on a double bond:\n        *   A **trans** arrangement (protons on opposite sides) gives a large coupling constant, typically in the range of 12-18 Hz.\n        *   A **cis** arrangement (protons on the same side) gives a smaller coupling constant, typically 6-12 Hz.\n        The observed J-value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates a **trans** double bond.\n\n**2. Assemble the Structure**\n\n*   From the integration of the signals not related to the acetate group (1H + 3H + 1H = 5H), we can deduce that the alkenyl part is a propenyl group (C3H5). This eliminates the butenyl acetate options (C and D).\n*   The signals describe a `CH3-CH=CH-` fragment attached to the acetate oxygen.\n*   The coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) between the two vinylic protons (at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm) confirms they are in a **trans** configuration.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe compound has an acetate group, a propenyl group, and the double bond has a trans geometry. Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nLet's check this against the options:\nA) Cis-propenyl acetate: Incorrect, the coupling constant would be smaller (~6-12 Hz).\nB) Trans-butenyl acetate: Incorrect, the NMR spectrum for a butenyl group would be different and the total hydrogen count for the alkenyl part doesn't match.\nC) Cis-butenyl acetate: Incorrect, for the same reasons as B and A.\nD) **Trans-propenyl acetate**: Correct. The structure matches all the provided 1H NMR data: four distinct signals with the correct integration, chemical shifts, splitting patterns, and a large coupling constant indicative of a trans double bond.\n\nThe structure of Trans-propenyl acetate and the assignment of protons is:\n\n        H (7.0 ppm, d, J=16 Hz)     H (5.5 ppm, dq)\n         \\                           /\n          C === C\n         /       \\\n      O-CO-CH3 (2.1 ppm, s)           CH3 (1.6 ppm, d)\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Data:**\n\n    1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n        *   Integration (3H) suggests a methyl group (CH3).\n        *   Multiplicity (s, singlet) means this methyl group has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n        *   Chemical shift (~2.1 ppm) is characteristic of the methyl group of an acetate ester (`-O-C(=O)-CH3`).\n        *   This strongly suggests the molecule is an acetate ester. All four options are acetate esters, so this is consistent.\n\n    2.  **Signals at 7.0, 5.5, and 1.6 ppm:**\n        *   These three signals must describe the \"alkyl\" part of the ester (the propenyl or butenyl group).\n        *   The total number of protons from the data is 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n        *   Let's check the number of protons in the proposed structures:\n            *   **Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2):** CH3(3H) + CH(1H) + CH(1H) + OCOCH3(3H) = 8 protons. This matches the data.\n            *   **Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2):** e.g., 2-butenyl acetate has 10 protons. This does not match the data.\n        *   Therefore, we can eliminate the butenyl acetate options (B and C). The compound must be either Cis- or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n    3.  **Structure of Propenyl Acetate (`CH3-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH3`):**\n        *   Let's analyze the remaining signals for the propenyl group (`CH3-CH=CH-`).\n        *   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This corresponds to the methyl group (`CH3-`) attached to the double bond. It is split into a doublet (d) because it is coupled to the adjacent vinyl proton (`-CH=`). This is a correct assignment.\n        *   **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This corresponds to the vinyl proton (`-CH=`) that is adjacent to the methyl group. It is split by the other vinyl proton (into a doublet) and by the three protons of the methyl group (into a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). This is a correct assignment.\n        *   **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This corresponds to the vinyl proton (`=CH-`) attached directly to the electronegative oxygen atom. This explains its high chemical shift (deshielding). It is split into a doublet (d) because it is only coupled to the other vinyl proton. This is a correct assignment.\n\n*   **Determining Cis vs. Trans Stereochemistry:**\n\n    *   The stereochemistry (cis or trans) of the double bond is determined by the magnitude of the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinyl protons (`-CH=CH-`).\n    *   The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n    *   For protons on a double bond:\n        *   A **trans** arrangement leads to a large coupling constant, typically in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n        *   A **cis** arrangement leads to a smaller coupling constant, typically in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n    *   Since the observed coupling constant is 16.0 Hz, this is characteristic of a **trans** double bond.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n\n    *   The compound has an acetate group and a propenyl group, ruling out butenyl acetates.\n    *   The coupling constant of 16.0 Hz between the vinylic protons confirms a trans configuration for the double bond.\n    *   Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Total Number of Protons (Integration):**\n    First, let's sum the integration values from the 1H NMR data to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule.\n    Total Protons = 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8H.\n    The unknown compound has a total of 8 hydrogen atoms.\n\n2.  **Compare with the Molecular Formulas of the Options:**\n    *   **Propenyl acetate:** The propenyl group is C3H5 and the acetate group is C2H3O2. The molecular formula is C5H8O2. This molecule has 8 hydrogens, which matches our data.\n    *   **Butenyl acetate:** The butenyl group is C4H7 and the acetate group is C2H3O2. The molecular formula is C6H10O2. This molecule has 10 hydrogens.\n\n    Since the unknown compound has 8 hydrogens, it must be a **propenyl acetate**. We can therefore eliminate the butenyl acetate options: Cis-butenyl acetate (C) and Trans-butenyl acetate (B).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Chemical Shifts and Splitting Patterns:**\n    The remaining options are Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The structure is CH3-COO-CH=CH-CH3. Let's analyze the expected signals and compare them to the given data.\n\n    *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal is a singlet, meaning the protons are not coupled to any neighbors. It integrates to 3 protons. This is characteristic of the methyl group of an acetate (CH3-COO-). Its chemical shift is also typical for this group.\n    *   **Vinyl Group Protons (-CH=CH-):** There are two protons on the double bond.\n        *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This proton is significantly downfield (high ppm), which is consistent with the vinylic proton attached directly to the electronegative oxygen atom (CH3-COO-**CH**=). It is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to one adjacent proton, which is the other vinylic proton.\n        *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This is the other vinylic proton (=-**CH**-CH3). It's a doublet of quartets (dq) because it is split by the other vinylic proton (creating the doublet) and by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (creating the quartet).\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This is the methyl group attached to the double bond (-CH=CH-**CH3**). It is a doublet (d) because it is coupled to the single proton on the adjacent vinylic carbon.\n\n    The chemical shifts, integrations, and splitting patterns all perfectly match the structure of propenyl acetate.\n\n4.  **Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n    The key to distinguishing between the cis and trans isomers is the coupling constant (J) between the two vinylic protons. The J-value represents the magnitude of the interaction between coupled protons, and its size is highly dependent on their spatial orientation.\n    *   **Trans-coupling (J_trans):** Protons on opposite sides of a double bond have a large coupling constant, typically in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis-coupling (J_cis):** Protons on the same side of a double bond have a smaller coupling constant, typically in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\n    The data for the signal at 7.0 ppm shows a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value is large and falls squarely within the expected range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the number of protons and the detailed analysis of the NMR signals, particularly the large J-coupling constant of 16.0 Hz, the unknown compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown organic compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Provided 1H NMR Data:**\n\n*   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is characteristic of a methyl group (CH3) attached to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The signal is a singlet, which means these three protons have no adjacent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This signal strongly indicates the presence of an acetyl group (CH3COO-). All four possible options contain an acetate group, so this is consistent.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This is another methyl group.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is a typical shift for an allylic or vinylic methyl group (a CH3 group attached to a C=C double bond).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** The signal is a doublet, meaning this methyl group is coupled to one adjacent proton.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This indicates a CH3-CH= fragment.\n\n*   **Signal 3: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents one proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This is in the alkene (vinyl) region, typical for a proton on a C=C double bond.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons. The \"d\" (doublet) indicates it is coupled to one proton. The \"q\" (quartet) indicates it is coupled to three equivalent protons (a methyl group).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This confirms the CH3-CH=CH- fragment. This proton is the one in the middle (=CH-), coupled to the adjacent vinyl proton (creating the doublet) and the adjacent methyl group (creating the quartet).\n\n*   **Signal 4: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal also represents one proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a vinyl proton. This strong deshielding effect is caused by an adjacent electronegative atom, in this case, the oxygen of the acetate group. So, this proton is part of a C=CH-O fragment.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** It is coupled to one adjacent proton (the one at 5.5 ppm).\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This value is crucial for determining stereochemistry. For protons across a double bond (vicinal coupling), a large coupling constant (typically 12-18 Hz) indicates a **trans** configuration. A smaller J value (6-12 Hz) would indicate a *cis* configuration.\n\n**2. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options:**\n\n*   **Fragments Identified:** We have an acetate group (CH3COO-), and a propenyl group (CH3-CH=CH-). The linkage is confirmed by the proton at 7.0 ppm being attached to the oxygen. The full structure is **CH3-CH=CH-O-COCH3**. This is named **propenyl acetate** (specifically, prop-1-en-1-yl acetate).\n*   This rules out **Cis-butenyl acetate** and **Trans-butenyl acetate**, as those molecules would contain a four-carbon butenyl group and would produce a different NMR spectrum. For instance, a butenyl group would introduce additional protons (e.g., from an ethyl group or a methylene group) that are not seen in the provided data.\n*   **Determine Stereochemistry:** The decision is now between Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. The coupling constant between the two vinyl protons (the ones at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm) is given as **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value falls squarely in the range for a **trans** relationship.\n*   **Final Conclusion:** The compound has a propenyl acetate structure with a trans configuration at the double bond. Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nLet's visualize the final compound and its protons to confirm:\n\n```\n      H(c)   O\n       \\    /\n        C = C      (Trans configuration)\n       /    \\\n H(b)-C-H(d)  H(a)\n    |\n   H(b)\n```\n*   **H(a) (proton at 7.0 ppm):** Vinyl proton next to oxygen. Split into a doublet by H(d). J = 16.0 Hz (trans coupling).\n*   **H(d) (proton at 5.5 ppm):** Vinyl proton next to the methyl group. Split into a doublet by H(a) (J = 16.0 Hz) and a quartet by the three H(b) protons (J ~ 7 Hz). This makes it a doublet of quartets (dq).\n*   **H(b) (protons at 1.6 ppm):** Methyl group protons. Split into a doublet by H(d) (J ~ 7 Hz).\n*   **H(c) (protons at 2.1 ppm):** Acetate methyl group protons. No adjacent protons, so it is a singlet.\n\nThe data perfectly matches the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A signal for three equivalent protons (3H) that is a singlet (s) is characteristic of a methyl group with no adjacent protons. A chemical shift of ~2.1 ppm is very typical for an acetyl methyl group (-C(=O)CH3). This suggests the presence of an acetate group in the molecule.\n    *   **Protons on a double bond:** There are two signals in the vinylic region (chemical shifts > 4.5 ppm), which indicates the presence of a C=C double bond with protons on it.\n        *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a signal for a single proton (1H). The chemical shift of 7.0 ppm is in the downfield vinylic region, suggesting it's attached to a carbon that is also attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen (C=CH-O-). The splitting pattern is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to only one other proton. The coupling constant (J-value) of 16.0 Hz is very important. This large value is characteristic of a *trans* relationship between two protons on a double bond.\n        *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This is the other vinylic proton (1H). Its splitting pattern is a doublet of quartets (dq). This means it is coupled to one proton (giving the doublet, this would be the proton at 7.0 ppm) and to a group of three protons (giving the quartet).\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal corresponds to three equivalent protons (3H). It is a doublet (d), which means it's coupled to one adjacent proton. This is consistent with a methyl group attached to a CH group, i.e., a -CH-CH3 fragment.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Structural Fragments:**\n    *   From `2.1 ppm (3H, s)`, we have an **acetyl group**: ` -O-C(=O)CH3 `.\n    *   From the signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm, we have a disubstituted double bond ` -CH=CH- `. The J-value of 16.0 Hz tells us it has a **trans configuration**.\n    *   The `dq` splitting at 5.5 ppm and the `d` splitting at 1.6 ppm connect the second vinylic proton and the methyl group. This confirms the fragment **`CH3-CH=CH-`**.\n    *   The vinylic proton at 7.0 ppm is significantly deshielded, which is consistent with it being attached to the oxygen of the acetate group.\n\n3.  **Construct the Final Structure:**\n    *   Let's combine the fragments: `CH3-CH=CH-` and `-O-C(=O)CH3`.\n    *   The connection point is the vinylic carbon. This gives the structure: `CH3-CH=CH-O-C(=O)CH3`.\n    *   The stereochemistry is determined by the J-value. Since J = 16.0 Hz, the two vinylic protons are *trans* to each other.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) Cis-butenyl acetate & B) Trans-butenyl acetate: A butenyl group (C4) attached to an acetate would most commonly be crotyl acetate, `CH3-CH=CH-CH2-O-C(=O)CH3`. This structure contains a CH2 group, which would give a signal for 2H in the NMR spectrum. The provided data has no 2H signals, only 1H, 1H, 3H, and 3H. Thus, butenyl acetate isomers can be ruled out.\n    *   D) Cis-propenyl acetate: This structure is consistent in terms of connectivity and proton count. However, the coupling constant between cis-vinylic protons is typically in the range of 6-12 Hz, not 16.0 Hz.\n    *   C) Trans-propenyl acetate: This structure is fully consistent with all aspects of the data: the chemical shifts, the proton count for each signal, the splitting patterns (s, d, dq, d), and especially the large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) indicating a trans double bond.\n\n**Conclusion:** The provided 1H NMR data perfectly matches the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\n*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Data:**\n\n    1.  **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This value is in the vinyl proton region (protons on a C=C double bond). The high chemical shift suggests it is attached to a carbon that is also bonded to an electronegative atom, like oxygen.\n        *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents one proton.\n        *   **Splitting (d, doublet):** The signal is split into a doublet, meaning this proton is coupled to one adjacent proton.\n        *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a large coupling constant for protons across a double bond. A J-value in the range of 12-18 Hz is characteristic of a *trans* configuration between two vinyl protons. A *cis* configuration would show a smaller J-value (typically 6-12 Hz). This is the key piece of information for determining the stereochemistry.\n\n    2.  **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** Also in the vinyl proton region.\n        *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents one proton.\n        *   **Splitting (dq, doublet of quartets):** This complex splitting pattern indicates the proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons.\n            *   The \"d\" (doublet) part arises from coupling to the single proton at 7.0 ppm (with the same J = 16.0 Hz).\n            *   The \"q\" (quartet) part arises from coupling to a group of three equivalent protons (n+1=4, so n=3), which must be a methyl (-CH3) group.\n\n    3.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is typical for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group in an acetate ester (`CH3-C(=O)O-`).\n        *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three protons, consistent with a methyl group.\n        *   **Splitting (s, singlet):** The signal is a singlet, meaning these protons have no adjacent protons to couple with, which is consistent with an acetate group.\n\n    4.  **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n        *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This chemical shift is typical for an allylic methyl group (a methyl group attached to a C=C double bond).\n        *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three protons, consistent with a methyl group.\n        *   **Splitting (d, doublet):** The signal is a doublet, meaning these three protons are coupled to a single adjacent proton. This matches the \"q\" splitting seen for the proton at 5.5 ppm (which is coupled to these three methyl protons).\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   The molecule contains an acetate group (`CH3COO-`) from the singlet at 2.1 ppm.\n    *   The total integration (1+1+3+3 = 8 protons) corresponds to the formula for propenyl acetate (`C5H8O2`), not butenyl acetate (`C6H10O2`, which would have 10 protons). This eliminates options A and B.\n    *   The remaining fragments are `CH=CH-CH3`.\n    *   Putting it together, the structure is `CH3-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH3`.\n    *   The final step is to determine the stereochemistry around the double bond. The large coupling constant, `J = 16.0 Hz`, between the two vinyl protons (at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm) definitively indicates a *trans* relationship.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The data corresponds to Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n    *   `trans-CH3(d)-CH(b)=CH(a)-O-C(=O)-CH3(c)`\n    *   H(a): ~7.0 ppm, doublet, coupled to H(b). Downfield due to attached oxygen.\n    *   H(b): ~5.5 ppm, doublet of quartets, coupled to H(a) and the CH3(d) group.\n    *   CH3(c): ~2.1 ppm, singlet, acetate methyl group.\n    *   CH3(d): ~1.6 ppm, doublet, coupled to H(b).\n    *   The `J = 16.0 Hz` confirms the *trans* geometry.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Protons**\n\nFirst, let's sum the integrations of the signals given in the 1H NMR data to determine the total number of protons in the molecule.\n- Signal 1: 1H\n- Signal 2: 1H\n- Signal 3: 3H\n- Signal 4: 3H\n- **Total Protons = 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 Protons**\n\nNow, let's determine the number of protons in each of the possible compounds:\n- **Propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂):** 8 protons. This matches our data.\n- **Butenyl acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂):** 10 protons. This does not match our data.\n\nBased on the proton count, we can immediately eliminate Cis-butenyl acetate (A) and Trans-butenyl acetate (B). The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze the Individual Signals**\n\nLet's look at the structure of propenyl acetate: `CH₃(a)-C(=O)-O-CH(b)=CH(c)-CH₃(d)`. There are four distinct proton environments, which corresponds to the four signals observed in the spectrum.\n\n*   **`2.1 ppm (3H, s)`:**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This region is typical for a methyl group adjacent to a carbonyl group (an acetyl group).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents three protons, consistent with a methyl (CH₃) group.\n    *   **Splitting (s):** A singlet indicates that these protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons.\n    *   **Assignment:** This signal corresponds to the acetyl methyl group, `CH₃(a)`.\n\n*   **The remaining signals (`7.0`, `5.5`, `1.6` ppm) must belong to the propenyl group `(-CH(b)=CH(c)-CH₃(d))`.**\n\n*   **`1.6 ppm (3H, d)`:**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region, typical for a methyl group attached to a double bond.\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a CH₃ group.\n    *   **Splitting (d):** A doublet means it is coupled to one neighboring proton.\n    *   **Assignment:** This signal is the propenyl methyl group, `CH₃(d)`, which is split into a doublet by the adjacent vinyl proton `H(c)`.\n\n*   **`7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)` and `5.5 ppm (1H, dq)`:** These two signals are for the two protons on the double bond (vinyl protons), `H(b)` and `H(c)`.\n    *   **Proton `H(b)`:** This proton (`-O-CH(b)=`) is attached to the carbon bonded to the electronegative oxygen atom, which deshields it, causing it to appear at a higher chemical shift (further downfield). It is coupled to proton `H(c)`.\n    *   **Proton `H(c)`:** This proton (`=CH(c)-CH₃`) is coupled to proton `H(b)` (making it a doublet) and to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group `CH₃(d)` (making it a quartet). The combination of these splittings results in a doublet of quartets (`dq`).\n    *   **Assignment:**\n        *   The signal at `7.0 ppm` is proton `H(b)`. It is a doublet because it's only split by `H(c)`.\n        *   The signal at `5.5 ppm` is proton `H(c)`. Its splitting is correctly described as a `dq`.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans)**\n\nThe key to distinguishing between the cis and trans isomers lies in the coupling constant (J-value) between the two vinyl protons, `H(b)` and `H(c)`.\n*   The signal at `7.0 ppm` for `H(b)` is a doublet with a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**. This value represents the interaction between `H(b)` and `H(c)`.\n\n*   The established rules for vinyl proton coupling are:\n    *   **Trans coupling (protons on opposite sides of the double bond):** `J_trans` is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis coupling (protons on the same side of the double bond):** `J_cis` is typically smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nThe observed coupling constant of **16.0 Hz** falls squarely in the range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe 1H NMR data indicates a propenyl acetate structure with a trans geometry at the double bond. Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to identify the unknown compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nWe are given the following signals:\n*   **Signal 1: 2.1 ppm (3H, s)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, which is typical for a methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon (C=O). In the given options, all are acetates, which contain the acetyl group (CH₃-C(=O)-). This signal is the acetyl methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s):** A singlet means this methyl group has no adjacent protons. This is consistent with an acetyl group, as the methyl is attached to a carbonyl carbon with no protons.\n\n*   **Signal 2: 1.6 ppm (3H, d)**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal also represents a methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** A doublet means this methyl group is coupled to one adjacent proton (according to the n+1 rule, 2 peaks means n=1 proton). This suggests a `CH-CH₃` fragment.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This shift is in the allylic region, which is typical for a methyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (`=C-CH₃`).\n\n*   **Signal 3: 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents a single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This shift is in the vinylic region, meaning this proton is attached directly to a carbon-carbon double bond (`C=CH`).\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq):** A doublet of quartets means this proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   The **quartet (q)** arises from coupling to a group of 3 equivalent protons (n+1 = 4, so n=3). This corresponds to the methyl group at 1.6 ppm.\n        *   The **doublet (d)** arises from coupling to one other proton (n+1 = 2, so n=1). This must be another vinylic proton on the double bond.\n    *   This confirms the existence of a `CH=CH-CH₃` fragment, and this signal corresponds to the `CH` that is in between the other vinylic proton and the methyl group.\n\n*   **Signal 4: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents a single proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is a highly deshielded vinylic proton. Such a large chemical shift for a vinylic proton indicates it is attached to a very electronegative atom, in this case, the oxygen of the acetate ester (`-O-CH=C`).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** A doublet means this proton is coupled to one adjacent proton, which is the other vinylic proton at 5.5 ppm.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the key piece of information for determining the stereochemistry (cis vs. trans).\n        *   A coupling constant (J) for **trans** protons on a double bond is typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n        *   A coupling constant for **cis** protons is smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n    *   The observed value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates that the two vinylic protons are in a **trans** configuration.\n\n**2. Assemble the Structure**\n\nBased on the analysis, we can assemble the fragments:\n*   We have an acetate group: `CH₃-C(=O)-O-` (from the 2.1 ppm singlet).\n*   We have a `CH=CH-CH₃` fragment (from the other three signals).\n*   The connection is through the ester oxygen to the double bond: `CH₃-C(=O)-O-CH=CH-CH₃`.\n*   The total number of carbons in the alkenyl group (the part derived from the alcohol) is 3 (`-CH=CH-CH₃`), so it is a **propenyl** group, not a butenyl group.\n*   The stereochemistry of the double bond is **trans** (from J = 16.0 Hz).\n\nPutting it all together, the structure is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   A) Trans-butenyl acetate: Incorrect. A butenyl group would have 4 carbons, which doesn't match the NMR data (we'd expect different signals, likely a `CH₂CH₃` group instead of a `CH₃` on the double bond).\n*   B) **Trans-propenyl acetate:** Correct. Matches all aspects of the NMR data: the number of signals, integration, chemical shifts, splitting patterns, and the crucial trans coupling constant.\n*   C) Cis-butenyl acetate: Incorrect. Wrong carbon count and wrong stereochemistry.\n*   D) Cis-propenyl acetate: Incorrect. A cis isomer would show a much smaller coupling constant (J ≈ 6-12 Hz).\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is in the alkene (vinylic) region, indicating a proton attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C-H). The relatively high shift (deshielded) suggests this proton is attached to a carbon that is also bonded to an electronegative atom, like oxygen.\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents one proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** The signal is split into a doublet, which means it is coupled to (i.e., adjacent to) only one other proton.\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This value is crucial for determining stereochemistry. A large J-value (typically 12-18 Hz) for vinylic protons is characteristic of a **trans** relationship across the double bond.\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** Also in the vinylic region, indicating another proton on the double bond.\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents one proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq, doublet of quartets):** This means the proton is coupled to two different sets of neighbors. The \"doublet\" part means it's coupled to one adjacent proton (this would be the proton at 7.0 ppm). The \"quartet\" part means it's coupled to three equivalent adjacent protons (typically a methyl, -CH3, group).\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of the protons of an acetyl group (CH3-C=O).\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents three equivalent protons, consistent with a methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s, singlet):** The signal is a singlet, meaning there are no protons on the adjacent atom (the carbonyl carbon). This confirms the acetate fragment: -O-C(=O)-CH3.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the alkyl/allylic region.\n    *   **Integration (3H):** The signal represents three equivalent protons, consistent with a methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d, doublet):** The signal is a doublet, which means this methyl group is adjacent to a carbon with a single proton (a -CH group).\n\n### **2. Assemble the Molecular Fragments**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following pieces:\n1.  An acetate group: **-O-C(=O)-CH3** (from the 3H singlet at 2.1 ppm).\n2.  A trans double bond with two protons: **-CH=CH-** (from the two vinylic signals, with J=16.0 Hz confirming *trans*).\n3.  A methyl group attached to one of the vinylic protons: **CH3-CH=** (from the 3H doublet at 1.6 ppm being coupled to the 1H vinylic proton, which must be the one showing quartet splitting at 5.5 ppm).\n\n### **3. Construct the Final Structure**\n\nLet's put the fragments together:\n\n*   The signal at 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets (dq). This proton is on the double bond (`=CH-`), is split by one other proton across the double bond (the doublet), and is split by a methyl group (the quartet). This corresponds to the **CH3-CH=** fragment.\n*   The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet. This proton is on the double bond (`=CH-`) and is only split by the other vinylic proton. This proton is also highly deshielded, indicating it's attached to the carbon bonded to the acetate's oxygen. This corresponds to the **=CH-O-** fragment.\n*   The J-value of 16.0 Hz confirms these two vinylic protons are in a *trans* configuration.\n\nCombining these pieces gives the structure of **Trans-propenyl acetate**:\n\n```\n      H(5.5 ppm)    O\n      |            //\nCH3-C ------- C-O-C-CH3(2.1 ppm)\n(1.6 ppm)    |\n             H(7.0 ppm, J=16.0 Hz)\n```\n\nThis structure is fully consistent with all the NMR data:\n*   **Trans** double bond protons with J=16.0 Hz.\n*   An **acetate methyl group** as a singlet.\n*   A **methyl group on the double bond** appearing as a doublet.\n*   The correct multiplicities for both vinylic protons.\n\n### **4. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **A) Trans-butenyl acetate & D) Cis-butenyl acetate:** These structures would contain an ethyl group (CH3-CH2-) instead of the methyl group attached to the double bond. This would result in different signals (e.g., a triplet and a multiplet for the ethyl group), which are not present in the given spectrum. Therefore, the butenyl acetate options are incorrect.\n*   **B) Cis-propenyl acetate:** This would have a smaller coupling constant (J ≈ 6-12 Hz) between the vinylic protons. The observed J=16.0 Hz rules out this isomer.\n*   **C) Trans-propenyl acetate:** This structure and stereochemistry perfectly match the provided 1H NMR data.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Number of Protons and Carbon Skeleton**\n\n*   First, let's sum the number of protons (the integration value) from the NMR data: 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons in total.\n*   Now, let's determine the number of protons for each possible compound:\n    *   **Propenyl acetate (C5H8O2)**: The chemical formula is C5H8O2. The number of hydrogens is 8. This matches the data.\n    *   **Butenyl acetate (C6H10O2)**: The chemical formula is C6H10O2. The number of hydrogens is 10. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound must be a propenyl acetate. This eliminates options A) Cis-butenyl acetate and D) Trans-butenyl acetate. We only need to decide between Cis-propenyl acetate (B) and Trans-propenyl acetate (C).\n\n**2. Analyze the Splitting Pattern and Coupling Constants**\n\nThe key to distinguishing between cis and trans isomers lies in the coupling constant (J value) between the protons on the double bond (vinyl protons).\n\n*   **The Data:** We have a signal at **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**.\n    *   This signal represents a single vinyl proton.\n    *   It is a doublet (d), meaning it is coupled to one other proton.\n    *   The coupling constant is **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n\n*   **Stereochemistry Rule:** The magnitude of the vicinal coupling constant (3JHH) for protons on a double bond is stereospecific:\n    *   **Trans protons:** Typically have a large coupling constant, J_trans ≈ 12-18 Hz.\n    *   **Cis protons:** Typically have a smaller coupling constant, J_cis ≈ 6-12 Hz.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The observed coupling constant of 16.0 Hz falls squarely in the range for a **trans** double bond. This strongly indicates the compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**3. Assign All Signals to the Trans-propenyl acetate Structure**\n\nLet's verify that all signals in the spectrum match the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**Structure: Trans-propenyl acetate**\n```\n      H(b)\n     /\nCH3(d)-C   = C - O - C(=O) - CH3(c)\n       \\   /\n        H(a)\n```\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This corresponds to proton **H(a)**. It is on the same carbon as the electron-withdrawing acetate group (-OAc), which shifts it far downfield. It is coupled only to H(b), giving a doublet with a large (trans) J value of 16.0 Hz. This assignment is a perfect match.\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This corresponds to proton **H(b)**. It is coupled to H(a) (which splits it into a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group CH3(d) (which splits it into a quartet). The resulting pattern is a doublet of quartets (dq). This is also a perfect match.\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This corresponds to the methyl group of the acetate, **CH3(c)**. These protons have no adjacent protons to couple with, so they appear as a singlet. The chemical shift of ~2.1 ppm is characteristic of an acetate methyl. This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This corresponds to the methyl group on the double bond, **CH3(d)**. It is coupled to the single adjacent proton H(b), splitting its signal into a doublet. This is a perfect match.\n\nAll pieces of the 1H NMR data are consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate. The structure of Cis-propenyl acetate is ruled out primarily by the large coupling constant of 16.0 Hz.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the total number of protons.**\n\nThe 1H NMR data provides the integration (relative number of protons) for each signal:\n*   7.0 ppm: 1H\n*   5.5 ppm: 1H\n*   2.1 ppm: 3H\n*   1.6 ppm: 3H\n\nThe total number of protons giving rise to these signals is 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = **8 protons**.\n\n### **Step 2: Compare the total proton count with the possible structures.**\n\nLet's determine the number of protons in each of the potential compounds.\n*   **Propenyl acetate:** The formula is C5H8O2. The most likely structure is `CH3-COO-CH=CH-CH3`. The number of hydrogen atoms is 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = **8H**. This matches the NMR data.\n*   **Butenyl acetate:** The formula is C6H10O2. The most likely structure is `CH3-COO-CH=CH-CH2-CH3`. The number of hydrogen atoms is 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = **10H**. This does not match the NMR data.\n\n**Conclusion from Step 2:** The total integration (8H) matches propenyl acetate but not butenyl acetate. Therefore, we can eliminate options A (Trans-butenyl acetate) and B (Cis-butenyl acetate). The unknown compound must be either Trans-propenyl acetate or Cis-propenyl acetate.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans) using the coupling constant (J).**\n\nThe choice between the cis and trans isomers depends on the coupling constant between the two protons on the double bond (the vinylic protons).\n*   The signal at 7.0 ppm is described as a doublet with a coupling constant **J = 16.0 Hz**. This splitting is due to its interaction with the other vinylic proton (at 5.5 ppm).\n*   In 1H NMR spectroscopy, the magnitude of the vicinal coupling constant (³J_HH) across a double bond is stereochemically dependent:\n    *   **J_trans** (protons are on opposite sides of the double bond) is typically in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **J_cis** (protons are on the same side of the double bond) is typically in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n*   The observed coupling constant of **16.0 Hz** falls directly within the expected range for a **trans** configuration.\n\n**Conclusion from Step 3:** The large coupling constant indicates a trans double bond. Therefore, the compound is Trans-propenyl acetate. This eliminates option D (Cis-propenyl acetate).\n\n### **Step 4: Confirm the full assignment for Trans-propenyl acetate.**\n\nLet's assign all the signals to the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate: `CH3(a)-COO-CH(b)=CH(c)-CH3(d)`\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal corresponds to the acetate methyl protons, H(a). It is a singlet (s) because it has no adjacent protons to couple with.\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal corresponds to the vinylic proton H(b), which is attached to the oxygen atom, causing it to be significantly deshielded (shifted downfield). It is split into a doublet (d) by the other vinylic proton, H(c), with a large trans-coupling constant.\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal corresponds to the vinylic proton H(c). It is split by H(b) (giving a doublet, J ≈ 16 Hz) and also by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group H(d) (giving a quartet). The resulting pattern is a doublet of quartets (dq).\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal corresponds to the methyl protons H(d) attached to the double bond. They are split by the single adjacent vinylic proton H(c), resulting in a doublet (d).\n\nAll aspects of the provided 1H NMR data are consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown organic compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n**1. Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\nLet's break down each signal provided:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates three equivalent protons, likely a methyl (CH3) group.\n    *   **Splitting (s):** A singlet means this methyl group has no adjacent protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is highly characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon in an ester or ketone. Given the options, this is the acetate methyl group (CH3-C=O).\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Another methyl (CH3) group.\n    *   **Splitting (d):** A doublet means this methyl group is adjacent to a single proton (a CH group).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (1.6 ppm):** This is in the allylic region, suggesting a methyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C-CH3).\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** A single proton.\n    *   **Splitting (dq):** A doublet of quartets means this proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   **Doublet (d):** Coupled to one adjacent proton.\n        *   **Quartet (q):** Coupled to three adjacent, equivalent protons (a CH3 group).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (5.5 ppm):** This is in the vinylic region, indicating a proton on a carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=).\n    *   Putting it together, this signal corresponds to a vinylic proton that has another vinylic proton as a neighbor (giving the doublet) and is also next to a methyl group (giving the quartet). This fits the fragment: **=CH-CH3**.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** A single proton.\n    *   **Splitting (d):** A doublet means this proton is adjacent to only one other proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This is also in the vinylic region (-CH=). Its downfield position suggests it is attached to a carbon atom that is also bonded to an electronegative atom, like the oxygen from the acetate group (-O-CH=).\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This value is the most critical piece of information for determining the stereochemistry. A large vicinal coupling constant (J > 12 Hz) across a double bond is characteristic of protons that are in a **trans** configuration. A cis configuration would show a smaller J-value (typically 6-12 Hz).\n\n**2. Assemble the Structure**\n\nLet's combine the fragments we've identified:\n\n1.  From `2.1 ppm (s, 3H)`, we have an acetate group: `CH3-C(=O)-O-`\n2.  From the remaining signals, we have a `CH=CH-CH3` fragment.\n3.  Let's connect them. The `7.0 ppm` proton is on a carbon attached to the oxygen, so the structure is `CH3-C(=O)-O-CH=CH-CH3`. This is a propenyl acetate. This eliminates the \"butenyl acetate\" options.\n4.  The coupling constant `J = 16.0 Hz` between the two vinylic protons (at 7.0 and 5.5 ppm) confirms they are in a **trans** arrangement.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **A) Trans-butenyl acetate:** Incorrect. The structure is a propenyl (3-carbon) derivative, not a butenyl (4-carbon) one.\n*   **B) Cis-propenyl acetate:** Incorrect. The large coupling constant (16.0 Hz) is indicative of a trans double bond, not cis.\n*   **C) Trans-propenyl acetate:** **Correct.** All features of the 1H NMR spectrum are consistent with this structure.\n    *   Acetate CH3: Singlet at ~2.1 ppm. (Matches `2.1 (3H, s)`)\n    *   Alkene CH3: Doublet at ~1.6 ppm. (Matches `1.6 (3H, d)`)\n    *   =CH-CH3 proton: Doublet of quartets at ~5.5 ppm. (Matches `5.5 (1H, dq)`)\n    *   O-CH= proton: Doublet at ~7.0 ppm. (Matches `7.0 (1H, d)`)\n    *   Coupling constant for trans vinylic protons: ~12-18 Hz. (Matches `J = 16.0 Hz`)\n*   **D) Cis-butenyl acetate:** Incorrect. Wrong carbon chain length and wrong stereochemistry.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
