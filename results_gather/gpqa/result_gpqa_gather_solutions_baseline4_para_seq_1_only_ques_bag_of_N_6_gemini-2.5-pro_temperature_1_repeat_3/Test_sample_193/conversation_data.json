Each spin can take values +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by the formula E = -J[S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]. The partition function is defined as Z = Σ_states exp(-βE), where β = 1/(kT).\n\nFirst, we need to list all possible states of the system and calculate the energy for each state. A state is defined by the triplet (S1, S2, S3). Since each spin has 2 possible values, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states in total.\n\nLet's list the 8 states and calculate the corresponding energy E for each:\n1.  State (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1):\n    E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n2.  State (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1):\n    E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n3.  State (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1):\n    E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n4.  State (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1):\n    E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n5.  State (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1):\n    E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n6.  State (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1):\n    E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n7.  State (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1):\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n8.  State (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1):\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\nNow, we group the states by their energy levels to find the degeneracy of each level.\n-   Energy Level E1 = -3J:\n    This energy corresponds to the states (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1).\n    The degeneracy (number of states) for this energy level is g1 = 2.\n-   Energy Level E2 = J:\n    This energy corresponds to the states (+1, +1, -1), (+1, -1, +1), (-1, +1, +1), (+1, -1, -1), (-1, +1, -1), and (-1, -1, +1).\n    The degeneracy for this energy level is g2 = 6.\n\nThe total number of states is g1 + g2 = 2 + 6 = 8, which is correct.\n\nThe partition function Z is the sum over all states of the term exp(-βE). We can write this as a sum over the energy levels, weighted by their degeneracies:\nZ = g1 * exp(-β * E1) + g2 * exp(-β * E2)\n\nSubstituting the values we found:\nZ = 2 * exp(-β * (-3J)) + 6 * exp(-β * (J))\nZ = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 6 * exp(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)\nB) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nD) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\n\nOur calculated partition function Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ) matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy reasoning has led to the correct result, and the python code has successfully verified it.\n\nThe system has two energy levels:\n1.  **E1 = -3J**: This occurs when all three spins are aligned (S1=S2=S3=+1 or S1=S2=S3=-1). There are 2 such states (degeneracy g1 = 2). The contribution to the partition function from these states is `2 * e^(-β * -3J) = 2e^(3Jβ)`.\n2.  **E2 = +J**: This occurs when two spins are aligned and one is anti-aligned. There are 6 such states (degeneracy g2 = 6). The contribution to the partition function from these states is `6 * e^(-β * J) = 6e^(-Jβ)`.\n\nThe total partition function Z is the sum of these contributions:\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nThe problem asks for the partition function Z of a system of three spins, S1, S2, and S3, each taking values +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\n\n**1. Understanding the Partition Function**\n\nThe partition function (Z) in statistical mechanics is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all possible microstates of the system.\nZ = Σ_states e^(-βE_state)\nwhere β = 1/(kT).\n\nSince multiple states can have the same energy, we can rewrite the sum over the distinct energy levels, multiplying each Boltzmann factor by the number of states (degeneracy, g) that have that energy:\nZ = Σ_levels g(E) * e^(-βE)\n\n**2. Identifying the Microstates and their Energies**\n\nThe system has three spins, each with two possible values (+1, -1). The total number of microstates is 2³ = 8. We need to calculate the energy for each of these 8 states. We can group the states by their configuration.\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n    *   State 1: (S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1)\n        E₁ = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) ] = -J [1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    *   State 2: (S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1)\n        E₂ = -J [ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J [1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n    *   So, we have **2 states** with an energy of **-3J**. The degeneracy for this energy level is g₁ = 2.\n\n*   **Case 2: One spin is flipped relative to the other two.**\n    *   This includes states like (+1, +1, -1) and (-1, -1, +1). Let's calculate the energy for one such state, (+1, +1, -1):\n        E = -J [ (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) ] = -J [1 - 1 - 1] = -J [-1] = +J\n    *   By symmetry, all states with one spin different from the other two will have the same energy. Let's list them:\n        1.  (+1, +1, -1)\n        2.  (+1, -1, +1)\n        3.  (-1, +1, +1)\n        4.  (-1, -1, +1)\n        5.  (-1, +1, -1)\n        6.  (+1, -1, -1)\n    *   There are **6 states** with an energy of **+J**. The degeneracy for this energy level is g₂ = 6.\n\nThe provided Python code output confirms this analysis:\n*   Energy E = -3J has a degeneracy g = 2.\n*   Energy E = +J has a degeneracy g = 6.\n\n**3. Calculating the Partition Function Z**\n\nNow we sum the contributions from the two distinct energy levels:\nZ = g₁ * e^(-βE₁) + g₂ * e^(-βE₂)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n**4.

The degeneracy for this energy level is g1 = 2.\n\n*   **Case 2: Two spins are up (+1) and one is down (-1).**\n    *   State (+1, +1, -1):\n        E3 = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   State (+1, -1, +1):\n        E4 = -J[(1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   State (-1, +1, +1):\n        E5 = -J[(-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n\n*   **Case 3: One spin is up (+1) and two are down (-1).**\n    *   State (+1, -1, -1):\n        E6 = -J[(1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   State (-1, +1, -1):\n        E7 = -J[(-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   State (-1, -1, +1):\n        E8 = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    *   All six states in Case 2 and Case 3 have the same energy E = J. The degeneracy for this energy level is g2 = 3 + 3 = 6.\n\n**3. Calculate the Partition Function**\nNow, we sum the contributions from each distinct energy level, taking into account their degeneracies.\nZ = (number of states with energy E_A) * e^(-βE_A) + (number of states with energy E_B) * e^(-βE_B)\nZ = g1 * e^(-β(-3J)) + g2 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\n**4.

Let's use this output to construct the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Code Output:**\nThe code has calculated the following:\n*   There are **2 states** with an energy level of **E₁ = -3J**.\n*   There are **6 states** with an energy level of **E₂ = J**.\n\n**2. Recall the Definition of the Partition Function (Z):**\nThe partition function is the sum over all distinct energy levels of the degeneracy of that level multiplied by the Boltzmann factor for that level.\nZ = Σᵢ gᵢ * e^(-βEᵢ)\nwhere:\n*   gᵢ is the degeneracy (number of states) of energy level i.\n*   Eᵢ is the energy of level i.\n*   β = 1/(kT).\n\n**3. Construct the Partition Function:**\nUsing the values from the code output:\n*   For the first energy level (E₁ = -3J, g₁ = 2), the term is: 2 * e^(-β * (-3J)) = 2e^(3Jβ)\n*   For the second energy level (E₂ = J, g₂ = 6), the term is: 6 * e^(-β * (J)) = 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nSumming these terms gives the total partition function:\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n**4.

Each spin can be either +1 (spin up) or -1 (spin down).\n\n### 1. Understanding the System and Partition Function\n\n*   **Spins:** We have three spins: S1, S2, S3. Each can be +1 or -1. This gives a total of 2³ = 8 possible microstates for the system.\n*   **Energy:** The energy (E) of any given microstate is determined by the Hamiltonian:\n    E = -J * (S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3)\n    where J is the coupling constant.\n*   **Partition Function (Z):** The partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible microstates.\n    Z = Σ_states e^(-βE)\n    where β = 1/(kT). Since some states might have the same energy level (degeneracy), we can group them:\n    Z = Σ_levels g(E) * e^(-βE)\n    where g(E) is the degeneracy of the energy level E.\n\n### 2. Calculating Energy for All Microstates\n\nWe need to list all 8 possible configurations of the spins and calculate the energy for each one.\n\n| State # | S1 | S2 | S3 | S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 | Energy (E) |\n| :------ | :- | :- | :- | :------------------------ | :----------- |\n| 1       | +1 | +1 | +1 | 1 + 1 + 1 = 3           | -3J        |\n| 2       | +1 | +1 | -1 | 1 - 1 - 1 = -1          | J          |\n| 3       | +1 | -1 | +1 | -1 + 1 - 1 = -1         | J          |\n| 4       | -1 | +1 | +1 | -1 - 1 + 1 = -1         | J          |\n| 5       | +1 | -1 | -1 | -1 - 1 + 1 = -1         | J          |\n| 6       | -1 | +1 | -1 | -1 + 1 - 1 = -1         | J          |\n| 7       | -1 | -1 | +1 | 1 - 1 - 1 = -1          | J          |\n| 8       | -1 | -1 | -1 | 1 + 1 + 1 = 3           | -3J        |\n\n### 3. Identifying Energy Levels and Degeneracies\n\nFrom the table above, we can see there are only two distinct energy levels:\n\n*   **Energy Level E₁ = -3J:**\n    This occurs when all spins are aligned (either all +1 or all -1).\n    States: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1)\n    The degeneracy (g₁) is **2**.\n\n*   **Energy Level E₂ = J:**\n    This occurs for all other configurations.\n    States: (+1,+1,-1), (+1,-1,+1), (-1,+1,+1), (+1,-1,-1), (-1,+1,-1), (-1,-1,+1)\n    The degeneracy (g₂) is **6**.\n\n### 4. Constructing the Partition Function\n\nNow we can use the formula Z = Σ g(E) * e^(-βE) with the energy levels and degeneracies we found.\n\n*   Term for E₁ = -3J:\n    g₁ * e^(-βE₁) = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) = 2e^(3Jβ)\n\n*   Term for E₂ = J:\n    g₂ * e^(-βE₂) = 6 * e^(-β(J)) = 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nThe total partition function Z is the sum of these terms:\n\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\n\nA) Z = 2e^(2Jβ) + 6e^(-2Jβ)\nB) Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\nC) Z = 6e^(2Jβ) + 2e^(-2Jβ)\nD) Z = 2e^(-3Jβ) + 6e^(Jβ)\n\nOur calculated partition function matches option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nOutput your detailed reasoning analysis and then output the most consistent answer with the format <<<answer content>>>, such as <<<9.8>>>, <<<C>>>."
