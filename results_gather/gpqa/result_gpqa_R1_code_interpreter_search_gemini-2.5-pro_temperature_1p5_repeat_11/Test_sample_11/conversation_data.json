    "This is a classic particle physics problem that can be solved using the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\nHere's the reasoning process:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial and final states:**\n    *   **Initial State:** We have a positive pion ($\\pi^+$) at rest.\n    *   **Final State:** We have a positive muon ($\\mu^+$) and a muon neutrino ($\\nu_\\mu$), both moving. The reaction is $\\pi^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + \\nu_\\mu$.\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation Laws:**\n    *   **Conservation of Momentum:** Since the initial pion is at rest, its momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the final particles must also be zero. This means the muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\n        $p_{\\mu} = p_{\\nu}$\n\n    *   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay. The initial energy is purely the rest energy of the pion, as it is stationary. The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n        $E_{\\pi} = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}$\n        Since $E = m_0c^2 + KE$ (where $m_0c^2$ is rest energy and KE is kinetic energy), we have:\n        $m_{\\pi}c^2 = (m_{\\mu}c^2 + KE_{\\mu}) + (m_{\\nu}c^2 + KE_{\\nu})$\n\n3.  **Use Relativistic Formulas and Simplify:**\n    *   For the purposes of this calculation, the rest mass of the neutrino is considered to be zero ($m_{\\nu} = 0$). This is a standard and highly accurate approximation in this context. Therefore, the neutrino's total energy is equal to its kinetic energy ($E_{\\nu} = KE_{\\nu}$).\n    *   The energy conservation equation becomes:\n        $m_{\\pi}c^2 = m_{\\mu}c^2 + KE_{\\mu} + KE_{\\nu}$\n    *   The total kinetic energy released in the decay (the Q-value) is the difference in rest masses:\n        $KE_{total} = KE_{\\mu} + KE_{\\nu} = m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2 = 139.6 \\text{ MeV} - 105.7 \\text{ MeV} = 33.9 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n4.  **Solve for Individual Kinetic Energies:**\n    We can derive a formula for the kinetic energy of the massive daughter particle (the muon) in a two-body decay from a stationary parent. Starting from the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$, and the conservation laws, one can derive the following clean formula for the muon's kinetic energy:\n\n    $KE_{\\mu} = \\frac{(m_{\\pi}c^2 - m_{\\mu}c^2)^2}{2 m_{\\pi}c^2}$\n\n    Now, we can plug in the given values to find the kinetic energies. This can be done efficiently and accurately using a short script.\n\n```python\n# Rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# The total kinetic energy released (Q-value) is the difference in rest mass energy.\n# Q = KE_mu + KE_nu\nQ = m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2\n\n# A direct formula for the kinetic energy of the massive particle (muon) in a two-body decay\n# from a stationary parent can be derived from conservation of energy and momentum.\n# KE_mu = (m_pi*c^2 - m_mu*c^2)^2 / (2 * m_pi*c^2)\nKE_mu = (m_pi_c2 - m_mu_c2)**2 / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the neutrino is the remaining energy.\nKE_nu = Q - KE_mu\n\nprint(f\"The kinetic energy of the muon (μ+) is: {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"The kinetic energy of the neutrino (ν) is: {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\nThe kinetic energy of the muon (μ+) is: 4.12 MeV\nThe kinetic energy of the neutrino (ν) is: 29.78 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are 4.12 MeV for the muon and approximately 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
