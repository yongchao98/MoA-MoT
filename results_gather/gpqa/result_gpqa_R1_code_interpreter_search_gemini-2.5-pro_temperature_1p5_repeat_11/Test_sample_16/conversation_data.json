    "The user wants to find the concentration of free calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution that initially contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical reaction:** The Ca-EDTA complex, [Ca-EDTA]²⁻, is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions, calcium (Ca²⁺) and EDTA (EDTA⁴⁻). The dissociation reaction is:\n    [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Identify the given equilibrium constant:** The problem provides the formation constant (also known as the stability constant), K_f or K_Ca-EDTA, for the complex.\n    K_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺] * [EDTA⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n3.  **Determine the dissociation constant (K_d):** The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction. Therefore, the dissociation constant (K_d) is the inverse of the formation constant (K_f).\n    K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n4.  **Set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table:** We can use an ICE table to track the concentrations of the species as the system reaches equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ formed from the dissociation of the complex.\n\n    | Species      | Initial (I) | Change (C) | Equilibrium (E) |\n    |--------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|\n    | [Ca-EDTA]²⁻  | 0.02 M      | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n    | Ca²⁺         | 0 M         | +x         | x               |\n    | EDTA⁴⁻       | 0 M         | +x         | x               |\n\n5.  **Write the equilibrium expression for K_d:**\n    K_d = ([Ca²⁺] * [EDTA⁴⁻]) / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]\n\n6.  **Substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the expression:**\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = x² / (0.02 - x)\n\n7.  **Simplify and solve for x:** Because the formation constant (K_f) is very large, the dissociation constant (K_d) is very small. This means the dissociation reaction barely proceeds, and 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). We can make the simplifying assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n    Now, we can solve for x, which represents [Ca²⁺] at equilibrium:\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    x ≈ √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This corresponds to option A.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nK_formation = 5e10\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# The dissociation constant (Kd) is the inverse of the formation constant (Kf)\n# [Ca-EDTA] <--> Ca2+ + EDTA4-\n# Kd = [Ca2+][EDTA4-] / [Ca-EDTA] = 1 / Kf\nK_dissociation = 1 / K_formation\n\n# Let x be the concentration of Ca2+ at equilibrium.\n# According to the stoichiometry of the dissociation, [EDTA4-] = x\n# The concentration of the complex at equilibrium is [initial] - x = 0.02 - x\n# Kd = x^2 / (0.02 - x)\n\n# Since Kd is very small, we can assume x is much smaller than 0.02,\n# so (0.02 - x) is approximately 0.02.\n# Kd ≈ x^2 / 0.02\n# x^2 ≈ Kd * 0.02\n# x = sqrt(Kd * 0.02)\n\nx_squared = K_dissociation * initial_complex_conc\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"The concentration of calcium ions [Ca2+] is: {x:.2e} M\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The problem asks for the concentration of free calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution that starts with a stoichiometric concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex of 0.02 M.\n\n1.  **Dissociation Reaction:** The Ca-EDTA complex ([CaY]²⁻, where Y⁴⁻ represents the EDTA anion) dissociates into calcium ions and EDTA ions.\n    [CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Constant:** The problem gives the formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA), which describes the formation of the complex from its ions:\n    Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻\n    K_f = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n    For the dissociation reaction, we need the dissociation constant (K_d), which is the inverse of the formation constant:\n    K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n3.  **ICE Table Setup:** We can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that dissociates from the complex.\n\n| Species   | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :-------- | :---------- | :--------- | :-------------- |\n| [CaY]²⁻   | 0.02        | -x         | 0.02 - x        |\n| Ca²⁺      | 0           | +x         | x               |\n| Y⁴⁻       | 0           | +x         | x               |\n\n4.  **Equilibrium Expression:** Now we write the expression for the dissociation constant, K_d, using the equilibrium concentrations:\n    K_d = ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) / [[CaY]²⁻]\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n\n5.  **Solve for x:** Since K_f is very large, K_d is very small. This indicates that very little of the complex will dissociate. Therefore, x will be much smaller than the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can make a simplifying assumption:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n    Now the equation becomes:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n    Solving for x:\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n    The concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is x, which is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nThe calculation performed by the Python script confirms this result: `6.32e-07 M`. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
