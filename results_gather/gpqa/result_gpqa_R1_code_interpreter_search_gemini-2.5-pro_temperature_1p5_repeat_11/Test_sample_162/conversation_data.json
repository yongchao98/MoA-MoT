    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning and calculations to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Understand the Chemical Reaction**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the chemical process. We are dissolving a sparingly soluble base, iron(III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)₃), in a strong monobasic acid (let's denote it as HA, which fully dissociates into H⁺ and A⁻).\n\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ in water is an equilibrium:\nFe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n\nThis equilibrium is described by the solubility product constant, Ksp:\nKsp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n\nThe strong acid provides H⁺ ions, which react with the OH⁻ ions produced by the dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ in a neutralization reaction:\nH⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → H₂O(l)\n\nBy removing OH⁻ ions from the solution, the H⁺ ions shift the dissolution equilibrium to the right, causing more Fe(OH)₃ to dissolve. The overall reaction is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThe problem asks for the *minimum* volume of acid required. This implies that just enough acid is added to dissolve all the Fe(OH)₃ solid. At this point, the solution is saturated, and the concentrations of the ions in the solution satisfy the Ksp expression.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Final Concentration of Fe³⁺**\n\nFirst, we calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ we need to dissolve.\n*   Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = M(Fe) + 3 * (M(O) + M(H)) = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 9.3576 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\nWhen this amount is dissolved in a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L), the concentration of Fe³⁺ will be:\n*   [Fe³⁺] = Moles / Volume = (9.3576 x 10⁻⁴ mol) / 0.1 L = 9.3576 x 10⁻³ M\n\n### **3. Determine the pH of the Final Solution**\n\nTo find the pH, we first need to determine the concentration of H⁺ (or OH⁻) in the final saturated solution. We use the Ksp value for Fe(OH)₃, which is approximately 2.79 x 10⁻³⁹ at 25°C.\n\n*   Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 2.79 x 10⁻³⁹\n*   (9.3576 x 10⁻³ M) * [OH⁻]³ = 2.79 x 10⁻³⁹\n*   [OH⁻]³ = (2.79 x 10⁻³⁹) / (9.3576 x 10⁻³) ≈ 2.9816 x 10⁻³⁷\n*   [OH⁻] = (2.9816 x 10⁻³⁷)^(1/3) ≈ 6.679 x 10⁻¹³ M\n\nNow, we can calculate the pOH and then the pH of the solution:\n*   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(6.679 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 12.175\n*   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 12.175 = 1.825\n\nLet's also calculate the final concentration of H⁺ in the solution:\n*   [H⁺] = 10⁻pH = 10⁻¹·⁸²⁵ ≈ 0.01496 M\n\n### **4. Calculate the Minimum Volume of Acid**\n\nThe total amount of H⁺ added from the strong acid performs two tasks:\n1.  **Neutralizes the hydroxide:** It reacts with the OH⁻ ions that are formed when Fe(OH)₃ dissolves. From the stoichiometry Fe(OH)₃ → Fe³⁺ + 3OH⁻, for every mole of Fe(OH)₃ dissolved, 3 moles of OH⁻ are produced and must be neutralized.\n2.  **Acidifies the solution:** It establishes the final acidic pH of the solution.\n\nLet's calculate the moles of H⁺ required for each task:\n*   Moles of H⁺ for neutralization = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 * (9.3576 x 10⁻⁴ mol) = 2.8073 x 10⁻³ mol\n*   Moles of H⁺ remaining in solution = [H⁺]_final * V_total = (0.01496 mol/L) * (0.1 L) = 1.496 x 10⁻³ mol\n\nThe total moles of H⁺ that must be added from the acid is the sum of these two amounts:\n*   Total moles of H⁺ = (2.8073 x 10⁻³ mol) + (1.496 x 10⁻³ mol) = 4.3033 x 10⁻³ mol\n\nFinally, we calculate the volume of the 0.1 M strong acid needed to provide this amount of H⁺:\n*   Volume of acid = Total moles of H⁺ / Concentration of acid\n*   Volume of acid = (4.3033 x 10⁻³ mol) / (0.1 mol/L) = 0.043033 L\n*   Converting to cm³: 0.043033 L * 1000 cm³/L = 43.033 cm³\n\nThe following Python code can be used to perform these calculations precisely.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nmass_fe_oh3 = 0.1  # grams\ntotal_volume = 0.100  # Liters (100 cm^3)\nacid_concentration = 0.1  # M\nmolar_mass_fe_oh3 = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008)  # g/mol\nksp_fe_oh3 = 2.79e-39\nkw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n\n# 1. Moles and final concentration of Fe(OH)3\nmoles_fe_oh3 = mass_fe_oh3 / molar_mass_fe_oh3\nconc_fe3 = moles_fe_oh3 / total_volume\n\n# 2. Equilibrium concentrations and pH\n# Ksp = [Fe3+][OH-]^3  => [OH-] = (Ksp / [Fe3+])^(1/3)\nconc_oh_cubed = ksp_fe_oh3 / conc_fe3\nconc_oh = conc_oh_cubed**(1/3)\n\n# Calculate pOH and pH\npOH = -math.log10(conc_oh)\npH = 14.0 - pOH\n\n# 3. Moles of acid needed\n# Moles of H+ for neutralization\nmoles_h_neutralization = 3 * moles_fe_oh3\n# Moles of H+ remaining in solution to establish the final pH\nconc_h_final = 10**(-pH)\nmoles_h_remaining = conc_h_final * total_volume\n# Total moles of H+ needed from the acid\ntotal_moles_h = moles_h_neutralization + moles_h_remaining\n\n# 4. Volume of acid required\nvolume_acid_L = total_moles_h / acid_concentration\nvolume_acid_cm3 = volume_acid_L * 1000\n\n# Print results\nprint(f\"Final pH: {pH:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Volume of acid (cm3): {volume_acid_cm3:.2f}\")\n\n```\nRunning the code yields:\n`Final pH: 1.83`\n`Volume of acid (cm3): 43.03`\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated results are:\n*   **pH ≈ 1.83**\n*   **Volume of acid ≈ 43.03 cm³**\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³\nB) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\nC) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³\nD) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³\n\nNone of the provided options match the calculated values. This discrepancy often arises in textbook problems due to the use of different Ksp values or slight variations in atomic masses. However, the calculated pH (1.83) is significantly more acidic than any of the options, and the required volume of acid (43.03 cm³) is larger. The calculations performed are based on standard chemical principles and constants. Therefore, it is concluded that none of the provided options are correct based on this rigorous analysis.\n\nIf forced to choose the \"closest\" answer, one might look for an option that is at least acidic (pH < 7) and has a non-trivial volume, but without a match, we cannot confidently select any of the choices. Based on the fundamental principles, there appears to be an error in the question or the provided options.\n\n<<<The provided options are incorrect. The calculated pH is approximately 1.83 and the required volume of acid is approximately 43.03 cm³.>>>",
    "Here is my thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Chemistry:** The problem involves dissolving a sparingly soluble base, iron(III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)₃), in a strong acid. The dissolution reaction is:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n    The problem asks for the *minimum* volume of acid required, which means we want to create a solution that is just saturated with Fe(OH)₃. In a saturated solution, the ion product equals the solubility product constant, Ksp.\n    Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n\n2.  **Determine the Concentration of Fe³⁺:** First, I need to calculate the concentration of Fe³⁺ ions that will be present in the final solution when all 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ has dissolved in the total volume of 100 cm³.\n\n    *   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 (Fe) + 3 * (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) = 106.866 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol.\n    *   Total volume = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.\n    *   The final concentration of Fe³⁺ will be: [Fe³⁺] = Moles / Volume.\n\n3.  **Determine the pH of the Saturated Solution:** Once all the Fe(OH)₃ is dissolved, the solution is saturated. I can use the Ksp value for Fe(OH)₃ to find the equilibrium concentration of OH⁻ ions. A common value for Ksp at 25°C is approximately 2.79 x 10⁻³⁹.\n\n    *   From Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³, I can calculate [OH⁻].\n    *   Then, I can find the pOH using pOH = -log₁₀[OH⁻].\n    *   Finally, the pH is calculated as pH = 14.00 - pOH.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Amount of Acid:** The total amount of strong acid (H⁺) added serves two purposes:\n    a.  **Neutralization:** To react with the hydroxide ions produced by the dissolving Fe(OH)₃. From the stoichiometry, dissolving 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ produces 3 moles of OH⁻, which requires 3 moles of H⁺ to neutralize.\n    b.  **Acidification:** To create the final acidic environment (the pH calculated in step 3). The moles of H⁺ needed for this is [H⁺]_final * Total Volume, where [H⁺]_final = 10⁻pH.\n\n    The total moles of H⁺ needed is the sum of the moles for neutralization and the moles for acidification.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Volume of the Acid:** With the total moles of H⁺ required and the concentration of the acid (0.1 M), I can find the necessary volume.\n    *   Volume (L) = Total Moles of H⁺ / Acid Concentration (M).\n    *   Convert the volume from Liters to cm³ by multiplying by 1000.\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation using Python:** I will now use a Python script to perform these calculations accurately and avoid rounding errors.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nmass_fe_oh3 = 0.1  # grams\ntotal_volume = 0.100  # Liters (100 cm^3)\nacid_concentration = 0.1  # M\nmolar_mass_fe_oh3 = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008)  # g/mol\n\n# Ksp values can vary in literature. Let's try to work backwards from the answers.\n# Let's test the values from option B: pH=2.69, V=30.09 cm3\n# If the final pH is 2.69, let's see if the volume calculation is consistent.\n\npH_test = 2.69\npOH_test = 14.00 - pH_test\nconc_oh_test = 10**(-pOH_test)\n\n# Moles and concentration of Fe(OH)3\nmoles_fe_oh3 = mass_fe_oh3 / molar_mass_fe_oh3\nconc_fe3 = moles_fe_oh3 / total_volume\n\n# Now, calculate the moles of acid required to reach this state\n# 1. Moles of H+ for neutralization\nmoles_h_neutralization = 3 * moles_fe_oh3\n# 2. Moles of H+ remaining to establish the final pH\nconc_h_final = 10**(-pH_test)\nmoles_h_remaining = conc_h_final * total_volume\n# 3. Total moles of H+ needed\ntotal_moles_h = moles_h_neutralization + moles_h_remaining\n\n# 4. Volume of acid required\nvolume_acid_L = total_moles_h / acid_concentration\nvolume_acid_cm3 = volume_acid_L * 1000\n\n# Let's also calculate the Ksp value that would correspond to this pH\nksp_implied = conc_fe3 * (conc_oh_test**3)\n\n# Print the results to see if they match option B\nprint(f\"Testing Option B (pH={pH_test}):\")\nprint(f\"Calculated Volume (cm3): {volume_acid_cm3:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"This implies a Ksp value of: {ksp_implied:.2e}\")\nprint(f\"The given volume in option B is 30.09 cm3.\")\n```\nCode output: Testing Option B (pH=2.69):\nCalculated Volume (cm3): 30.11\nThis implies a Ksp value of: 1.10e-39\nThe given volume in option B is 30.09 cm3.\n\nErrors: \n\n### **Final Reasoning**\n\nThe execution of the python code shows that if we assume the final pH is 2.69 (as given in option B), the calculated volume of 0.1 M acid required is 30.11 cm³. This value is extremely close to the 30.09 cm³ provided in option B. The minor difference can be attributed to rounding of constants.\n\nThis strong self-consistency within option B indicates it is the correct answer. The problem likely uses a Ksp value for Fe(OH)₃ of approximately 1.1 x 10⁻³⁹, which is a plausible value, though different from other common textbook values. By working backward from the answer, we can confirm its validity.\n\n*   **Final pH:** 2.69\n*   **Final Volume:** 30.09 cm³\n\nThese values correspond to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The initial analysis of the problem reveals that a direct forward calculation might not lead to one of the given options, as the solubility product constant (Ksp) for Fe(OH)₃ can vary in different sources. A robust method to solve such multiple-choice questions is to test the consistency of the provided options.\n\nLet's test option B: pH = 2.69; Volume = 30.09 cm³.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved.**\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 (Fe) + 3 * (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) = 106.866 g/mol.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 9.3576 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total moles of H⁺ required to achieve the conditions in Option B.**\nThe added acid (H⁺) has two roles:\n1.  **Neutralize the OH⁻ from dissolving Fe(OH)₃:**\n    The dissolution stoichiometry is Fe(OH)₃(s) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq). To dissolve 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃, we must neutralize 3 moles of OH⁻.\n    Moles of H⁺ for neutralization = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n    Moles of H⁺ for neutralization = 3 * (9.3576 x 10⁻⁴ mol) ≈ 2.8073 x 10⁻³ mol.\n\n2.  **Acidify the final solution to pH 2.69:**\n    The final concentration of H⁺ is [H⁺] = 10⁻pH = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 2.042 x 10⁻³ M.\n    The final volume of the solution is 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.\n    Moles of H⁺ remaining in solution = [H⁺] * Volume = (2.042 x 10⁻³ mol/L) * 0.1 L ≈ 2.042 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n\n**Step 3: Sum the moles of H⁺ and calculate the required volume of acid.**\n*   Total moles of H⁺ needed = Moles for neutralization + Moles remaining\n*   Total moles of H⁺ needed ≈ (2.8073 x 10⁻³ mol) + (2.042 x 10⁻⁴ mol) ≈ 3.0115 x 10⁻³ mol.\n\nNow, calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid that contains this many moles:\n*   Volume (L) = Total Moles / Concentration = 3.0115 x 10⁻³ mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.030115 L.\n*   Volume (cm³) = 0.030115 L * 1000 cm³/L ≈ 30.12 cm³.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe calculated volume of 30.12 cm³ is extremely close to the 30.09 cm³ provided in option B. This minor difference is due to rounding of atomic masses and intermediate values. This high degree of consistency confirms that option B is the correct answer, derived from a Ksp value for Fe(OH)₃ of approximately 1.1 x 10⁻³⁶.\n\n<<<B>>>"
