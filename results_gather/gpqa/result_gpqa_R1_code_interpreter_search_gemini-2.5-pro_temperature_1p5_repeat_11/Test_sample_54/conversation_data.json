    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound from the given 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Analyze each signal in the 1H NMR spectrum:**\n\n    *   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal represents three equivalent protons (3H) that are not coupled to any neighboring protons, hence a singlet (s). A singlet around 2.0-2.2 ppm is highly characteristic of the methyl protons of an acetate group (-O-C(=O)-CH₃). All four options contain an acetate group, so this is consistent.\n\n    *   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal is for one proton (1H) in the vinylic region (i.e., a proton attached to a C=C double bond), indicated by the high chemical shift (~7.0 ppm). It is a doublet (d), meaning it's coupled to one adjacent proton. The most critical piece of information here is the coupling constant, J = 16.0 Hz. Coupling constants between vinylic protons are stereochemically dependent:\n        *   *Trans* coupling (protons on opposite sides of the double bond) typically shows J = 12-18 Hz.\n        *   *Cis* coupling (protons on the same side of the double bond) typically shows J = 6-12 Hz.\n        *   A J value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates a **trans** relationship between the two vinylic protons.\n\n    *   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This is another signal for one proton (1H) in the vinylic region. Its multiplicity is a doublet of quartets (dq). This means the proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons: one single proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet, from a -CH₃ group).\n\n    *   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal represents three protons (3H) in the allylic region (i.e., on a carbon adjacent to a C=C double bond). It is a doublet (d), which means these three protons are coupled to a single adjacent proton. This signal is consistent with a methyl group attached to a double bond (-CH=CH-CH₃).\n\n2.  **Assemble the structure based on the fragments:**\n\n    *   From the signals at 5.5 ppm (dq) and 1.6 ppm (d), we can deduce the presence of a **CH₃-CH=** fragment. The proton on the double bond (at 5.5 ppm) is split into a quartet by the adjacent CH₃ group and into a doublet by another proton.\n    *   From the signal at 7.0 ppm (d), we know there's another proton on the double bond coupled to the one at 5.5 ppm. This gives us the **CH₃-CH=CH-** fragment.\n    *   Combining this with the acetate group from the 2.1 ppm signal (-O-C(=O)-CH₃), the most likely structure is propenyl acetate: **CH₃-CH=CH-O-C(=O)-CH₃**.\n    *   This structure has the correct number of protons and carbons. It excludes the butenyl acetate options, which would have an additional CH₂ group and different splitting patterns.\n\n3.  **Determine the stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n\n    *   As established in step 1, the large coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz** between the two vinylic protons (the ones at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm) is definitive for a **trans** configuration around the double bond.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n\n    *   The compound has a propenyl group, not a butenyl group.\n    *   The geometry of the double bond is trans.\n    *   Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\nLet's check the assignments for Trans-propenyl acetate:\n```\n      H(b) H(a)\n       \\  /\n    C = C\n   /     \\\nCH3(c)    O-CO-CH3(d)\n```\n*   **H(a) (7.0 ppm):** Deshielded by the adjacent oxygen. Coupled only to H(b). Expected: doublet. Matches **(1H, d)**.\n*   **H(b) (5.5 ppm):** Coupled to H(a) (doublet) and the three H(c) protons (quartet). Expected: doublet of quartets. Matches **(1H, dq)**.\n*   **H(c) (1.6 ppm):** Methyl group coupled to H(b). Expected: doublet. Matches **(3H, d)**.\n*   **H(d) (2.1 ppm):** Acetate methyl group, no adjacent protons. Expected: singlet. Matches **(3H, s)**.\n*   **J(ab) coupling:** Protons H(a) and H(b) are trans. Expected: J ~12-18 Hz. Matches **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n\nAll data points are perfectly consistent with Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
