    "*   **Analysis of FT-IR Data**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid, where the broadening is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so the FT-IR data confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n    The key to identifying the correct structure lies in interpreting the complex splitting patterns described. The multiplicity of a signal is given by the (n+1) rule, where 'n' is the number of equivalent neighboring protons. When a proton is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons, the multiplicities are multiplied.\n\n    1.  **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This indicates a proton (let's call it H_A) is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One proton (n=1), splitting H_A into a **doublet**.\n        *   Two protons (n=2), splitting H_A into a **triplet**.\n        *   Three protons (n=3), splitting H_A into a **quartet**.\n\n    2.  **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This indicates a different proton (H_B) is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   One proton (n=1), splitting H_B into a **doublet**.\n        *   Two protons (n=2), splitting H_B into a **triplet**.\n        *   Another set of two protons (n=2), chemically non-equivalent to the first set, splitting H_B into another **triplet**.\n\n*   **Evaluation of the Proposed Structures**\n    We need to find the structure that contains both a proton environment that would produce a `dtq` and another that would produce a `dtt`. Let's analyze each option. For clarity, we will number the carbons of the main acid chain, starting with the carboxyl carbon as C1.\n\n    *   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n        ```\n              CH₃   CH₃\n               |     |\n        CH₃-CH₂-CH -- CH -- COOH\n         (5) (4) (3)   (2)\n        ```\n        *   **H at C3:** Neighbors are H at C2 (1H, doublet), CH₂ at C4 (2H, triplet), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H, quartet). This signal is a **dtq**.\n        *   However, there is no proton in this molecule that is adjacent to three groups of (1H, 2H, 2H) to produce a `dtt`. So, A is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n        ```\n              C₂H₅  C₂H₅\n               |     |\n        CH₃-CH₂-CH -- CH -- COOH\n         (5) (4) (3)   (2)\n        ```\n        *   **H at C3:** Neighbors are H at C2 (1H, doublet), CH₂ at C4 (2H, triplet), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C3 (2H, triplet). This signal is a **dtt**.\n        *   However, there is no proton in this molecule that is adjacent to three groups of (1H, 2H, 3H) to produce a `dtq`. So, C is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n        ```\n              CH₃   CH₃\n               |     |\n        CH₃ --CH -- CH -- CH₂ -- COOH\n         (5)   (4)   (3)   (2)\n        ```\n        *   **H at C3:** Neighbors are H at C4 (1H, doublet), CH₂ at C2 (2H, triplet), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H, quartet). This signal is a **dtq**.\n        *   However, there is no proton in this molecule that would produce a `dtt`. The proton at C4 is coupled to H at C3 (1H) and the protons of the isopropyl group end, which would not result in a `dtt`. So, D is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid)**\n        The linear formula represents the molecule `CH₃-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH`. Let's determine the correct IUPAC name and structure. The longest carbon chain containing the carboxyl group is a 6-carbon chain (hexanoic acid).\n        The structure is:\n        ```\n                     CH₃\n                      |\n        CH₃ -- CH₂ -- CH -- CH -- CH₂ -- COOH\n         (6)    (5)    (4)   (3)   (2)\n                               |\n                               CH₂CH₃ (Ethyl group)\n        ```\n        Let's analyze the signals for the protons on the chiral centers, C3 and C4.\n        *   **H at C4:** This proton's neighbors are:\n            *   H at C3 (1H) → doublet\n            *   CH₂ at C5 (2H) → triplet\n            *   CH₃ group on C4 (3H) → quartet\n            The resulting signal for H at C4 is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first piece of NMR data.\n        *   **H at C3:** This proton's neighbors are:\n            *   H at C4 (1H) → doublet\n            *   CH₂ at C2 (2H) → triplet\n            *   CH₂ of the ethyl group on C3 (2H) → triplet\n            The resulting signal for H at C3 is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second piece of NMR data.\n\nSince the molecule corresponding to option B is the only one that exhibits both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<B>>>"
