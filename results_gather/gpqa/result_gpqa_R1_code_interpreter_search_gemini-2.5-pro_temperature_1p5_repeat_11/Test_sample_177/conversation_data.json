    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe question asks for two things:\na) The mass dimension of the coupling constant `κ` in the given Lagrangian `L_int`.\nb) Whether the theory described by this interaction is renormalizable.\n\n**2. Analyze the Lagrangian Term**\n\nThe given interaction Lagrangian is:\n`L_int = κ * ψ̄ * σ_μν * ψ * F^μν`\n\n**3. Determine the Mass Dimension of the Lagrangian Density**\n\nThe action `S` is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density `L` over four-dimensional spacetime:\n`S = ∫ d⁴x L`\n\nFor the action `S` to be a dimensionless quantity in natural units (where `ħ = c = 1`), the Lagrangian density `L` must have a mass dimension that compensates for the `d⁴x` term.\nThe spacetime differential `d⁴x` has dimensions of (length)⁴. In natural units, mass has dimensions of `M`, and length has dimensions of `M⁻¹`.\nTherefore, `[d⁴x] = (M⁻¹)⁴ = M⁻⁴`.\n\nSince `[S] = M⁰` (dimensionless), we have:\n`[S] = [d⁴x] * [L]`\n`M⁰ = M⁻⁴ * [L]`\nThis implies that the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density `L` (and any term within it, like `L_int`) must be `[L] = M⁴`.\n\n**4. Determine the Mass Dimensions of the Fields and Operators**\n\nWe need to find the mass dimension of each component in `L_int` to isolate `[κ]`.\n\n*   **Fermion field (ψ):** The kinetic term for a fermion field in the full Lagrangian is `L_kinetic_fermion = ψ̄(iγ^μ∂_μ - m)ψ`.\n    *   We know `[L] = M⁴`.\n    *   The derivative `∂_μ` has a mass dimension `[∂_μ] = M¹`.\n    *   Looking at the `ψ̄γ^μ∂_μψ` part, its dimension must be `M⁴`.\n    *   `[ψ̄] * [γ^μ] * [∂_μ] * [ψ] = M⁴`.\n    *   Gamma matrices `γ^μ` are dimensionless, so `[γ^μ] = M⁰`.\n    *   `[ψ̄]` has the same dimension as `[ψ]`.\n    *   So, `[ψ]² * M¹ = M⁴`.\n    *   `[ψ]² = M³`.\n    *   `[ψ] = M³/²`. And consequently, `[ψ̄] = M³/²`.\n\n*   **Field strength tensor (F^μν):** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is `L_kinetic_EM = -1/4 F_μν F^μν`.\n    *   This term must also have a mass dimension of `M⁴`.\n    *   `[F_μν F^μν] = [F_μν]² = M⁴`.\n    *   Therefore, `[F_μν] = M²`.\n\n*   **Sigma tensor (σ_μν):** This is defined as `σ_μν = (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]`.\n    *   As established before, the gamma matrices `γ_μ` are dimensionless.\n    *   The commutator of dimensionless matrices is also dimensionless.\n    *   Therefore, `[σ_μν] = M⁰`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Mass Dimension of κ**\n\nNow we can use the overall dimension of `L_int` to find the dimension of `κ`.\n`[L_int] = [κ] * [ψ̄] * [σ_μν] * [ψ] * [F^μν]`\n`M⁴ = [κ] * M³/² * M⁰ * M³/² * M²`\n`M⁴ = [κ] * M^(3/2 + 3/2) * M²`\n`M⁴ = [κ] * M³ * M²`\n`M⁴ = [κ] * M⁵`\n\nSolving for `[κ]`:\n`[κ] = M⁴ / M⁵ = M⁻¹`\n\nSo, the mass dimension of `κ` is -1.\n\n**6. Determine Renormalizability**\n\nThe renormalizability of a quantum field theory can be assessed (by power-counting) based on the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n\n*   If the mass dimension of a coupling constant `g` is `[g] > 0`, the interaction is \"super-renormalizable\".\n*   If `[g] = 0`, the interaction is \"renormalizable\".\n*   If `[g] < 0`, the interaction is \"non-renormalizable\".\n\nIn our case, the coupling constant is `κ`, and we found `[κ] = M⁻¹`. Since the mass dimension is negative, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nA negative mass dimension implies that at higher orders in perturbation theory (i.e., in loop diagrams), the coupling constant will come with powers of momentum in the numerator of integrals. This makes the ultraviolet (high-momentum) divergences worse with each order, requiring an infinite number of new counterterms to cancel them, which ruins the predictive power of the theory at high energies.\n\n**7. Conclusion**\n\n*   The mass dimension of `κ` is -1.\n*   The theory is not renormalizable.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
