    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the compound C9H11NO2 using the provided spectral data.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)\n\nFirst, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to determine the number of rings and/or double bonds in the molecule.\n\n*   **Formula:** DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n*   **Calculation:** DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n\nA DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring + three double bonds) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong intensity):** These two distinct peaks in the N-H stretching region are characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands arise from the asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes of the N-H bonds.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong intensity):** This absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an ester that is conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring. The conjugation lowers the frequency from the usual 1735-1750 cm⁻¹ for a saturated ester.\n\n**IR Conclusion:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂) group and a conjugated ester functional group.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Indicates three protons, characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Splitting (t = triplet):** The triplet means it has 2 adjacent protons (n+1 rule: 2+1=3). This points to a -CH₂-CH₃ fragment.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Indicates two protons, characteristic of a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Splitting (q = quartet):** The quartet means it has 3 adjacent protons (n+1 rule: 3+1=4). This confirms the -CH₂-CH₃ fragment.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This downfield shift is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n    *   **Combined:** The triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm together confirm the presence of an **ethyl ester group** (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Indicates two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs = broad singlet):** This is typical for exchangeable protons, such as those on an -OH or -NH₂ group. Combined with the IR data, this signal corresponds to the two protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H + 2H = 4H):** Four protons in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm), confirming the benzene ring.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** The presence of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The aromatic protons are split into two groups. One set is relatively upfield (more shielded) at 7.0 ppm, and the other is significantly downfield (more deshielded) at 8.0 ppm. This indicates that one substituent on the ring is electron-donating (shields the adjacent protons) and the other is electron-withdrawing (deshields the adjacent protons).\n        *   The amino group (-NH₂) is a strong electron-donating group, which would shield the ortho protons, shifting them upfield. The signal at 7.0 ppm corresponds to these protons.\n        *   The ester group (-COOR) is an electron-withdrawing group, which would deshield the ortho protons, shifting them downfield. The signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to these protons.\n\n### 4. Evaluation of the Options\n\nLet's see which proposed structure fits all the data:\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This has an amide group, which is inconsistent with the ester C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹. It also has a 1,3- (meta) substitution pattern, which would give a more complex aromatic NMR spectrum, not two doublets.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This molecule has a propionate group (-OCOC₂H₅), not an ethyl ester group. The NMR would show a triplet and quartet in the aliphatic region (for -CH₂CH₃), but the quartet would be around 2.2-2.5 ppm (next to C=O), not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This molecule has a secondary amide (-NH-), which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not two. This contradicts the IR data indicating a primary amine.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:**\n    *   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂ - **Correct.**\n    *   **Functional Groups:** Has a primary amine (-NH₂) and a conjugated ethyl ester. - **Correct.**\n    *   **¹H NMR:**\n        *   Contains an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃), matching the triplet and quartet.\n        *   Contains a primary amine (-NH₂), matching the broad singlet.\n        *   Has a 1,4-disubstituted ring with an electron-donating (-NH₂) and electron-withdrawing (-COOEt) group, matching the two aromatic doublets.\n\nAll spectroscopic data points are consistent with the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
