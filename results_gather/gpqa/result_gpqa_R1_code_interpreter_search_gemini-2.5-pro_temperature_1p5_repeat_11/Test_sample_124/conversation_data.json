    "*   **1. Identify the Physical System and its Hamiltonian**\n    The problem describes a particle of mass $m$ in a three-dimensional isotropic potential $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator.\n    In Cartesian coordinates, $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$, so the potential can be written as:\n    $V(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x^2\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 y^2\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 z^2\\right)$\n    This potential is separable, meaning it's a sum of three independent 1D harmonic oscillator potentials, one for each Cartesian coordinate: $V(x,y,z) = V_x(x) + V_y(y) + V_z(z)$.\n\n*   **2. Determine the Energy Eigenvalues**\n    Because the potential is separable, the total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the three independent 1D harmonic oscillators. The energy eigenvalues for a 1D harmonic oscillator are given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + 1/2)\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the quantum number for that dimension.\n    The total energy $E$ is therefore:\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z}$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + 1/2)\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + 1/2)\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + 1/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n    $E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n    Let's define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$. The energy levels can be expressed as:\n    $E_n = (n + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega$\n\n*   **3. Identify the Energy Levels and States**\n    We need to find the energy of the *third excited state*. This means we need to find the fourth lowest energy level (after the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state).\n    *   **Ground State (n=0):**\n        *   $n = n_x + n_y + n_z = 0$. The only possible combination is $(n_x, n_y, n_z) = (0, 0, 0)$.\n        *   Energy: $E_0 = (0 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (3/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n    *   **First Excited State (n=1):**\n        *   $n = n_x + n_y + n_z = 1$.\n        *   Energy: $E_1 = (1 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (5/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n    *   **Second Excited State (n=2):**\n        *   $n = n_x + n_y + n_z = 2$.\n        *   Energy: $E_2 = (2 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (7/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n    *   **Third Excited State (n=3):**\n        *   $n = n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.\n        *   Energy: $E_3 = (3 + 3/2)\\hbar\\omega = (9/2)\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n*   **4. Calculate the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State**\n    The degeneracy of an energy level is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same total energy. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways to choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is 3.\n    The possible combinations for $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ are:\n    1.  Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3). This gives 3 states.\n    2.  Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2). This gives 6 states.\n    3.  Permutations of (1, 1, 1): (1,1,1). This gives 1 state.\n\n    The total number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) for the third excited state is the sum of these states: $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\n    Alternatively, the degeneracy $g_n$ of the n-th level for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the formula:\n    $g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n    For the third excited state, $n=3$:\n    $g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\n*   **5. Compare with the Options**\n    The energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy is 10.\n    Let's check the given options:\n    A) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10  (Incorrect energy)\n    B) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3   (Incorrect energy and degeneracy)\n    C) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10         (Correct energy and degeneracy)\n    D) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3          (Incorrect degeneracy)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
