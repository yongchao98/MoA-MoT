    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning to arrive at the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials of a moving point charge.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Problem:** The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and the vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) at a specific point in space ($\\vec{r}$) and time (t), generated by a point charge (q) moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$. These potentials are fundamental in classical electrodynamics and are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n2.  **The Concept of Retarded Time:** A key principle in electromagnetism is that electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, c. This means the field observed at point $\\vec{r}$ at time t was not generated by the charge at its position at time t, but at some earlier time, called the **retarded time**, $t_r$.\n\n3.  **Defining the Variables:**\n    *   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge q at the retarded time $t_r$. This is the source point.\n    *   $\\vec{r}$: The position where the field is observed at time t. This is the field point.\n    *   $\\vec{d}$: The vector from the source point to the field point. As defined in the problem, $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n    *   $d$: The magnitude of this vector, $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$.\n    *   $\\vec{v}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time, $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=t_r}$.\n    *   $c$: The speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n4.  **The Retarded Time Condition:** The time it takes for the field to travel from the source point $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ to the field point $\\vec{r}$ is $d/c$. Therefore, the observation time t is related to the retarded time $t_r$ by the equation:\n    $t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c} = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n    This is an implicit equation for $t_r$, as $t_r$ appears on both sides.\n\n5.  **General Formulas for Retarded Potentials:** The potentials V and $\\vec{A}$ are solutions to Maxwell's equations and can be expressed in terms of the charge density $\\rho$ and current density $\\vec{J}$ as retarded integrals:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n    where $t_r = t - |\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|/c$.\n\n6.  **Applying to a Point Charge:** For a point charge q, the charge and current densities are represented by Dirac delta functions:\n    $\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n    $\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\cdot \\vec{v}(t') \\cdot \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\n7.  **Evaluating the Integrals:** Substituting these into the potential formulas requires careful evaluation of the integral involving the delta function, whose argument includes the retarded time. The result of this integration (a standard result in E&M textbooks like Griffiths) is not simply a substitution. The time-dependence of the charge's volume element leads to a correction factor in the denominator.\n    The integration yields:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\n    The notation $[...]_{t_r}$ means all quantities inside the brackets ($d, \\vec{d}, \\vec{v}$) must be evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n8.  **Simplifying the Expressions:** The expressions can be rewritten by multiplying the numerator and denominator by c:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n9.  **Comparing with the Options:**\n    *   **A) V(...) = q/(4πε₀r), ...:** Incorrect. This is the static Coulomb potential, which doesn't account for motion or retardation effects correctly.\n    *   **B) V(...) = qc/(4πε₀(dc - d⋅v)), A(...) = μ₀qcv/(4π(dc - d⋅v)):** This exactly matches our derived Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n    *   **C) V(...) = q/(4πε₀r), ...:** Incorrect for the same reason as A. The form of $\\vec{A}$ is also incorrect.\n    *   **D) V(...) = qc/(4πε₀(dc + d⋅v)), ...:** Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. The negative sign arises from the retardation effect (a Doppler-like effect); if the charge moves towards the observer ($\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} > 0$), the denominator becomes smaller, and the potential becomes larger, as expected.\n\n10. **Final Conclusion:** The correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option B. It is also worth noting that for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$, which is consistent with the expressions in option B since $\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 = 1/c^2$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
