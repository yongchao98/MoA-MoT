    "**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\nThe user wants to identify which of the given organic compounds can exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Optical Isomerism**\nOptical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if its molecule is **chiral**. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The two non-superimposable mirror images are called enantiomers. A key test for chirality is the absence of a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion in the molecule's conformation.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each compound for chirality.**\n\n**Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a substituted biphenyl compound. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   At the 2 and 2' positions are dimethyl dicarboxylate groups (-COOCH3).\n    *   At the 6 and 6' positions are nitro groups (-NO2).\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** The positions ortho to the inter-ring C-C bond (positions 2, 2', 6, 6') are occupied by bulky groups (-COOCH3 and -NO2). These bulky groups sterically hinder the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This phenomenon is called **atropisomerism**. Because rotation is restricted, the two phenyl rings are forced into a non-planar (twisted) arrangement.\n*   **Symmetry Check:**\n    *   Does this twisted molecule have a plane of symmetry? No. A plane cannot bisect the molecule into two identical halves because of the twist and the specific placement of different substituents.\n    *   Does it have a center of inversion? No.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion due to hindered rotation, it is chiral. Its mirror image will be non-superimposable. Therefore, it exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Methyl Lactate)**\n*   **Structure:** The chemical formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:** Let's focus on the central carbon atom, which is C2 (the carbon bearing the -OH group). This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3)\n*   A carbon atom bonded to four different substituents is called a **chiral center** or a stereocenter.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule inherently chiral (unless it is a meso compound, which requires at least two chiral centers). Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as a pair of enantiomers (R-methyl lactate and S-methyl lactate) and shows optical isomerism.\n\n**Compound 3: benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** The formula is (C6H5)2CO or Ph-CO-Ph. It consists of a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to two phenyl rings.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule is not planar, as the phenyl rings are twisted out of the plane of the C=O group. However, we must check for symmetry elements.\n    *   **Symmetry Check:** The molecule possesses a C2 axis of rotation that passes through the C=O bond. More importantly, it has a **plane of symmetry** that passes through the C=O group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a plane of symmetry means the molecule is **achiral**. Its mirror image is superimposable on the original molecule. Therefore, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the *trans* isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. Its structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two -COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n*   **Chirality Analysis:**\n    *   The molecule is planar. Any planar molecule has at least one plane of symmetry: the molecular plane itself.\n    *   **Symmetry Check:** Besides the molecular plane, dimethyl fumarate also has a **center of inversion** at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Inverting any atom through this point results in an identical atom.\n*   **Conclusion:** Due to the presence of both a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion, the molecule is **achiral** and cannot show optical isomerism.\n\n**Step 3: Consolidate the results.**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (chiral due to atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral due to a stereocenter).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral, has a plane of symmetry).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral, has a plane of symmetry and center of inversion).\n\nTherefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.\n\n**Step 4: Select the correct option.**\nThe option that includes both 1 and 2 is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
