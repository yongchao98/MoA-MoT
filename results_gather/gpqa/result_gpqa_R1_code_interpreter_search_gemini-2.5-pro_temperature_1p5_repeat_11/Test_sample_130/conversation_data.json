    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid and Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR spectrum and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in its ¹³C spectrum.\n    *   The simplest *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid. Its dehydration product is maleic anhydride.\n    *   Let's check if maleic anhydride's spectral data matches the description. Maleic anhydride has a C₂v symmetry axis.\n        *   **¹H NMR:** The two protons on the double bond are chemically equivalent. They are deshielded by the adjacent electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. A chemical shift around 7 ppm is expected. So, a single peak for these two protons at 7 ppm is consistent with the structure of maleic anhydride.\n        *   **¹³C NMR:** Due to symmetry, there are only two unique carbon environments: the two equivalent olefinic carbons (C=C) and the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O). Olefinic carbons typically resonate around 100-150 ppm (137 ppm is a good fit), and carbonyl carbons resonate around 160-180 ppm (165 ppm is a good fit).\n    *   Therefore, the anhydride is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds at positions 1 and 3, methyl groups attached to carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4, and a CH₂ group at position 5.\n    *   Molecular formula of maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) + Molecular formula of the diene (C₉H₁₄) gives the product formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which matches the information given.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Products**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n*   **Stereochemistry and Isomers:** Diels-Alder reactions often produce two stereoisomeric products: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n    *   The **endo rule** predicts that the major product is typically the *endo* isomer, where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile are oriented under the newly formed six-membered ring.\n    *   The *exo* isomer is typically the minor product.\n    *   Thus, the **major product is the *endo* adduct**, and the **minor product is the *exo* adduct**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Structure of the Products and Predict NMR Signals**\n\nLet's visualize the structure of the bicyclic adducts and predict their ¹H NMR signals. Both products possess a plane of symmetry that bisects the double bond and the anhydride ring.\n\n*   **Proton Types and Expected Signals:**\n    1.  **Anhydride Protons (H-a):** The two protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule. Due to the plane of symmetry, they are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they will appear as a **2H singlet**. Their position, being alpha to carbonyl groups in a strained ring system, would be relatively downfield. The value of **~3.5 ppm** is reasonable.\n    2.  **Vinylic Methyls:** The two methyl groups on the double bond of the newly formed ring. They are equivalent by symmetry. They will appear as a **6H singlet**. Methyl groups on a double bond are typically deshielded compared to those on sp³ carbons. A value of **~1.7 ppm** is a reasonable estimate.\n    3.  **Bridgehead Methyls:** The two methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons. They are also equivalent by symmetry and will appear as a **6H singlet**. These are on saturated (sp³) carbons and should be more shielded (further upfield) than the vinylic methyls. A value of **~1.0 ppm** is plausible.\n    4.  **Methylene Bridge Protons:** The two protons of the CH₂ group that forms the bridge. These two protons are diastereotopic and thus not equivalent. They would likely appear as two separate signals, each coupling with the other (geminal coupling), forming a pair of doublets (an AB system). One of these could correspond to the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** mentioned in the options.\n\n**4. Interpret the 2D NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   **NOESY Principle:** A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), regardless of whether they are connected by chemical bonds.\n*   **The Distinguishing Cross-Peak:** The problem states there is a cross-peak present in the major product's spectrum but absent (or weak) in the minor product's spectrum. This means we must find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer (major) but far apart in the *exo* isomer (minor).\n*   **Spatial Analysis of Isomers:**\n    *   **Endo Isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the C=C double bond. This geometry brings the **anhydride protons (H-a)** into close spatial proximity with the **vinylic methyl groups**. A strong Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) and thus a strong cross-peak is expected between them.\n    *   **Exo Isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring points away from the C=C double bond. In this arrangement, the **anhydride protons (H-a)** are now far away from the **vinylic methyl groups**. The NOE between them would be very weak or absent.\n\n**5. Match the Interacting Protons to the NMR Signals**\n\n*   The NOESY cross-peak that distinguishes the major and minor products connects the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyls.\n*   From our signal assignment in step 3:\n    *   Anhydride protons = **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n    *   Vinylic methyls = **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**\n*   Therefore, the cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum connects the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.\n\nThis corresponds perfectly with option A.\n\n*   **Why other options are incorrect:**\n    *   **B) 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This is an interaction between a bridge proton and the anhydride protons. While an interaction might exist, a similar (or even stronger) interaction would also exist in the *exo* isomer, so it would not be a distinguishing peak.\n    *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This is between the bridgehead methyls and the vinylic methyls. They are close in both isomers, so an NOE would be seen in both spectra.\n    *   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This is between the bridgehead methyls and a bridge proton. They are close in both isomers, so an NOE would be seen in both spectra.\n\n<<<A>>>"
