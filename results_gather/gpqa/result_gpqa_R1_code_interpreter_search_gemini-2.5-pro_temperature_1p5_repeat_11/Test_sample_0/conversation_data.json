    "This problem is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in a quantum state's energy (ΔE) to its lifetime (Δt or τ). The principle is mathematically stated as:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δτ ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy, also known as the natural linewidth of the energy level.\n*   Δτ is the lifetime of the state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s or 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nTo clearly distinguish or resolve two energy levels, E1 and E2, the difference in their energies, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than the energy uncertainty (linewidth) of the states. When both states have a finite lifetime, the condition for them to be resolvable is that their energy difference must be greater than the larger of their individual linewidths.\n\nThe energy linewidth is inversely proportional to the lifetime (ΔE ≈ ħ/Δτ). This means the state with the *shorter* lifetime will have the *larger* energy uncertainty. This larger uncertainty is the limiting factor for resolving the two levels.\n\nLet's identify the shorter lifetime:\n*   τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s\nThe shorter lifetime is τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s.\n\nNow, we calculate the energy uncertainty (ΔE) corresponding to this shorter lifetime. This value represents the minimum energy separation required to distinguish the levels.\n\nΔE_min ≈ ħ / τ1\n\nWe can use a Python script to perform this calculation accurately and convert the result from Joules to electron-volts (eV).\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\n# Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nhbar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states in seconds\ntau1 = 1e-9\ntau2 = 1e-8\n\n# The state with the shorter lifetime has the larger energy uncertainty (linewidth),\n# which determines the minimum required energy separation for the levels to be resolved.\nshorter_lifetime = min(tau1, tau2)\n\n# Calculate the minimum energy separation required using the uncertainty principle\n# Delta_E_min * shorter_lifetime ~ hbar\nmin_energy_separation_eV = hbar_eVs / shorter_lifetime\n\nprint(f\"The shorter lifetime is {shorter_lifetime:.1e} s.\")\nprint(f\"The minimum required energy separation to resolve the levels is approximately {min_energy_separation_eV:.3e} eV.\")\n\n```\nThe shorter lifetime is 1.0e-09 s.\nThe minimum required energy separation to resolve the levels is approximately 6.582e-07 eV.\n\nThe calculation shows that the minimum energy separation required to distinguish the two levels is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV. We must choose an energy difference from the options that is greater than this value.\n\nLet's compare this requirement with the given options:\n*   A) 10⁻⁹ eV (10⁻⁹ < 6.582 x 10⁻⁷, so this is not sufficient)\n*   B) 10⁻⁸ eV (10⁻⁸ < 6.582 x 10⁻⁷, so this is not sufficient)\n*   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV (10⁻¹¹ < 6.582 x 10⁻⁷, so this is not sufficient)\n*   D) 10⁻⁴ eV (10⁻⁴ > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷, so this is sufficient)\n\nOnly option D provides an energy difference large enough to clearly resolve the two energy levels.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "This problem is solved using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which establishes a fundamental limit on the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle can be known simultaneously. For energy (E) and time (t), the relationship is:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δτ ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy of a quantum state, often referred to as its natural linewidth.\n*   Δτ is the lifetime of the state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nFor two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguished, the difference in their energies, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than their energy uncertainties. The state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy uncertainty (linewidth), as ΔE is inversely proportional to Δτ. This larger uncertainty is the primary factor limiting our ability to resolve the two levels.\n\n1.  **Identify the shorter lifetime:**\n    *   Lifetime of state 1 (τ₁): 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Lifetime of state 2 (τ₂): 10⁻⁸ s\n    The shorter lifetime is τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s.\n\n2.  **Calculate the energy uncertainty for the shorter lifetime:**\n    The energy uncertainty (ΔE₁) for the state with the shorter lifetime will be larger and thus dictates the minimum required separation.\n    \n    ΔE_max ≈ ħ / τ_shorter\n    ΔE_max ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n    ΔE_max ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    The code execution you performed confirmed this calculation: the minimum required energy separation is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\n3.  **Compare the required separation with the given options:**\n    For the levels to be clearly resolved, their energy difference must be greater than this minimum value.\n    |E1 - E2| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    Let's check the options:\n    *   A) 10⁻⁹ eV is less than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁸ eV is less than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   C) 10⁻¹¹ eV is less than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   D) 10⁻⁴ eV is greater than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option D provides an energy difference large enough to be clearly distinguished from the natural linewidth of the shorter-lived state.\n\n<<<D>>>"
