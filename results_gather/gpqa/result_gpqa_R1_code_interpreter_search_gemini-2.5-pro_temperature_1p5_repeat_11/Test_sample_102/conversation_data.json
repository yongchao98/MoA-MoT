    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\nLet's break down its structure:\n*   **Parent:** Benzene ring.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The groups are at positions 1, 3, and 5. This means all substituents are **meta** to each other.\n\n### 2. Understand the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\nThe order in which these groups are added to the benzene ring is critical. This is governed by the directing effects of the substituents in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS) reactions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Important Reaction Rule:** Friedel-Crafts reactions (like acylation with CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) do not work on strongly deactivated rings, especially those containing a nitro group (-NO₂). This means the **acylation step must be performed before the nitration step**.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Proposed Reaction Sequences\n\nLet's analyze each option based on these principles.\n\n**A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...**\n*   i) Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Reduction of nitrobenzene gives aniline.\n*   iii) Diazotization of aniline gives benzenediazonium chloride.\n*   iv) Reaction with H₃PO₂ reduces the diazonium salt, removing the group entirely and regenerating benzene. This sequence makes no sense as it brings you back to the starting material. This option is incorrect.\n\n**C) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃...**\n*   i) Bromination of benzene gives bromobenzene. The -Br group is an o,p-director.\n*   ii) Nitration of bromobenzene gives a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene (ortho) and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (para), with the para product being major. Neither has the 1,3-relationship needed.\n*   iii) Acylation of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene would be the next step. This Friedel-Crafts reaction will **fail** because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. This option is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃...**\n*   i) Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene.\n*   iii) The next EAS step shown is Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃) on a product derived from nitrobenzene. As established, FC acylation fails on nitrobenzene. This option is incorrect from the start. (Even if we consider the intermediate steps of reduction to aniline, the pathway does not lead to the desired product, as acylation would then occur on the amine or its complex with AlCl₃, leading to different isomers).\n\n**B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄...**\nLet's analyze this sequence step-by-step:\n*   **i) Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This reaction works well to produce **acetophenone**. The acetyl group (-COCH₃) is a **meta-director**.\n     \n*   **ii) Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ (Bromination):** The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine electrophile (Br⁺) to the meta position. This correctly forms **3-bromoacetophenone**.\n     \n*   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ (Nitration):** We now nitrate 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring has two substituents:\n    *   -COCH₃ at C1 (meta-director, directs to C5).\n    *   -Br at C3 (ortho, para-director, directs to C2, C4, C6).\n    The acetyl group is a moderate deactivator, and its meta-directing effect to the open position (C5) is strong. The bromo group directs elsewhere. In this case, the directing effects combine favorably, and the major product is indeed **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**, the desired target molecule, in high yield.\n     \n\nThe first three steps of this sequence provide a viable, high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. The remaining steps (iv-vii) in the option are extraneous and would modify the product in undesirable ways, but the core synthetic route presented at the beginning of this option is the correct one. Among the choices given, this is the only one that presents a chemically sound pathway.\n\n<<<B>>>"
