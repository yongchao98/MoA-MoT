    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Reactions and Products**\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reaction 2:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nThe product in both reactions is a derivative of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**, which is a delta-lactone (a six-membered cyclic ester). The two products are enantiomers, differing only in their stereochemistry at the chiral center, C4.\n\nThe formation of this lactone implies that the starting material, upon selective reduction, yields a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid (or a derivative) which then undergoes intramolecular cyclization (lactonization). The structure of this precursor must be `HO-(CH₂)₄-COOH` with an ethyl group at the appropriate position.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nAll options for starting materials A and B are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. Let's draw its structure and identify its key features:\n`isobutyl-O-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-COOH`\nThis molecule has:\n*   A carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`).\n*   An isobutyl ester group (`-COO-isobutyl`).\n*   A single chiral center at C3, the carbon atom bonded to the ethyl group.\n\nThe lactone product is formed from an open-chain precursor `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`, which results from the reduction of either the ester or the carboxylic acid group. The C3 of the starting material corresponds to C4 of the lactone product. The stereochemistry at this center is key to solving the problem.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Reagents and their Selectivity**\n\nThe outcome of each reaction depends on the selective action of the reducing agent:\n\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** This is a moderately strong reducing agent. It is known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** This reagent is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids. It reduces carboxylic acids much more rapidly than it reduces esters.\n\n### **4. Trace the Path of Each Reaction**\n\n#### **Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ → (R)-Lactone**\n\n1.  **Reduction:** LiBH₄ selectively reduces the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The carboxylic acid at C1 remains unchanged.\n    `A (isobutyl-OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH)` → `HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`\n2.  **Lactonization:** The H⁺ workup catalyzes the intramolecular esterification between the newly formed hydroxyl group (at C5) and the existing carboxylic acid group (at C1), forming the six-membered lactone ring.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** We need to determine if the R/S configuration changes. This depends on how the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the groups attached to the chiral center change.\n\n    *   **Starting Material (A):** The chiral center C3 is attached to:\n        1.  `-CH₂-COO-isobutyl` (Priority 1)\n        2.  `-CH₂-COOH` (Priority 2)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Priority 3)\n        4.  `-H` (Priority 4)\n        *(Reasoning: `-CH₂-COOR` beats `-CH₂-COOH` because the isobutyl group is larger than H).*\n\n    *   **Lactone Product:** After reduction and cyclization, the chiral center C4 is attached to:\n        1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (from the original acid group, Priority 2)\n        2.  `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (from the original ester group, Priority 1)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Priority 3)\n        4.  `-H` (Priority 4)\n        *(Reasoning: The path `-CH₂-C(=O)-` has higher priority than `-CH₂-CH₂O-` because C is attached to (O,O,O) vs (O,H,H)).*\n\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The group that was Priority 1 in the starting material becomes Priority 2 in the product, and the group that was Priority 2 becomes Priority 1. This swapping of the top two priorities leads to an **inversion** of the stereochemical descriptor (R → S, S → R).\n    *   Since the product is the **(R)-lactone**, the starting material **A must have the (S) configuration**.\n\n#### **Reaction 2: B + BH₃ → (S)-Lactone**\n\n1.  **Reduction:** BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The isobutyl ester at C5 remains unchanged.\n    `B (isobutyl-OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH)` → `isobutyl-OOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂-OH`\n2.  **Lactonization:** The H⁺ workup catalyzes intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol and forming the lactone ring.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** We again analyze the CIP priorities.\n\n    *   **Starting Material (B):** Same priorities as for A.\n        1.  `-CH₂-COO-isobutyl` (Priority 1)\n        2.  `-CH₂-COOH` (Priority 2)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Priority 3)\n\n    *   **Lactone Product:** The groups attached to the chiral center are the same as in Reaction 1, with the same priorities.\n        1.  `-CH₂-C(=O)-O-` (from the original ester group, Priority 1)\n        2.  `-CH₂-CH₂-O-` (from the original acid group, Priority 2)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Priority 3)\n\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The group that was Priority 1 in the starting material (`-CH₂-COOR`) becomes the group with Priority 1 in the product (`-CH₂-C(=O)-O-`). The group that was Priority 2 (`-CH₂-COOH`) becomes Priority 2 (`-CH₂-CH₂-O-`). The relative priority order is unchanged. This results in **retention** of the stereochemical descriptor (R → R, S → S).\n    *   Since the product is the **(S)-lactone**, the starting material **B must have the (S) configuration**.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must also be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
