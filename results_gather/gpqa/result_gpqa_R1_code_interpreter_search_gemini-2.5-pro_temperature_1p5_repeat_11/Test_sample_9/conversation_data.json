    "*   **Analysis of Each Option:**\n\n    1.  **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is simply describing Earth. Earth's average density is a standard value, approximately 5.51 grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm³). We will use this as our reference point.\n        *   Density(a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n\n    2.  **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3:** The density is explicitly given in the question.\n        *   Density(b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n\n    3.  **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This describes a \"Super-Earth.\" When a planet has a larger mass but the same composition as a smaller one, its own gravity becomes significantly stronger. This increased gravitational force compresses the material of the planet, packing the atoms more tightly together. As a result, the overall density of the planet increases. Therefore, this 5-Earth-mass planet will be denser than Earth.\n\n        *   To illustrate: Let's consider the mass-radius relationship for rocky planets, which is not linear. Due to compression, the radius (R) grows more slowly than the cube root of the mass (M). A common approximation is R ∝ M^x, where x is roughly 0.27-0.28 (and definitely less than 1/3).\n        *   Density (ρ) is Mass / Volume, so ρ ∝ M / R³.\n        *   Substituting the relationship for R, we get ρ ∝ M / (M^x)³ = M / M^(3x) = M^(1-3x).\n        *   Since x < 1/3, the exponent (1-3x) is positive. This means that as mass (M) increases, density (ρ) also increases.\n        *   Since this planet is 5 times more massive than Earth, its density will be significantly higher than Earth's.\n        *   Density(c) > Density(a).\n\n    4.  **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** This describes a \"sub-Earth.\" Using the same logic as above, a planet with less mass will have weaker self-gravity. This leads to less compression of its internal materials compared to Earth. Consequently, its overall density will be lower than Earth's.\n        *   Density(d) < Density(a).\n\n*   **Comparison:**\n\n    *   Density(a) ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density(b) ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   Density(c) > 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   Density(d) < 5.51 g/cm³\n\n    By comparing the options, it is clear that the 5-Earth-mass planet (c) has the highest density.\n\n*   **Final Answer Selection:**\n\n    The question asks for the planet with the highest density. Our analysis shows this is the planet described in statement c). This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
