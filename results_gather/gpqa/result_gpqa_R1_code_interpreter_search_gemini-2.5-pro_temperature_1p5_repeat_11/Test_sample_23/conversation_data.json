    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z.**\n    The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CxHy.\n    The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by: (mass of H) / (total mass) = (y * AtomicMass_H) / (x * AtomicMass_C + y * AtomicMass_H).\n    Using approximate atomic masses (H=1, C=12), the equation is: y / (12x + y) = 0.1428.\n    This simplifies to y ≈ 2x.\n    The empirical formula is CH2. The general formula for a hydrocarbon with this ratio is CnH2n. This corresponds to either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    The problem states that Z is formed by hydrogenation and does not react further with hydrogen. This means Z must be a saturated compound, which rules out alkenes. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane (CnH2n).\n    Z is also described as a widely used solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent fitting this description is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    Let's verify the mass fraction for cyclohexane (C6H12):\n    Mass of H = 12 * 1.008 = 12.096\n    Mass of C = 6 * 12.011 = 72.066\n    Total Mass = 12.096 + 72.066 = 84.162\n    Mass fraction of H = 12.096 / 84.162 ≈ 0.1437, which is very close to 14.28%. Using simpler masses (12 and 1), the fraction is exactly 12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857.\n    So, Z is confirmed to be **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Carbon Skeleton of all Components.**\n    The problem states that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* hydrocarbon Z (cyclohexane). This implies that all components in both mixtures X and Y are compounds with a six-carbon skeleton, which can be converted to a cyclohexane ring upon hydrogenation.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture Y.**\n    Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of its constituents is Z, which is cyclohexane (C6H12). Let's call the components Y1 and Y2. So, Y1 = cyclohexane (C6H12).\n    Mixture Y \"does not decolorize bromine water\". This typically means the components are saturated (no C=C or C≡C bonds) or aromatic.\n    Hydrogenation of Y gives only cyclohexane. We know Y1 (cyclohexane) is already saturated. For Y2, hydrogenation must also yield cyclohexane.\n    If Y2 were saturated (like Y1), the reaction producing Y would not be a disproportionation (which involves oxidation and reduction). A mixture of two saturated C6H12 isomers is not formed by disproportionation.\n    This suggests that the phrase \"does not decolorize bromine water\" should also include aromatic compounds, as they are unreactive with bromine water without a Lewis acid catalyst.\n    Let's hypothesize that Y2 is an aromatic compound with a C6 skeleton, which is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n    So, **Y = an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\n    Let's check if this hypothesis for Y fits all conditions:\n    *   It's an equimolar mixture of two liquids. (Yes)\n    *   It does not decolorize bromine water. (Yes, neither cyclohexane nor benzene do under normal conditions).\n    *   Hydrogenation gives only Z (cyclohexane). (Yes: C6H12 stays C6H12; C6H6 + 3H2 -> C6H12).\n    *   Z (cyclohexane) is a constituent. (Yes).\n    This hypothesis works perfectly.\n\n4.  **Analyze Mixture X and the Disproportionation Reaction.**\n    Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X1 and X2.\n    It undergoes a disproportionation reaction when heated with platinum to form Y. Disproportionation in this context is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component is oxidized (loses hydrogen), and another is reduced (gains hydrogen).\n    The reaction is: X1 + X2 → Y1 + Y2.\n    Since X and Y are both equimolar mixtures, the stoichiometry is likely 1:1:1:1.\n    X1 + X2 → C6H6 + C6H12\n    By the principle of conservation of atoms, the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms on both sides of the equation must be equal. The carbon atoms are already balanced (6+6 on the left, 6+6 on the right). Let's balance the hydrogen atoms.\n    (H atoms in X1) + (H atoms in X2) = (H atoms in benzene) + (H atoms in cyclohexane)\n    (H atoms in X1) + (H atoms in X2) = 6 + 12 = 18.\n\n5.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X.**\n    We need to find two compounds, X1 and X2, that fit the following criteria:\n    *   They are liquids with a C6 skeleton.\n    *   They decolorize bromine water (i.e., they are unsaturated).\n    *   They do not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   Their molecules' hydrogen atoms sum to 18.\n    *   Hydrogenation of both yields cyclohexane (so they must have a C6 ring structure).\n\n    Let's consider possible unsaturated C6 ring compounds:\n    *   Cyclohexene: C6H10. It has one double bond and is not conjugated. Hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.\n    *   Cyclohexadienes: C6H8. There are two isomers:\n        *   1,3-cyclohexadiene: Has conjugated double bonds, so it's ruled out.\n        *   1,4-cyclohexadiene: Has isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds. Hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.\n\n    Now let's see which pair sums to 18 hydrogen atoms:\n    *   If X1 = cyclohexene (C6H10) and X2 = cyclohexene (C6H10), the sum is 10 + 10 = 20. (Incorrect)\n    *   If X1 = 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) and X2 = 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), the sum is 8 + 8 = 16. (Incorrect)\n    *   If X1 = cyclohexene (C6H10) and X2 = 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), the sum is 10 + 8 = 18. (**Correct**)\n\n    So, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**. The reaction is:\n    C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C6H10 (cyclohexene) --(Pt/heat)--> C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane)\n    In this reaction, 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized to benzene, and cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane. This is a classic example of catalytic hydrogen transfer.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer.**\n    The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of the first liquid and one molecule of the second liquid.\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in cyclohexene) + (H atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene)\n    Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
