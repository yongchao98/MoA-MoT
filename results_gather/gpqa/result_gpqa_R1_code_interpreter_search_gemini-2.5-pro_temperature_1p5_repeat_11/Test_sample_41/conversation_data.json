    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance.**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from its host star and the energy it radiates away. The formula for the equilibrium temperature of a planet in a circular orbit is:\n    T_eq = [L_star * (1 - A) / (16 * π * σ * d²)]^(1/4)\n    where:\n    *   L_star is the luminosity of the star.\n    *   A is the planet's albedo.\n    *   σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n    *   d is the orbital distance from the star.\n\n    Since all three planets orbit the same star, L_star is constant. We are also given that the albedo (A) is the same for all three planets. The term [L_star * (1 - A) / (16 * π * σ)] is therefore constant for all three planets. The relationship simplifies to:\n    T_eq ∝ (1/d²)^(1/4)\n    T_eq ∝ 1 / d^(1/2)\n\n    This means that the orbital distance (d) is inversely proportional to the square of the equilibrium temperature:\n    d ∝ 1 / T_eq²\n\n2.  **Analyze the relationship between Orbital Period and Orbital Distance.**\n    Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion relates a planet's orbital period (P) to its orbital distance (d). For planets orbiting the same star, the law states:\n    P² ∝ d³\n\n    Note that the masses of the planets are negligible compared to the star's mass and do not significantly affect the orbital period. Therefore, the given mass ratios are irrelevant to this problem.\n\n3.  **Combine the relationships to find the link between Orbital Period and Equilibrium Temperature.**\n    We can combine the two relationships derived above to find a direct relationship between the orbital period (P) and the equilibrium temperature (T_eq).\n\n    From step 1: d ∝ 1 / T_eq²\n    From step 2: P² ∝ d³\n\n    Substitute the expression for `d` into the second proportion:\n    P² ∝ (1 / T_eq²)³\n    P² ∝ 1 / T_eq⁶\n    Taking the square root of both sides gives:\n    P ∝ 1 / T_eq³\n\n    This means the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature. The ratio of the orbital periods of two planets (i and j) can be expressed as:\n    P_i / P_j = (T_eq_j / T_eq_i)³\n\n4.  **Calculate the required ratio.**\n    We need to find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, which is the ratio P3 / P1.\n    Using the formula from step 3:\n    P3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³\n\n    We are given the temperature ratios:\n    *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4\n    *   T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3\n\n    First, we calculate the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq3:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq3 = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22\n\n    Now, we can calculate the period ratio P3 / P1:\n    P3 / P1 = (3.22)³\n\n    Let's compute the final value.\n```python\n# Given ratios\nT1_div_T2 = 1.4\nT2_div_T3 = 2.3\n\n# We know that P is proportional to 1 / (T_eq)^3.\n# Therefore, P3 / P1 = (T1 / T3)^3.\n\n# First, find the ratio T1 / T3\nT1_div_T3 = T1_div_T2 * T2_div_T3\n\n# Now, calculate the ratio P3 / P1\nP3_div_P1 = T1_div_T3**3\n\nprint(P3_div_P1)\n```\n<execute_result>\n33.386248000000005\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation shows that the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.39.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 4.4\nB) ~ 3.2\nC) ~ 33.4\nD) ~ 10.4\n\nThe calculated value of 33.39 is closest to 33.4.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature T_eq of a planet is related to its distance d from the star by the formula:\nT_eq ∝ 1 / d^(1/2)\nThis implies that the distance d is related to the temperature T_eq as:\nd ∝ 1 / T_eq²\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the orbital period P of a planet is related to its orbital distance d by:\nP² ∝ d³\n\nNow, we can combine these two relationships to find the relationship between the orbital period P and the equilibrium temperature T_eq.\nP² ∝ (1/T_eq²)³\nP² ∝ 1/T_eq⁶\nP ∝ 1/T_eq³\n\nThis means the ratio of the orbital periods of two planets is inversely proportional to the cube of the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. For Planet 3 and Planet 1:\nP3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)³\n\nWe are given the following ratios of equilibrium temperatures:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4\nT_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3\n\nTo find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq3, we multiply the two given ratios:\nT_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22\n\nNow we can calculate the ratio of the orbital periods:\nP3 / P1 = (3.22)³\nP3 / P1 ≈ 33.386\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4. Comparing this result with the given options, the closest one is C. The information about the planet masses and the specific albedo value is not needed for the calculation as these factors cancel out when dealing with ratios.\n\n<<<C>>>"
