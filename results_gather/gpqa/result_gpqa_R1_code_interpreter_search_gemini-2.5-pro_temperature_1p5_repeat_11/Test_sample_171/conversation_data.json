    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principle:** The problem deals with the relative population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars. The assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) indicates that the distribution of atoms across different energy states is governed by the **Boltzmann equation**.\n\n2.  **Write down the Boltzmann equation:** The Boltzmann equation describes the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two different energy states, an upper state `j` and a lower state `i`.\n    (N_j / N_i) = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n    where:\n    *   `N_j` and `N_i` are the number densities of atoms in states `j` and `i`.\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the states.\n    *   `E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the states, which we can call ΔE.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Define the \"excitation\":** The problem states that the \"excitation\" in star_1 is twice that in star_2. \"Excitation\" refers to the population of a higher energy level relative to a lower one. Let's define the excitation ratio, R, as the ratio of atoms in an excited state (let's call it level 2) to the number of atoms in a lower state (level 1, often the ground state).\n    R = N_2 / N_1 = (g_2 / g_1) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T)]\n\n4.  **Apply the equation to the two stars:** We have two stars, star_1 with temperature T_1 and star_2 with temperature T_2. The atomic transition is the same in both stars, so ΔE, g_1, and g_2 are constants.\n    *   For star_1:  R_1 = (g_2 / g_1) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n    *   For star_2:  R_2 = (g_2 / g_1) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n5.  **Use the given relationship:** The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2.\n    R_1 = 2 * R_2\n\n6.  **Set up the equation and simplify:** Substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the relationship R_1 = 2 * R_2.\n    (g_2 / g_1) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * [(g_2 / g_1) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]]\n    The term (g_2 / g_1) appears on both sides and can be canceled out.\n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n7.  **Solve for the temperatures:** To isolate the temperatures, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation.\n    ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n    Using the logarithm properties ln(e^x) = x and ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b), we get:\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n8.  **Isolate ln(2):** Rearrange the equation to solve for ln(2).\n    ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n    Factor out the common term (ΔE / k).\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\n9.  **Combine the temperature fractions:** Find a common denominator for the term in the parentheses.\n    1/T_2 - 1/T_1 = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n    Substitute this back into the main equation:\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n10. **Use the given numerical values:** The problem provides:\n    *   Energy difference, ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J\n    *   The standard value for the Boltzmann constant, k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K\n    Calculate the ratio (ΔE / k):\n    (ΔE / k) ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) = 1 K\n    Since this ratio is exactly 1, the (ΔE / k) term in our equation is equal to 1.\n\n11. **Final Equation:** Substituting (ΔE / k) = 1 into our derived equation, we get the final relationship:\n    ln(2) = 1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n    This matches option C. The fact that the excitation is higher in star_1 (R_1 > R_2) implies that star_1 is hotter (T_1 > T_2), so the term (T_1 - T_2) is positive, which is consistent.\n\n<<<C>>>"
