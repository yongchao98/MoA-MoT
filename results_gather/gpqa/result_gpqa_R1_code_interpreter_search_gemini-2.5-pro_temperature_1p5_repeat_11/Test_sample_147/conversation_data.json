    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Element Y and Compound A2**\n\nThe problem states that compound A2 has a mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. The general formula for a binary fluoride is YFₓ.\n\nThe mass percentage of fluorine can be expressed as:\nɷF = (x * Ar(F)) / (Ar(Y) + x * Ar(F))\n\nLet Ar(F) be approximately 19.00 g/mol and Ar(Y) be the atomic weight of element Y.\n0.3196 = (x * 19.00) / (Ar(Y) + x * 19.00)\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for Ar(Y):\n0.3196 * Ar(Y) + 0.3196 * 19.00 * x = 19.00 * x\n0.3196 * Ar(Y) = 19.00 * x - 6.0724 * x\n0.3196 * Ar(Y) = 12.9276 * x\nAr(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x\n\nWe can test integer values for x (the number of fluorine atoms) to find a plausible atomic weight for element Y.\n*   If x = 1, Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 (close to Ca, Ar, K - unlikely candidates)\n*   If x = 2, Ar(Y) ≈ 80.9 (close to Br, Se - Bromine only forms 3 stable fluorides)\n*   If x = 3, Ar(Y) ≈ 121.35 (close to Sb, but it only forms 2 fluorides)\n*   If x = 4, Ar(Y) ≈ 161.8 (close to Dy, Tb)\n*   If x = 5, Ar(Y) ≈ 202.25 (close to Hg, Tl)\n*   If x = 6, Ar(Y) ≈ 242.7 (close to Am)\n*   If x = 7, Ar(Y) ≈ 283.15\n\nLet's use a more precise atomic mass for Fluorine (18.998 g/mol) and check against a table of elements for a better match. The element must also satisfy other conditions: forming five binary fluorides and having strongly oxidizing higher fluorides.\n\nA known element that fits these criteria remarkably well is Rhenium (Re).\nLet's test this hypothesis.\nIf Y = Rhenium (Re), its atomic weight Ar(Re) is 186.21 g/mol.\nLet's see which fluoride of Rhenium gives a fluorine mass percentage close to 31.96%.\n186.21 ≈ 40.45 * x  => x ≈ 186.21 / 40.45 ≈ 4.6. This is very close to x=5.\n\nLet's assume A2 is ReF₅.\n*   Formula: ReF₅\n*   Molar Mass: 186.21 + 5 * 18.998 = 186.21 + 94.99 = 281.2 g/mol\n*   Mass % of F: (94.99 / 281.2) * 100% = 33.78%\nThis value (33.78%) is not close enough to 31.96%.\n\nLet's re-examine the list. Let's assume A2 is ReF₆.\n*   Formula: ReF₆\n*   Molar Mass: 186.21 + 6 * 18.998 = 186.21 + 113.988 = 300.198 g/mol\n*   Mass % of F: (113.988 / 300.198) * 100% = 37.97%\nThis is also not a match.\n\nLet's try ReF₄.\n*   Formula: ReF₄\n*   Molar Mass: 186.21 + 4 * 18.998 = 186.21 + 75.992 = 262.202 g/mol\n*   Mass % of F: (75.992 / 262.202) * 100% = 28.98%\nThis is also not a match.\n\nThere might be an error in the problem's percentage, or we are on the wrong track. Let's reconsider another candidate from our list.\nIf x = 6, Ar(Y) ≈ 242.7. This is very close to Americium (Am, 243).\nLet's test if A2 = AmF₆.\n*   Mass % of F in AmF₆ = (6 * 19) / (243 + 6*19) = 114 / 357 = 31.93%.\nThis is an excellent match for the given 31.96%.\n\nLet's check if Americium fits the other clues:\n1.  **Five binary compounds with fluorine**: Americium is known to form AmF₂, AmF₃, AmF₄, and possibly AmF₅ and AmF₆, though the higher oxidation states are less stable. The existence of five compounds is plausible.\n2.  **A1 is bright-red, decomposes, and oxidizes Xenon**: The decomposition is A1 -> A2 + F₂. Since A2 = AmF₆, A1 must be a higher fluoride. Such a compound (e.g., AmF₇ or AmF₈) is unknown and highly unlikely. More probably, there's a typo in the question and A1 is the higher fluoride which decomposes to A2. Let's assume the decomposition is: A1 (e.g. AmF₄) -> A2 (e.g. AmF₃) + ½ F₂. But this contradicts A2 being AmF₆.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem's text. Perhaps the compound A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine, but A2 is not the direct product, but one of the resulting species. The decomposition of a bright-red higher fluoride of a transition metal (like ReF₇) could be complex.\n\nLet's assume Y=Rhenium despite the mass percentage discrepancy, as its chemical properties are a strong fit. Rhenium forms ReF₄, ReF₅, ReF₆, and ReF₇. The existence of five fluorides is often cited.\n*   **A1**: The highest oxide, ReF₇, is yellow. This doesn't match \"bright-red\".\n*   **A3**: This is another fluoride that interacts with Xenon. ReF₆ reacts with Xe to form [XeF][ReF₆]. This fits.\n\nLet's try **Krypton (Kr)** as element Y.\n*   Ar(Kr) = 83.8 g/mol. From our formula, Ar(Y) ≈ 80.9 for x=2.\n*   If A2 = KrF₂, Mass % F = (2 * 19) / (83.8 + 38) = 38 / 121.8 = 31.2%. This is reasonably close to 31.96%.\n*   **Five binary compounds**: This is false for Krypton. Only KrF₂ and KrF₄ (unstable) are known.\n*   **A1 oxidizes Xenon**: Krypton compounds like KrF₂ are exceptionally strong oxidizers and will oxidize xenon.\n*   **A1 bright-red**: KrF₂ is a white solid.\nThis hypothesis fails on multiple points.\n\nLet's assume the given percentage is correct and re-evaluate our calculation which led to Americium.\n*   Y = Am\n*   A2 = AmF₆\n*   A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes into AmF₆ and F₂. This implies A1 is a higher fluoride like AmF₈, which is highly speculative. However, Am(VI) is a very strong oxidant.\n\nLet's consider the last piece of information.\n*   Y + A4 -> A5 (in a 1:1 molar ratio)\n*   A4 is a colorless concentrated solution.\n*   A5 decomposes in water into two substances.\n\nIf Y=Am, the reaction is: Am + A4 -> A5.\nA4 is a fluoride of Americium. Let's assume A4 is AmF₄ in a solvent. Adding Am metal would reduce it: Am + 3AmF₄ -> 4AmF₃. The ratio is not 1:1.\nThe statement \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\" suggests A4 is dissolved in something. An aqueous solution is unlikely for reactive fluorides. A common solvent for fluorination chemistry is anhydrous HF (aHF).\n\nConsider A4 to be an acid. A common acid formed from these types of fluorides is a fluoroacid, like H₂[YFₙ₊₂].\nIf A4 = H₂[AmF₈], this acid is known (formed from AmF₆).\nAm + H₂[AmF₈] -> ??? This reaction is not straightforward.\n\nLet's reconsider the \"five compounds\" clue. This points strongly to Rhenium (Re) or a similar transition metal. Let's assume the mass % was a typo and should have been closer to that of ReF₄ (28.98%) or ReF₅ (33.78%). Or that the decomposition product is complex.\n\nLet's work backward from the final reaction, assuming Y=Re.\nRe + A4 -> A5 (1:1 ratio)\nA4 is likely an oxyfluoride acid of Rhenium dissolved in water (\"concentrated solution\", which can be aqueous). A5 decomposes in water. This is consistent with many Re compounds.\nA common, stable, colorless Rhenium species in water is the perrhenate ion, [ReO₄]⁻, forming perrhenic acid HReO₄.\nLet's assume **A4 is perrhenic acid, HReO₄**. It is commercially available as a colorless aqueous solution.\n\nThe reaction is:\nRe + HReO₄ -> A5\nThis is a comproportionation reaction.\nRe(0) + Re(VII) -> A5\nThe oxidation state of Re in A5 would be intermediate. For a 1:1 reaction, the product would have an average oxidation state that might not be an integer or could be a mixture. However, in many comproportionation reactions, a stable intermediate state is formed, and the stoichiometry is balanced accordingly.\nA known stable oxide of Rhenium is ReO₂ (Rhenium(IV) dioxide). Let's see if the reaction can form this:\nRe + 2HReO₄ → 3ReO₂ + H₂O\nThis does not have a 1:1 molar ratio of Re to HReO₄.\n\nAnother possibility involves the solvent. \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" could imply a non-aqueous solvent, but if we consider it as aqueous HReO₄, it is a good candidate for A4.\n\nLet's assume A4 is HReO₄.\nMolecular Weight of HReO₄ = 1.008 (H) + 186.21 (Re) + 4 * 16.00 (O)\nMW = 1.008 + 186.21 + 64.00 = 251.218 g/mol.\nThis falls into the range 220-240 if we consider some rounding.\n\nLet's check if this is consistent.\n*   **Y = Re**. Forms many fluorides (ReF₄, ReF₅, ReF₆, ReF₇), fitting \"five compounds\".\n*   **A3 interacts with Xe**: ReF₆ reacts with Xe. A3=ReF₆.\n*   **A1 is bright-red, decomposes, strong oxidant**: This points to something like ReF₇ (yellow, not red) or an oxyfluoride. The properties of all five compounds are not fully specified, but Rhenium has highly oxidizing fluorides. Let's assume this clue points to a less common Re compound.\n*   **A2 has ɷF=31,96%**: This is the main conflicting point. No simple fluoride of Rhenium matches this. However, given the strong fit of all other clues for Y=Re and A4=HReO₄, it is plausible there is an error in this number in the problem statement.\n*   **A4 is HReO₄**: A stable compound, forms colorless aqueous solutions.\n*   **A5 formation**: Reaction between Re and HReO₄.\n*   **A5 decomposition in water**: If A5 is ReO₂, it is stable in water. However, the reaction could yield another species like Re₂O₅, which would hydrolyze. The reaction `Re + 2HReO4 → 3ReO2 + H2O` shows it's plausible.\n\nGiven the options, the molecular weight of HReO₄ (251.2 g/mol) is outside all ranges. Let me re-calculate.\nMW = 1.008 + 186.21 + 64.00 = 251.218. Let's re-read the options.\nA) 140-160\nB) 110-130\nC) 160-180\nD) 220-240\nMy result 251.2 is closest to D, but still outside.\n\nLet's reconsider A4. \"a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". A4 itself is the solute. A4 could be a solid that is dissolved. If A4 is a binary fluoride, which one is soluble and colorless? None are particularly soluble in water without reaction.\n\nWhat if Y is not Rhenium? What if the Americium hypothesis (Y=Am, A2=AmF₆) is correct, and the reaction `Am + A4 -> A5` is the key?\nLet's assume A4 is an Americium compound. Perhaps a fluoroacid like H[AmF₅] or H₂[AmF₆]?\nMW(H[AmF₅]) = 1 + 243 + 5*19 = 339 g/mol.\nMW(H₂[AmF₆]) = 2 + 243 + 6*19 = 359 g/mol.\nThese are too high.\n\nLet's go back to the HReO₄ hypothesis. Is there a mistake in my calculation or assumptions?\nMW(HReO₄) = 251.2 g/mol.\nRange D is 220-240. The value is off by ~11.\nWhat if A4 is not an acid, but an oxide? The most common oxide is Re₂O₇.\nMW(Re₂O₇) = 2*186.21 + 7*16 = 372.42 + 112 = 484.42 g/mol. Too high. Re₂O₇ is a colorless solid. Its solution in water is HReO₄. So \"solution of A4\" could mean aqueous solution of Re₂O₇, which is HReO₄.\n\nThere must be a simpler explanation. Let's look at the candidates again.\nAr(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x.\nIf x=3, Ar(Y)=121.3. Close to Antimony (Sb, 121.76).\nLet's check Sb. Fluorides: SbF₃, SbF₅. Only two. Fails.\nIf x=4, Ar(Y)=161.8. Close to Dysprosium (Dy, 162.5). Unlikely lanthanide chemistry.\nIf Y=Iodine, Ar(I)=126.9. %F in IF₃ is 31.0%. It's close.\nIf Y=I, what is A4? An iodine compound forming a colorless solution. Periodic acid (HIO₄ or H₅IO₆).\nMW(HIO₄) = 1+127+64 = 192 g/mol. Not in ranges.\nMW(H₅IO₆) = 5+127+96 = 228 g/mol. This falls in range D (220-240).\nLet's check this. A4 = H₅IO₆.\nReaction: I + H₅IO₆ -> A5 (1:1). `I + H5IO6 -> ?` This reaction is not standard.\nAlso, IF₅ and IF₇ are colorless, not \"bright-red\". So Iodine is unlikely.\n\nThe Rhenium/HReO₄ hypothesis seems the most chemically sound, despite the conflict with the mass percentage and the final molecular weight being slightly out of range. Perhaps A4 is not HReO₄, but a different compound related to Rhenium.\nWhat if A4 is Rhenium heptafluoride, ReF₇? It's a low-melting solid (48°C), could be used in a \"hot... solution\".\nMW(ReF₇) = 186.21 + 7*19 = 319.2 g/mol. Too high.\n\nGiven the high consistency of the Rhenium hypothesis for most clues and the fact that H₅IO₆ has a MW in the correct range but fails on other clues, there might be an error in the problem data. However, if we must choose, the H₅IO₆ path gives a MW that perfectly fits an answer choice. Let's re-evaluate iodine.\nY = I. Five fluorides? Let's assume yes for the sake of the problem. A1 is bright-red? Maybe an impure sample or an unknown compound. Let's ignore this clue. A1 oxidizes Xe? IF₇ can react with Xe sources, but doesn't directly oxidize Xe metal easily.\nThis path seems weak.\n\nLet's trust the H₅IO₆ molecular weight. It's 228 g/mol. This falls squarely in the 220-240 range. Despite the chemical inconsistencies with Iodine, this numerical match is very strong. Often in such problems, one path leads to a perfect numerical fit.\n\n<<<D>>>"
