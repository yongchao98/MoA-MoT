    "This problem requires us to determine the energies of the ground state and the first two excited states for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well.\n\n### 1. Understanding the System\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Particles with half-integer spin (like spin-1/2) are **fermions**.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions are subject to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state is defined by its full set of quantum numbers.\n*   **Quantum States in a 1D Infinite Well:** For a particle in a 1D infinite potential well of length L, the quantum states are defined by two quantum numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number, `n` (`n = 1, 2, 3, ...`), which determines the energy level.\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number, `m_s`, which can be `+1/2` (spin up, ↑) or `-1/2` (spin down, ↓).\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy of a single particle in the state `n` is given by:\n    `E_n = n^2 * (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2mL^2)`\n    The problem conveniently defines the base energy unit as `E = (pi^2 * hbar^2) / (2mL^2)`.\n    So, the energy of a particle in level `n` is `E_n = n^2 * E`.\n*   **State Occupancy:** Due to the two possible spin states (up and down), each energy level `n` can accommodate a maximum of two fermions.\n\n### 2. Calculating the State Energies\n\nWe need to place the four fermions into the available energy levels to find the configurations corresponding to the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the individual particles.\n\n#### Ground State Energy\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest energy levels first, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   **Level n=1:** We can place two fermions here (one spin up, one spin down).\n    *   Energy = `2 * E_1 = 2 * (1^2 * E) = 2E`.\n*   **Level n=2:** We place the remaining two fermions here (one spin up, one spin down).\n    *   Energy = `2 * E_2 = 2 * (2^2 * E) = 2 * 4E = 8E`.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of these energies:\n`E_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E`.\n\n#### First Excited State Energy\n\nTo find the first excited state, we must create the lowest possible energy excitation from the ground state. This is typically achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is `n=2` and the lowest unoccupied level is `n=3`.\n*   We promote one fermion from `n=2` to `n=3`. The new configuration is:\n    *   **Level n=1:** 2 fermions. Energy = `2 * E_1 = 2E`.\n    *   **Level n=2:** 1 fermion. Energy = `1 * E_2 = 1 * (2^2 * E) = 4E`.\n    *   **Level n=3:** 1 fermion. Energy = `1 * E_3 = 1 * (3^2 * E) = 9E`.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n`E_first_excited = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E`.\n\n#### Second Excited State Energy\n\nTo find the second excited state, we need to find the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. Let's consider the possible excitations from the ground state:\n*   **Configuration A (First Excited State):** Promote one fermion from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: {2 fermions in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3}\n    *   Energy = `(2 * 1^2 + 1 * 2^2 + 1 * 3^2)E = (2 + 4 + 9)E = 15E`.\n*   **Configuration B:** Promote one fermion from `n=1` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: {1 fermion in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3}\n    *   Energy = `(1 * 1^2 + 2 * 2^2 + 1 * 3^2)E = (1 + 8 + 9)E = 18E`.\n*   **Configuration C:** Promote both fermions from `n=2` to `n=3`.\n    *   Configuration: {2 fermions in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3}\n    *   Energy = `(2 * 1^2 + 2 * 3^2)E = (2 + 18)E = 20E`.\n*   **Configuration D:** Promote one fermion from `n=2` to `n=4`.\n    *   Configuration: {2 fermions in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4}\n    *   Energy = `(2 * 1^2 + 1 * 2^2 + 1 * 4^2)E = (2 + 4 + 16)E = 22E`.\n\nComparing the energies of these excited configurations:\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First lowest excitation: 15E\n*   Second lowest excitation: 18E\n\nSo, the second excited state has an energy of `18E`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
