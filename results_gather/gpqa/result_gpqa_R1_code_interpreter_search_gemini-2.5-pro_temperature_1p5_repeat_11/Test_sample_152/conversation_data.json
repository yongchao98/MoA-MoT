    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each reaction to determine the reactants and products.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)\n\n1.  **Identify Nucleophile and Michael Acceptor:**\n    *   **Nucleophile Precursor:** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂. The protons on the central carbon (Cα) are acidic due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the two adjacent ester groups.\n    *   **Base:** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) is a strong base that deprotonates the dimethyl malonate to form a resonance-stabilized enolate anion, ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂. This is the active nucleophile.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. Its structure is p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃. The β-carbon is electrophilic and is the site of nucleophilic attack.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism (Michael Addition):**\n    *   The malonate enolate, ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂, attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the central carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   The π-electrons of the C=C bond shift to form an enolate intermediate: p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) -CH=C(O⁻)OCH₃.\n    *   This enolate is then protonated by the solvent (EtOH) at the α-carbon to yield the final, stable product.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product (A):**\n    *   The final product structure is p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) -CH₂-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's name this compound according to the options provided. The name \"trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\" corresponds to the following structure:\n        *   A propane chain: C3-C2-C1.\n        *   Two methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃) groups on C1.\n        *   One p-tolyl group on C2.\n        *   One methoxycarbonyl group on C3.\n        *   Putting it together: (CH₃OOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂COOCH₃.\n    *   This structure matches our derived product.\n    *   Therefore, **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)\n\n1.  **Identify Nucleophile and Michael Acceptor:**\n    *   **Nucleophile:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine. Enamines act as carbon nucleophiles at the β-carbon (the C2 of the cyclohexene ring).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN. The β-carbon is electrophilic.\n    *   **Reaction Conditions:** The reaction is a Stork enamine alkylation (a type of Michael addition), followed by acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The β-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium ion intermediate and a nitrile-stabilized carbanion.\n    *   The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) serves two purposes:\n        1.  It protonates the carbanion to give the -CH(CH₃)-CH₂CN side chain.\n        2.  It hydrolyzes the iminium ion (C=N⁺R₂) back to a ketone (C=O).\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure of Product (B):**\n    *   The reaction attaches the butenenitrile fragment to the α-carbon of the original ketone (cyclohexanone).\n    *   The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the C2 position with a -CH(CH₃)CH₂CN group.\n    *   Let's name this product. The parent chain is butanenitrile (numbering starts from the CN group: C1 is CN, C4 is CH₃). The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on C3. The ketone is at position 2 of the cyclohexyl ring. Thus, the substituent is (2-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   The full IUPAC name is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. The keto form is the stable product after hydrolysis, not the enol form (`-hydroxycyclohexenyl`).\n    *   Therefore, **B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction (Retrosynthesis):**\n    *   This is a Michael addition where we are given the product and one reactant (the Michael acceptor) and must find the other reactant (the nucleophile precursor, C).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃.\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   Let's dissect the product. It consists of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring and a (3-oxobutyl) group (-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃) attached at position 2.\n\n2.  **Identify the Nucleophile:**\n    *   In a Michael addition to MVK, the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon (the CH₂ group), and the C=C double bond becomes a C-C single bond. This process converts MVK into the -CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃ (3-oxobutyl) fragment found in the product.\n    *   This means the other part of the product, the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring, must have come from the nucleophile.\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the most acidic proton on reactant C to form the nucleophile. In cyclohexane-1,3-dione, the protons at C2 (the methylene group between the two carbonyls) are the most acidic.\n    *   Therefore, the enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione attacks MVK.\n    *   Reactant **C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis set of reactants and products matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
