    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars, let's call it `N`, varies with parallax, `plx`, according to the relation:\n    `N ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n    In stellar astronomy, when we talk about the \"number of stars with a certain parallax\", we are typically referring to the cumulative number of stars with a parallax *greater than or equal to* a certain value `plx`. This is because a larger parallax means the star is closer. So, `N(>plx)` represents the total number of stars from our position out to a certain distance limit.\n\n2.  **Relate Parallax to Distance:**\n    The parallax (`plx`) of a star is inversely proportional to its distance (`r`). The fundamental relationship is:\n    `plx = 1/r`\n    where `r` is the distance in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds.\n\n3.  **Express the Number of Stars as a Function of Distance:**\n    We need to find how the number of stars changes with distance, so we must first express `N` in terms of `r`. We can do this by substituting the parallax-distance relation into the given formula.\n\n    A parallax value greater than `plx` (`>plx`) corresponds to a distance less than `r` (`<r`). Therefore, the number of stars within a distance `r` is given by `N(<r)`.\n\n    Substitute `plx = 1/r` into the given relation:\n    `N(<r) ∝ 1/(1/r)^5`\n    `N(<r) ∝ 1/(1/r^5)`\n    `N(<r) ∝ r^5`\n\n    This means the cumulative number of stars out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r^5`. We can write this as `N(r) = k * r^5`, where `k` is a constant of proportionality.\n\n4.  **Determine the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:**\n    The question asks how the number of stars changes \"per unit range of distance, r\". This quantity is the rate of change of the cumulative number of stars with respect to distance, which is the derivative `dN/dr`. This represents the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance `r`.\n\n    We differentiate the expression for `N(r)` with respect to `r`:\n    `N(r) = k * r^5`\n    `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r^5)`\n\n    Using the power rule for differentiation (`d/dx(ax^n) = n*a*x^(n-1)`):\n    `dN/dr = 5 * k * r^(5-1)`\n    `dN/dr = 5k * r^4`\n\n5.  **State the Final Proportionality:**\n    Since `5k` is just another constant, we can see that the number of stars per unit range of distance is directly proportional to `r^4`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ r^4`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    This result matches option B.\n\n    A) ~ r^5 (This is the cumulative number of stars, not the number per unit distance)\n    B) ~ r^4 (This is the number of stars per unit distance)\n    C) ~ r^2 (This would be true if the star density in space were uniform)\n    D) ~ r^3\n\n<<<B>>>"
