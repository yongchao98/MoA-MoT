    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Physics\nThe problem involves the decay of a relativistic particle, $X^0$. Key concepts are:\n- **Proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$):** The lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame.\n- **Time Dilation:** In the laboratory frame (the Bubble Chamber), the particle is moving at a high speed, so its lifetime appears longer. This observed lifetime ($\\tau_{lab}$) is related to the proper lifetime by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n- **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** This factor quantifies the relativistic effects and is determined by the particle's energy ($E$) and rest mass ($m_0$). The relationship is $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$. Since mass is given in units of energy (GeV), this simplifies to $E = \\gamma m_0$.\n- **Exponential Decay Law:** The decay of particles is a random process. The fraction of particles that survive after a time $t$ is given by $N(t)/N_0 = e^{-t/\\tau}$, where $\\tau$ is the mean lifetime.\n- **Decay Length:** The distance a particle travels before decaying. The average distance is the mean decay length, $\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity.\n- **Resolution:** In this context, resolution refers to the minimum track length that a detector can distinguish from the production point. If a particle decays after traveling a distance $L$, the decay is considered \"observed\" only if the detector's resolution is better than $L$ (i.e., the resolution length is smaller than $L$).\n\n### 2. Interpret the Question\nThe question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays\".\n- \"To observe a decay\" means we can resolve the track of the particle $X^0$ before it decays. This implies the particle must travel a distance $L$ greater than the experimental resolution, $L_{res}$.\n- We need to be able to observe *at least 30%* of all the decays that occur.\n- This means that the fraction of particles that travel a distance $L > L_{res}$ must be at least 30%.\n- Let's find the maximum possible resolution $L_{res}$ that still satisfies this condition.\n\n### 3. Formulate the Equations\nThe fraction of particles that travel at least a distance $L_{res}$ before decaying is given by the survival probability:\n$P(\\text{travel distance} \\ge L_{res}) = e^{-L_{res} / \\lambda}$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame.\n\nWe require this fraction to be at least 30% (0.3):\n$e^{-L_{res} / \\lambda} \\ge 0.3$\n\nSolving for $L_{res}$:\n- Take the natural logarithm of both sides: $-L_{res} / \\lambda \\ge \\ln(0.3)$\n- Multiply by $-\\lambda$ (which is a positive number). This reverses the inequality sign:\n$L_{res} \\le -\\lambda \\ln(0.3)$\n\nThis inequality tells us that to observe at least 30% of decays, our resolution $L_{res}$ must be less than or equal to $-\\lambda \\ln(0.3)$. The question is asking for the value of this boundary, which represents the maximum permissible resolution. So we need to calculate $L = -\\lambda \\ln(0.3)$.\n\nThe mean decay length $\\lambda$ is given by:\n$\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$\nwhere:\n- $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n- $v = \\beta c$, where $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$\n- $\\gamma = E / m_0$\n\nCombining these, we get:\n$\\lambda = c \\cdot \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2} \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0) = c \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} \\cdot \\tau_0$\n\nTherefore, the distance we need to calculate is:\n$L = -c \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\ln(0.3)$\n\n### 4. Calculate the Value\nWe will use a Python script to perform the calculation with high precision.\n\n**Given values:**\n- Proper lifetime, $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n- Total energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n- Rest mass, $m_0 = 3.41$ GeV\n- Speed of light, $c \\approx 2.998 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\n**Python Code:**\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants from the problem statement\ntau_0 = 8e-16  # Proper lifetime in seconds\nE = 27.0       # Energy in GeV\nm_0 = 3.41     # Rest mass in GeV\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# 1. Calculate the Lorentz factor, gamma\ngamma = E / m_0\n\n# 2. Calculate the required distance L.\n# L is the maximum resolution allowed to observe at least 30% of the decays.\n# This corresponds to the distance at which 30% of the particles are yet to decay.\n# Fraction surviving to distance L is exp(-L / lambda) = 0.3\n# L = -lambda * ln(0.3)\n# where lambda = v * tau_lab = c * beta * gamma * tau_0 = c * sqrt(gamma^2 - 1) * tau_0\nln_0_3 = math.log(0.3)\nL = -c * math.sqrt(gamma**2 - 1) * tau_0 * ln_0_3\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(f\"{L:.3e}\")\n```\n\n### 5. Execution and Result\nThe code calculates the values as follows:\n1.  **Lorentz factor:** $\\gamma = 27 / 3.41 \\approx 7.9179$\n2.  **Mean decay length:** $\\lambda = c \\sqrt{\\gamma^2-1} \\tau_0 \\approx (3\\times10^8) \\sqrt{7.9179^2-1} (8\\times10^{-16}) \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n3.  **Required Resolution:** $L = -\\lambda \\ln(0.3) \\approx -(1.884 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times (-1.204) \\approx 2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nThe calculated value is approximately $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 2.08 * 1e-1 m\nB) 2.08 * 1e-6 m\nC) 2.08 * 1e-9 m\nD) 2.08 * 1e-3 m\n\nThe value is closest to option B. The minor discrepancy might arise from slightly different values for the speed of light or rounding in the problem's intended calculation, but the order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) and the leading digits are a clear match.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle $X^0$.\n\n### 1. Physics Principles and Formulation\n\nFirst, we need to understand what \"observing a decay\" means in this context. It means the detector can resolve the track of the particle $X^0$ from its creation point to its decay point. This requires the particle to travel a distance, $L$, that is greater than the detector's resolution, $L_{res}$.\n\nThe decay of unstable particles follows an exponential probability law. The fraction of particles that survive after traveling a distance $L$ in the lab frame is given by:\n$P(\\text{distance} > L) = e^{-L/\\lambda}$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\nWe are asked to observe \"at least 30% of the decays\". This means the fraction of particles that travel a distance greater than the resolution $L_{res}$ must be at least 0.30.\nSo, we have the condition:\n$P(\\text{distance} > L_{res}) \\ge 0.30$\n$e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\nThe question asks for the \"minimum resolution\". A smaller resolution value means a better, more precise detector. This inequality means that any resolution $L_{res}$ smaller than or equal to a certain value will allow us to see at least 30% of the decays. The question is asking for this maximum possible resolution value, which is the boundary of our condition. We find this by setting the equality:\n$e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.30$\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-L_{res}/\\lambda = \\ln(0.30)$\n$L_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(0.30)$\n\n### 2. Calculating the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)\n\nThe mean decay length $\\lambda$ is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It is related to the particle's velocity $v$ and its lifetime in the lab frame $\\tau_{lab}$:\n$\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$\n\nDue to relativistic effects (time dilation), the lifetime in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime $\\tau_0$:\n$\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\nThe Lorentz factor is determined by the particle's total energy $E$ and rest mass $m_0$ (where $E_{rest} = m_0 c^2$). Since the units are given in GeV, this simplifies to:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}}$\n\nThe particle's velocity is $v = \\beta c$, where $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\nCombining these expressions for $\\lambda$:\n$\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab} = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0) = c \\cdot (\\beta \\gamma) \\cdot \\tau_0$\nUsing the identity $\\beta \\gamma = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$:\n$\\lambda = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n\n### 3. Final Calculation\n\nNow we have all the pieces to calculate $L_{res}$:\n$L_{res} = - (c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}) \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\nLet's use a Python script to compute the value accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants from the problem statement\n# Proper lifetime in seconds\ntau_0 = 8e-16\n# Total energy in GeV\nE = 27.0\n# Rest mass in GeV (shorthand for m_0 * c^2)\nm_0 = 3.41\n# Speed of light in m/s\nc = 299792458\n\n# 1. Calculate the Lorentz factor, gamma\ngamma = E / m_0\n\n# 2. Calculate the mean decay length in the lab frame, lambda\n# lambda = c * tau_0 * sqrt(gamma^2 - 1)\nmean_decay_length = c * tau_0 * math.sqrt(gamma**2 - 1)\n\n# 3. Calculate the required resolution L_res\n# We need to observe at least 30% of decays, which means the fraction of particles\n# traveling a distance greater than L_res must be at least 0.3.\n# The boundary condition is exp(-L_res / lambda) = 0.3\n# Solving for L_res gives: L_res = -lambda * ln(0.3)\nln_0_3 = math.log(0.3)\nL_res = -mean_decay_length * ln_0_3\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation\nprint(f\"{L_res:.3e}\")\n```\n\nThe script calculates the value of the required resolution based on the formulas derived above. The output of the script is $2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ meters.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated resolution is $L_{res} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\nLet's compare this with the given options:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n\nOur calculated value is very close in magnitude to option B. The small numerical difference (about 9%) is likely due to the rounding of constants used when the problem was created. Option B is the only choice with the correct order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$ m).\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem has been solved and the calculation has been performed. Here is the summary of the result.\n\n### 1. Physics and Formula\n\nThe condition \"to observe at least 30% of the decays\" implies that the fraction of particles that travel a distance $L$ greater than the detector's resolution ($L_{res}$) must be at least 0.3. The survival probability is given by an exponential decay law:\n$P(\\text{distance} > L_{res}) = e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.3$\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the laboratory frame.\n\nThe question asks for the required resolution. This corresponds to the boundary condition, where we can resolve the maximum number of particles while still meeting the 30% threshold. Therefore, we solve for $L_{res}$ using the equality:\n$e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} = 0.3$\n$L_{res} = -\\lambda \\ln(0.3)$\n\n### 2. Calculation of Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)\n\nThe mean decay length depends on the particle's speed and its dilated lifetime in the lab frame.\n$\\lambda = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\n\nThe Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ is calculated from the energy and mass:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n### 3. Numerical Result\n\nThe provided code executed the following calculation:\n$L_{res} = - \\left( (2.998 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\cdot \\sqrt{(27/3.41)^2 - 1} \\right) \\cdot \\ln(0.3)$\n\nThe output of the code is `2.268e-06`, which means the calculated resolution is $2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ meters.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nComparing the calculated value to the given options:\n- A) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\n- B) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n- C) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n- D) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n\nThe calculated result, $2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is very close to option B, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. They share the same order of magnitude, and the numerical value is the closest among all options. The minor difference is likely due to the use of slightly different physical constants or rounding in the problem's source. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
