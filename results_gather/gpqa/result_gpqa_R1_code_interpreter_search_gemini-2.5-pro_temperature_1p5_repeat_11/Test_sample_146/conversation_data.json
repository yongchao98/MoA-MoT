    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Process**\n\nThe problem describes a particle annihilation process where a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) collide and are converted into four new particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. This process must obey the fundamental laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n**2. Analyze the Initial State**\n\n*   **Particles:** We start with one proton ($p$) and one antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   **Energy:** The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving.\" In high-energy physics, this is a common approximation for saying the initial kinetic energy is negligible compared to the rest mass energy. We can assume both the proton and the antiproton are essentially at rest in the laboratory frame. Therefore, the total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of their rest mass energies.\n    *   $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$\n    *   The mass of a proton and an antiproton are equal. From known physical constants, the rest mass energy of a proton is approximately $m_p c^2 = 938.27 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   So, $E_i = 2 \\times 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   **Momentum:** Since both initial particles are assumed to be at rest, the total initial momentum ($P_i$) is zero.\n\n**3. Analyze the Final State**\n\n*   **Particles:** The final state consists of four particles: $2A^+$ and $2A^-$. The charge is conserved ($+1 - 1 = +1 - 1 + 1 - 1$).\n*   **Mass:** The rest mass of each particle A (both $A^+$ and $A^-$) is given by $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n*   **Energy:** The total energy in the final state ($E_f$) is the sum of the relativistic energies of the four A particles. Since they are all produced from the annihilation and must conserve momentum, they will be moving. The total energy of a moving particle is the sum of its rest mass energy and its kinetic energy, given by the relativistic formula $E = \\gamma m c^2$.\n    *   $E_f = E_{A_1} + E_{A_2} + E_{A_3} + E_{A_4}$\n*   **Momentum:** By the law of conservation of momentum, the total final momentum ($P_f$) must be zero, equal to the initial momentum.\n    *   $\\vec{P}_f = \\vec{p}_{A_1} + \\vec{p}_{A_2} + \\vec{p}_{A_3} + \\vec{p}_{A_4} = 0$\n\n**4. Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\n*   Total initial energy equals total final energy: $E_i = E_f$.\n*   $1876.54 \\text{ MeV} = E_{A_1} + E_{A_2} + E_{A_3} + E_{A_4}$.\n*   Due to the symmetry of the problem (annihilation from rest into identical-mass particles), it is most likely that the available energy is distributed equally among the four final particles. Therefore, each particle A will have the same total energy, $E_A$.\n*   $E_A = \\frac{E_i}{4} = \\frac{1876.54 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469.135 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**5. Calculate the Velocity of Particle A**\n\n*   We now know the total energy ($E_A$) and the rest mass energy ($m_A c^2$) for a single particle A. We can use the relativistic energy equation to find its velocity.\n*   The total energy of a particle is $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   First, we solve for $\\gamma$:\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469.135 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.5638$.\n*   Now, we solve for the velocity, $v$.\n    *   $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n    *   $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    *   $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    *   $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n*   Plugging in the value of $\\gamma$:\n    *   $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911} \\approx 0.7688$.\n*   Therefore, the velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
