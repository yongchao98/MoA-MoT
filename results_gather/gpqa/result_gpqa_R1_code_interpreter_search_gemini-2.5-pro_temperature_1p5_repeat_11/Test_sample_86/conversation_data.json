    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the given information:**\n    *   **Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This means we have a benzene ring (C6) with two groups attached.\n    *   **Total Carbon Atoms:** 8. The benzene ring itself contains 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:** The spectrum shows the presence of:\n        *   A carbonyl group (C=O).\n        *   An aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X), meaning a halogen atom is directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the molecular structure:**\n    *   We have two substituents on a benzene ring.\n    *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X). A halogen atom has 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   The other substituent must therefore contain both the carbonyl group and the 2 required carbon atoms. The simplest and most common functional group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   So, the molecule is a haloacetophenone. Its general structure is X-C₆H₄-COCH₃.\n\n3.  **Analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for this structure:**\n    *   The molecule has a methyl group (-CH₃) and aromatic protons (-C₆H₄-).\n    *   **Methyl Protons (-CH₃):** The methyl group is attached to a carbonyl group. It has no adjacent protons, so it will appear as a **singlet (s)**. It corresponds to **3 hydrogens (3H)**. The chemical shift for a methyl ketone is typically in the range of 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (-C₆H₄-):** A di-substituted benzene ring has **4 aromatic protons (4H)**. Their splitting pattern depends on the positions of the substituents (ortho, meta, or para).\n        *   **Ortho (1,2-substitution):** Would show a complex multiplet for the 4 aromatic protons.\n        *   **Meta (1,3-substitution):** Would also show a complex pattern, likely with 4 distinct signals.\n        *   **Para (1,4-substitution):** Due to the high symmetry of the molecule, there are only two chemically distinct types of aromatic protons. This results in a very characteristic pattern: **two doublets (d)**, with each doublet integrating to **2 hydrogens (2H)**. The chemical shift for aromatic protons is typically between 6.5 and 8.5 ppm. Protons closer to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group will be further downfield (higher ppm value).\n\n4.  **Evaluate the given options against the expected spectrum:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This option lacks any signals in the typical aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). The signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are too low. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   The integration values (1H, 2H, 2H, 2H) do not match our expected pattern of 4H (aromatic) and 3H (methyl). The signal at 1.3 ppm is a singlet for 2H, not 3H. This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d):** This is a perfect match for a para-substituted aromatic ring. Two doublets, each for 2 protons, totaling 4 aromatic protons. The chemical shifts are in the correct aromatic region.\n        *   **2.3 (3H, s):** This is a singlet for 3 protons at a chemical shift characteristic of an acetyl methyl group.\n        *   This option perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for a **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton (-CHO)**, not a methyl ketone. If the compound were an aldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CHO), it would only have 7 carbon atoms, which contradicts the problem statement. This is incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, option C is the only one that fits the description of the compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
