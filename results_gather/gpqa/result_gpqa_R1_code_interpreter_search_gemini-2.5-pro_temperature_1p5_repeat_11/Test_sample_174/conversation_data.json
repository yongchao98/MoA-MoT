    "An oscillating charge distribution acts as a source of electromagnetic radiation. The nature of this radiation depends on the multipole moments of the charge distribution. The lowest-order radiating multipole is the electric dipole, followed by the magnetic dipole and the electric quadrupole. For a generic oscillating charge distribution, the electric dipole moment is typically the dominant source of radiation, unless symmetries forbid it.\n\nLet's model the oscillating spheroidal charge distribution as the simplest possible radiating system with a well-defined axis: an oscillating electric dipole aligned with the z-axis.\n\n**1. Angular Distribution of Power for an Electric Dipole**\n\nThe time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) by an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis is given by the formula:\n`dP/dΩ = f(θ, φ) = C * sin²(θ)`\nwhere `θ` is the polar angle measured from the z-axis and `C` is a constant that depends on the frequency and the magnitude of the dipole moment.\n\nThe power radiated is independent of the azimuthal angle `φ` due to the symmetry around the z-axis.\n\n*   **Maximum Power (A):** The function `sin²(θ)` has its maximum value of 1 when `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the xy-plane).\n    So, the maximum power per unit solid angle is:\n    `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = C * sin²(90°) = C * 1 = C`\n\n*   **Power at θ = 30°:** We need to find the power radiated at an angle of `θ = 30°`.\n    `f(30°) = C * sin²(30°)`\n    We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n    So, the power at 30° is `f(30°) = C * (1/4) = A/4`.\n\n*   **Fraction of Maximum Power:** The fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at `θ = 30°` is:\n    `Fraction = f(30°) / A = (A/4) / A = 1/4`\n\nThis eliminates options A and B. We are left with C and D.\n\n**2. Wavelength (λ) Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nThe total power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency `ω` (`P_total ∝ ω⁴`). This is a cornerstone result of classical electrodynamics.\n\nThe power per unit solid angle `f = dP/dΩ` will also have this same dependence on frequency:\n`f ∝ ω⁴`\n\nThe angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` and the speed of light `c` by:\n`ω = 2πν = 2π(c/λ)`\n\nSubstituting this into the proportionality for `f`:\n`f ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\nSo, a possible form for the function `f` shows a dependence on wavelength as `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n**3. Combining the Results**\n\n*   The fraction of maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   The radiated power per unit solid angle `f` is proportional to **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThese two results together match option C.\n\n*Alternative consideration (Quadrupole Radiation):*\nIf the spheroid were oscillating in shape (e.g., from prolate to oblate), the primary radiation might be electric quadrupole. In that case, `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)cos²(θ)` and `P ∝ ω⁶ ∝ λ⁻⁶`. The maximum power would be at `θ=45°`, and the fraction at `30°` would be `(sin²(30)cos²(30))/(sin²(45)cos²(45)) = ( (1/4)*(3/4) ) / ( (1/2)*(1/2) ) = (3/16)/(1/4) = 3/4`. This corresponds to option A. However, without a specific statement that the shape is deforming, the standard and most fundamental model is the electric dipole, which is the lowest-order radiating multipole for a general oscillating charge. Therefore, the dipole model is the most appropriate assumption.\n\nFinal answer based on the most likely physical model (electric dipole radiation):\n- Fraction at 30°: **1/4**\n- Wavelength dependence: **λ⁻⁴**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
