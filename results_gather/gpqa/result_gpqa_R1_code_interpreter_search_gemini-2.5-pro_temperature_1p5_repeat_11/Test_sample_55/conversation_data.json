    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transition and Selection Rules**\n    The problem describes a two-step decay process from the initial state |3,0,0⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩ via an intermediate state. The transitions are electric dipole transitions, which are governed by specific selection rules for the quantum numbers n, l, and m:\n    *   **Δl = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by exactly 1.\n    *   **Δm = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can change by 0 or 1.\n    *   **Δn is unrestricted**: The principal quantum number can change by any integer value, but for a decay (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so n must decrease.\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State(s)**\n    Let the intermediate state be |n', l', m'⟩.\n    *   **First transition: |3,0,0⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩**\n        *   Applying the Δl rule: l' - l = l' - 0 = ±1. So, the intermediate state must have **l' = 1**.\n        *   For a decay, n' < n. So, n' must be less than 3. The possible values are n'=2 or n'=1.\n        *   If n'=1, then l' would have to be 0 (since for a given n, l can range from 0 to n-1). This would violate the Δl=±1 rule. Therefore, the intermediate state must have **n' = 2**.\n        *   Applying the Δm rule: m' - m = m' - 0 = 0, ±1. So, the possible values for the intermediate magnetic quantum number are **m' = 0, +1, or -1**.\n        *   Combining these, the possible intermediate states are the three degenerate 2p states: |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.\n\n    *   **Second transition: |n', l', m'⟩ → |1,0,0⟩**\n        *   Let's check if a transition from our identified intermediate states |2,1,m'⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩ is allowed.\n        *   Applying the Δl rule: l_final - l' = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies Δl=±1.\n        *   Applying the Δm rule: m_final - m' = 0 - m'. Since m' can be 0, +1, or -1, Δm can be 0, -1, or +1, respectively. All these are allowed.\n        *   Therefore, all three routes are physically possible:\n            1.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n            2.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n            3.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability of a Specific Route**\n    The question asks for \"The transition route and the corresponding probability\". This refers to the branching ratio for a specific decay channel.\n    *   The initial state is |3,0,0⟩ (the 3s state). This state is spherically symmetric (l=0).\n    *   When a spherically symmetric state decays, the transition probabilities to each of the possible final magnetic sub-levels are equal. This is a consequence of the Wigner-Eckart theorem, which separates the geometry (m-dependence) from the dynamics.\n    *   In this case, the atom in the |3,0,0⟩ state can decay to any of the three |2,1,m'⟩ states. Since there is no preferred direction in the initial state, the probabilities for these three decay channels must be equal.\n    *   Total probability of decaying from |3,0,0⟩ to any of the |2,1,m'⟩ states is 1 (as this is the only allowed decay path). Since the three channels are equally likely, the probability for each is:\n        *   P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = 1/3\n        *   P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩) = 1/3\n        *   P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩) = 1/3\n    *   The second step of the decay is from the intermediate state |2,1,m'⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩. The 2p state (|2,1,m'⟩) can only decay to the 1s state (|1,0,0⟩) via an electric dipole transition. Thus, once the atom is in any of the |2,1,m'⟩ states, it will decay to |1,0,0⟩ with a probability of 1.\n    *   The probability of a complete transition route is the product of the probabilities of each step. For the route via |2,1,0⟩:\n        P(Route) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) × P(|2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩)\n        P(Route) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given Options**\n    *   **A) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3**: The route is valid, and the calculated probability is correct.\n    *   **B) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4**: The route is valid, but the probability should be 1/3, not 1/4.\n    *   **C) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 2/3**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n    *   **D) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4**: The route is valid, but the probability should be 1/3, not 1/4.\n\nBased on the analysis, option A is the only one that presents a valid route with the correct corresponding probability.\n\n<<<A>>>"
