    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:**\n    We have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a conducting sphere of radius `R`. The sphere is \"grounded,\" which means it is connected to a charge reservoir (the Earth) and is held at a constant potential, which we can set to zero (V=0). The presence of the charge `q` induces an opposite charge distribution on the surface of the sphere to maintain the V=0 condition on the sphere's surface.\n\n2.  **Apply the Method of Images:**\n    This problem is a classic application of the method of images in electrostatics. The electric field and potential *outside* the sphere can be accurately described by removing the sphere and replacing it with a single \"image charge\" `q'` placed at a specific location `d'` inside the sphere. The values of `q'` and `d'` are chosen to satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface where the sphere was (i.e., at radius `R`) is zero.\n\n3.  **Determine the Image Charge (`q'`) and its Position (`d'`):**\n    Through standard derivation (which involves setting the potential from `q` and `q'` to zero at points `r=R` on the sphere's surface), the image charge and its properties are found to be:\n    *   Image charge value: `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n    *   Image charge position: `d' = R^2 / d` (measured from the center, along the line connecting the center to `q`).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:**\n    The potential energy of the system is the work done by an external force to bring the charge `q` from infinity (where the potential energy is zero) to its final position `d`. The potential energy `U` is the negative of the work `W_field` done by the electric field of the induced charges.\n    `U = -W_field = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F_elec ⋅ dr`\n\n    The force on the charge `q` at any intermediate position `x` from the center is due to the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this force is exactly the force exerted by the image charge `q'(x) = -qR/x` at position `x' = R^2/x`.\n\n    `F_elec(x)` = Force between `q` at `x` and `q'` at `x'`\n    `F_elec(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - x')^2`\n    Substitute the expressions for `q'` and `x'`:\n    `F_elec(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n    `F_elec(x) = -k * q^2 * R / x * 1 / ((x^2 - R^2)/x)^2`\n    `F_elec(x) = -k * q^2 * R / x * x^2 / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n    `F_elec(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\n    The force is attractive (negative sign).\n\n5.  **Perform the Integration:**\n    Now, we integrate this force to find the work and then the potential energy.\n    `U = -W_field = - ∫(from ∞ to d) F_elec(x) dx`\n    `U = - ∫(from ∞ to d) [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n    `U = k * q^2 * R ∫(from ∞ to d) [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\n    To solve the integral, we use a u-substitution: let `u = x^2 - R^2`, then `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du/2`.\n    `∫ [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx = ∫ (1/u^2) * (du/2) = (1/2) ∫ u^(-2) du = (1/2) * (u^(-1)/-1) = -1 / (2u) = -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))`\n\n    Now, we evaluate the definite integral:\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))] (from ∞ to d)`\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * { [-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))] - [lim(x→∞) -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))] }`\n    `U = k * q^2 * R * { [-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))] - [0] }`\n    `U = - k * q^2 * R / (2(d^2 - R^2))`\n\n6.  **Final Expression and Comparison:**\n    The net potential energy of the system is:\n    `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    Comparing this result with the given options:\n    A) `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    B) `U = - (1/2) kq^2 R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)`\n    C) `U = - (1/2) kq^2 d / (d^2 + R^2)`\n    D) `U = - kq^2 d / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    Our derived expression matches option A perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
