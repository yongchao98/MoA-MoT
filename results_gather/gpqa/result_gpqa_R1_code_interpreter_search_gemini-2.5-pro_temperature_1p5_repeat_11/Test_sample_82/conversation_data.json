    "This problem requires a two-step calculation for the pH of a solution at different stages of a titration. First, we need to account for the initial dilution of the acetic acid, and then apply the principles of acid-base titration.\n\n**1. Initial Dilution of Acetic Acid**\n\n*   We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n*   We add 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   The final volume becomes 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³.\n*   We can use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂ to find the new concentration (M₂) of the acetic acid solution that will be titrated.\n    (0.05 M) × (20.00 cm³) = M₂ × (40.00 cm³)\n    M₂ = (0.05 × 20.00) / 40.00 = 0.025 M\n*   So, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**2. pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt this point, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, forming its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). The solution contains a mixture of the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base, which constitutes a buffer.\n\n*   The reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COO⁻Na⁺ + H₂O\n*   At 25% titration, 75% of the original acid remains, and 25% has been converted to the conjugate base.\n*   The ratio of [conjugate base]/[acid] is 25/75 = 1/3.\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid]).\n*   First, we calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵)\n*   Then we calculate the pH.\n\n**3. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH. The solution contains only the salt, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻), being the conjugate base of a weak acid, will hydrolyze in water to produce hydroxide ions (OH⁻), making the solution basic.\n\n*   Reaction: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   First, we need to find the number of moles of acid initially present to determine the moles of acetate formed and the volume of NaOH required.\n    Moles of CH₃COOH = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 M × 0.040 L = 0.001 moles.\n    At the equivalence point, moles of CH₃COO⁻ = 0.001 moles.\n*   Next, we find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed:\n    Volume = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.\n*   The total volume of the solution at the equivalence point is:\n    40.00 cm³ (acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n*   The concentration of the acetate ion [CH₃COO⁻] is:\n    [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for the acetate ion, which can be calculated from Ka and Kw (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C):\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵).\n*   Using an ICE table for the hydrolysis reaction, we have Kb = [OH⁻]² / [CH₃COO⁻]. We can solve for [OH⁻].\n*   From [OH⁻], we calculate pOH = -log[OH⁻].\n*   Finally, we find the pH using pH = 14 - pOH.\n\nLet's perform the calculations using a script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Part 1: pH at 25% Titration ---\n# For a buffer solution, pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n# At 25% titration, [A-]/[HA] = 25 / 75 = 1/3\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\npH_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- Part 2: pH at the Equivalence Point ---\n# Initial acid concentration after dilution\ninitial_acid_conc_diluted = 0.05 * 20.00 / 40.00  # M\n# Initial acid volume\ninitial_acid_vol = 0.040  # L\n# Moles of acid\nmoles_acid = initial_acid_conc_diluted * initial_acid_vol\n\n# Titrant (NaOH) concentration\ntitrant_conc = 0.1  # M\n# Volume of titrant at equivalence point\nvol_titrant_eq = moles_acid / titrant_conc  # L\n\n# Total volume at equivalence point\ntotal_vol_eq = initial_acid_vol + vol_titrant_eq  # L\n\n# Concentration of the conjugate base (acetate) at equivalence point\nconc_base_eq = moles_acid / total_vol_eq  # M\n\n# Calculate Kb for the conjugate base\nKb = Kw / Ka\n# Kb = [OH-]^2 / [A-], so [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [A-])\n# We assume [A-] at equilibrium is approximately the initial conc_base_eq\noh_conc = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_base_eq)\n\n# Calculate pOH and pH\npOH_eq = -math.log10(oh_conc)\npH_eq = 14 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n\n```\npH at 25% titration: 4.26\npH at equivalence point: 8.52\n\nThe calculations show that the pH at 25% titration is 4.26 and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Calculate the Concentration of Acetic Acid after Dilution**\n\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (V₁): 20.00 cm³\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M₁): 0.05 M\n*   Final volume of the solution (V₂): 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n*   We use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂ to find the new concentration (M₂) of the acetic acid that will be titrated.\n    M₂ = (M₁ * V₁) / V₂\n    M₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = 0.025 M\n*   So, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n\n**2. Calculate the pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the weak acid (CH₃COOH) has been converted to its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻) by the NaOH. This means 75% of the acid remains.\n*   The solution now contains a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base, which is a buffer system.\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid])\n*   First, we calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n*   The ratio of [conjugate base]/[acid] is 25%/75% = 1/3.\n*   Now, we can calculate the pH.\n\n**3. Calculate the pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with the NaOH to form sodium acetate (NaCH₃COO).\n*   The solution contains only the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻), which is a weak base and will hydrolyze in water, producing OH⁻ ions.\n    Reaction: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   To find the pH, we first need to determine the concentration of the acetate ion at the equivalence point.\n    *   **Moles of acid:** Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol.\n    *   **Volume of NaOH added:** At equivalence, moles of acid = moles of base. Volume = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   **Total volume:** 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L.\n    *   **Concentration of acetate:** [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.\n*   Next, we calculate the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻] from the hydrolysis equilibrium. We need the base dissociation constant, Kb.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n    *   From the equilibrium, Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]. Assuming [OH⁻] is small, we can approximate Kb ≈ [OH⁻]² / [CH₃COO⁻].\n    *   We can solve for [OH⁻].\n*   Finally, we calculate the pOH from [OH⁻] and then find the pH using pH = 14 - pOH.\n\nTo get the precise numerical values, the following Python code is used to perform the calculations.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Part 1: pH at 25% Titration ---\n# Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for a buffer.\n# At 25% titration, the ratio of [conjugate base]/[acid] is 25/75 = 1/3.\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\npH_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\n# --- Part 2: pH at the Equivalence Point ---\n# 1. Calculate the diluted concentration of the acid.\nconc_acid_diluted = 0.05 * (20.00 / 40.00) # M\n\n# 2. Calculate moles of acid being titrated.\nvol_acid_L = 40.00 / 1000 # L\nmoles_acid = conc_acid_diluted * vol_acid_L\n\n# 3. Calculate volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence.\nconc_NaOH = 0.1 # M\nvol_NaOH_L = moles_acid / conc_NaOH\n\n# 4. Calculate concentration of the acetate ion at the equivalence point.\ntotal_volume_L = vol_acid_L + vol_NaOH_L\nconc_acetate = moles_acid / total_volume_L\n\n# 5. Calculate Kb for acetate.\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\n# 6. Calculate [OH-] from hydrolysis equilibrium: Kb = [OH-]^2 / [acetate]\noh_conc = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_acetate)\n\n# 7. Calculate pOH and then pH.\npOH_eq = -math.log10(oh_conc)\npH_eq = 14.00 - pOH_eq\n\nprint(f\"pH at 25% titration: {pH_25_percent:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"pH at equivalence point: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n```\n<<<B>>>",
