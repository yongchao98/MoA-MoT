The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    `T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n    where:\n    *   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   `A` is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to compute the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]`\n    The problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both. It is also given that both planets have the same albedo (`A1 = A2`). Therefore, most terms cancel out:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [(1 / a1)^(1/2)] / [(1 / a2)^(1/2)] = (a2 / a1)^(1/2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)`\n    The problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes, `a2 / a1`.\n\n4.  **Relate Observational Data to Physical Properties:** We are given data from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) for each planet. The RV semi-amplitude (K) is the maximum speed of the star along our line of sight and is related to the Doppler shift by:\n    `K = c * (Δλ / λ_0)`\n    where `c` is the speed of light and `λ_0` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\n5.  **Connect RV Semi-amplitude (K) to Orbital Properties:** For a planet in a circular orbit (as stated in the problem), the star's velocity `K` (assuming we are viewing the system edge-on, which is a valid assumption since the planets are detected by the transit method) is given by:\n    `K = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))`\n    where:\n    *   `M_p` is the planet's mass.\n    *   `M_star` is the star's mass.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n6.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We can rearrange the above formula to solve for `a`:\n    `K^2 = M_p^2 * G / (M_star * a)`\n    `a = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1):**\n    `a2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K1^2)]`\n    The constants `G` and `M_star` cancel out:\n    `a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K1^2) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Ratio of RV Semi-amplitudes (K1 / K2):**\n    `K1 / K2 = [c * (Δλ_1 / λ_0)] / [c * (Δλ_2 / λ_0)]`\n    The constants `c` and `λ_0` cancel out:\n    `K1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`\n\n9.  **Combine the Ratios:** Substitute the expression for `K1 / K2` into the expression for `a2 / a1`:\n    `a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2`\n\n10. **Final Derivation for Temperature Ratio:** Now substitute this expression for `a2 / a1` back into our temperature ratio formula from step 3:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2 )`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)`\n\n11. **Plug in the Values and Compute:**\n    *   `M_p1 = 7` Earth masses\n    *   `M_p2 = 5` Earth masses\n    *   `Δλ_1 = 0.03` Å\n    *   `Δλ_2 = 0.04` Å\n\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04) = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28`\n\nThe final step is to perform the division.\n```python\n# Given values\n# Planet 1\nMp1 = 7  # Earth masses\nd_lambda1 = 0.03  # Angstroms\n\n# Planet 2\nMp2 = 5  # Earth masses\nd_lambda2 = 0.04  # Angstroms\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 is derived to be:\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (Mp2 / Mp1) * (d_lambda1 / d_lambda2)\n\n# Calculate the ratio\nratio = (Mp2 / Mp1) * (d_lambda1 / d_lambda2)\n\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.53\nB) ~ 1.05\nC) ~ 0.98\nD) ~ 1.30\n\nThe result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
