    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle, meaning its spin can be either \"up\" or \"down\" along any chosen axis.\n*   Its magnetic moment is given by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio and `S` is the spin angular momentum operator.\n*   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B` in the +Z direction (`B_vec = B * z_hat`). The Hamiltonian for the system is `H_initial = -μ · B_vec = -γS · (B * z_hat) = -γB * Sz`.\n*   The particle's magnetic moment is stated to be \"aligned\" with this field. This means the particle is in the lowest energy state. The eigenstates of `Sz` are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n*   The energies are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n*   The lower energy state is `E_up`, which corresponds to the spin-up state `|+z>`.\n*   Therefore, the state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. The Change in Hamiltonian (t ≥ 0)\n\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to the +Y direction (`B_vec = B * y_hat`).\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system for `t > 0` is `H_new = -μ · B_vec = -γS · (B * y_hat) = -γB * Sy`.\n\n### 3. Time Evolution of the State\n\nThe state `|ψ(t)>` will evolve according to the Schrödinger equation with the new Hamiltonian. An efficient way to find the oscillation frequency is to consider the energy spectrum of the new Hamiltonian.\n\n*   The time evolution of any quantum state can be understood by decomposing it into the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. The eigenstates of `H_new` are the same as the eigenstates of the `Sy` operator, which we denote as `|+y>` and `|-y>`.\n*   The eigenvalues of `Sy` are `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n*   The energy eigenvalues of `H_new` are:\n    *   `E_+y` (for eigenstate `|+y>`): `E_+y = -γB(ħ/2)`\n    *   `E_-y` (for eigenstate `|-y>`): `E_-y = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`\n*   The initial state `|+z>` is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian `H_new`. It is a superposition of the new eigenstates `|+y>` and `|-y>`. The relationship is:\n    `|+z> = (1/√2) * (|+y> + |-y>)`\n*   So at `t=0`, the state is `|ψ(0)> = (1/√2)|+y> + (1/√2)|-y>`. It's a superposition of two different energy states.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Oscillation Frequency\n\n*   The time evolution of the state will involve terms oscillating with a frequency determined by the energy difference between the components of the superposition.\n*   According to Bohr's frequency condition, the angular frequency `ω` of the oscillation between two energy states `E1` and `E2` is given by `ω = (E1 - E2) / ħ`.\n*   In our case, the energy difference between the two components of the state is `ΔE = E_-y - E_+y`.\n*   `ΔE = (+γBħ/2) - (-γBħ/2) = γBħ`.\n*   The oscillation frequency `ω` is therefore:\n    `ω = ΔE / ħ = (γBħ) / ħ = γB`.\n\nThis frequency `ω = γB` is known as the Larmor frequency. It is the frequency at which the expectation value of the spin vector precesses around the new magnetic field. Since the z-component of the spin is perpendicular to the new field (along Y), its expectation value will oscillate with this Larmor frequency.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe average (expectation value) of the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) `γB`\nB) `γB/√2`\nC) `√2 * γB`\nD) `γB/2`\n\nThe calculated frequency matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
