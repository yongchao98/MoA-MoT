    "Here is the thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe core of the question is to compare the magnitude of two energy values:\n1.  The energy of the **paramagnetic coupling term**, which is the energy shift caused by the interaction of an atom's orbital magnetic moment with an external magnetic field (Zeeman effect).\n2.  The **transition energy** of a specific spectral line in the Hydrogen atom, given by its wavelength.\n\nWe need to determine if the paramagnetic energy is much smaller than, much larger than, or on the same order of magnitude as the transition energy.\n\n### **2. Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy `\\(\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle\\)`**\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the interaction of the orbital magnetic moment with an external magnetic field `\\(\\vec{B}\\)` is given by:\n`$$ H = - \\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B} $$`\nwhere `\\(\\vec{\\mu}_L = - \\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L}\\)` is the orbital magnetic dipole moment.\n\nSubstituting `\\(\\vec{\\mu}_L\\)` into the Hamiltonian expression:\n`$$ H = \\frac{e}{2m_e} \\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} $$`\nThe magnetic field `\\(\\vec{B}\\)` is directed along the z-axis, so `\\(\\vec{B} = B\\hat{z}\\)`. The dot product becomes `\\(\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = L_z B\\)`, where `\\(L_z\\)` is the z-component of the orbital angular momentum.\n\nThe expectation value of the energy `\\(\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle\\)` is given by the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian. The eigenvalues of `\\(L_z\\)` are `\\(m\\hbar\\)`, where `\\(m\\)` is the orbital magnetic quantum number.\nTherefore, the energy shift is:\n`$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} m B $$`\nThe term `\\(\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}\\)` is defined as the Bohr magneton, `\\(\\mu_B\\)`.\n`$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = m \\mu_B B $$`\n\nNow, let's plug in the given values:\n*   `\\(B = 1 \\, \\text{T}\\)`\n*   `\\(m\\)` is a \"small value\". For an order-of-magnitude comparison, we can take a typical small, non-zero integer value for `\\(m\\)`, such as `\\(m=1\\)`.\n*   The Bohr magneton `\\(\\mu_B\\)` is a fundamental physical constant.\n\nWe will calculate the value of `\\(\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle\\)` in Joules.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Transition Energy `\\(\\Delta E\\)`**\n\nThe energy of a photon corresponding to a specific transition is related to its wavelength `\\(\\lambda\\)` by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n`$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} $$`\nwhere:\n*   `\\(h\\)` is the Planck constant.\n*   `\\(c\\)` is the speed of light.\n*   The given wavelength is `\\(\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}\\)`.\n\nWe will calculate this energy in Joules to compare it with `\\(\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle\\)`.\n\n### **4. Perform the Calculation and Comparison**\n\nTo get precise values and avoid rounding errors, we can use a small Python script to compute both energies and their ratio.\n\n**Physical Constants:**\n*   Bohr magneton (`\\(\\mu_B\\)`): `\\(9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J/T}\\)`\n*   Planck constant (`\\(h\\)`): `\\(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J} \\cdot \\text{s}\\)`\n*   Speed of light (`\\(c\\)`): `\\(2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\, \\text{m/s}\\)`\n\n**Given Values:**\n*   `\\(B = 1 \\, \\text{T}\\)`\n*   `\\(m = 1\\)`\n*   `\\(\\lambda = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}\\)`\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Physical constants\nmu_B = 9.274078e-24  # Bohr magneton (J/T)\nh = 6.62607015e-34   # Planck constant (J*s)\nc = 299792458        # Speed of light (m/s)\n\n# Given values\nB = 1.0  # Magnetic field in Tesla\nm = 1    # A small orbital magnetic quantum number\nwavelength = 0.4861e-6 # Wavelength in meters\n\n# 1. Calculate the paramagnetic coupling energy <H>\n# Formula: <H> = m * mu_B * B\nH_paramagnetic = m * mu_B * B\n\n# 2. Calculate the transition energy Delta E\n# Formula: Delta_E = h * c / wavelength\nDelta_E = (h * c) / wavelength\n\n# 3. Compare the two energies\nratio = H_paramagnetic / Delta_E\n\nprint(f\"Paramagnetic Coupling Energy <H>: {H_paramagnetic:.4e} J\")\nprint(f\"Transition Energy Delta E: {Delta_E:.4e} J\")\nprint(f\"Ratio <H> / Delta E: {ratio:.4e}\")\n\n```\n<execute_result>\nParamagnetic Coupling Energy <H>: 9.2741e-24 J\nTransition Energy Delta E: 4.0877e-19 J\nRatio <H> / Delta E: 2.2687e-05\n</execute_result>\n### **5. Conclude**\n\nFrom the calculation:\n*   The paramagnetic coupling energy `\\(\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle\\)` is on the order of `\\(10^{-23}\\)` Joules.\n*   The transition energy `\\(\\Delta E\\)` is on the order of `\\(10^{-19}\\)` Joules.\n\nThe ratio `\\(\\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E}\\)` is approximately `\\(2.27 \\times 10^{-5}\\)`. This is a very small number, which means the paramagnetic coupling energy is significantly smaller than the transition energy.\n\nThis relationship is expressed mathematically as:\n`$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E $$`\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\nThis result is expected, as the Zeeman effect (paramagnetic coupling) typically represents a fine perturbation to the main energy levels of an atom, which are determined by the principal quantum number `\\(n\\)`. The energy differences between these main levels (like the given transition) are orders of magnitude larger than the shifts caused by a typical laboratory magnetic field of 1 Tesla.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "### **Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The core task is to compare two quantities:\n    *   **The paramagnetic coupling energy (`\\(\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle\\)`):** This is the energy shift experienced by an atom's orbital magnetic moment in an external magnetic field. This is a manifestation of the Zeeman effect.\n    *   **The transition energy (`\\(\\Delta E\\)`):** This is the energy difference between two atomic orbitals, corresponding to the emission or absorption of a photon with a given wavelength.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy `\\(\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle\\)`:**\n    *   The Hamiltonian for the interaction is `\\(H = -\\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B}\\)`, where `\\(\\vec{\\mu}_L\\)` is the orbital magnetic dipole moment and `\\(\\vec{B}\\)` is the external magnetic field.\n    *   The orbital magnetic moment is given by `\\(\\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L}\\)`, where `\\(\\vec{L}\\)` is the orbital angular momentum operator, `\\(e\\)` is the elementary charge, and `\\(m_e\\)` is the electron mass.\n    *   Substituting `\\(\\vec{\\mu}_L\\)` into the Hamiltonian, we get `\\(H = \\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B}\\)`.\n    *   The problem states the magnetic field is parallel to the z-axis, so `\\(\\vec{B} = B\\hat{z}\\)`. The dot product simplifies to `\\(\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = L_z B\\)`, where `\\(L_z\\)` is the z-component of the orbital angular momentum.\n    *   The energy eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian, which represent the energy shifts, are `\\(\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\frac{e}{2m_e}\\left\\langle L_z\\right\\rangle B\\)`.\n    *   The eigenvalues of `\\(L_z\\)` are `\\(m\\hbar\\)`, where `\\(m\\)` is the orbital magnetic quantum number.\n    *   So, `\\(\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} m B\\)`.\n    *   The term `\\(\\mu_B = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}\\)` is the Bohr magneton, a fundamental physical constant. Its value is approximately `\\(9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J/T}\\)`.\n    *   The final formula for the energy is `\\(\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = m \\mu_B B\\)`.\n    *   Given values: `\\(B = 1 \\, \\text{T}\\)` and `\\(m\\)` is a small integer. For an order-of-magnitude calculation, we can choose the smallest non-zero integer, `\\(m=1\\)`.\n    *   Calculation: `\\(\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = 1 \\times (9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J/T}) \\times 1 \\, \\text{T} = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J}\\)`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Transition Energy `\\(\\Delta E\\)`:**\n    *   The energy of a photon is related to its wavelength `\\(\\lambda\\)` by the Planck-Einstein relation: `\\(\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}\\)`.\n    *   Given values:\n        *   `\\(h\\)` (Planck's constant) `\\(\\approx 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J}\\cdot\\text{s}\\)`.\n        *   `\\(c\\)` (speed of light) `\\(\\approx 2.998 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)`.\n        *   `\\(\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}\\)`. (Note: This wavelength corresponds to the Balmer series H-beta line, a transition from n=4 to n=2 in Hydrogen).\n    *   Calculation: `\\(\\Delta E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34}) \\times (2.998 \\times 10^8)}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6}} \\approx 4.088 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J}\\)`.\n\n4.  **Compare the Magnitudes:**\n    *   Paramagnetic energy: `\\(\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\approx 9.27 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J}\\)` (Order `\\(10^{-23}\\)` J).\n    *   Transition energy: `\\(\\Delta E \\approx 4.09 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J}\\)` (Order `\\(10^{-19}\\)` J).\n    *   The ratio is `\\(\\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{9.274 \\times 10^{-24}}{4.088 \\times 10^{-19}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}\\)`.\n    *   Since the ratio is very small (`\\(2.27 \\times 10^{-5} \\ll 1\\)`), the paramagnetic coupling energy is many orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The relationship between the two energies is `\\(\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E\\)`. This corresponds to option B. The Zeeman splitting caused by a 1 Tesla field is a very small perturbation compared to the energy difference between principal electron shells in a Hydrogen atom.\n\n***\n\n**Final Answer Derivation using LaTeX notation:**\n\nThe paramagnetic coupling term is given by the energy of interaction between the orbital magnetic moment `\\(\\vec{\\mu}_L\\)` and the external magnetic field `\\(\\vec{B}\\)`:\n`$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle - \\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B} \\right\\rangle $$`\nSince `\\(\\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}\\frac{\\vec{L}}{\\hbar} = -\\mu_B \\frac{\\vec{L}}{\\hbar}\\)`, where `\\(\\mu_B\\)` is the Bohr magneton, and `\\(\\vec{B}\\)` is along the z-axis (`\\(\\vec{B} = B\\hat{z}\\)`):\n`$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle \\mu_B \\frac{L_z}{\\hbar} B \\right\\rangle = m \\mu_B B $$`\nUsing the given values `\\(B = 1 \\, \\text{T}\\)`, `\\(m=1\\)` (a small value), and `\\(\\mu_B = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J/T}\\)`:\n`$$ \\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle = 1 \\times (9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J/T}) \\times (1 \\, \\text{T}) \\approx 9.27 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J} $$`\n\nThe transition energy `\\(\\Delta E\\)` is related to the photon wavelength `\\(\\lambda\\)` by:\n`$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} $$`\nUsing the given `\\(\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}\\)`, Planck's constant `\\(h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J}\\cdot\\text{s}\\)`, and the speed of light `\\(c = 2.998 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)`:\n`$$ \\Delta E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J}\\cdot\\text{s})(2.998 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s})}{0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}} \\approx 4.09 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J} $$`\n\nComparing the two energy values:\n`$$ \\frac{\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{9.27 \\times 10^{-24} \\, \\text{J}}{4.09 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5} $$`\nSince this ratio is extremely small, we conclude that `\\(\\left\\langle H\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E\\)`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
