    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the gaseous products and their quantities.**\n\nThe problem states that a mixture of gases is formed and passed through a series of tubes. We can determine the composition and amount of the gas mixture from the mass changes of these tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is equal to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (filled with Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases, most commonly carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since the weight of the tube did not change, no gas was absorbed. This means no CO₂ (or other acidic gases like SO₂, NO₂) was present in the gas mixture. Therefore, the original salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (filled with red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) via the reaction 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen exists as O₂ molecules, the moles of O₂ gas are half the moles of O atoms.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (C):** After passing through all three tubes, 2.24 liters of a gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with the drying agent, the alkaline solution, or the hot copper. Given that we expect the salts to contain nitrogen (a very common component of salts that decompose into gases), the most logical identity for Gas C is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nSo, the decomposition of the 7.20 g salt mixture produced:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.025 mol O₂\n*   0.10 mol N₂\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elemental composition of the original salt mixture.**\n\nSince salts A and B decomposed completely into these gases, we can calculate the total moles of each element present in the initial mixture.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All H comes from H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All N comes from N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × Moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen comes from both H₂O and O₂.\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × Moles of H₂O) + (2 × Moles of O₂) = 0.20 mol + (2 × 0.025 mol) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\nNow, let's check if the total mass of these elements matches the initial mass of the mixture (7.20 g).\n*   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n*   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n*   Total Mass = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches perfectly, confirming our analysis of the products is correct.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Salts A and B.**\n\nThe problem states we have an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. The combined empirical formula of the mixture (A+B) has an atomic ratio of H:N:O = 0.40 : 0.20 : 0.25. To get whole numbers, we can multiply by 20, giving a ratio of H:N:O = 8:4:5.\n\nSo, the combined formula of one molecule of salt A plus one molecule of salt B is **N₄H₈O₅**.\n\nWe need to find two common salt formulas that add up to this total. The salts are composed of H, N, and O. The most common cation is ammonium (NH₄⁺), and the common anions are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻). Let's test these.\n\n*   Let Salt A be ammonium nitrite: **NH₄NO₂**. Its chemical formula is N₂H₄O₂.\n*   Let Salt B be ammonium nitrate: **NH₄NO₃**. Its chemical formula is N₂H₄O₃.\n\nLet's sum the formulas of our candidate salts:\n(N₂H₄O₂) + (N₂H₄O₃) = **N₄H₈O₅**\nThis perfectly matches the overall composition we derived. Thus, salts A and B are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\nWe can verify this with the moles and masses. M(NH₄NO₂) = 64 g/mol, M(NH₄NO₃) = 80 g/mol. Since the mixture is equimolar, let's say we have 'n' moles of each.\nTotal mass = n × M(NH₄NO₂) + n × M(NH₄NO₃) = n × (64 + 80) = 144n.\n144n = 7.20 g → n = 7.20 / 144 = 0.05 mol.\nThe mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃. This is consistent with all the product amounts.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in their respective chemical formulas.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Atoms = (1 N + 4 H) + (1 N + 2 O) = 2 N + 4 H + 2 O\n    *   Total atoms in A = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Atoms = (1 N + 4 H) + (1 N + 3 O) = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O\n    *   Total atoms in B = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total atoms in both salts** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
