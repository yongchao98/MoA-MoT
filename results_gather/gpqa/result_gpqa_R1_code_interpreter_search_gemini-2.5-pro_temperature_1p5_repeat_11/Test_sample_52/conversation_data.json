    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\nFirst, let's break down the information provided by each spectroscopic technique.\n\n*   **Compound Type:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This tells us we have a benzene ring (C6H6) where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by two other groups (substituents). The core of the molecule is therefore a C6H4 group.\n*   **FTIR:** An ester group is present. An ester has the functional group -COO-, which contains one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms. This accounts for the O2 in all the proposed formulas.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:** This provides the most detailed structural information.\n    *   **Six signals:** This indicates there are six chemically non-equivalent sets of protons in the molecule.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4) has 4 aromatic protons. Having only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern. A 1,4- (para) substitution with two different substituents would give two signals (typically two doublets), which fits this description perfectly. So, we have a 1,4-disubstituted C6H4 ring, accounting for 4 hydrogens.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H:** This indicates a carbon-carbon double bond with two hydrogens attached (-CH=CH-).\n        *   One signal is a **doublet**. This proton is coupled to only one other proton.\n        *   One signal is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighbors: one proton (giving the doublet) and a group of three equivalent protons (a -CH3 group, giving the quartet).\n        *   This specific splitting pattern points to a **prop-1-en-1-yl group** (-CH=CH-CH3). The proton on the central carbon is split by the other vinyl proton and the methyl group (dq), and the other vinyl proton is split only by the central vinyl proton (d). This fragment accounts for one C=C double bond, two vinyl hydrogens, and one methyl group. The formula for this group is C3H5.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** We have already identified one -CH3 group as part of the prop-1-en-1-yl substituent. This means there must be a second, distinct -CH3 group elsewhere in the molecule.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** This is a critical constraint, ruling out any structures containing ethyl, propyl, or other alkyl chains with -CH2- units.\n\n### 2. Assembling the Molecular Structure\n\nNow, let's assemble the pieces we've identified:\n*   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring (C6H4).\n*   An ester group (-COO-).\n*   Substituent 1: A prop-1-en-1-yl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n*   Substituent 2: This must be formed from the remaining pieces, which are the ester group and the second -CH3 group.\n\nThere are two ways to combine the ester and the second -CH3 group to form the second substituent without introducing any -CH2- groups:\n1.  **Methyl ester group (-COOCH3):** The benzene ring is attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n2.  **Acetoxy group (-OCOCH3):** The benzene ring is attached to the ester oxygen.\n\nBoth of these possibilities are consistent with the NMR data, as the methyl group in each (-COOCH3 or -OCOCH3) would be a singlet (no adjacent protons), providing the second required -CH3 signal.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Chemical Formula\n\nLet's calculate the molecular formula for the structure we have deduced. The structure consists of three parts:\n*   The benzene ring core: **C6H4**\n*   The prop-1-en-1-yl group: **C3H5**\n*   The second substituent (either -COOCH3 or -OCOCH3): **C2H3O2**\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from these parts:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from ester/methyl part) = 11\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl ester/acetate part) = 12\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester)\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n### 4. Verification\n\nWe can verify this by summing the protons accounted for by the NMR signals:\n*   Aromatic H: 4H\n*   Vinyl H: 2H\n*   Methyl H's: 3H + 3H = 6H\n*   **Total H = 4 + 2 + 6 = 12 H**\n\nThis matches the hydrogen count in the formula C11H12O2.\n\nLet's check the given options:\nA) C11H14O2 (14 H) - Incorrect hydrogen count.\nB) C12H14O2 (14 H) - Incorrect hydrogen count.\nC) C11H12O2 (12 H) - **Matches our derived formula and hydrogen count.**\nD) C12H12O2 (12 H) - While the hydrogen count is correct, it is not possible to construct a molecule with this formula that fits all the detailed NMR constraints (specifically the nature of the six signals and the absence of -CH2- groups). Adding another carbon atom to our derived structure would require adding/removing hydrogens in a way that violates the spectral data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the only possible chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n```python\n# A simple script to confirm the atom count for the deduced structure.\n# The structure consists of three main parts:\n# 1. A di-substituted benzene ring: C6H4\n# 2. A prop-1-en-1-yl group: C3H5\n# 3. A methyl ester or acetoxy group: C2H3O2\n\n# Initialize atom counts\nC_total = 0\nH_total = 0\nO_total = 0\n\n# Add atoms from the benzene ring\nC_total += 6\nH_total += 4\n\n# Add atoms from the prop-1-en-1-yl group\nC_total += 3\nH_total += 5\n\n# Add atoms from the second substituent (e.g., -COOCH3)\nC_total += 2\nH_total += 3\nO_total += 2\n\n# Print the final formula\nprint(f\"The calculated chemical formula is C{C_total}H{H_total}O{O_total}.\")\n```\n<<<C>>>",
    "An example of a compound that fits all the described data is **methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate**. Let's break down its structure and see how it matches the evidence.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    *   A benzene ring is substituted at the 1 and 4 positions (para).\n    *   One substituent is a methyl ester group (-COOCH3).\n    *   The other substituent is a prop-1-en-1-yl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n*   **Formula Calculation:**\n    *   Benzene ring core: C6H4\n    *   Methyl ester group: C2H3O2\n    *   Prop-1-en-1-yl group: C3H5\n    *   Total: C(6+2+3) H(4+3+5) O(2) = **C11H12O2**\n*   **Spectroscopic Data Match:**\n    *   **FTIR:** The methyl ester group (-COOCH3) is an ester. This matches.\n    *   **1H NMR:**\n        *   **Aromatic-H:** The para-substitution pattern gives two signals for the 4 aromatic protons (two doublets). This matches (2 signals).\n        *   **Vinyl-H:** The -CH=CH- part gives two signals for the two vinyl protons. This matches (2 signals). The splitting would be a doublet and a doublet of quartets as described.\n        *   **–CH3 Groups:** There is one methyl group in the ester (-COOCH3) and one in the propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). These are in different chemical environments, so they give two distinct signals. This matches (2 signals).\n        *   **No –CH2 Groups:** The structure contains no -CH2- units. This matches.\n\nThe molecular formula C11H12O2 is the only one that is consistent with the detailed structural information derived from the NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>"
