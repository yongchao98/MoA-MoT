    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the principle of conservation of energy.**\n    In this problem, the total mechanical energy of the harmonic oscillator is conserved. This total mechanical energy is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy ($K$) and the potential energy ($U$).\n    $E_{mech} = K + U = \\text{constant}$\n\n2.  **Define the relativistic kinetic energy and potential energy.**\n    *   The relativistic kinetic energy of a particle of mass $m$ moving at speed $v$ is given by:\n        $K = mc^2(\\gamma - 1)$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    *   The force is given by Hooke's law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy $U$ associated with this conservative force is:\n        $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n3.  **Set up the conservation of energy equation.**\n    The conserved total mechanical energy is:\n    $E_{mech} = mc^2\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} - 1\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n4.  **Analyze the system at two key points in its oscillation.**\n    *   **Point 1: Maximum displacement (amplitude).**\n        At this point, the position is $x = A$, and the mass is momentarily at rest, so its speed is $v = 0$.\n        Let's calculate the total energy at this point:\n        *   $v=0 \\implies \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0}} = 1$.\n        *   Kinetic energy, $K_1 = mc^2(1 - 1) = 0$.\n        *   Potential energy, $U_1 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        *   Total mechanical energy, $E_{mech} = K_1 + U_1 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n    *   **Point 2: Equilibrium position.**\n        At this point, the position is $x = 0$, and the mass is moving at its maximum speed, $v = v_{max}$.\n        Let's calculate the total energy at this point:\n        *   Let $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        *   Kinetic energy, $K_2 = mc^2(\\gamma_{max} - 1)$.\n        *   Potential energy, $U_2 = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n        *   Total mechanical energy, $E_{mech} = K_2 + U_2 = mc^2(\\gamma_{max} - 1)$.\n\n5.  **Equate the energies and solve for $v_{max}$.**\n    Since energy is conserved, the total energy at Point 1 must equal the total energy at Point 2.\n    $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2(\\gamma_{max} - 1)$\n\n    Now, we solve for $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\gamma_{max} - 1$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To isolate $v_{max}$, we first take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n    Next, square both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Rearrange the terms to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n6.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The derived expression for $v_{max}$ is identical to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
