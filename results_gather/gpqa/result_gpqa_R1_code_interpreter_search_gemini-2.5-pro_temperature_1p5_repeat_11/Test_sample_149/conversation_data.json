    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Elucidate the structure of the starting compound (C8H9NO) from the given data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    DBE = 8 - (9/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 8 - 4.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond or ring.\n*   **1H-NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 6.98 (d, 2H) and δ 6.51 (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region of the spectrum. Two doublets, each integrating to two protons, are characteristic of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The different chemical shifts for the two sets of protons indicate that the two substituents are electronically different.\n    *   **δ 6.27 (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet that integrates to two protons is typically an exchangeable group like -OH or -NH2. Given that the molecular formula contains a nitrogen atom, this signal is very likely due to a primary amino group (-NH2). An amino group is an electron-donating group.\n    *   **δ 9.72 (t, 1H):** This signal is in the far downfield region, which is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The splitting pattern is a triplet (t), which means it is coupled to an adjacent group with two protons (n+1=3, so n=2), most likely a -CH2- group. This confirms the presence of a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **δ 3.66 (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the -CH2- group adjacent to the aldehyde. It appears as a doublet (d), indicating it is coupled to a single proton (n+1=2, so n=1), which is the aldehyde proton. The coupling between the -CH2- and -CHO protons (2J_HH) is consistent.\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    *   We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   The substituents are an amino group (-NH2) and a -CH2-CHO group (acetaldehyde group).\n    *   The amino group is electron-donating, and the -CH2-CHO group is electron-withdrawing. This is consistent with the separated signals for the aromatic protons.\n    *   The structure of the starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n    *   Let's verify the molecular formula: C6(ring) + C1(CH2) + C1(CHO) = C8. H4(ring) + H2(NH2) + H2(CH2) + H1(CHO) = H9. N1, O1. The formula C8H9NO is correct.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n*   **Reagents 1 & 2: 1. NaNO2 + HCl; 2. H2O**\n    *   The first step (NaNO2 + HCl, typically at 0-5°C) is the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH2 group is converted into a diazonium salt group (-N₂⁺).\n        Ar-NH₂ → [Ar-N≡N]⁺Cl⁻\n    *   The second step is the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt by adding water and warming. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (N₂) and is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n        [Ar-N≡N]⁺Cl⁻ + H₂O → Ar-OH + N₂ + HCl\n    *   The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n        Structure: HO-C₆H₄-CH₂-CHO\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   This step involves treating the intermediate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, with a strong base (KOH) and heat.\n    *   4-Hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is an aldehyde with two acidic α-protons (the protons on the -CH₂- group adjacent to the -CHO group).\n    *   Aldehydes with α-protons undergo an **aldol condensation** in the presence of a base. The \"Heat\" specified in the conditions indicates that the reaction will proceed to the final condensation product, not just stop at the aldol addition product.\n    *   **Aldol Condensation Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Enolate Formation:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻ from KOH) removes an acidic α-proton from one molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n        2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n        3.  **Protonation:** The resulting alkoxide is protonated by water to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde, known as the aldol addition product. The structure of this adduct is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option C).\n        4.  **Dehydration:** Because the reaction is heated, the aldol adduct undergoes dehydration (elimination of a water molecule). The α-proton is removed, and the β-hydroxyl group is eliminated, forming a double bond between the α and β carbons. This creates a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Final Product Structure.**\n\n*   **Aldol Adduct (Intermediate, Option C):** 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal\n    Structure: (HO-C₆H₄)-CH₂(β')-CH(β)(OH)-CH(α)(CHO)-(C₆H₄-OH)\n    IUPAC chain numbering starts from the aldehyde C=O as C1. The alpha carbon is C2, the beta carbon is C3.\n    So the adduct is (HO-C₆H₄)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(OH)-CH(2)(C₆H₄-OH)-CHO(1).\n    This structure name is: **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**.\n*   **Final Dehydration Product (Final Product, Option D):**\n    Dehydration eliminates the -OH from C3 and a proton from the acidic C2 (the α-carbon). This forms a double bond between C2 and C3.\n    The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n    Structure: (HO-C₆H₄)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)=C(2)(C₆H₄-OH)-CHO(1).\n\nComparing this final structure to the given options:\nA) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect structure and stoichiometry.\nB) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect substituents (phenyl instead of hydroxyphenyl) and wrong double bond position.\nC) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the aldol addition product, which is an intermediate. It would be the main product if the reaction was run at low temperatures without heat.\nD) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal - This is the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde formed after dehydration. Given the \"Heat\" condition, this is the expected final product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
