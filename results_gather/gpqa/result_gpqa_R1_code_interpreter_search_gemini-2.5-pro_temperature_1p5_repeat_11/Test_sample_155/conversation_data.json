    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene which is achiral. The two groups attached to the double bond are identical (n-propyl groups).\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   H\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n                H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is a two-step process:\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction on the alkene. Epoxidation is a *syn-addition*, meaning both C-O bonds form on the same face of the alkene. For a trans-alkene, this results in a *trans*-epoxide. Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, the product will be a racemic mixture of the two possible chiral trans-epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This causes the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The water molecule acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the epoxide carbons from the backside (anti-attack relative to the epoxide oxygen). This is an *anti-addition* step.\n\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The combination of epoxidation (syn) followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis (anti) results in an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:** A well-known rule in stereochemistry states that the *anti*-addition to a *trans*-alkene (with identical substituents) results in a *meso* compound.\n    *   Let's trace it:\n        *   (4R,5R)-epoxide + H₂O → Backside attack at either C4 or C5 inverts the configuration at that carbon, leading to (4S,5R)-diol or (4R,5S)-diol. Both designations refer to the same single meso compound.\n        *   (4S,5S)-epoxide + H₂O → Backside attack leads to the same meso compound.\n    *   Therefore, the product of Reaction 1 is a single, achiral compound: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene, which is also achiral.\n    ```\n        CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n                H   H\n    ```\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are the same as in Reaction 1, leading to an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:** The stereochemical rule for *anti*-addition to a *cis*-alkene (with identical substituents) is the formation of a *racemic mixture* of enantiomers.\n    *   Let's trace it:\n        *   (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA (syn-addition) → This forms the *cis*-epoxide, which is a meso compound (meso-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n        *   meso-epoxide + H₃O⁺ (anti-addition) → Backside attack by water on the two equivalent carbons of the meso-epoxide leads to the formation of two different products which are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (enantiomers).\n    *   The products are **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**, formed in equal amounts (a racemic mixture).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1) - Achiral\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2) - Chiral\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2) - Chiral\n\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Achiral HPLC columns separate compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and thus different affinities for the stationary phase. They will be separated and show distinct peaks.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They cannot be separated by an achiral column and will elute at the same time, appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the meso-diol will give one peak, and the racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diols will co-elute and give a second peak.\n    *   **Total peaks observed = 2.**\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC columns use a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n    *   The problem states that \"the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible,\" which means the enantiomers will be successfully separated.\n    *   A chiral column can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   Therefore, all three distinct stereoisomers in the mixture will be separated from each other.\n    *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n    *   **Total peaks observed = 3.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the standard HPLC will produce 2 peaks, and the chiral HPLC will produce 3 peaks.\n\n<<<A>>>"
