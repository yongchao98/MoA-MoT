    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Starting Material:** 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one\n\nLet's break down the structure:\n*   **cyclohexan-1-one**: A six-membered carbon ring containing a ketone (C=O) at position 1.\n*   **3-(hydroxymethyl)**: A -CH2OH group attached to carbon 3 of the ring.\n*   **5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)**: This is an isopropenyl group, -C(CH3)=CH2, attached to carbon 5 of the ring.\n\nThe starting material has a ketone, a primary alcohol, and an alkene functional group.\n\n**Step 1: Treatment with sodium hydride (NaH), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr)**\n\n*   **Sodium hydride (NaH)** is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It will react with the most acidic proton in the molecule. The alcohol proton (-OH, pKa ≈ 16-18) is significantly more acidic than the α-protons of the ketone (pKa ≈ 19-20). Therefore, NaH will deprotonate the hydroxymethyl group to form a sodium alkoxide.\n    > R-CH2OH + NaH → R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n*   **Benzyl bromide (PhCH₂Br or BnBr)** is an alkylating agent. The alkoxide formed in the first part of the step is a strong nucleophile and will attack the benzyl bromide in a Williamson ether synthesis (an Sₙ2 reaction) to form a benzyl ether.\n    > R-CH2O⁻Na⁺ + PhCH₂Br → R-CH₂-O-CH₂Ph + NaBr\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group is protected as a benzyl ether. The ketone and isopropenyl groups are unaffected.\n    > **Product 1 is 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.**\n\n**Step 2: Treatment with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (TsNHNH₂) in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl**\n\n*   This reaction is the formation of a tosylhydrazone. The ketone group reacts with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide under acidic conditions. The nitrogen of the hydrazide acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon, followed by dehydration to form a C=N bond.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone is converted to a tosylhydrazone. The benzyl ether and isopropenyl groups remain unchanged.\n    > **Product 2 is the tosylhydrazone derivative of Product 1.**\n\n**Step 3: Treatment at low temperature with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), followed by aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)**\n\n*   This set of reagents and conditions is characteristic of the **Shapiro reaction**.\n*   **n-Butyllithium (n-BuLi)** is a very strong base. Two equivalents are used. The first equivalent deprotonates the -NH- proton of the tosylhydrazone. The second equivalent deprotonates the α-carbon (C2 or C6 of the cyclohexanone ring), which is now a vinylic proton in the tosylhydrazone anion.\n*   This dianion is unstable and collapses, eliminating nitrogen gas (N₂) and the toluenesulfinate anion (Ts⁻) to form a vinyllithium intermediate.\n*   The overall transformation replaces the original C=O group with a C=C double bond, where the double bond forms between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and one of the adjacent α-carbons (C2 or C6). Since both α-positions are symmetrically equivalent (CH₂ groups), there is no regiochemical preference.\n*   **Aqueous ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl)** is a mild proton source used during the workup to quench the vinyllithium intermediate, protonating it to form the final alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** The cyclohexanone ring becomes a cyclohexene ring. The other groups are unaffected.\n    > **Product 3 is a cyclohexene derivative with a (benzyloxy)methyl group and an isopropenyl group.** For example, 4-((benzyloxy)methyl)-6-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene.\n\n**Step 4: Stirring with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂)**\n\n*   This is a **catalytic hydrogenation** reaction. Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) is a powerful catalyst for reducing multiple types of functional groups with hydrogen gas.\n*   The reaction will cause three transformations in Product 3:\n    1.  **Reduction of the alkene in the ring**: The C=C bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C single bond, reforming the cyclohexane skeleton.\n    2.  **Reduction of the isopropenyl group**: The C=C bond in the side chain is also reduced. The isopropenyl group [-C(CH₃)=CH₂] becomes an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂].\n    3.  **Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether**: The C-O bond of the benzyl ether is cleaved by hydrogen. The benzyl group is removed, and the alcohol is regenerated.\n        > R-CH₂-O-Bn + H₂ → R-CH₂-OH + Toluene\n*   **Product 4:** Combining these transformations:\n    *   The cyclohexane ring is restored.\n    *   The substituent at position 5 becomes an isopropyl group.\n    *   The substituent at position 3 becomes a hydroxymethyl group.\n    *   The ketone at position 1 has been effectively reduced to a CH₂ group.\n\nThe final structure is a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group and an isopropyl group in a 1,3-relationship (derived from the original 3,5-disubstituted cyclohexanone). Let's name this final product.\nThe principal functional group is the alcohol, making it a derivative of methanol. The substituent on the methanol is a `3-isopropylcyclohexyl` group. Therefore, the IUPAC name is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide: Incorrect. This structure still contains the tosylhydrazone moiety.\n*   B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene: Incorrect. This is the benzyl ether product before the final hydrogenolysis step.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol: Correct. This name perfectly matches the structure we derived for Product 4.\n*   D) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol: Incorrect. This structure implies an addition of the butyl group from n-BuLi, which is not the main pathway for a Shapiro reaction. It also retains the benzyl ether, which should have been cleaved.\n\nThe final product of the reaction sequence is (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol.\n\n<<<C>>>"
