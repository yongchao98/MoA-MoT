    "*   **Analyze the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance:**\n    The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates away. The formula is:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} \\cdot (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis (orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n    *   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n    We need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 4 to Planet 2 ($T_{eq4} / T_{eq2}$).\n    $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_4} \\right)^{1/2} \\cdot (1 - A_4)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} \\cdot (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\n    Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constant) and have the same albedo ($A_4 = A_2$), most terms cancel out:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_4} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_4} \\right)^{1/2}$\n    This shows that the temperature ratio is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance ratio.\n\n*   **Relate Orbital Distance to Orbital Period using Kepler's Third Law:**\n    Kepler's Third Law states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis ($a$):\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3$ or $\\frac{P^2}{a^3} = \\text{constant}$\n\n    Therefore, for Planet 2 and Planet 4:\n    $\\frac{P_2^2}{a_2^3} = \\frac{P_4^2}{a_4^3}$\n\n    We can rearrange this to find the ratio $a_2 / a_4$:\n    $\\frac{a_2^3}{a_4^3} = \\frac{P_2^2}{P_4^2}$\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_4} \\right)^{2/3}$\n\n*   **Combine the Equations:**\n    Now, substitute the expression for $a_2 / a_4$ into our temperature ratio equation:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left[ \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_4} \\right)^{2/3} \\right]^{1/2} = \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_4} \\right)^{(2/3) \\cdot (1/2)} = \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_4} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\n*   **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    The problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n    So, $P_2$ corresponds to the value 2, and $P_4$ corresponds to the value 3.5.\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \\frac{2}{3.5}$\n\n    Now, we can compute the temperature ratio.\n```python\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is (P2/P4)^(1/3)\n# Given P2 ratio is 2 and P4 ratio is 3.5\ntemp_ratio = (2 / 3.5)**(1/3)\nprint(temp_ratio)\n```\n<<<B>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is proportional to the inverse square root of its semi-major axis ($a$), assuming it orbits the same star and has the same albedo. This relationship can be expressed as:\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 4 to Planet 2 is:\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_4}}$\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the square of a planet's orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis ($a^3$), for planets orbiting the same star:\n$P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\nThis gives us the relationship between the semi-major axes and the periods:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}$\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for the ratio of the semi-major axes back into our temperature ratio equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}} = \\left(\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{2/3}\\right)^{1/2} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{(2/3) \\times (1/2)} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_4}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of orbital periods as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. We can use these ratio values directly for $P_2$ and $P_4$:\n*   $P_2 = 2$\n*   $P_4 = 3.5$\n\nNow, we calculate the temperature ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq4}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3.5}\\right)^{1/3}$\n\nThe python code calculated this value to be approximately 0.8298.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.75\nB) ~0.83\nC) ~0.69\nD) ~0.57\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.83 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
