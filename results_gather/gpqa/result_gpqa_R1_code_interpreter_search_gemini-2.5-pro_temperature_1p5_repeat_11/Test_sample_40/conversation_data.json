    "Here is the reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the observer's frame of reference. The observer is stationary in this frame. The glass block is moving with a constant velocity `v` in this frame.\n    *   **Glass's Rest Frame (S'):** This is the frame of reference in which the glass block is stationary. The laboratory frame (S) is moving with velocity `-v` relative to this frame.\n\n2.  **Determine the Velocity of Light in Each Frame:**\n    *   **In the Glass's Rest Frame (S'):** The problem states that the index of refraction of the glass is `n`. The index of refraction is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`).\n        `n = c / u'`\n        The problem specifies to take `c = 1`. Therefore, the speed of light within the glass, as measured in the frame where the glass is at rest, is:\n        `u' = 1 / n`\n        This velocity `u'` is in the same direction as the motion of the glass.\n\n    *   **In the Laboratory Frame (S):** We want to find the speed of the light beam as observed in the laboratory. Let's call this speed `u`. The glass itself is moving at velocity `v` in this frame.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    Since the speeds are comparable to the speed of light (or at least, we are dealing with a fundamental concept in relativity), we must use the relativistic formula for adding velocities, not the simple Galilean addition (`u = u' + v`).\n\n    The formula for adding velocities in the same direction is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n    Where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in frame S.\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in frame S'.\n    *   `v` is the velocity of frame S' relative to frame S.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula:**\n    We have:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v` (the speed of the glass)\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    Substituting these into the velocity addition formula:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `u = ( 1/n + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n    To clear the fractions in the numerator and denominator, we can multiply both the top and bottom of the main fraction by `n`:\n    `u = n * ( 1/n + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n    `u = ( n*(1/n) + n*v ) / ( n*1 + n*(v/n) )`\n    `u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    The calculated speed of the light beam relative to the observer in the laboratory is `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n    Let's check the options:\n    A) `(1+n*v)/(n+v)`\n    B) `1`\n    C) `(1+n*v)/(n-v)`\n    D) `(1-n*v)/(n+v)`\n\n    Our result matches option A perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>"
