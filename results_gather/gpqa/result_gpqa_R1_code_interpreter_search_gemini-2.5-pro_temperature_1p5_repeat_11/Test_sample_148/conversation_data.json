    "*   **Analysis of the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   The observation of two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton indicates that this proton exists in two different chemical environments.\n    *   Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, the two environments must arise from the presence of two different molecular species.\n    *   The integrals are roughly equal, suggesting these two species are present in an approximately 1:1 ratio.\n    *   The fact that the sum of the integrals equals 1H confirms that both signals originate from the same proton position in the two different species.\n\n*   **Analysis of the LC-MS Data:**\n    *   The LC (Liquid Chromatography) experiment separates compounds based on their physical properties. The presence of two clearly defined peaks confirms that there are two distinct, separable chemical species in the mixture.\n    *   The MS (Mass Spectrometry) data shows that both peaks have the exact same mass spectrum, which matches the expected product. This means the two species are isomers â€“ they have the same molecular formula and molecular weight but different three-dimensional arrangements of atoms.\n    *   The equal intensities of the LC peaks corroborate the 1:1 ratio observed in the NMR spectrum.\n    *   The \"elevated temperature\" condition in LC often helps improve peak shape and resolution, and it confirms that the two species are stable enough to be separated under these conditions and are not rapidly interconverting on the chromatography timescale.\n\n*   **Evaluating the Options:**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent and on a standard (achiral) LC column, enantiomers are indistinguishable. They would produce a single peak in the NMR and a single peak in the LC. This option is inconsistent with the data.\n\n    *   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would almost certainly have a different chemical formula and therefore a different molecular weight. The MS data shows both peaks have the same mass as the final product, ruling out a precursor impurity.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **NMR:** Because they are chemically distinct, they give different NMR spectra. A mixture would show two sets of peaks, which is consistent with the observation of two signals for the alpha-proton.\n        *   **LC:** Because they have different physical properties, they can be separated by standard (achiral) chromatography. This is consistent with observing two peaks in the LC.\n        *   **MS:** As isomers, they have the same molecular formula and therefore the same mass, which is consistent with the MS data.\n        *   **Context:** In peptide synthesis, if one of the chiral amino acid centers epimerizes (e.g., an L-amino acid converts to a D-amino acid) during a coupling step, the resulting peptide will be a diastereomer of the intended product. This is a common side reaction, and if it happens to about half the material, it would lead to a ~1:1 mixture of diastereomers. This scenario perfectly explains all the observations.\n\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This terminology usually refers to repeating a coupling step to drive a reaction to completion. If it were to mean an unwanted second acylation (e.g., on a side chain), the resulting molecule would have a higher mass. This is inconsistent with the MS data showing the expected mass.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of two species that are isomers (same mass), but are separable by standard LC and distinguishable by NMR, points directly to a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<C>>>"
