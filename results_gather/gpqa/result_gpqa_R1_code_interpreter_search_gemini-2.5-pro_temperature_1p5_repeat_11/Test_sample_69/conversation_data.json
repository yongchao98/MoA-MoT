    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 3: The Hydrolysis Reaction**\n    *   `C + H₂O -> A (reformed) + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)`\n    *   This is the most chemically specific clue. The hydrolysis of compound `C` regenerates solid `A` and produces two different acids, one strong and one weak.\n    *   This strongly suggests that `C` is a compound containing element `A` and the components of the two acids. The fact that the acids are different implies gas `B` must contain at least two different non-metal elements that can form acids upon hydrolysis.\n    *   Let's consider pairs of strong/weak acids that can be formed from a single gas `B`:\n        *   **HCl (strong) and HF (weak):** This implies `B` is an interhalogen compound containing chlorine and fluorine. A plausible candidate for a gas `B` is **Chlorine trifluoride (ClF₃)**, which is a gas (boiling point 11.75 °C).\n        *   **HBr (strong) and HF (weak):** This would imply `B` is BrF₅ (a liquid, but could be gas under reaction conditions).\n        *   **HNO₃ (strong) and HNO₂ (weak):** This implies `B` is N₂O₄/NO₂.\n    *   The combination of HCl and HF from a compound containing Cl and F is a classic example in inorganic chemistry. Let's proceed with the hypothesis that **B = ClF₃**, **F = HCl**, and **G = HF**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 1: Formation of C**\n    *   `Solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B -> bright red product C`\n    *   With `B = ClF₃`, the reaction is: `A(s) + 8 ClF₃(g) -> C(bright red)`\n    *   `ClF₃` is an extremely powerful fluorinating and chlorinating agent. We are looking for a reaction where a solid `A` reacts with `ClF₃` to form a \"bright red\" product `C`.\n    *   A known reaction in fluorine chemistry involves gold (Au), which is a solid:\n        `2 Au(s) + 8 ClF₃(g) -> 2 [ClF₂]⁺[AuF₄]⁻(s) + Cl₂(g)`\n    *   Let's check if this fits the clues:\n        *   **A = Au** (Gold, a solid).\n        *   **B = ClF₃** (gas).\n        *   **C = [ClF₂]⁺[AuF₄]⁻** (bis(chlorofluoronium) tetrafluoroaurate(III)). This compound is known to be a **bright red solid**.\n        *   The stoichiometry is 2 moles of `A` to 8 moles of `B`. This fits the clue \"reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B\".\n    *   Now, let's verify if the hydrolysis (Clue 3) works. The salt `C = [ClF₂][AuF₄]` contains Au, Cl, and F. Violent hydrolysis with water is expected to reduce the high-oxidation-state metals and halogens, regenerating the stable element `A` (Au) and forming the hydrogen halides HF and HCl. This is consistent with the clue. So, this set of assignments (A=Au, B=ClF₃, C=[ClF₂][AuF₄]) is highly plausible.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Molecular Structure of C and the Question**\n    *   The compound `C` is an ionic salt: `[ClF₂]⁺[AuF₄]⁻`.\n    *   The cation is **[ClF₂]⁺**. It has a bent structure, similar to OF₂, and its point group is **C₂ᵥ**.\n    *   The anion is **[AuF₄]⁻**. As a d⁸ metal complex, the tetrafluoroaurate(III) ion is square planar, and its point group is **D₄h**.\n    *   The question asks for the molecular symmetry group of `E`. The options provided are A) C₂ᵥ, B) D∞h, C) C₂, and D) D₄h. Notice that the symmetries of the ions that make up compound `C` are among the options.\n\n4.  **Deduce the Identity and Symmetry of E**\n    *   We need to identify `E` from the remaining clues:\n        *   `C + 2 D (gas) -> E (extremely hazardous)`\n        *   `D (gas) + B (gas) -> H (solvent)`\n    *   Finding the exact identities of D, H, and E is challenging and may not be necessary. However, the structure of the puzzle strongly hints that `E` is related to one of the components already identified.\n    *   One common type of reaction for complex salts like `C` is the displacement of the cation or anion. It is conceivable that a reaction `C + 2D -> E` could generate a hazardous product `E` that is essentially a stabilized form of the anion `[AuF₄]⁻`, or a new square-planar gold complex that retains the **D₄h** symmetry. For example, if D were a ligand that could replace the fluorides while maintaining the square planar geometry.\n    *   Alternatively, the most prominent and hazardous molecule with D₄h symmetry that is commonly encountered in chemistry problems is **Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄)**. While constructing a complete reaction pathway to form XeF₄ from our identified A, B, and C is not straightforward, the problem might be designed to point towards a specific symmetrical, hazardous molecule. Given the options, XeF₄ is the best fit for an \"extremely hazardous product\" with D₄h symmetry.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    The most logical and consistent chemical pathway identifies compound `C` as `[ClF₂]⁺[AuF₄]⁻`. The anion of this compound, `[AuF₄]⁻`, has **D₄h** symmetry. The options for the symmetry of product `E` include D₄h. A prominent example of an extremely hazardous molecule with D₄h symmetry is XeF₄. It is highly probable that E is a molecule with D₄h symmetry.\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of E is D₄h.\n\n<<<D>>>"
