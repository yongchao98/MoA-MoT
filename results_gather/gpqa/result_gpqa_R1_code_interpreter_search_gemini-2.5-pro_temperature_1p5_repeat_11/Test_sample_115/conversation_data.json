    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A**\n*   The ¹H NMR spectrum of Compound A shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) and a quartet at 1.3 ppm (4H).\n*   The total number of protons is 6 + 4 = 10.\n*   The integration ratio is 6:4, which simplifies to 3:2.\n*   The splitting pattern of a triplet and a quartet is characteristic of an ethyl group (-CH₂-CH₃), where the CH₃ protons (3H) are split into a triplet by the adjacent 2 CH₂ protons, and the CH₂ protons (2H) are split into a quartet by the adjacent 3 CH₃ protons.\n*   The integration values (6H and 4H) indicate the presence of two equivalent ethyl groups.\n*   A molecule with two equivalent ethyl groups and 10 total hydrogens is n-butane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃).\n    *   The two terminal -CH₃ groups are equivalent (6H). They are adjacent to a -CH₂- group, so their signal is a triplet.\n    *   The two internal -CH₂- groups are equivalent (4H). They are adjacent to a -CH₃ group (3H) and another -CH₂- group (2H). The signal should be a multiplet (sextet), but it is described as a quartet in the problem, which is a common simplification for this type of system in introductory problems.\n*   Therefore, Compound A is n-butane.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound B**\n*   Compound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination. This is a free-radical halogenation.\n*   Bromination is selective and favors the formation of the most stable radical, which corresponds to substituting a hydrogen on the most substituted carbon atom.\n*   n-butane has primary (1°) and secondary (2°) carbons. The secondary carbons are more substituted.\n*   Therefore, the major product is 2-bromobutane.\n*   Compound B is CH₃-CH(Br)-CH₂-CH₃.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Compound C**\n*   Compound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic KOH. This is a dehydrohalogenation reaction (E2 elimination).\n*   According to Zaitsev's rule, the major elimination product is the more substituted (more stable) alkene.\n*   Elimination of HBr from 2-bromobutane can form but-1-ene (monosubstituted alkene) or but-2-ene (disubstituted alkene).\n*   The major product is but-2-ene (CH₃-CH=CH-CH₃).\n*   The problem states that C has two geometrical isomers, which corresponds to cis-but-2-ene and trans-but-2-ene.\n*   Therefore, Compound C is but-2-ene.\n\n**Step 4: The Diels-Alder Reaction**\n*   The reaction is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition.\n*   **Diene**: (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol.\n*   **Dienophile**: The *cis*-isomer of C, which is *cis*-but-2-ene.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product (Compound D)**\nThe Diels-Alder reaction is stereospecific. The stereochemistry of the reactants determines the stereochemistry of the product. The kinetically favored product is the *endo* product.\n\n1.  **Ring Formation**: The reaction forms a six-membered ring, a cyclohexene derivative. The substituents will be an -OH group, and three -CH₃ groups. The name is 4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-ol.\n\n2.  **Relative Stereochemistry**:\n    *   **From the diene**: The diene is (1E,3E). In the required s-cis conformation, both \"outer\" substituents (the -OH on C1 and the -CH₃ on C4) end up on the same face of the newly formed ring. Thus, the C1-OH and the C4-CH₃ are **cis** to each other.\n    *   **From the dienophile**: The dienophile is *cis*-but-2-ene. Its two methyl groups will also end up on the same face of the ring. Thus, the C5-CH₃ and the C6-CH₃ are **cis** to each other.\n    *   **Endo Rule**: For the endo product, the substituents of the dienophile are oriented *trans* to the outer substituents of the diene. Therefore, the pair of methyl groups from the dienophile {C5-Me, C6-Me} is **trans** to the pair of substituents from the diene {C1-OH, C4-Me}.\n\n3.  **Summary of Relative Stereochemistry**:\n    *   The C1-OH and C4-Me are *cis*.\n    *   The C5-Me and C6-Me are *cis*.\n    *   The {OH, C4-Me} pair is *trans* to the {C5-Me, C6-Me} pair.\n\n4.  **Assigning the R/S Configuration**:\n    Let's draw one of the two possible enantiomers that fits this description. Let's place the {C1-OH, C4-Me} pair \"up\" (wedge) and the {C5-Me, C6-Me} pair \"down\" (dash).\n    *   C1 has an OH (wedge).\n    *   C4 has a CH₃ (wedge).\n    *   C5 has a CH₃ (dash).\n    *   C6 has a CH₃ (dash).\n\n    Now we assign the absolute configuration at each chiral center (C1, C4, C5, C6) using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n    *   **At C1**: Priorities are: -OH > -C2=C3 > -C6 > -H. With OH wedge and H dash, the configuration is **S**.\n    *   **At C4**: Priorities are: -C5 > -C3=C2 > -CH₃ > -H. The path through C5 is higher priority than the path through C3 due to greater substitution further along the chain. With CH₃ wedge and H dash, the path C5 -> C3 -> CH₃ is clockwise. The configuration is **R**.\n    *   **At C5**: Priorities are: -C6 > -C4 > -CH₃ > -H. With CH₃ dash and H wedge, the path C6 -> C4 -> CH₃ is clockwise (R), but since H is in front, the configuration is **S**.\n    *   **At C6**: Priorities are: -C1 > -C5 > -CH₃ > -H. With CH₃ dash and H wedge, the path C1 -> C5 -> CH₃ is counter-clockwise (S), but since H is in front, the configuration is **R**.\n\n    The resulting enantiomer is **(1S, 4R, 5S, 6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-ol**. This matches option D. The reaction produces a racemic mixture of this compound and its (1R, 4S, 5R, 6S) enantiomer.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe final product, Compound D, is identified as (1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-ol.\n\n<<<D>>>"
