    "Here is my reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues and Identify the Reactants and Products**\n\n1.  **\"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements...\"**: This tells us Substance X is a deuterated or otherwise isotopically labeled compound. The heavier isotope is likely Deuterium (D or ²H), which is the most common heavy isotope used in chemical synthesis.\n\n2.  **\"...reacts violently with liquid Y...\"**: This suggests a very energetic reaction, typical of highly reactive species like alkali metals or powerful hydrides with a protic solvent like water.\n\n3.  **\"...with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons...\"**: Let's analyze potential simple gas molecules:\n    *   H₂ (Hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (p ≠ n)\n    *   HD (Hydrogen Deuteride): 2 protons, 1 neutron. (p ≠ n)\n    *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): 2 protons (1 per D), 2 neutrons (1 per D). **(p = n)**. This is a perfect match. So, **W = D₂**.\n    *   C₂H₂ (Acetylene): 8 protons, 6 neutrons. (p ≠ n)\n    *   C₂D₂ (Deuterated Acetylene): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. **(p = n)**. This is another possibility.\n\n4.  **\"...a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"**:\n    *   277 K is approximately 4°C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0°C). The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82°C).\n    *   The value 277 K is a clear indicator that **B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n    *   Since precipitate G releases D₂O upon heating, G must be a deuterated hydroxide or a hydrate containing D₂O. For example, a metal deuteroxide: `M(OD)n --(heat)--> MxOy + D₂O`.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Chemical Reaction and Identify Substance X**\n\n*   We know the reaction produces D₂ gas (W) and a precipitate (G) which can be heated to form D₂O (B).\n*   Let's synthesize these facts:\n    `Substance X + Liquid Y → D₂(g) + G(s)`\n    `G(s) --(heat)--> ... + D₂O(l)`\n*   For D₂ gas to be a product, the reactants must provide the deuterium. Since X contains the heavy isotope, it's the source of 'D'. Since G yields D₂O, Liquid Y must also be a source of 'D' and 'O'. This makes **Liquid Y = D₂O**.\n*   Now the reaction is: `X + D₂O → D₂(g) + G(s)`.\n*   This means X reacts with D₂O to liberate D₂. This happens when X is a source of a reduced species that can be oxidized by D₂O's deuterium (D⁺). Hydride (H⁻) is a perfect candidate. So X is likely a metal hydride. Since X contains deuterium, it must be a metal **deuteride**.\n*   Let's consider common deuteride reagents used in organic chemistry, as hinted by the last clues. The most powerful and common are Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄) and Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄).\n*   **Let's test X = LiAlD₄**.\n    *   **Clue: \"...and its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\"**: The analog is LiAlH₄, a ubiquitous reducing agent. This fits perfectly.\n    *   **Reaction with D₂O**: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃(s) + 4D₂(g)`.\n        *   Reacts violently? Yes.\n        *   Releases D₂ gas (W)? Yes.\n        *   Forms a precipitate G? Yes, Aluminum deuteroxide, **G = Al(OD)₃**, would precipitate.\n        *   Heating G releases B (D₂O)? `2Al(OD)₃ --(heat)--> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. Yes. This fits all the clues.\n    *   **Clue: \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"**: A keto acid (e.g., R-CO-COOH) has 3 oxygen atoms. LiAlD₄ is a powerful reducing agent that would reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid to alcohols, yielding a diol (e.g., R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)), which has **2 oxygen atoms**. This clue is satisfied.\n\n*   All evidence strongly points to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**Step 3: Perform the Calculation**\n\n*   The question asks to \"Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X... if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all... must be summed.\"\n*   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n*   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n*   We use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved: Li is mostly ⁷Li, Al is ¹⁰⁰% ²⁷Al, and the hydrogen is specified as the heavier isotope D (²H).\n    *   Mass Number (Li) = 7\n    *   Mass Number (Al) = 27\n    *   Mass Number (D) = 2\n*   **Identify the lightest and heaviest elements**:\n    *   Lightest element: Hydrogen (H)\n    *   Heaviest element: Aluminum (Al)\n*   **Calculate the total mass from each of these elements in the formula LiAlD₄**:\n    *   Mass from heaviest element (Al): There is one atom of Aluminum. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Mass from lightest element (H): There are four atoms of Hydrogen, all in the form of Deuterium (D). Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n*   **Calculate the cumulative (summed) mass**:\n    *   Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from Al) + (Total mass from H/D)\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
