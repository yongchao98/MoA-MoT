    "*   **Analysis of the first reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   **Reactant:** butan-2-one is a ketone (CH₃-CO-CH₂-CH₃).\n    *   **Product:** 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile is a cyanohydrin (CH₃-C(OH)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a nucleophilic addition reaction known as cyanohydrin formation.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The reaction involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate.\n        `CH₃-CO-CH₂-CH₃ + CN⁻  ⇌  CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃`\n    *   **Role of Reagent A:** The alkoxide intermediate must be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group. This requires a proton source (an acid).\n        `CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃ + H⁺  →  CH₃-C(OH)(CN)-CH₂-CH₃`\n    *   The reaction is typically carried out in a slightly acidic medium. Using NaCN with a strong acid (represented by H₃O⁺) will generate HCN in situ, which then reacts with the ketone. Alternatively, the acid is added in a subsequent step (workup) to protonate the intermediate. In either case, an acid is required.\n    *   **Evaluating options for A:**\n        *   `H₃O⁺`: Represents a strong acid source (e.g., HCl, H₂SO₄), which provides the necessary protons for the reaction. This is a suitable choice.\n        *   `NaHSO₃`: Sodium bisulfite reacts with ketones to form bisulfite addition products, which is a different reaction. It is not used for cyanohydrin formation.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A must be an acid, represented by H₃O⁺. This eliminates options A and C.\n\n*   **Analysis of the second reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   **Reactant:** A cyanohydrin (a type of nitrile, R-CN).\n    *   **Product:** An α-hydroxy carboxylic acid (R-COOH).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Mechanism:** Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either strong acid or strong base. The problem specifies the addition of reagent B and water (H₂O).\n        *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** `R-CN + 2 H₂O + H₃O⁺ --(heat)--> R-COOH + NH₄⁺`\n        *   This reaction requires a strong acid catalyst to protonate the nitrile nitrogen, making the carbon more susceptible to attack by water.\n    *   **Evaluating options for B:**\n        *   `HCl`: Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid and is a very common reagent for nitrile hydrolysis. This is a suitable choice.\n        *   `CH₃COOH`: Acetic acid is a weak acid. It is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a stable nitrile to a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Reagent B must be a strong acid, like HCl. This eliminates option B.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, reagent A is H₃O⁺ and reagent B is HCl.\n    *   This combination matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
