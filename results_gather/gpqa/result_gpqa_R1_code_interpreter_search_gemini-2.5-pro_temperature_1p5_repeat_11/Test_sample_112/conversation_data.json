    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound's chemical formula:\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Spectroscopy Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic signal for an O-H stretching vibration. The significant broadness is caused by hydrogen bonding, which is a hallmark of carboxylic acids (-COOH). While alcohols also have O-H peaks, they are typically less broad than those of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. The specific position is consistent with the carbonyl group of a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n*Conclusion from FTIR:* The data strongly suggests the compound is a carboxylic acid that also contains an alkene group. A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n**2. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectroscopy Data**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbon atoms of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the NMR spectrum definitively confirms the existence of an alkene group, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n**3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a classic and diagnostic fragmentation pattern for carboxylic acids. The fragment with a mass-to-charge ratio of 45 corresponds to the carboxyl group itself, [COOH]⁺.\n    *   Mass of C = 12\n    *   Mass of O = 16 (x2) = 32\n    *   Mass of H = 1\n    *   Total mass = 12 + 32 + 1 = 45\n\n*Conclusion from MS:* This provides very strong evidence that the molecule contains a -COOH functional group.\n\n**4. Synthesizing the Information and Evaluating the Options**\n\n*   From the combined data, we know the molecule must contain:\n    1.  A carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which means it has **two oxygen atoms**.\n    2.  An alkene group (C=C).\n\n*   This immediately eliminates options A (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O) because they only have one oxygen atom. We are left with B (C6H10O2) and C (C6H12O2).\n\n*   To differentiate between B and C, we can calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` (for molecules containing only C, H, and O).\n    *   Our molecule has a C=O bond (in the acid) and a C=C bond (in the alkene). This means it must have a total of **two degrees of unsaturation**.\n\nLet's use a Python script to calculate the DoU for the remaining options.\n```python\ndef calculate_dou(formula):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Degree of Unsaturation for a chemical formula C_x H_y O_z.\"\"\"\n    import re\n    \n    parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z][a-z]*)(\\d*)', formula)\n    \n    atom_counts = {'C': 0, 'H': 0, 'O': 0}\n    for element, count in parts:\n        if element in atom_counts:\n            atom_counts[element] = int(count) if count else 1\n\n    C = atom_counts.get('C', 0)\n    H = atom_counts.get('H', 0)\n    \n    # DoU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1. For CHO compounds, N=0.\n    # So, DoU = C - H/2 + 1\n    if C == 0:\n        return 0\n    \n    dou = C - (H / 2) + 1\n    return int(dou)\n\n# Candidate formulas\nformula_B = \"C6H10O2\"\nformula_C = \"C6H12O2\"\n\n# Calculate DoU\ndou_B = calculate_dou(formula_B)\ndou_C = calculate_dou(formula_C)\n\nprint(f\"The Degree of Unsaturation for {formula_B} is: {dou_B}\")\nprint(f\"The Degree of Unsaturation for {formula_C} is: {dou_C}\")\n```\n**Execution Output:**\n```\nThe Degree of Unsaturation for C6H10O2 is: 2\nThe Degree of Unsaturation for C6H12O2 is: 1\n```\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Our analysis of the spectral data concluded that the unknown molecule must have **two degrees of unsaturation**: one for the C=O bond and one for the C=C bond.\n*   The calculation shows that **C6H10O2** has a DoU of 2.\n*   The calculation shows that **C6H12O2** has a DoU of 1. This would only account for the C=O bond of a carboxylic acid, meaning it would be a saturated carboxylic acid (like hexanoic acid), which contradicts the FTIR and NMR data showing a C=C bond.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical formula that fits all the provided spectroscopic evidence is **C6H10O2**.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "**Summary of Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **FTIR Analysis**: The broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹, combined with the strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). The peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C, an alkene).\n2.  **1H NMR Analysis**: The observation of vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of the C=C double bond suggested by the FTIR data.\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry Analysis**: The fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic signature for the carboxyl fragment [COOH]⁺, providing very strong evidence that the compound is a carboxylic acid.\n4.  **Putting It Together**: The evidence points to an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n    *   The presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This eliminates options A (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O).\n    *   We are left with B (C6H10O2) and C (C6H12O2). The difference lies in the degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The molecule contains a C=O double bond (from the acid) and a C=C double bond (from the alkene). This means it has **two degrees of unsaturation**.\n5.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) Calculation**: The Python script calculated the DoU for the remaining options based on the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n    *   **C6H10O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This matches our requirement.\n    *   **C6H12O2**: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This does not account for the C=C double bond.\n\n**Conclusion**: The only formula that has two oxygen atoms and two degrees of unsaturation is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
