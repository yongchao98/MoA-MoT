    "*   **Analysis of the Options:**\n    *   **A) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** This is the quantum field theory (QFT) describing the strong nuclear force. Like most QFTs, when calculating physical quantities using perturbation theory (via Feynman diagrams), one encounters loop integrals that diverge at high energies (ultraviolet divergences). These divergences must be handled by a procedure called regularization, followed by renormalization. Therefore, QCD requires regularization.\n    *   **B) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the QFT describing the electromagnetic force. It was the first QFT where the problem of infinities in calculations was seriously encountered and solved. Calculations involving loop diagrams in QED lead to ultraviolet divergences, which necessitate regularization and renormalization. Therefore, QED requires regularization.\n    *   **C) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory is described by Maxwell's equations. While not a quantum field theory, it has its own divergence problem at high energies/short distances. For instance, the self-energy of a classical point-like electron is infinite. To make this finite, one must introduce a cutoff, effectively giving the electron a finite size, which is a form of regularization. Thus, classical electrodynamics also encounters divergences that need to be regularized.\n    *   **D) Superstring Theory:** Superstring theory is a candidate for a quantum theory of gravity and a unified theory of all forces. One of its most celebrated features is that it is believed to be free of ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences. Unlike point particles in QFTs, the fundamental objects in string theory are extended, one-dimensional strings. The interactions between strings are \"smeared out\" in spacetime, which smooths the short-distance behavior that causes divergences in QFTs. Calculations of scattering amplitudes in superstring theory are expected to yield finite results without the need for regularization.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Among the given options, Superstring Theory is the only one that is conjectured to be UV-finite and thus does not require regularization at high energies. The other three theories all suffer from high-energy divergences that must be treated with regularization.\n\n<<<D>>>"
