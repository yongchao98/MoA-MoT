    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n**1. Determine the structure and molecular formula of the reactant.**\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n\n*   **Parent structure:** `cyclohex-3-ene`. This is a six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **Principal functional group:** `-carboxylic acid`. The suffix `-carboxylic acid` indicates a -COOH group is attached to the parent ring. The ring carbon it's attached to is designated as C1. The carbon of the COOH group is not part of the ring numbering.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   `2-formyl`: A -CHO group is attached to C2 of the ring.\n    *   `5-vinyl`: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is attached to C5 of the ring.\n\nLet's determine the molecular formula by counting the atoms in this structure:\n\n*   **Carbon (C):**\n    *   6 carbons in the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   1 carbon in the -COOH group.\n    *   1 carbon in the -CHO group.\n    *   2 carbons in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2).\n    *   Total Carbons = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **10**.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   We need to count the hydrogens on each carbon of the ring, considering their bonds to other carbons and substituents.\n    *   C1: Bonded to C2, C6, and -COOH. So, 1 H on C1.\n    *   C2: Bonded to C1, C3, and -CHO. So, 1 H on C2.\n    *   C3: Bonded to C2 and has a double bond to C4. So, 1 H on C3.\n    *   C4: Bonded to C5 and has a double bond to C3. So, 1 H on C4.\n    *   C5: Bonded to C4, C6, and the vinyl group. So, 1 H on C5.\n    *   C6: Bonded to C1 and C5. So, 2 H on C6.\n    *   Hydrogens on the ring = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 7 H.\n    *   Hydrogens on the substituents: 1 H in -COOH, 1 H in -CHO, and 3 H in -CH=CH2. Total = 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 H.\n    *   Total Hydrogens = 7 (ring) + 5 (substituents) = **12**.\n\n*   **Oxygen (O):**\n    *   2 oxygens in the -COOH group.\n    *   1 oxygen in the -CHO group.\n    *   Total Oxygens = 2 + 1 = **3**.\n\nThe molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\nWe can verify this by calculating the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the reactant structure:\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of pi bonds)\nIHD = (1 ring) + (1 C=C in ring) + (1 C=C in vinyl) + (1 C=O in formyl) + (1 C=O in carboxylic acid) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\nUsing the formula: IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 - X/2 + 1 = 10 - 12/2 + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5. This confirms the molecular formula is correct.\n\n**2. Identify the reaction and the product.**\n\nThe reagent is **red phosphorus and excess of HI (Red P/HI)**. This is a very powerful reducing agent. It reduces almost all oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturations (double/triple bonds) to their corresponding saturated alkanes.\n\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   The carbon-carbon double bond in the ring (-C=C-) is reduced to a single bond (-CH-CH-).\n*   The carbon-carbon double bond in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2-CH3).\n\nThe overall transformation converts the starting molecule into a saturated, substituted cycloalkane. The carbon skeleton remains the same (10 carbons). The product is **5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane**.\n\n**3. Determine the molecular formula of the product.**\n\nThe product is a saturated hydrocarbon containing one ring. The general formula for such a compound is **CnH2n**.\nSince there are 10 carbon atoms, the molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the product.**\n\nThe IHD can be calculated in two ways:\n\n*   **From the structure:** The IHD is the sum of the number of rings and pi bonds. The product, a substituted cyclohexane, has:\n    *   Number of rings = 1\n    *   Number of pi bonds = 0\n    *   IHD = 1 + 0 = **1**.\n\n*   **From the molecular formula (C10H20):**\n    *   IHD = C - H/2 + 1\n    *   IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\n    *   IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n    *   IHD = **1**.\n\nBoth methods give an IHD of 1 for the final product.\n\n<<<A>>>"
