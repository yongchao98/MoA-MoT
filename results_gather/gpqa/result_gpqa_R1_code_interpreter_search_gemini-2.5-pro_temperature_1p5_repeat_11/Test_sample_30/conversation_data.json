    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the molecular symmetry group of product 3.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Toluene is treated with nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically nitration. The methyl group (-CH3) on toluene is an ortho-, para-director and an activating group. The reaction yields a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. Due to steric hindrance, the para-isomer is typically the major product. We will assume the reaction proceeds to form the major product.\n*   **Product 1:** p-Nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene).\n\n     ![p-Nitrotoluene structure](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/4-Nitrotoluol.svg/150px-4-Nitrotoluol.svg.png) \n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO2) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** MnO2 in an acidic medium is a strong oxidizing agent. It will oxidize the alkyl side chain of the aromatic ring. The methyl group (-CH3) will be oxidized to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The nitro group (-NO2) is stable under these oxidizing conditions.\n*   **Product 2:** p-Nitrobenzoic acid (4-nitrobenzoic acid).\n\n     ![p-Nitrobenzoic acid structure](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/4-Nitrobenzoic_acid.svg/150px-4-Nitrobenzoic_acid.svg.png) \n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (p-nitrobenzoic acid) is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction is more complex. Let's analyze the components:\n    *   p-Nitrobenzoic acid is an acid.\n    *   Sodium hydroxide is a strong base.\n    *   Acetone is a ketone with α-hydrogens.\n*   The first step is a simple acid-base reaction: p-nitrobenzoic acid reacts with NaOH to form sodium p-nitrobenzoate and water.\n*   Next, the remaining NaOH acts as a base to deprotonate acetone, forming its enolate ion (a nucleophile/carbanion).\n*   Nitroaromatic compounds can undergo several reactions in the presence of a base and a carbanion source.\n    *   **Possibility (a) Meisenheimer complex formation:** The acetone enolate could attack the electron-deficient aromatic ring (activated by the -NO2 group) to form a σ-complex. This attack would occur ortho to the nitro group. The resulting structure would be highly asymmetric, possessing only the identity element (E), which corresponds to the C1 point group. This is not among the options, so this is likely not the intended product.\n    *   **Possibility (b) Reductive dimerization:** It is a known reaction that nitroaromatic compounds can be reduced in basic conditions to form azoxy, azo, or hydrazo compounds. The acetone/enolate can act as the reducing agent, itself being oxidized. This reaction would involve two molecules of p-nitrobenzoate coupling together. The most likely product under these conditions is the stable azo compound.\n        2 Ar-NO2 + reducing agent -> Ar-N=N-Ar + oxidized products\n*   Let Ar be the p-carboxylatophenyl group [-C6H4-COO-]. The dimerization leads to 4,4'-azodibenzoate. The N=N double bond can exist in cis and trans configurations. The trans isomer is thermodynamically much more stable and is the expected product.\n*   **Product 3:** trans-4,4'-Azodibenzoic acid (or its disodium salt, trans-4,4'-azodibenzoate).\n\n     ![trans-4,4'-Azodibenzoic acid structure](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/4%2C4%27-Azodibenzoic_acid.png/300px-4%2C4%27-Azodibenzoic_acid.png) \n\n**Step 4: Determine the molecular symmetry group of Product 3**\n\n*   **Molecule:** trans-4,4'-azodibenzoic acid.\n*   **Analysis of symmetry elements:** We consider the molecule in its most stable, planar conformation.\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules have this element.\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule is centrosymmetric. The center of the N=N bond acts as a center of inversion. Inverting any atom through this point results in an identical atom at the corresponding position.\n    *   **Proper Axis of Rotation (Cn):** There is a C2 axis that passes through the center of inversion and is perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. A 180° rotation about this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** There is a horizontal plane of symmetry (σh) that is coincident with the plane of the molecule itself (assuming the COOH groups are coplanar).\n*   **Point Group Assignment:** A molecule that possesses a C2 axis, a horizontal plane of symmetry (σh), and a center of inversion (i) belongs to the **C2h** point group.\n\nFinal check of options:\nA) D2h: Requires more symmetry elements (e.g., three perpendicular C2 axes), which are not present.\nB) C3: Requires a 3-fold rotation axis, which is not present.\nC) C2h: Matches our analysis.\nD) Cs: Requires a single plane of symmetry but no C2 axis or center of inversion (this would fit the cis-isomer, but the trans is the major product).\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of Product 3 is C2h.\n\n<<<C>>>"
