    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle.\n\n### **1. Understand the Potential**\n\nThe potential energy of the particle is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)\n\nTo solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation, it is often advantageous to work in a coordinate system where the potential energy function separates into a sum of functions of each coordinate. Let's convert the potential into Cartesian coordinates (x, y).\n\n### **2. Convert to Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nThe transformation from polar to Cartesian coordinates is given by:\nx = r cos(θ)\ny = r sin(θ)\nr^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\nNow, substitute these into the potential energy expression:\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 k (r^2) + 3/2 k (r cos(θ))^2\n\nSubstitute the Cartesian equivalents:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k (x)^2\n\nNow, simplify the expression by combining like terms:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2 + 3/2 kx^2\nV(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2) kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\nV(x, y) = (4/2) kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\nV(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2\n\n### **3. Identify the System**\n\nThe potential V(x, y) has the form:\nV(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\nwhere V_x(x) = 2kx^2 and V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2.\n\nThis is the potential for a **two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator**. The motion in the x-direction is independent of the motion in the y-direction.\n\nThe standard form for a harmonic oscillator potential is 1/2 mω^2 x^2. We can compare our terms to this standard form to find the angular frequencies (ω_x and ω_y) for the oscillations in each direction.\n\n### **4. Determine the Angular Frequencies**\n\n*   **For the x-direction:**\n    V_x(x) = 1/2 mω_x^2 x^2 = 2kx^2\n    mω_x^2 = 4k\n    ω_x^2 = 4k/m\n    ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)\n\n*   **For the y-direction:**\n    V_y(y) = 1/2 mω_y^2 y^2 = 1/2 ky^2\n    mω_y^2 = k\n    ω_y^2 = k/m\n    ω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\n### **5. Find the Energy Spectrum**\n\nSince the system is a separable 2D harmonic oscillator, the total energy E is the sum of the energies of the two independent 1D harmonic oscillators:\nE = E_x + E_y\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator with frequency ω and quantum number n are given by:\nE_n = (n + 1/2)ℏω, where n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\nApplying this to our system:\n*   Energy in the x-direction (with quantum number n_x):\n    E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ℏω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ℏ * (2 * sqrt(k/m))\n\n*   Energy in the y-direction (with quantum number n_y):\n    E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ℏω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nThe total energy E is the sum:\nE = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}\nE = (n_x + 1/2)ℏ * (2 * sqrt(k/m)) + (n_y + 1/2)ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nNow, let's factor out the common term ℏ * sqrt(k/m):\nE = [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n### **6. Conclusion**\n\nThe energy spectrum for the particle is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ℏ * sqrt(k/m). Comparing this with the given options, it matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
