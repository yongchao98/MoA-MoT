    "This problem requires us to calculate the percentage of a specific cobalt complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) or `[Co(SCN)2]`, in a solution.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the species:**\n    The solution contains a central metal ion, Co(II), and a ligand, thiocyanate (SCN-). They form a series of complexes. The total concentration of all cobalt-containing species is denoted by `c(Co)`. The species present are:\n    - Free Co(II) ion: `Co^2+`\n    - Monothiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)]+`\n    - Dithiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)2]`\n    - Trithiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)3]-`\n    - Tetrathiocyanato cobalt(II): `[Co(SCN)4]2-`\n\n2.  **Formulate the mass balance equation:**\n    The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]+ + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]- + [Co(SCN)4]2-`\n\n3.  **Use the stability constants:**\n    The overall stability constants (`βn`) relate the concentration of each complex to the concentration of the free metal ion (`[Co^2+]`) and the free ligand (`[SCN-]`).\n    - `[Co(SCN)]+ = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n    - `[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n    - `[Co(SCN)3]- = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n    - `[Co(SCN)4]2- = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n4.  **Express `c(Co)` in terms of `[Co^2+]` and `[SCN-]`:**\n    Substitute the expressions from step 3 into the mass balance equation from step 2:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + β1[Co^2+][SCN-] + β2[Co^2+][SCN-]^2 + β3[Co^2+][SCN-]^3 + β4[Co^2+][SCN-]^4`\n    Factor out `[Co^2+]`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the mole fraction of `[Co(SCN)2]`:**\n    The mole fraction (`α2`) of the dithiocyanato complex is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration:\n    `α2 = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)`\n\n    Substitute the expressions for `[Co(SCN)2]` and `c(Co)`:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4))`\n\n    The `[Co^2+]` term cancels out:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`\n\n6.  **Substitute the given values and calculate:**\n    The problem provides:\n    - `[SCN-] = 0.1 M`. The use of square brackets `[]` conventionally denotes the equilibrium concentration of the free ligand. The total cobalt concentration `c(Co) = 10^-2 M` is not needed for this calculation as the mole fraction is independent of it.\n    - `β1 = 9`\n    - `β2 = 40`\n    - `β3 = 63`\n    - `β4 = 16`\n\n    Let's calculate the terms for the denominator sum (let's call the sum `D`):\n    - `Term 0: 1`\n    - `Term 1: β1 * [SCN-]^1 = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n    - `Term 2: β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    - `Term 3: β3 * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n    - `Term 4: β4 * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\n    `D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n    The numerator is `Term 2`, which is `0.4`.\n\n    Now, calculate `α2`:\n    `α2 = 0.4 / 2.3646`\n\n    To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100.\n\nI will use a short Python script to perform the calculation accurately.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the denominator of the fraction formula\n# The denominator is S = 1 + beta1*[SCN] + beta2*[SCN]^2 + beta3*[SCN]^3 + beta4*[SCN]^4\ndenominator = 1 + \\\n              beta1 * (scn_conc**1) + \\\n              beta2 * (scn_conc**2) + \\\n              beta3 * (scn_conc**3) + \\\n              beta4 * (scn_conc**4)\n\n# Calculate the numerator for the species [Co(SCN)2]\n# The numerator is N = beta2 * [SCN]^2\nnumerator = beta2 * (scn_conc**2)\n\n# Calculate the mole fraction (alpha2) of [Co(SCN)2]\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Calculate the percentage\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage=}\")\n```\n\n<<<answer content>>>\nA",
    "The calculation shows that the mole fraction `α2` is approximately `0.169`, which corresponds to a percentage of `16.9%`.\n\nFinal check of the steps:\n1.  **Species:** Co^2+, [Co(SCN)]+, [Co(SCN)2], [Co(SCN)3]-, [Co(SCN)4]2-. Correct.\n2.  **Mass Balance:** `c(Co) = Σ[Co(SCN)n^(2-n)]` for n=0 to 4. Correct.\n3.  **Stability Constants:** `[Co(SCN)n^(2-n)] = βn * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^n`. Correct.\n4.  **Mole Fraction Formula:** `αn = (βn * [SCN-]^n) / (Σ βi * [SCN-]^i)` for i=0 to 4 (with `β0=1`). The formula for `α2` is `(β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1[SCN-] + β2[SCN-]^2 + β3[SCN-]^3 + β4[SCN-]^4)`. Correct.\n5.  **Values:** `[SCN-] = 0.1`, `β1=9`, `β2=40`, `β3=63`, `β4=16`. Correct.\n6.  **Calculation:**\n    - Numerator: `40 * (0.1)^2 = 0.4`\n    - Denominator: `1 + 9*(0.1) + 40*(0.1)^2 + 63*(0.1)^3 + 16*(0.1)^4`\n    - Denominator: `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n    - `α2 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n    - Percentage = `16.916%`\n\nThe calculation is correct. The closest answer choice is 16.9%.\n\n<<<A>>>"
