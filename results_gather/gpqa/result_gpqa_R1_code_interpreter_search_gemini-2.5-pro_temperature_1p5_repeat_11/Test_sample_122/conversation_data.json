    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. We need to calculate the distance traveled by the supernova ejecta as measured by an observer in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n### 1. Identify the Frames of Reference\n*   **Galaxy's Frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame of reference from which we want to measure the distance.\n*   **Ejecta's Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame of reference. The time measured in this frame is the proper time (Δt₀).\n\n### 2. List the Given Information\n*   **Relative velocity (v):** The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   **Proper time (Δt₀):** The time that passes in the ejecta's reference frame is `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n*   **Speed of light (c):** We'll use the standard approximation `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n### 3. Determine the Goal\n*   We need to find the distance (d) traveled by the ejecta as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S).\n\n### 4. The Physics Principles\nThe distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame is calculated as the velocity `v` multiplied by the time `Δt` that has passed in the Galaxy's frame.\n`d = v * Δt`\n\nHowever, we are given the time passed in the ejecta's frame (the proper time, `Δt₀`), not the Galaxy's frame. Due to time dilation, an observer in the stationary frame (Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) than the observer in the moving frame (`Δt₀`).\n\nThe relationship between the two times is given by the time dilation formula:\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n\nwhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n### 5. Step-by-Step Calculation\nFirst, we'll calculate the Lorentz factor `γ`.\n\n*   **Calculate the ratio v/c:**\n    `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\n*   **Calculate (v/c)²:**\n    `(v/c)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n\n*   **Calculate γ:**\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\nNow, we can find the time `Δt` that has passed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n*   **Calculate Δt:**\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\nFinally, we calculate the distance `d` traveled in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n*   **Calculate d:**\n    `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n    `d = (60,000 * 50) / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\nTo get the final numerical value, we can use a python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000      # velocity in km/s\nc = 300000      # speed of light in km/s\ndelta_t0 = 50   # proper time in s\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta_sq = (v/c)**2\n\n# Calculate gamma (Lorentz factor)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta_sq)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame\ndelta_t = gamma * delta_t0\n\n# Calculate the distance in the Galaxy's frame\ndistance = v * delta_t\n\nprint(distance)\n```\n>>>\n3061862.1784783683\n>>>\nThe calculated distance is approximately `3,061,862 km`. Comparing this value to the given options:\n\nA) 2,940,000 km\nB) 2,880,000 km\nC) 3,000,000 km\nD) 3,060,000 km\n\nThe calculated result is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "Here is a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify Knowns:**\n    *   Relative velocity of the ejecta (v) = 60,000 km/s\n    *   Time passed in the ejecta's frame (proper time, Δt₀) = 50 s\n    *   Speed of light (c) ≈ 300,000 km/s\n\n2.  **Identify Unknown:**\n    *   Distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame (d).\n\n3.  **Relate Distance, Velocity, and Time:**\n    The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is given by the formula `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured by an observer in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n4.  **Apply the Principle of Time Dilation:**\n    According to Einstein's theory of special relativity, time for a moving object (the ejecta) passes slower than for a stationary observer (in the Galaxy). This effect is called time dilation. The time `Δt` in the stationary frame is related to the proper time `Δt₀` in the moving frame by the Lorentz factor (γ):\n\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n\n    The Lorentz factor is calculated as:\n\n    `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   First, find the ratio of the ejecta's velocity to the speed of light, squared:\n        `(v/c)² = (60,000 / 300,000)² = (0.2)² = 0.04`\n    *   Now, calculate γ:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.02062`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s ≈ 51.031 s`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\n    *   Now use the distance formula with the dilated time:\n        `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated distance, approximately 3,061,862 km, is closest to option D. The small difference is due to rounding of intermediate values. The python code provided a more precise result of `3061862.17...` km, which also strongly supports option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
