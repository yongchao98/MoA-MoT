    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with a six-carbon chain.\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   There is a chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), and its configuration is specified as (S). The molecule is chiral.\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n    *   LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at C3 is reduced to a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The carbonyl carbon (C3) is sp² hybridized and planar. The hydride ion (H⁻) from LAH can attack from either face (re or si face) of the carbonyl plane.\n    *   This attack creates a new chiral center at C3. Since the starting material is chiral and the reagent (LAH) is achiral, the attack is not stereospecific. It will lead to the formation of both possible configurations at C3, which are (R) and (S).\n    *   The original chiral center at C5 is not involved in the reaction and its (S) configuration remains unchanged.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:**\n    *   The products are stereoisomers of 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   Since the configuration at C5 is fixed as (S) and the new center at C3 can be (R) or (S), two products are formed:\n        1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n        2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   These two molecules are diastereomers because they have two chiral centers, with one center being the same and the other being opposite.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone).\n    *   The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃.\n    *   This molecule is achiral; it has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup.\n    *   NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that also reduces ketones to alcohols. \"Excess\" indicates that both ketone groups will be reduced.\n*   **Reaction:** Both carbonyl groups at C2 and C4 are reduced to hydroxyl groups.\n    *   The product is pentane-2,4-diol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n    *   New chiral centers are created at C2 and C4.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:**\n    *   We need to consider all possible stereoisomers: (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   The molecule has a symmetrical structure. The (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) isomers are identical and represent a single achiral compound called a meso compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n    *   The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, meaning they are a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   The reduction of an achiral starting material with an achiral reagent produces a racemic mixture (equal amounts of both enantiomers) if the product is chiral. It will also produce any possible meso compounds.\n    *   So, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers:\n        1.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol [(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol]\n        2.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        3.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n        (where the latter two form a racemic mixture).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with HPLC**\n\nThe final mixture contains all the products from both reactions, for a total of 2 + 3 = 5 different stereoisomers.\n\n*   **From Reaction I:**\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Diastereomer 1)\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Diastereomer 2)\n*   **From Reaction II:**\n    *   meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Meso compound)\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer +)\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Enantiomer -)\n\n**Number of Peaks in Normal-Phase HPLC:**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC is an **achiral** separation technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** (like the pair from Reaction II) have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be separated by normal-phase HPLC and will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** (like the pair from Reaction I) have different physical properties and can be separated by normal-phase HPLC, showing up as distinct peaks.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. It will have different physical properties and will be separated from them.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are structurally very different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) and will have different polarities. Thus, they will be separated from the diols.\n*   Let's count the number of species that can be separated:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 1)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 2, diastereomer of 1, so it separates)\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3)\n    4.  The racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4, enantiomers co-elute; this species is a diastereomer of Peak 3, so it separates)\n*   Assuming no accidental co-elution between these four chemically distinct species, the normal-phase HPLC will show **4 peaks**.\n\n**Number of Peaks in Chiral HPLC:**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of **enantiomers** in addition to diastereomers.\n*   It will resolve all stereoisomers in the mixture that have different interactions with the chiral stationary phase.\n*   Let's count the number of distinct stereoisomers in the mixture:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 1)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 2, diastereomer)\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3, achiral compound, gives one peak)\n    4.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4)\n    5.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 5, enantiomer of 4, separates on chiral column)\n*   All five of these stereoisomers are chemically unique and will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase. Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis predicts 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram and 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
