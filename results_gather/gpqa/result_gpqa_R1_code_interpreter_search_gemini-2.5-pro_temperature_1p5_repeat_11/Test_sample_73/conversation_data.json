    "This problem involves the physics of radioactive decay, which is mathematically described by an exponential distribution. A key feature of this distribution is its \"memoryless\" property.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Model the Decay Process:**\n    The probability that an atomic nucleus survives (does not decay) for a time `t` is given by the exponential survival function:\n    P(survival, t) = e^(-λt)\n    where λ is the decay constant, a characteristic of the specific atom.\n\n    Consequently, the probability of decay within a time `t` is:\n    P(decay, t) = 1 - P(survival, t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n2.  **Determine the Decay Constant (λ):**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this information to find λ.\n    P(decay, 100) = 0.32\n    1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n    e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32\n    e^(-100λ) = 0.68\n\n    We can solve for λ by taking the natural logarithm, but it's often easier to work with the `e^(-100λ)` term directly.\n\n3.  **Frame the Question:**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, *given* that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n    In probability notation, this is a conditional probability:\n    P(decay between t=50 and t=200 | survived until t=50)\n\n4.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:**\n    The exponential decay process is \"memoryless.\" This means the probability of a future event does not depend on past events. In this context, the atom doesn't \"age.\" The fact that it has survived for 50 minutes does not change its intrinsic probability of decaying in any future time interval.\n\n    Therefore, the probability of it decaying in the *next* 150 minutes is the same as the probability of a brand-new atom of the same type decaying within 150 minutes.\n\n    So, the problem simplifies to calculating:\n    P(decay, 150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Probability:**\n    We need to calculate `1 - e^(-150λ)` using the information we found in Step 2 (`e^(-100λ) = 0.68`).\n\n    We can rewrite `e^(-150λ)` as:\n    e^(-150λ) = e^(-1.5 * 100λ) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5\n\n    Now, substitute the known value:\n    (0.68)^1.5\n\n    Let's use a small Python script to compute this value accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# From the problem statement, we know:\n# P(decay in 100 mins) = 0.32\n# This means the survival probability for 100 mins is 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n# So, math.exp(-lambda * 100) = 0.68\n\n# We want to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.\n# Due to the memoryless property of exponential decay, this is equivalent to\n# finding the probability of a new atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n# P(decay in 150 mins) = 1 - math.exp(-lambda * 150)\n\n# We can express math.exp(-lambda * 150) in terms of what we know:\n# math.exp(-lambda * 150) = math.exp(-lambda * 100 * 1.5)\n#                        = (math.exp(-lambda * 100)) ** 1.5\n#                        = 0.68 ** 1.5\n\n# Calculate the survival probability for 150 minutes\nsurvival_prob_150_mins = 0.68 ** 1.5\n\n# The decay probability is 1 minus the survival probability\ndecay_prob_150_mins = 1 - survival_prob_150_mins\n\n# Print the result as a percentage\nprint(f\"The probability of decay is: {decay_prob_150_mins * 100:.2f}%\")\n```\n> The probability of decay is: 43.93%\n\nThe calculated probability is 43.93%. This value is closest to the 44% option.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem is about radioactive decay, which follows an exponential distribution. The key characteristic of this process is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of the atom decaying in the future is independent of how long it has already survived. The atom does not \"age\". Therefore, the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay has no impact on the future probability.\n\nThe problem then simplifies to: What is the probability that a newly obtained atom will decay within 150 minutes?\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Define the survival probability:** The probability that an atom survives for a time `t` is given by `P(survival, t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n\n2.  **Use the given data to find a value for λ:** We are told the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   Probability of decay in 100 min: `P(decay, 100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n    *   This means the probability of survival for 100 min is: `e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\n3.  **Calculate the probability of decay in 150 minutes:** We need to find `P(decay, 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n    *   We can rewrite `e^(-λ * 150)` in terms of the value we found in step 2:\n        `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    *   Now substitute the value from step 2:\n        `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n    *   Using a calculator, `(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`. This is the probability the atom will *survive* for 150 minutes.\n\n4.  **Find the final decay probability:** The probability of decay within 150 minutes is 1 minus the survival probability.\n    *   `P(decay, 150) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n\n5.  **Convert to a percentage:** The probability is `0.4393 * 100% = 43.93%`.\n\nThis value is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
