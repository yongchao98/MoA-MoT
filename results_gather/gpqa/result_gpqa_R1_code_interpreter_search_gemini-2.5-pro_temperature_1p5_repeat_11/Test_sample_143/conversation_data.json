    "Answering this question requires combining concepts from special relativity and particle physics.\n\n**1. Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n*   **Proper Lifetime ($\\tau$):** The lifetime of the meson X in its own rest frame is determined by its decay width ($\\Gamma_X$) through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n    $\\tau = \\hbar / \\Gamma_X$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n*   **Relativistic Effects:** The meson is produced with a high energy ($E_X = 8$ GeV) compared to its rest mass energy ($m_X c^2 = 1.2$ GeV), which means it travels at a speed close to the speed of light. Due to time dilation, its lifetime in the laboratory frame ($\\tau'$) will be longer than its proper lifetime. The relationship is:\n    $\\tau' = \\gamma \\tau$\n    where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, given by $\\gamma = E_X / (m_X c^2)$.\n\n*   **Mean Decay Distance (d):** The mean distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying is its velocity ($v$) multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime ($\\tau'$):\n    $d = v \\tau' = v \\gamma \\tau$\n\n*   **Calculation Strategy:** A convenient way to calculate the decay distance is to use the product $\\hbar c$ and the relativistic quantity $\\gamma \\beta$, where $\\beta = v/c$.\n    The formula can be rewritten as:\n    $d = v \\gamma \\tau = c \\beta \\gamma (\\hbar/\\Gamma_X) = \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X} (\\gamma \\beta)$\n    We can find the term $\\gamma \\beta$ from the energy-momentum relation $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2$. The momentum $p$ is also given by $p = \\gamma m_X v = \\gamma m_X (\\beta c)$.\n    So, $pc = \\gamma \\beta (m_X c^2)$. This gives us:\n    $\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{pc}{m_X c^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2}$\n\n*   **Final Formula:**\n    $d = \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2}$\n\n**2. Calculation:**\n\nLet's use a Python script to perform the calculation accurately. We will use the following values:\n*   $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV} = 8000 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\text{ GeV} = 1200 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$\n*   $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\text{ MeV fm}$ (a standard constant in particle physics, where 1 fm = $10^{-15}$ m)\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants and Given Values in MeV\nh_bar_c_MeV_fm = 197.327  # MeV fm\nE_X_MeV = 8000.0           # MeV\nm_X_c2_MeV = 1200.0        # MeV\nGamma_X_MeV = 320.0        # MeV\n\n# Calculate the momentum term pc\npc_MeV = math.sqrt(E_X_MeV**2 - m_X_c2_MeV**2)\n\n# Calculate the term gamma * beta = pc / (mc^2)\ngamma_beta = pc_MeV / m_X_c2_MeV\n\n# Calculate the mean decay distance in fm\ndecay_distance_fm = (h_bar_c_MeV_fm / Gamma_X_MeV) * gamma_beta\n\n# Convert the distance to meters\ndecay_distance_m = decay_distance_fm * 1e-15\n\nprint(f\"{decay_distance_m:.4e}\")\n```\n**3. Conclusion:**\n\nThe calculated value is approximately $4.065 \\times 10^{-15}$ meters. Comparing this with the given options:\n\nA) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\nB) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\nC) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\nD) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\n\nThe result from our calculation matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The user wants me to solve a particle physics problem.\n\n**1. Identify the goal:** The main goal is to calculate the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X.\n\n**2. List the given information:**\n*   Particle: Meson resonance X\n*   Production energy: $E_X = 8 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n*   Mass: $m_X = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV/c}^2$ (or rest mass energy $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}$)\n*   Decay width: $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n**3. Recall the relevant physics principles:**\n*   **Mean Lifetime:** The mean lifetime ($\\tau$) of a particle in its own rest frame is related to its decay width ($\\Gamma$) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: $\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$.\n*   **Time Dilation:** The lifetime of the particle in the laboratory frame ($\\tau'$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau$) due to relativistic effects. The relationship is $\\tau' = \\gamma \\tau$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Mean Decay Distance:** The mean distance ($d$) the particle travels in the lab frame is its velocity ($v$) multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime ($\\tau'$): $d = v \\tau'$.\n*   **Lorentz Factor:** The Lorentz factor is defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{mc^2}$, where E is the total energy and $mc^2$ is the rest mass energy.\n*   **Relativistic Velocity:** The velocity of the particle is related to the Lorentz factor by $\\beta = \\frac{v}{c} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$.\n\n**4. Formulate the calculation plan:**\n1.  Convert all energy units to be consistent (e.g., all in MeV).\n    *   $E_X = 8 \\, \\text{GeV} = 8000 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n    *   $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV} = 1200 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n    *   $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n2.  Calculate the proper lifetime $\\tau$. For this, we need the value of the reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar$. A very useful constant in particle physics is $\\hbar c$.\n    *   $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\, \\text{MeV fm}$ (where 1 fm = $10^{-15}$ m).\n    *   $\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X} = \\frac{\\hbar c}{c \\Gamma_X}$\n3.  Calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$.\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X c^2} = \\frac{8000 \\, \\text{MeV}}{1200 \\, \\text{MeV}}$\n4.  Combine the formulas for the mean decay distance $d$.\n    *   $d = v \\tau' = v (\\gamma \\tau) = v \\gamma \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    *   Since $v = \\beta c$, we have $d = \\beta c \\gamma \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$.\n    *   This can be written as $d = (\\beta \\gamma) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$.\n5.  We need to find the value of $\\beta \\gamma$. We know that momentum $p = \\gamma m v = \\gamma m (\\beta c)$. So, $pc = (\\beta \\gamma) mc^2$.\n    *   From the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$, we can find $pc$.\n    *   $pc = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}$\n    *   Therefore, $\\beta \\gamma = \\frac{pc}{m_X c^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2}$.\n6.  Substitute everything into the final formula for $d$:\n    *   $d = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2} \\times \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n**5. Execute the plan using a Python script for precision:**\n\nThe script will:\n1.  Define the constants and given values in MeV.\n2.  Calculate the term $\\beta \\gamma = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2}$.\n3.  Calculate the decay distance in femtometers (fm) using $d = (\\beta \\gamma) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$.\n4.  Convert the final result from fm to meters (m) and format it in scientific notation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the physical constants and given values.\n# All energy units are in MeV for consistency.\nh_bar_c_MeV_fm = 197.327  # Reduced Planck constant times speed of light in MeV*fm\nE_X_MeV = 8000.0           # Production energy of meson X in MeV\nm_X_c2_MeV = 1200.0        # Rest mass energy of meson X in MeV\nGamma_X_MeV = 320.0        # Decay width of meson X in MeV\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the relativistic term 'gamma * beta'.\n# The momentum (pc) can be found from the energy-momentum relation: E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2\n# pc = sqrt(E^2 - (mc^2)^2)\npc_MeV = math.sqrt(E_X_MeV**2 - m_X_c2_MeV**2)\n\n# The term gamma*beta is related to momentum by: pc = gamma * beta * mc^2\n# So, gamma*beta = pc / mc^2\ngamma_beta = pc_MeV / m_X_c2_MeV\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the mean decay distance in femtometers (fm).\n# The formula is d = (gamma * beta) * (hbar * c / Gamma)\n# This directly gives the distance in fm because hbar*c is in MeV*fm and Gamma is in MeV.\ndecay_distance_fm = gamma_beta * (h_bar_c_MeV_fm / Gamma_X_MeV)\n\n# Step 3: Convert the distance from femtometers to meters.\n# 1 fm = 10^-15 m\ndecay_distance_m = decay_distance_fm * 1e-15\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation to compare with the options.\nprint(f\"{decay_distance_m:.4e}\")\n```\nThe python code was executed and the output `4.0645e-15` was returned.\nThis corresponds to $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m.\n\nLet's compare this with the given options:\nA) $4.0655 \\times 10^{-16}$ m\nB) $4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m\nC) $5.0223 \\times 10^{-15}$ m\nD) $5.0223 \\times 10^{-16}$ m\n\nThe calculated value $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m is extremely close to option B, $4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m. The small difference is likely due to the precise value of $\\hbar c$ used or rounding in the option's value. The magnitude ($10^{-15}$) and the significant figures (4.06) match perfectly.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>",
