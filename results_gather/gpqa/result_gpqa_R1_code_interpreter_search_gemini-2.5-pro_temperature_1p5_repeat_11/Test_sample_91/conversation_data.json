    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula and structure of the compound.**\n\nThe compound is given by the condensed formula: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nLet's parse this formula to determine the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms and the types of bonds.\n\n*   The formula represents a single molecule with a central carbon chain.\n*   Let's identify the carbons in the main chain and the substituent groups. The backbone can be seen as: C=C-C-C-C-C=C. This is a 7-carbon chain.\n*   Let's count the atoms:\n    *   `(CH3)2C=`: One carbon in the chain, two methyl (CH3) groups attached. Total: 3 Carbons, 6 Hydrogens.\n    *   `=CH-`: One carbon, one hydrogen.\n    *   `-CH2-`: One carbon, two hydrogens.\n    *   `-CH(CH3)-`: One carbon in the chain, one hydrogen, and one methyl (CH3) group attached. Total: 2 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens.\n    *   `-CH2-`: One carbon, two hydrogens.\n    *   `-CH=`: One carbon, one hydrogen.\n    *   `=C(CH3)2`: One carbon in the chain, two methyl (CH3) groups attached. Total: 3 Carbons, 6 Hydrogens.\n\n*   **Total Carbon atoms (C):** 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 Carbons.\n*   **Total Hydrogen atoms (H):** 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 Hydrogens.\n*   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**Step 2: Count the number of each type of bond.**\n\nWe need to count the number of C-H, C-C, and C=C bonds in the molecule.\n\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n*   **C=C bonds:** The formula clearly shows two double bonds: (CH3)2**C=C**H- and -**C=C**(CH3)2. So, there are **2** C=C bonds.\n*   **C-C single bonds:**\n    *   Bonds within the main 7-carbon chain: There are 6 links in the chain, 2 of which are double bonds, so there are 6 - 2 = 4 single bonds (C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6).\n    *   Bonds connecting methyl groups to the chain:\n        *   Two CH3 groups on the first carbon. (2 C-C bonds)\n        *   One CH3 group on the fourth carbon. (1 C-C bond)\n        *   Two CH3 groups on the last carbon. (2 C-C bonds)\n    *   Total C-C single bonds = 4 (in chain) + 2 + 1 + 2 (substituents) = **9** C-C bonds.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the enthalpy of atomization of the compound.**\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the compound (ΔH_atom) is the sum of the bond energies of all the bonds in one mole of the compound.\nΔH_atom(compound) = (No. of C-H bonds × BE_C-H) + (No. of C-C bonds × BE_C-C) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE_C=C)\n\nGiven bond energies (BE):\n*   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atom(C12H22) = (22 × 400) + (9 × 200) + (2 × 300)\nΔH_atom(C12H22) = 8800 + 1800 + 600\nΔH_atom(C12H22) = **11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f) of the compound.**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is calculated using the following relationship based on Hess's Law:\nΔH_f = (Sum of enthalpies of atomization of elements in their standard state) - (Enthalpy of atomization of the compound)\n\nThe formation reaction is: 12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\n*   **Enthalpy of atomization of reactants:**\n    *   For 12 moles of Carbon: 12 × ΔH_atom(C) = 12 × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n    *   For 11 moles of H2: To get 22 H atoms, we need to break 11 H-H bonds. 11 × BE(H-H) = 11 × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n    *   Total enthalpy for atomizing reactants = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ**\n\n*   **Calculate ΔH_f:**\n    ΔH_f = (Enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Enthalpy of atomization of the compound)\n    ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\n    ΔH_f = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**Step 5: Convert the enthalpy of formation to the units in the options.**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Options A and B are given in kJ/g. We need to convert our answer to these units.\n\n*   **Molar Mass of C12H22:**\n    Using integer atomic masses consistent with the problem data (C=12 g/mol, H=1 g/mol).\n    Molar Mass = (12 × 12) + (22 × 1) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n\n*   **Convert kJ/mol to kJ/g:**\n    ΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    ΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166\n\nLet's perform the division.\n```python\nprint(1900 / 166)\n```\n<execute_ipython>\n11.44578313253012\n</execute_ipython>\nThe result is approximately 11.446 kJ/g.\n\n**Step 6: Compare with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 11.44 kJ/g\n*   B) 1900 kJ/g\n*   C) 67.4 kJ/mol\n*   D) 11200 kJ/mol\n\nOur calculated value of 11.446 kJ/g matches option A very closely. Option D corresponds to the enthalpy of atomization of the molecule, not its enthalpy of formation. Option B has the correct numerical value for the molar enthalpy, but incorrect units.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "An enthalpy of formation calculation involves determining the energy change when a compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states. The calculation typically follows these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure:**\n    The given compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n    Let's break down the structure to count the atoms and bonds.\n    *   Number of Carbon (C) atoms: 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (from CH(CH3)) + 1 + 1 + 2 (from (CH3)2) = 12 Carbon atoms.\n    *   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms: 6 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 (from CH(CH3)) + 2 + 1 + 6 (from (CH3)2) = 22 Hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Molecular Formula: **C12H22**.\n\n2.  **Count the Number of Each Type of Bond:**\n    *   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds indicated by `C=C` in the structure. Count = **2**.\n    *   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms. Count = **22**.\n    *   **C-C single bonds:** We count the single bonds connecting the carbons.\n        *   The main chain is C-C=C-C-C-C=C-C. Counting the single bonds in this chain gives us 4.\n        *   There are also single bonds connecting the methyl (CH3) groups to the main chain: two on the first C, one on the fourth C, and two on the last C. This gives 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 C-C single bonds.\n        *   Total C-C single bonds = 4 + 5 = **9**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound (ΔH_atom, compound):**\n    This is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound.\n    ΔH_atom(compound) = (No. of C-C bonds × BE_C-C) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE_C=C) + (No. of C-H bonds × BE_C-H)\n    ΔH_atom(compound) = (9 × 200 kJ/mol) + (2 × 300 kJ/mol) + (22 × 400 kJ/mol)\n    ΔH_atom(compound) = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants (ΔH_atom, reactants):**\n    This is the energy required to convert the elements from their standard states into gaseous atoms. The formation reaction is: 12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22\n    *   For 12 moles of Carbon: 12 × ΔH_atom(C) = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ\n    *   For 22 moles of Hydrogen atoms from 11 moles of H2 gas: 11 × BE(H-H) = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ\n    *   Total ΔH_atom(reactants) = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f):**\n    ΔH_f = ΔH_atom(reactants) - ΔH_atom(compound)\n    ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n6.  **Convert to kJ/g:**\n    The options include units of kJ/g, so we must convert our result.\n    *   Molar Mass of C12H22 = (12 × 12.011) + (22 × 1.008) ≈ 166.34 g/mol. Using the simplified integer masses implied by the problem data (C=12, H=1): Molar Mass = (12 * 12) + (22 * 1) = 166 g/mol.\n    *   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\n    *   ΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol ≈ 11.4457 kJ/g.\n\nThis value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
