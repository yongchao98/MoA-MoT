    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C10H14Br2). Adamantane is a tricyclic alkane (3 degrees of unsaturation).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess KOH at 240°C. This is a strong base at high temperature, suggesting complex reactions beyond simple substitution, such as elimination or rearrangement.\n*   **Product 1 Information:**\n    *   **IR:** 1720 cm⁻¹. This indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone in a six-membered ring or a slightly strained environment.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H). The total integration is 14H, which is the same as the starting material. This implies the overall formula is C10H14O (the two Br atoms are replaced by one O atom).\n    *   **Ozonolysis Step:** The fact that a later product (Product 2) undergoes ozonolysis implies that it, and therefore Product 1, must contain a C=C double bond.\n\n*   **Putting the clues together:** Product 1 has the formula C10H14O, and it contains both a ketone (C=O) and a double bond (C=C). Let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation (DU) for C10H14O:\n    DU = C + 1 - H/2 = 10 + 1 - 14/2 = 11 - 7 = 4.\n    A ketone (C=O) accounts for 1 DU. A double bond (C=C) accounts for 1 DU. This leaves 4 - 1 - 1 = 2 DU for the carbon skeleton, which means the skeleton must be **bicyclic**.\n*   **Conclusion for Step 1:** The reaction is not a simple substitution on the adamantane cage. The tricyclic adamantane skeleton must have undergone a ring-opening reaction (a fragmentation) to form a bicyclic product. A known fragmentation reaction of 1,3-disubstituted adamantanes (like the 1,3-diol formed from hydrolysis) is the Grob fragmentation. This leads to a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane derivative.\n*   **Proposed Structure for Product 1:** The structure that fits all the data is **7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n    *   **Formula:** C10H14O. Correct.\n    *   **Skeleton:** Bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane is bicyclic. Correct.\n    *   **Functional Groups:** It has a ketone at C3 and a C=C double bond (exocyclic methylene group at C7). Correct.\n    *   **IR:** The ketone is in a six-membered ring, consistent with 1720 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **NMR:**\n        *   The two protons of the exocyclic methylene group (=CH₂) are vinylic and deshielded. They typically resonate around 4.7-4.9 ppm. This perfectly matches the signal at **4.79 ppm (2H)**.\n        *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making many protons on the ring equivalent. The various ring protons (12 of them) can plausibly account for the complex multiplet at **2.41-2.23 (10H)** and the signal at **1.94 (2H)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Transformation:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces the ketone to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Product 2 Structure:** The C=O at C3 is reduced to a CH-OH group. Product 2 is **7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3 and Analyze its NMR**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS).\n*   **Transformation:** This is an ozonolysis with reductive workup. It cleaves the C=C double bond. The exocyclic C=CH₂ group is cleaved to give a ketone at C7 (C=O) and formaldehyde (H₂C=O), which is washed away.\n*   **Product 3 Structure:** The product is **3-hydroxybicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-one**. This molecule has a plane of symmetry (Cs) passing through the C3-OH and C7=O groups, assuming the thermodynamically favored `endo` configuration for the hydroxyl group, which allows the bicyclic system to adopt a stable dual chair conformation.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Coupling Pattern of the Most Deshielded Proton in Product 3**\n\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** In Product 3, we have protons alpha to a ketone (on C6 and C8, ~2.5 ppm) and a proton on the carbon bearing the alcohol group (H3 on C3). Protons on a carbon attached to an oxygen (CH-OH) are typically the most deshielded C-H protons in such a structure, resonating around 3.5-4.5 ppm. The question asks to exclude exchangeable protons (the O-H proton). Therefore, **H3 is the most deshielded proton** we need to analyze.\n\n*   **Coupling Analysis of H3:**\n    *   H3 is located on carbon C3. Its neighbors are the protons on C2 and C4.\n    *   The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system exists in a chair-chair conformation. Let's assume the alcohol is `endo`, making H3 `exo`.\n    *   H3 is coupled to four protons: two on C2 (let's call them H2ax and H2eq) and two on C4 (H4ax and H4eq).\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the coupling environments are simplified:\n        *   H3 couples to H2ax and H4ax. These are two equivalent protons. The coupling constant J(H3, Hax) will be of one type (J_A).\n        *   H3 couples to H2eq and H4eq. These are two other equivalent protons. The coupling constant J(H3, Heq) will be of another type (J_B).\n    *   According to the Karplus curve, the dihedral angles in the chair conformation will lead to significantly different values for J_A and J_B.\n    *   The signal for H3 is split by two equivalent protons (H2ax, H4ax) with coupling constant J_A. This gives a triplet (1:2:1 intensity).\n    *   Each of these three lines is then further split by two other equivalent protons (H2eq, H4eq) with coupling constant J_B. This splits each line into another triplet (1:2:1 intensity).\n    *   The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."
