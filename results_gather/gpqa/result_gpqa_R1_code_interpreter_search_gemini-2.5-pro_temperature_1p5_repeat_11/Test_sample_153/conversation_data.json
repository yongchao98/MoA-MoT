    "*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion (M⁺) peak is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most common isotopes.\n    *   There is another peak at m/z = 158, which is M+2. The relative intensity is 32% (100:32 ratio is approximately 3:1). This distinct M/M+2 pattern is a classic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes exist in an approximate 3:1 natural abundance).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weight of the proposed structures (C₇H₅ClO₂):\n        *   (7 * 12) + (5 * 1) + (1 * 35) + (2 * 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156.\n    *   All four options have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption band from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n    *   A strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   These two features together strongly suggest the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This rules out options A (phenyl chloroformate, which lacks an O-H group) and C (an aldehyde, which would have a C=O peak but no carboxylic O-H, and its NMR would be different). We are left with options B and D.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal in this region (typically 10-13 ppm) is highly characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). Its integration of 1H confirms one such proton. This is consistent with both 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n    *   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):**\n        *   The signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm).\n        *   We have two signals: one doublet at 8.02 ppm integrating to 2H, and another doublet at 7.72 ppm integrating to 2H. This pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para)** benzene ring. The symmetry of a para-substituted ring makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two protons on the other side.\n        *   **Option B (2-chlorobenzoic acid)** is *ortho*-substituted. All four aromatic protons would be in unique chemical environments, leading to four separate, more complex signals (not two simple doublets).\n        *   **Option D (4-chlorobenzoic acid)** is *para*-substituted. This structure has a plane of symmetry. The two protons adjacent (ortho) to the carboxylic acid group are equivalent and would appear as one signal. The two protons adjacent (ortho) to the chlorine atom are also equivalent and would appear as a second signal. This perfectly matches the observed spectrum of two doublets, each integrating to two protons. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are more deshielded and appear further downfield (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the -Cl group are less deshielded and appear at 7.72 ppm.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The combination of all spectral data—the molecular weight and chlorine isotope pattern from MS, the carboxylic acid signatures from IR, and the characteristic para-substitution pattern in the ¹H NMR—unequivocally points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>"
