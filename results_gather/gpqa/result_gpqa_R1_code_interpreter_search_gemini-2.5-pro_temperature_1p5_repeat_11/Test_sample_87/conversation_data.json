    "The user wants me to identify a biological process based on an experimental description.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Experiment:**\n    *   **Antigen:** Rotavirus inner capsid proteins (tagged with GFP).\n    *   **Delivery:** Oral gavage in mice. This means the antigen is introduced through the gastrointestinal tract.\n    *   **Initial Observation:** Some antigen is lost, but some reaches the intended area. This is a detail about the delivery, not the core immune process.\n    *   **Location of Response:** Fluorescent Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches are a type of Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT), which are secondary lymphoid organs where immune responses to intestinal antigens are initiated.\n    *   **Cellular Activity:** Proliferating cell population isolated from the Peyer's patches. Cell proliferation (clonal expansion) is a key feature of an adaptive immune response.\n    *   **Genetic Observation:** Sequencing of the *variable heavy chain gene* from these proliferating cells shows *high variability*. This is the most critical piece of information.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Options in Context:**\n    *   **A) Complement activation:** This is a part of the innate and humoral immune response involving a cascade of plasma proteins. It does not directly cause genetic mutations or variability in the immunoglobulin genes of B cells.\n    *   **B) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs in activated B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches). Its purpose is to introduce point mutations into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This process generates B cells with variant antibodies, some of which may have a higher affinity for the antigen. The cells with higher affinity are then selected for survival and proliferation. This process directly results in \"high variability\" in the \"variable heavy chain gene\" of a proliferating B cell population after antigen exposure. This fits the description perfectly.\n    *   **C) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers. However, it changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain gene, switching the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgG or IgA). It does *not* alter the variable region. The question specifically mentions variability in the *variable* heavy chain gene.\n    *   **D) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that creates the initial diversity of B cell receptors *before* a B cell ever encounters an antigen. It occurs in the bone marrow (a primary lymphoid organ) during B cell development. The scenario described is an ongoing immune response to an antigen in a *secondary* lymphoid organ, leading to further diversification in a proliferating population, not the initial generation of diversity.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The observation of high variability specifically in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating cells within a Peyer's patch following antigen exposure is the classic signature of somatic hypermutation. This process is central to affinity maturation in germinal centers.\n\n<<<B>>>"
