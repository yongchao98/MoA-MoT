    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each compound to determine if it is optically active. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a racemic mixture. Chirality means the molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators are the presence of stereocenters and the absence of internal symmetry elements like a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   **Structure:** This is an alkene. The atoms involved in the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, CH3, CH2CH3) lie in the same plane.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since it has a plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and therefore optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a complex polycyclic molecule. The name itself provides critical information.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The descriptors `(3aR,7aS)` specify the absolute configuration at two stereocenters. This means the name refers to a single, specific stereoisomer. A single stereoisomer is chiral unless it is a meso compound. Given the complexity and unsymmetrical substitution (`8-(chloromethylene)`), the molecule is certain to lack any internal symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The name specifies a single enantiomer of a chiral compound. Therefore, it is optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** The molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. It possesses two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The substituents on C2 and C3 are the same (H, CH3, COOH, and the other chiral carbon group). The configurations are opposite (R and S). This is the definition of a *meso* compound. Meso compounds are achiral because they possess an internal element of symmetry (a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion in at least one conformer).\n    *   **Conclusion:** As a meso compound, it is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a diastereomer of the compound above. It has two stereocenters, C2 and C3.\n    *   **Symmetry:** Both stereocenters have the same (R) configuration. This molecule does not have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is therefore a chiral molecule. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S,3S) isomer.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The name specifies a single enantiomer of a chiral pair. Therefore, it is optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4 and an -OH group at C1.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** Let's check C1 for chirality. It is bonded to four different groups: (1) -H, (2) -OH, (3) the ring path -CH2-CH=, and (4) the ring path -CH2-C5H2-C4H=. Because the paths around the ring are different (one path encounters the double bond sooner than the other), C1 is a stereocenter. The molecule is chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The name `(R)-...` specifies a single enantiomer. Therefore, it is optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptor 's' usually denotes relative stereochemistry (cis/trans). Assuming it means all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. C1 is bonded to -H, -OH, and two identical paths around the ring (-C2H2-C3H(OH)-... and -C6H2-C5H(OH)-...). Thus, C1, C3, and C5 are not stereocenters. The all-cis isomer possesses a C3 rotational axis and three planes of symmetry. The other diastereomer (one OH trans to the other two) also has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral due to its high symmetry. It is optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   **Structure:** The molecule's formula is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** We need to check for any stereocenters. A review of all carbon atoms reveals none. The carbon in the `CH(CH3)2` group is bonded to two identical methyl groups. All other carbons are either sp2 hybridized or are part of a CH2 group or have two identical paths in the ring. The molecule has no stereocenter.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule is achiral and optically **inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>"
