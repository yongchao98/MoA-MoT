    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n**Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.**\n\n1.  **Understanding Tautomerism:** Tautomerism is a type of isomerism where two structures, called tautomers, are in equilibrium and can readily interconvert. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For a compound to exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, it must have at least one α-hydrogen atom (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group, where that carbon is sp³ hybridized).\n\n2.  **Analyzing Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a six-membered carbon ring with carbonyl groups (C=O) at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are methylene groups (-CH₂-).\n    *   **α-Hydrogens:** The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are α-carbons to the carbonyl groups. Each of these sp³ hybridized carbons has two hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Tautomerization:** Due to the presence of these α-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerization. It exists in equilibrium with its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene). This enol form is aromatic and therefore very stable, meaning the equilibrium strongly favors this form.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione *does* show tautomerism.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Benzoquinone:**\n    *   **Structure:** The common form is 1,4-benzoquinone. It is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two carbonyl groups at positions 1 and 4.\n    *   **α-Hydrogens:** The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6) are all sp² hybridized as they are part of a C=C double bond. They do not have the required α-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon.\n    *   **Tautomerization:** For benzoquinone to form its corresponding \"enol\" (which would be hydroquinone), it would require the addition of two hydrogen atoms (a reduction), changing its molecular formula from C₆H₄O₂ to C₆H₆O₂. Since tautomers must have the same molecular formula, this process is a redox reaction, not tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone *does not* show tautomerism.\n\n4.  **Result for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n---\n\n**Part B: Identifying the compound that shows optical isomerism.**\n\n1.  **Understanding Optical Isomerism:** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is `CH₃-CH(OH)-C(=O)OCH₃`.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one with the -OH group). It is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl group)\n        4.  -C(=O)OCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   **Chirality:** Since this carbon is attached to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and therefore *will* show optical isomerism (it has two enantiomers).\n\n3.  **Analyzing Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the methyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is `CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃`, with the `CH₃OOC` groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** The molecule contains no sp³ carbon bonded to four different groups. The carbons of the double bond are sp² hybridized and cannot be chiral centers in this case.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule is essentially planar and possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and therefore *will not* show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **Result for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\n*   Compound A (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound B (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching this to the given options:\n\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
