    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### Reaction 1 Analysis\n\n**Reaction:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK.\n\n1.  **Identify Reaction Type:** This is a classic **Michael Addition** reaction. It involves the addition of a nucleophile (an enolate in this case) to the β-carbon of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.\n\n2.  **Identify Reactants and Reagents:**\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor (Ketone):** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This molecule will be deprotonated to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base, ideal for forming enolates.\n\n3.  **Enolate Formation:**\n    *   The base's role is to remove an acidic α-proton (a proton on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) from the ketone.\n    *   Let's analyze the α-carbons of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one:\n        *   **C2:** This carbon is bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, the carbonyl carbon (C1), and C3. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.\n        *   **C6:** This carbon is bonded to a methyl group, the carbonyl carbon (C1), C5, and one hydrogen atom. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Since C6 is the only α-carbon with a proton, the base (t-BuOK) will selectively deprotonate C6 to form a single, specific enolate. The steric hindrance of t-BuOK is irrelevant here as there is no competition.\n\n     \n\n4.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The negatively charged C6 of the enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electron-deficient β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate moiety.\n\n     \n\n5.  **Protonation and Final Product (A):**\n    *   The resulting intermediate is an enolate of the ester, which is then protonated during the work-up (likely by t-butanol, the conjugate acid of the base) to yield the final stable product.\n    *   The structure of the product is the original cyclohexanone ring with an `-(CH₂)-CH₂-COOEt` group attached to C6.\n\n6.  **Naming Product A:**\n    *   The options name the product as a substituted ethyl propanoate. We must name our predicted structure according to this convention to match the options.\n    *   Parent Chain: `ethyl propanoate` (`-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`). The `CH₂` group attached to the ring is C3 of the propanoate chain.\n    *   Substituent: The cyclohexyl ring is treated as a substituent attached to C3 of the propanoate chain. We number the ring starting from the point of attachment (the original C6) as C1'.\n    *   Let's re-number the ring based on this new priority:\n        *   Original C6 is now C1'. It has a **methyl** group.\n        *   Original C1 (carbonyl) is now C2'. It is an **oxo** group.\n        *   Original C2 is now C3'. It has an **ethyl** group and a **methyl** group.\n    *   Assembling the name of the substituent: (3'-ethyl-1',3'-dimethyl-2'-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   Combining with the parent chain: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n    *   This matches the name for product A in options A and B.\n\n---\n\n### Reaction 2 Analysis\n\n**Reaction:** 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile in the presence of KOH and H₂O.\n\n1.  **Identify Reaction Type:** This is also a **Michael Addition**. The nucleophile is a carbanion stabilized by the nitro group (a nitronate).\n\n2.  **Identify Reactants and Reagents:**\n    *   **Nucleophile precursor:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂-NO₂).\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN).\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n    *   **Solvent/Proton Source:** Water (H₂O).\n\n3.  **Carbanion (Nitronate) Formation:**\n    *   The protons on the carbon adjacent (α) to the electron-withdrawing nitro group are acidic.\n    *   KOH deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate ion), `CH₃CH₂CH⁻-NO₂`.\n\n4.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate attacks the electron-deficient β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (the CH carbon bonded to the methyl group).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed.\n    *   The fragments are: `[CH₃CH₂(NO₂)CH]` and `[CH(CH₃)CH₂CN]`.\n    *   Connecting them gives the structure: `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n\n     \n\n5.  **Protonation and Final Product (B):**\n    *   The resulting carbanion α to the nitrile group is protonated by water to give the final product.\n\n6.  **Naming Product B:**\n    *   According to IUPAC rules, the principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN), so its carbon is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including C1 is six carbons long. The parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering the chain from the nitrile group:\n        `CN(1) - CH₂(2) - CH(3)(CH₃) - CH(4)(NO₂) - CH₂(5) - CH₃(6)`\n    *   Identify the substituents and their positions:\n        *   A methyl group at C3 (`3-methyl`).\n        *   A nitro group at C4 (`4-nitro`).\n    *   Assembling the full name: **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n    *   This matches the name for product B in options A and D.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   **Product B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nThe correct choice is **A**, as it correctly identifies both major products.\n\n<<<A>>>"
