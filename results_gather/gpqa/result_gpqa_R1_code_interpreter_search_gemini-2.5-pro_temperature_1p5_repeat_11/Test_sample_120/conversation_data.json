    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Starting Material and Reagents\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   The core structure `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` represents a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across two adjacent carbons. These carbons are numbered C1 and C6 according to bicyclic nomenclature.\n    *   There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The stereochemistry is given as (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi, which is lithium dimethylcuprate, a Gilman reagent.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Reaction of an epoxide with an organocuprate.\n\n### 2. Understand the Reaction Mechanism and Rules\n\nThe problem provides two key rules for this reaction:\n1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophilic alkyl group (in this case, methyl, Me⁻) attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n2.  **Stereospecificity:** The reaction is an Sₙ2-type attack, which results in an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon that is attacked by the nucleophile.\n\n### 3. Apply the Rules to the Specific Reaction\n\n*   **Step 3.1: Identify the site of attack (Regioselectivity).**\n    *   The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group, in addition to being part of the bicyclic system. It is a **tertiary** carbon.\n    *   C6 is only substituted with a hydrogen atom (and is part of the bicyclic system). It is a **secondary** carbon.\n    *   Therefore, C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon. The methyl nucleophile from Me₂CuLi will attack C6.\n\n*   **Step 3.2: Determine the consequences of the attack.**\n    *   The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks C6.\n    *   The C6-O bond of the epoxide ring breaks. The electrons move to the oxygen atom.\n    *   After an acidic or aqueous workup step (which is implicit in this type of reaction), the resulting alkoxide ion at C1 is protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The final product is a substituted cyclohexanol.\n\n*   **Step 3.3: Determine the substitution pattern of the product.**\n    *   The cyclohexane ring skeleton is preserved.\n    *   Let's trace the positions of the groups. For IUPAC naming of the product, the carbon bearing the -OH group will be designated as C1.\n        *   The **-OH group** is on the original C1 of the epoxide. This becomes the **new C1** of the cyclohexanol product.\n        *   The original **methyl group on C1** is still attached to this same carbon. So, there is a methyl group at the **new C1**.\n        *   A **new methyl group** from the cuprate is added to the original C6. The original C6 is adjacent to the original C1. In the product, this carbon will be the **new C2** (numbering to give substituents the lowest locants).\n        *   The original **methyl group on C4** remains. This carbon becomes the **new C4** in the product.\n        *   The original **methyl group on C3** remains. This carbon becomes the **new C5** in the product.\n    *   Thus, the product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This structural formula eliminates options A and B, which are 2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. We are left to decide between C and D based on stereochemistry.\n\n*   **Step 3.4: Determine the stereochemistry of the product (Stereospecificity).**\n    *   We need to find the absolute configuration (R/S) of the stereocenters in the product: C1, C2, C4, and C5.\n    *   **Stereocenters C1, C4, C5:** The chemical bonds at the original C1, C3, and C4 are not broken during the reaction (except for the C1-O bond, but the stereocenter at C1 is not inverted because the attack happens at C6). Therefore, their absolute configurations are retained.\n        *   Original C1 was **R** -> New C1 remains **R**.\n        *   Original C4 was **R** -> New C4 remains **R**.\n        *   Original C3 was **R** -> New C5 remains **R**.\n    *   **Stereocenter C2:** This is the site of nucleophilic attack (original C6). The problem states that inversion of configuration occurs.\n        *   The original configuration of C6 was **S**.\n        *   An SN2 reaction causes a Walden inversion, which is a geometric inversion of the tetrahedron at the chiral center. We must determine the resulting R/S descriptor.\n        *   Let's analyze the groups and their priorities (according to Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules) at this center before and after the reaction.\n            *   **Reactant (C6):** Groups are O(from epoxide), C1, C5, H. Priorities: O > C1 > C5 > H. The configuration is **S**.\n            *   **Product (New C2):** The leaving group (O) is replaced by the incoming methyl group (Me). The groups are C1(now with OH), C3(old C5), Me, H. Priorities: C1 > C3 > Me > H.\n        *   Crucially, the leaving group (O-R) had the highest priority (1), while the incoming nucleophile (Me) has a lower priority (3). This change in group priorities means that the R/S descriptor might not simply flip from S to R, even though the 3D geometry inverts.\n        *   A careful analysis of the 3D geometry is required. The attack by Me⁻ must occur from the side opposite to the C6-O bond. If we assume the epoxide ring is on the 'top' (beta) face of the cyclohexane ring, the attack comes from the 'bottom' (alpha) face. This pushes the original hydrogen at C6 from the alpha position to the beta position.\n        *   Let's analyze the resulting geometry in the most stable chair conformation of the product. The product has a cis-1,2-dimethyl arrangement (C1-Me and C2-Me are both alpha), so one will be axial and one equatorial. The most stable conformer will have the C1-Me group equatorial and the C2-Me group axial. In this conformation, the hydrogen on C2 is equatorial. Analyzing the priorities (C1 > C3 > Me > H) around C2 in this conformation reveals a clockwise path of C1->C3->Me when viewed down the C2-H bond. Since the lowest priority group (H) points towards the viewer in this perspective, we reverse the assignment from R to S. Thus, the configuration at C2 is **S**.\n        *   Therefore, the S configuration at C6 in the reactant leads to an S configuration at the new C2 in the product. This is a \"retention\" of the descriptor, but it is the result of a geometric inversion coupled with a change in group priorities.\n    *   **Final Stereochemistry:** The product has the configuration (1R, 2S, 4R, 5R).\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nCombining the structure and the stereochemistry, the final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
