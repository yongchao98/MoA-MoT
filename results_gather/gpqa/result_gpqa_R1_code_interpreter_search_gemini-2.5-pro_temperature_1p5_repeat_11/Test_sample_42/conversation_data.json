    "This is a problem that requires applying the rules of IUPAC nomenclature for substituted aromatic compounds. Let's break down the structure of the molecule step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Identify the Principal Functional Group:** The molecule contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano (-CN) group. According to IUPAC priority rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority. Therefore, the parent compound is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to the carboxylic acid is assigned position C1.\n\n2.  **Determine the Positions of the Main Substituents:**\n    *   The carboxylic acid (-COOH), carbaldehyde (-CHO), and cyano (-CN) groups are all **meta** (1,3-relationship) to one another.\n    *   If -COOH is at C1, the meta positions are C3 and C5. So, -CHO and -CN are at C3 and C5.\n    *   Since the -CHO and -CN groups are also meta to each other, this arrangement (C1, C3, C5) is consistent. For now, let's tentatively place -CHO at C3 and -CN at C5.\n\n3.  **Determine the Positions of the Remaining Substituents:**\n    *   A hydroxyl (-OH) group and a dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group are **ortho** (1,2-relationship) to the carboxylic acid (at C1). This means they are at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   A methoxy (-OCH3) group is **para** (1,4-relationship) to the carboxylic acid (at C1). This places it at C4.\n    *   We are given a final piece of information to resolve the ambiguity: the methoxy group (-OCH3) and the alcohol (-OH) are both **ortho** to the nitrile (-CN).\n        *   We tentatively placed the -CN group at C5. The ortho positions to C5 are C4 and C6.\n        *   The methoxy group is at C4, which is indeed ortho to C5. This fits perfectly.\n        *   Therefore, the hydroxyl group must be at the other ortho position, C6.\n        *   Since the hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups are at C2 and C6, and we've now placed the hydroxyl group at C6, the dimethylamino group must be at C2.\n        *   This also confirms that our initial placement of -CHO at C3 and -CN at C5 was correct.\n\n4.  **Summarize the Structure:**\n    *   C1: -COOH (part of the parent name, benzoic acid)\n    *   C2: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n    *   C3: -CHO (formyl)\n    *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n    *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n    *   C6: -OH (hydroxy)\n\n5.  **Apply IUPAC Naming Rules:**\n    *   **Numbering:** We must number the ring to give the lowest possible set of locants (positions) to the substituents. Starting from C1 (-COOH), we can number clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n        *   Clockwise: C2-dimethylamino, C3-formyl, C4-methoxy, C5-cyano, C6-hydroxy. The locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n        *   Counter-clockwise: C2-hydroxy, C3-cyano, C4-methoxy, C5-formyl, C6-dimethylamino. The locant set is also {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n        *   When the locant sets are identical, we use alphabetical order of the substituents to decide the numbering. We assign the lower number to the substituent that comes first alphabetically at the first point of difference.\n        *   The first point of difference is C2 vs. C6. We have \"dimethylamino\" vs. \"hydroxy\".\n        *   \"**D**imethylamino\" comes before \"**h**ydroxy\" in the alphabet.\n        *   Therefore, the dimethylamino group gets the lower number (C2), and the numbering proceeds clockwise. Our assignments in step 4 are correct.\n\n    *   **Alphabetize the Prefixes:** The substituent groups must be listed in alphabetical order in the final name. The prefixes are:\n        *   **c**yano\n        *   **d**imethylamino\n        *   **f**ormyl\n        *   **h**ydroxy\n        *   **m**ethoxy\n\n    *   **Assemble the Final Name:** Combine the prefixes in alphabetical order, each preceded by its locant number, and add the parent name at the end.\n        *   5-cyano-\n        *   2-(dimethylamino)-\n        *   3-formyl-\n        *   6-hydroxy-\n        *   4-methoxy\n        *   benzoic acid\n\n    *   The complete name is: **5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - **This matches our derived name.**\n    *   B) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - Incorrect numbering and alphabetical order.\n    *   C) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Correct numbering but incorrect alphabetical order of prefixes.\n    *   D) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - Incorrect numbering and alphabetical order.\n\n<<<A>>>"
