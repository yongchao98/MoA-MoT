    "An eigenvector is a vector that, when acted upon by a given linear operator, results in a scaled version of the same vector. The scaling factor is known as the eigenvalue. The problem requires us to find the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator, P, that corresponds to a specific eigenvalue.\n\n**1. Define the Operator and its Components**\n\nThe operator is given in terms of its Cartesian components:\n$P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\nThese are the standard spin-1/2 angular momentum operators, where the matrices are the Pauli matrices ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$).\n\n**2. Determine the Direction Vector**\n\nThe problem specifies that the direction vector, $\\vec{n}$, lies in the x-z plane. A general unit vector in 3D spherical coordinates is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$. For the vector to be in the x-z plane, its y-component must be zero. This means $\\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi = 0$. For an arbitrary direction, $\\theta$ is not fixed at 0 or $\\pi$, so we must have $\\sin\\phi = 0$. This implies $\\phi = 0$ (or $\\pi$, but $\\phi=0$ is the standard convention).\nTherefore, the direction vector is:\n$\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\n\n**3. Construct the Operator Along Direction n**\n\nThe operator along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is the dot product of the operator vector $\\vec{P}$ and the direction unit vector $\\vec{n}$:\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_y(0) + P_z \\cos\\theta$\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta$\nCombining the matrices:\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$P_{\\vec{n}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**4. Set Up and Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n$P_{\\vec{n}} |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe can cancel $\\hbar/2$ from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis gives a system of two linear equations:\n1) $a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta = a$\n2) $a\\sin\\theta - b\\cos\\theta = b$\n\nLet's solve the first equation for the ratio of b to a:\n$b\\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\nUsing the half-angle trigonometric identities ($1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$):\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nSo, the eigenvector has the form $|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$ for some constant C. A more convenient (unnormalized) form is obtained by multiplying by $\\cos(\\theta/2)$:\n$|\\psi\\rangle_{unnorm} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**5. Normalize the Eigenvector**\n\nThe norm of a vector must be 1. The squared norm is the sum of the absolute squares of its components.\n$\\|\\psi\\|^2 = |\\cos(\\theta/2)|^2 + |\\sin(\\theta/2)|^2 = \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$\n\nSince the norm is already 1, the normalized eigenvector is:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
