    "To solve this problem, we need to follow a systematic approach to determine the final composition of the solution after all reactions have occurred, and then calculate the pH.\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each reactant.**\n\n*   **Moles of Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.05 mol\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   HCl dissociates completely: HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.08 mol\n    *   Therefore, Moles of H⁺ from HCl = 0.08 mol\n\n*   **Moles of Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂), a strong base:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Ba(OH)₂ dissociates completely: Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.09 mol\n    *   Since each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces 2 moles of OH⁻,\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ = 2 × 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol\n\n**2. Determine the net result of the neutralization reactions.**\n\nThe reactions will proceed in order of strength. The strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) will react first with the strong base (OH⁻).\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Acid vs. Strong Base**\n    *   Initial moles H⁺ = 0.08 mol\n    *   Initial moles OH⁻ = 0.18 mol\n    *   The neutralization reaction is: H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n    *   Since there are more moles of OH⁻ than H⁺, all the H⁺ will be consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.18 mol - 0.08 mol = 0.10 mol\n\nNow, the remaining strong base (OH⁻) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Remaining Strong Base vs. Weak Acid**\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.10 mol\n    *   Initial moles CH3COOH = 0.05 mol\n    *   The reaction is: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n    *   Since there are more moles of OH⁻ than CH3COOH, all the weak acid will be consumed.\n    *   Moles of excess OH⁻ = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol\n\nAfter all reactions, the solution contains a significant amount of excess strong base (OH⁻). The presence of this strong base will be the primary determinant of the solution's pH.\n\n**3. Calculate the concentration of the excess hydroxide ions (OH⁻).**\n\nFirst, find the total volume of the final solution.\n*   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\nNow, calculate the final concentration of the excess OH⁻ ions.\n*   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n*   [OH⁻] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L\n\nLet's compute the concentration and the resulting pOH and pH.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Moles of reactants\nmoles_ch3cooh = 0.1 * 0.500\nmoles_h_from_hcl = 0.2 * 0.400\nmoles_oh_from_baoh2 = 2 * 0.3 * 0.300\n\n# Neutralization reactions\nmoles_oh_after_hcl = moles_oh_from_baoh2 - moles_h_from_hcl\nmoles_oh_excess = moles_oh_after_hcl - moles_ch3cooh\n\n# Final calculations\ntotal_volume = 0.500 + 0.400 + 0.300  # in L\nconcentration_oh = moles_oh_excess / total_volume\npOH = -math.log10(concentration_oh)\npH = 14 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"pH = {pH:.2f}\")\n```\nExecution of the code gives the following result:\n```\npH = 12.62\n```\n\n**4. Final pH Calculation**\n*   The concentration of excess OH⁻ is calculated to be approximately 0.04167 M.\n*   The pOH of the solution is: pOH = -log₁₀[OH⁻] = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n*   The pH of the solution is: pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nTherefore, the pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each substance:**\n\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n    Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 M × 0.500 L = 0.05 mol\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ (from HCl, a strong acid):**\n    Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 M × 0.400 L = 0.08 mol\n\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ (from Ba(OH)₂, a strong base):**\n    Note that each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces 2 moles of OH⁻.\n    Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 M × 0.300 L = 0.09 mol\n    Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol\n\n**2. Perform neutralization reactions:**\n\nThe strong acid (H⁺) will react completely with the strong base (OH⁻) first.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Acid + Strong Base**\n    H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O\n    *   Initial moles H⁺ = 0.08 mol\n    *   Initial moles OH⁻ = 0.18 mol\n    *   The H⁺ is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.18 mol - 0.08 mol = 0.10 mol\n\nNow, the remaining strong base (OH⁻) will react with the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Weak Acid + Remaining Strong Base**\n    CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O\n    *   Initial moles CH₃COOH = 0.05 mol\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.10 mol\n    *   The CH₃COOH is the limiting reactant and will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of excess OH⁻ = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol\n\n**3. Calculate the pH of the final solution:**\n\nThe final solution has an excess of 0.05 moles of OH⁻, a strong base. The pH will be determined by the concentration of these excess hydroxide ions.\n\n*   **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Calculate the final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    [OH⁻] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate the pOH:**\n    pOH = -log₁₀[OH⁻]\n    pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate the pH:**\n    pH + pOH = 14\n    pH = 14 - pOH\n    pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>"
