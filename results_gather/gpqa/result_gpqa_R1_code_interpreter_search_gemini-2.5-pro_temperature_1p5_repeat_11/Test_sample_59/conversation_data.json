    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the time elapsed for the astronaut on the spacecraft, which is the \"proper time\" in the context of special relativity.\n\n2.  **Gather Information:**\n    *   **Distance (d):** The distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to Earth. A search reveals this is approximately 163,000 light-years. This is the distance as measured in the Earth's (or LMC's) stationary reference frame.\n    *   **Velocity (v):** The spacecraft's speed is `0.99999987 * c`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   **Astronaut's initial age:** 22 years.\n    *   **Average lifetime:** 150 years.\n\n3.  **Apply the Theory of Special Relativity:**\n    *   The time measured by an observer on Earth (dilated time, Δt) will be different from the time experienced by the astronaut on the moving spacecraft (proper time, Δt₀).\n    *   The relationship between these two times is given by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   Therefore, the time experienced by the astronaut is `Δt₀ = Δt / γ`.\n\n4.  **Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Calculate the travel time from Earth's perspective (Δt).**\n        This is a simple `time = distance / speed` calculation.\n        `Δt = 163,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * c)`\n        Since `1 light-year` is the distance light travels in one year (`c * 1 year`), the `c` terms cancel out.\n        `Δt ≈ 163,000 / 0.99999987` years ≈ `163,000.02` years.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n        The formula is `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)²)`.\n        Given `v/c = 0.99999987`.\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.99999987²)`.\n        This calculation requires precision and is best done with a script.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (Δt₀).**\n        `Δt₀ = Δt / γ`.\n\n    *   **Step 4 (Verification): Check if the astronaut survives.**\n        The astronaut's age upon arrival will be `22 + Δt₀`. We must check if this is less than 150.\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation using Python:**\n    The following Python code will execute the precise calculations.\n\nThe code execution has returned the following results:\n*   Time from Earth's perspective (Δt): `163,000.02` years.\n*   Lorentz factor (γ): `1961.16`\n*   Time experienced by the astronaut (Δt₀): `83.11` years.\n*   The astronaut's age upon arrival will be `22 + 83.11 = 105.11` years.\n*   Since `105.11 < 150`, the astronaut survives the journey. This eliminates option D.\n\nThe calculated time experienced by the astronaut is approximately **83.11 years**. Comparing this to the given options:\n*   A) 81 years\n*   B) 77 years\n*   C) 72 years\n\nThe value `83.11` years is closest to 81 years. The minor difference can be attributed to using a slightly different value for the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (e.g., the problem might have been designed using a value like 160,000 light-years). Given the options, 81 years is the most plausible approximate answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
