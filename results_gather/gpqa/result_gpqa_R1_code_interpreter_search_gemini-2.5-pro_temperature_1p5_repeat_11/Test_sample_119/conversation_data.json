    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Define the key quantities:**\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** The parallax of a star is inversely proportional to its distance (d) from the observer. Mathematically, `plx = 1/d`, or equivalently, `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   **Uniform Distribution:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. This implies that the number density of stars (`ρ`), which is the number of stars per unit volume, is constant throughout space.\n\n2.  **Relate the number of stars to distance:**\n    *   Let's find the number of stars (`dN`) located within a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` with a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this spherical shell (`dV`) is its surface area (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`):\n        `dV = 4πd² dd`\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars `dN` in this volume `dV` is:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² dd`\n\n3.  **Convert from distance to parallax:**\n    *   The goal is to find the number of stars per unit range of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`), not per unit range of distance (`dN/dd`). We need to express `d` and `dd` in terms of `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   We already have the relation `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   To find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`, we differentiate `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) * (1/plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   This gives us `dd = - (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign simply means that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. When we consider the number of stars within a certain interval (a magnitude), we can use the absolute value: `|dd| = (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n\n4.  **Substitute and find the final relationship:**\n    *   Now, we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into our equation for `dN`:\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * |dd|`\n        `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n        `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) d(plx)`\n    *   To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide by `d(plx)`:\n        `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n    *   Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are all constants, we can see the proportionality:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\n**Conclusion:** The number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax as `1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
