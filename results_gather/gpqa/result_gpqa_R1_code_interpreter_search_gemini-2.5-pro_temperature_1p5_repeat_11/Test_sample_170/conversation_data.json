    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction and the Goal**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on a series of substituted benzene rings (C6H5-X). We need to arrange the starting substances in order of increasing yield of the para-bromo-substituted product. The yield of the para-isomer depends on two factors:\n*   The directing effect of the substituent (ortho/para vs. meta).\n*   The ratio of para- to ortho-isomer for ortho/para directors.\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents based on their electronic effects, which determine whether they are ortho/para-directing or meta-directing.\n\n*   **Ortho/Para Directors:** These substituents donate electron density to the ring (or have lone pairs that can be donated via resonance) and direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   **-CH3 (1, Toluene):** Activating alkyl group.\n    *   **-C2H5 (5, Ethylbenzene):** Activating alkyl group.\n    *   **-Cl (3, Chlorobenzene):** Deactivating halogen (due to induction), but ortho/para directing (due to resonance).\n\n*   **Meta Directors:** These substituents withdraw electron density from the ring and direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position.\n    *   **-NO2 (4, Nitrobenzene):** Strongly deactivating.\n    *   **-COOH (6, Benzoic acid):** Deactivating.\n    *   **-COOC2H5 (2, Ethyl benzoate):** Deactivating.\n\n**3. Compare the Two Groups**\n\nOrtho/para directors yield significant amounts of the para-isomer (often >50%), while meta directors yield very small, almost negligible amounts of the para-isomer (typically <5%). Therefore, all the meta-directing substances will have a lower para-isomer yield than all the ortho/para-directing substances.\n\nThe final ordered list will have the meta-directors first, followed by the ortho/para-directors:\n{Group of 4, 6, 2} < {Group of 1, 5, 3}\n\n**4. Order the Meta-Directors (Substances 4, 6, 2)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the formation of the para-isomer is highly unfavorable. The yield of the para-isomer will be inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A more strongly deactivating group will suppress the formation of ortho and para products more effectively.\n\n*   The order of deactivating strength for these groups is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**\n    *   -NO2 is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n    *   -COOH is a strong deactivator.\n    *   -COOC2H5 is also deactivating, but slightly weaker than -COOH.\n\n*   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield will be the reverse of the deactivating strength:\n    *   Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)\n    *   Estimated para yields: -NO2 (~1%), -COOH (~2%), -COOC2H5 (~3%).\n\nThe first part of the sequence is **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**5. Order the Ortho/Para-Directors (Substances 1, 5, 3)**\n\nFor ortho/para directors, we need to compare the ratio of the para product to the ortho product. This ratio is primarily determined by two factors: steric hindrance and electronic effects.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk hinders the approach of the electrophile (Br+) to the adjacent ortho positions more significantly. Consequently, a higher proportion of the substitution occurs at the less hindered para position.\n    *   Therefore, % para-yield (Ethylbenzene) > % para-yield (Toluene).\n    *   This gives us the order: **1 < 5**.\n    *   Typical values for bromination: Toluene (~62% para), Ethylbenzene (~75% para).\n\n*   **Comparing Alkyl Groups with -Cl (3):** The chlorine atom in chlorobenzene is also an ortho/para director. It directs para strongly for two reasons:\n    1.  **Steric Hindrance:** The chlorine atom presents some steric block to the ortho positions.\n    2.  **Electronic Effect:** Chlorine is highly electronegative and has a strong inductive effect (-I), which withdraws electron density and deactivates the ring. This effect is strongest at the ortho position, making it less reactive than the para position.\n    *   This combination of effects makes chlorobenzene highly selective for the para position during bromination, with yields often cited as high as 89%. This yield is greater than that for both toluene and ethylbenzene.\n    *   So, % para-yield (Chlorobenzene) > % para-yield (Ethylbenzene).\n    *   This gives us the order: **5 < 3**.\n\n*   Combining these findings, the order of increasing para-yield for the ortho/para directors is:\n    *   Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n    *   The second part of the sequence is **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n**6. Combine Both Groups for the Final Order**\n\nCombining the ordered groups:\n*   From step 4: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   From step 5: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThe complete order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
