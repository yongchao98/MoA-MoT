    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Problem Statement**\n\nWe are given the following information about a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds:\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (¹H NMR):** Two singlets, ratio 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (¹H NMR):** Three singlets, ratio 2:1:1.\n\nWe need to identify the two compounds from the given options:\n1.  1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)\n2.  1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)\n3.  1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)\n4.  1,4-diethylbenzene\n\n### **2. Verify Molecular Formula and Analyze Individual Spectra**\n\nFirst, let's confirm the molecular formula and predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each compound based on its chemical structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 -> C10H14. Correct.\n    *   Symmetry: This molecule is highly symmetrical. It has two planes of symmetry.\n    *   Aromatic protons: The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Aliphatic protons: All four methyl groups (at positions 1, 2, 4, 5) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 -> C10H14. Correct.\n    *   Symmetry: The molecule has one plane of symmetry passing through C4 and C1-C2.\n    *   Aromatic protons: The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Aliphatic protons: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   C1 and C3 methyls are equivalent (6H).\n        *   C2 methyl is unique (3H).\n        *   C5 methyl is unique (3H).\n        *   This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of **6H:3H:3H**, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   Formula: C6H2(CH3)4 -> C10H14. Correct.\n    *   Symmetry: The molecule has one plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   Aromatic protons: The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Aliphatic protons: There are two distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   C1 and C4 methyls are equivalent (6H).\n        *   C2 and C3 methyls are equivalent (6H).\n        *   This will produce **two singlets** with an integration ratio of **6H:6H**, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Formula: C6H4(C2H5)2 -> C10H14. Correct.\n    *   Symmetry: Highly symmetrical para-substituted benzene.\n    *   Aromatic protons: All four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent. They would produce **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   Aliphatic protons: The ethyl groups have methylene (-CH2-) and methyl (-CH3) protons. Due to spin-spin coupling, these will not be singlets.\n        *   The -CH2- protons will be a **quartet (4H)**.\n        *   The -CH3- protons will be a **triplet (6H)**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of a quartet and triplet rules out 1,4-diethylbenzene, as the problem states the aliphatic signals are all singlets.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Mixture**\n\nThe mixture contains two compounds from the remaining three tetramethylbenzene isomers in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n**Aromatic Region Analysis:**\n*   The spectrum shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   Each of the three candidate isomers (Durene, Isodurene, Prehnitene) produces a single 2H singlet in the aromatic region.\n*   A 1:1 mixture of any two of these isomers will show two singlets (assuming their chemical shifts are different), each integrating to 2H. The ratio will be 2H:2H or 1:1.\n*   This information confirms we have a mixture of two of these isomers but doesn't differentiate between the possible pairs.\n\n**Aliphatic Region Analysis:**\n*   The spectrum shows three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n*   Since the mixture is 1:1, the total number of aliphatic protons is 12H (from compound A) + 12H (from compound B) = 24H.\n*   The total ratio is 2+1+1 = 4 parts.\n*   We can calculate the actual number of protons for each signal:\n    *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n    *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n*   Therefore, the mixture must have three aliphatic singlets corresponding to 12 protons, 6 protons, and 6 protons.\n\nNow, let's see which pair of compounds produces this pattern:\n*   **Aliphatic signals from individuals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB: one signal for 12H\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB: two signals for 6H each\n    *   1,2,3,5-TMB: three signals for 6H, 3H, 3H\n\n*   **Consider the mixture from option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.**\n    *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet of **12H**.\n    *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets of **6H** each.\n    *   Combined, this gives exactly three signals with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Let's check other combinations to be sure:**\n    *   **Mixture of 1,2,4,5-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB (Option D):** Signals would be {12H} and {6H, 3H, 3H}. This results in four signals. To get three signals, an accidental overlap would be required, but no simple overlap yields a 2:1:1 ratio of the total 24H.\n    *   **Mixture of 1,2,3,4-TMB and 1,2,3,5-TMB (Option B):** Signals would be {6H, 6H} and {6H, 3H, 3H}. This gives up to five signals. Again, this combination cannot simply produce the {12H, 6H, 6H} pattern required.\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair that directly explains the observed ¹H NMR data for the mixture is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
