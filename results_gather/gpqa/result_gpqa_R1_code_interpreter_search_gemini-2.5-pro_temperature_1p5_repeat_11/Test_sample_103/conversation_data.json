    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the RV Method and Doppler Shift:** The Radial Velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the light from their host star. The star wobbles as it orbits the common center of mass with the planet. This wobble causes its light to be blueshifted when it moves towards us and redshifted when it moves away. The amount of wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) along our line of sight, according to the Doppler formula: Δλ/λ = v_r/c. The maximum observed shift (given as 5 and 7 miliangstroms) corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star, known as the radial velocity semi-amplitude, K.\n    Therefore, K is directly proportional to the measured wavelength shift amplitude:\n    *   K ∝ Δλ_max\n\n2.  **Relate K to Physical Parameters:** The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\n    K ≈ ( (2πG)^(1/3) * M_p * sin(i) ) / ( P^(1/3) * M_star^(2/3) )\n    where:\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   M_p is the planet's mass.\n    *   M_star is the star's mass.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n    *   i is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n    The term `M_p * sin(i)` is the \"minimum mass\", which is the quantity directly measured by the RV method.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Given Information:** Let's list the parameters for the two systems (Planet #1 and Planet #2).\n    *   **Wavelength shift:** Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ, Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ. Since K ∝ Δλ, the ratio of their RV semi-amplitudes is K₁/K₂ = 5/7.\n    *   **Star mass:** The stars have the same mass (M_star₁ = M_star₂).\n    *   **Planet mass:** The planets have \"masses similar to that of Neptune.\" In the context of RV measurements, this is most reasonably interpreted as the measured minimum masses (`M_p * sin(i)`) being similar for both planets. So, M_p₁ * sin(i₁) ≈ M_p₂ * sin(i₂).\n\n4.  **Establish the Proportionality:** From the formula for K, we can see the relationship between the key variables. We can write this as a proportionality:\n    K ∝ (M_p * sin(i)) / (P^(1/3) * M_star^(2/3))\n\n5.  **Set up the Ratio:** We can now write this proportionality for both systems and take their ratio (System 2 / System 1):\n    K₂ / K₁ = [ (M_p₂ sin(i₂)) / (P₂^(1/3) * M_star₂^(2/3)) ] / [ (M_p₁ sin(i₁)) / (P₁^(1/3) * M_star₁^(2/3)) ]\n\n    This can be rearranged as:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (M_p₂ sin(i₂) / M_p₁ sin(i₁)) * (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3) * (M_star₁ / M_star₂)^(2/3)\n\n6.  **Substitute Known Values:** Now, we substitute the information from step 3 into this equation:\n    *   M_p₂ sin(i₂) / M_p₁ sin(i₁) ≈ 1\n    *   M_star₁ / M_star₂ = 1\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = 7 / 5\n\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    7 / 5 = (1) * (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3) * (1)^(2/3)\n    7 / 5 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n7.  **Solve for the Period Ratio:** We need to find P₂ / P₁. Let's rearrange the equation:\n    (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3) = 5 / 7\n\n    To solve for P₂ / P₁, we cube both sides of the equation:\n    P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Value:** The final step is to compute the value of the ratio.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods (P2/P1)\nperiod_ratio = (5/7)**3\nprint(period_ratio)\n```\n```output\n0.3644314868804665\n```\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.364. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the RV Method and Doppler Shift**: The problem uses the Radial Velocity (RV) method. This method detects exoplanets by measuring the periodic Doppler shift of the host star's spectral lines. The amount of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r). The maximum shift corresponds to the radial velocity semi-amplitude, denoted by K.\n    *   So, K is proportional to the observed maximum wavelength shift Δλ_max.\n    *   For planet #1, K₁ ∝ Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ.\n    *   For planet #2, K₂ ∝ Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is K₂/K₁ = 7/5.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude (K)**: For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by:\n    K ≈ ( (2πG)^(1/3) * M_p * sin(i) ) / ( P^(1/3) * M_star^(2/3) )\n    where:\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   M_p is the planet's mass.\n    *   M_star is the star's mass.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n    *   i is the inclination of the orbit. The term M_p*sin(i) is the minimum mass, which is what the RV method directly measures.\n\n3.  **Set Up the Proportionality**: We can simplify the relationship to focus on the variables that change between the two systems:\n    K ∝ (M_p*sin(i)) / (P^(1/3) * M_star^(2/3))\n\n4.  **Analyze the Given Information**:\n    *   **Star Masses**: The stars have the same mass, so M_star₁ = M_star₂.\n    *   **Planet Masses**: The planets have \"masses similar to that of Neptune\". In the context of the RV method, this implies that the measured minimum masses are similar. Thus, M_p₁*sin(i₁) ≈ M_p₂*sin(i₂).\n\n5.  **Form a Ratio of the Two Systems**: We can write a ratio for System 2 to System 1:\n    K₂ / K₁ = [ (M_p₂*sin(i₂)) / (P₂^(1/3) * M_star₂^(2/3)) ] / [ (M_p₁*sin(i₁)) / (P₁^(1/3) * M_star₁^(2/3)) ]\n\n    This can be rearranged as:\n    K₂ / K₁ = ( M_p₂*sin(i₂) / M_p₁*sin(i₁) ) * ( P₁ / P₂ )^(1/3) * ( M_star₁ / M_star₂ )^(2/3)\n\n6.  **Substitute the Known Values and Ratios**:\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = 7 / 5\n    *   (M_p₂*sin(i₂)) / (M_p₁*sin(i₁)) ≈ 1 (since the minimum masses are similar)\n    *   M_star₁ / M_star₂ = 1 (since the star masses are the same)\n\n    Substituting these into the equation gives:\n    7 / 5 = (1) * (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3) * (1)^(2/3)\n    7 / 5 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n7.  **Solve for the Period Ratio (P₂ / P₁)**: We want to find the ratio of the orbital period of planet #2 to planet #1, which is P₂ / P₁.\n    First, let's invert both sides of the equation to get P₂/P₁ on the left side:\n    5 / 7 = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n\n    Now, to isolate P₂ / P₁, we need to cube both sides of the equation:\n    (5 / 7)³ = P₂ / P₁\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Value**:\n    P₂ / P₁ = (5 * 5 * 5) / (7 * 7 * 7) = 125 / 343\n    P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThe calculation shows that the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
