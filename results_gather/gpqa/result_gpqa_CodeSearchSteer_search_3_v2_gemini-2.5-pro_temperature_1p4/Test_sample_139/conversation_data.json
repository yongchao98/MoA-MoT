    "Based on the clues provided, the substances can be systematically identified:\n\n*   **Substance B**: The melting point of B is stated to be very close to 277 K. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C), while heavy water (D₂O) melts at 276.97 K (~3.82 °C). This is very close to 277 K, making **Substance B heavy water (D₂O)**. The \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the description of Substance X is therefore deuterium (D).\n\n*   **Substance X**: This substance contains deuterium and, along with its lighter analog, is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Its reaction with a keto acid produces a compound with two oxygen atoms. Powerful reducing agents like Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) and its deuterated analog, **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**, are known for this. A keto acid (containing a ketone and a carboxylic acid, R-CO-R'-COOH) is reduced by the potent LiAlH₄ to a diol (a molecule with two alcohol groups, R-CH(OH)-R'-CH₂OH), which has two oxygen atoms. Milder reducing agents like sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) would not typically reduce the carboxylic acid group. The violent reaction described also points towards LiAlD₄ over the milder NaBD₄. Thus, **Substance X is LiAlD₄**.\n\n*   **Liquid Y, Gas W, and Precipitate G**: Substance X (LiAlD₄) reacts violently with liquid Y to produce gas W and precipitate G. The gas W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Deuterium gas (D₂) has 2 protons and 2 neutrons and is produced when LiAlD₄ reacts with a deuterium source like heavy water (D₂O). So, **Gas W is D₂** and **Liquid Y is D₂O**. The reaction is: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂. The precipitate, G, is aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃. The final clue is that G, when heated, releases B (D₂O). Indeed, aluminum hydroxide (and its deuterated version) decomposes upon heating to yield aluminum oxide and water (or heavy water). 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O. This confirms the identities of all substances.\n\n**Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X (LiAlD₄). For this calculation, we use the mass numbers of the most common or relevant isotopes (an integer value representing the sum of protons and neutrons).\n\n1.  **Identify elements in X**: The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D), which is an isotope of Hydrogen.\n2.  **Determine lightest and heaviest elements**:\n    *   Deuterium (D) has a mass number of 2.\n    *   Lithium (Li) has a mass number of 7 (for its most abundant isotope, ⁷Li).\n    *   Aluminum (Al) has a mass number of 27 (for its only stable isotope, ²⁷Al).\n    *   The lightest element is **Deuterium (D)**.\n    *   The heaviest element is **Aluminum (Al)**.\n3.  **Calculate cumulative masses**: The formula for Substance X is LiAlD₄.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the lightest element (D)**: There are 4 atoms of Deuterium.\n        Mass = 4 × (mass number of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Cumulative mass of the heaviest element (Al)**: There is 1 atom of Aluminum.\n        Mass = 1 × (mass number of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n4.  **Sum the cumulative masses**:\n    Total = (Cumulative mass of D) + (Cumulative mass of Al) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n<<<C>>>"
