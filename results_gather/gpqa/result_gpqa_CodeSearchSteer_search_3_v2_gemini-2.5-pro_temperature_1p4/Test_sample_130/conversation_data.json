    "### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Identify the Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR (indicating two equivalent vinyl protons) and two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons) in its ¹³C NMR. This spectroscopic data uniquely identifies the anhydride as maleic anhydride.\n\n2.  **Identify the Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction:** The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition. This reaction is known to produce a bicyclic adduct. The total proton count in the product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) is 16: 12 from the four methyl groups, 2 from the anhydride moiety, and 2 from the C5 position of the cyclopentadiene, which becomes the C7 bridge in the product.\n\n4.  **Consider Stereochemistry (Endo vs. Exo):** The Diels-Alder reaction can lead to two major stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products. The \"endo rule\" states that the kinetically favored product, which is typically the major product, is the *endo* isomer. This is due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile and the developing pi system of the diene in the transition state.\n\n5.  **Predict Product Structures:**\n    *   **Endo Product (Major):** In the *endo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *syn* (on the same side) with respect to the one-carbon bridge (C7) and underneath the C-C double bond of the newly formed bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system. This geometry places the two protons of the anhydride moiety (let's call them H_A) in close spatial proximity to the *syn* methyl groups (the two methyl groups on the same side as the anhydride ring).\n    *   **Exo Product (Minor):** In the *exo* adduct, the anhydride ring is oriented *anti* (on the opposite side) to the one-carbon bridge (C7). This moves the anhydride protons (H_A) far away from the methyl groups.\n\n6.  **Interpret the NOESY Spectra:** A 2D NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) experiment shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å), regardless of through-bond coupling.\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is **present** in the spectrum of the major product but **absent or weak** in the minor product.\n    *   This observation is the key to identifying the interacting protons. The defining stereochemical difference between the *endo* and *exo* products is the distance between the anhydride protons (H_A) and the methyl groups.\n    *   Therefore, the cross-peak in the major (*endo*) product must be due to the spatial proximity of the anhydride protons (H_A) and the nearby methyl groups.\n\n7.  **Assign NMR Signals and Match with Options:**\n    *   **Anhydride Protons (H_A):** These two protons are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. They are located on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups and part of a strained bicyclic system, so a chemical shift around 3.5 ppm is expected. They should appear as a 2H singlet.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** There are four methyl groups, totaling 12 protons. In the *endo* product, they are not all equivalent. The two *syn* methyls are in a different chemical environment than the two *anti* methyls. This leads to two distinct 6H singlets. Typical shifts for methyl groups on a double bond are in the 1-2 ppm range. The options suggest ~1.0 ppm and ~1.7 ppm.\n    *   The NOESY cross-peak in the major product will connect the signal for the **2H anhydride protons** with the signal for the **6H *syn* methyl protons**.\n    *   Let's examine the choices:\n        *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: Connects the two different methyl group signals.\n        *   B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: Connects a bridge proton with the anhydride protons.\n        *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: Connects one set of methyl groups with the anhydride protons.\n        *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: Connects a methyl group with a bridge proton.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** Option C is the only one that correctly identifies the interaction between the two equivalent anhydride protons (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) and one of the sets of equivalent methyl groups (6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm). This interaction is strong in the major *endo* isomer and weak or absent in the minor *exo* isomer, perfectly matching the experimental description.\n\nFinal Answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
