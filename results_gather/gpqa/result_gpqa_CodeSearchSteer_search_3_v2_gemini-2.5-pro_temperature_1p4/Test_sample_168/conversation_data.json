    "### Analysis of the Decay Scenarios\n\nThe problem describes two types of nuclear decay. Let's analyze the energy distribution for each, using the strong analogy of double-beta decay in nuclear physics.\n\n**Scenario 1: The Original Decay (2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V)**\n\nThis decay is analogous to the standard, observed two-neutrino double beta decay (2νββ). In this process, the decay energy, known as the Q-value, is shared among the four light particles in the final state (two E particles and two V particles), as well as the recoil of the two B nucleons. Because the energy is distributed among multiple particles, the sum of the kinetic energies of the two E particles results in a continuous spectrum. The spectrum extends from zero up to an \"endpoint,\" which is the maximum possible energy the two E particles can have. This maximum, or endpoint, occurs when the other light particles (the two V particles) carry away zero kinetic energy.\n\n**Scenario 2: The Variant Decay (2A -> 2B + 2E + M)**\n\nThis decay involves the emission of a single exotic, massless particle M instead of the two V particles. This is analogous to Majoron-emitting neutrinoless double beta decay (0νMββ).\n\n*   **Nature of the Spectrum:** In this case, the decay energy (Q-value) is shared among the two E particles and the single M particle. Since there are still three particles in the final state sharing the available energy (2E + M, ignoring the recoil of B), the energy distribution for the two E particles remains continuous. The E particles can take on a range of energies depending on how much energy the M particle carries away.\n\n*   **Shape of the Spectrum:** The distribution of energy among the final particles is governed by phase space considerations. A decay with three final light particles (2E, M) has a different phase space from a decay with four final light particles (2E, 2V). This results in a different shape for the energy spectrum of the E particles. Specifically, the peak of the energy distribution for the Majoron-emitting decay is shifted to a higher energy compared to the two-neutrino decay.\n\n*   **Endpoint of the Spectrum:** The endpoint represents the total kinetic energy available to the final particles. This energy comes from the difference in rest mass between the initial and final particles.\n    *   **Q-value for decay 1:** Q₁ = E_initial - E_final = (2mₐ - 2mₑ - 2mₑ - 2mᵥ)c²\n    *   **Q-value for decay 2:** Q₂ = E_initial - E_final = (2mₐ - 2mₑ - 2mₑ - mₘ)c²\n\nThe problem states that particle M is **massless** (mₘ = 0), while particles V are described as \"much lighter,\" which implies they have some non-zero mass (mᵥ > 0), as is the case for real neutrinos.\n\nComparing the two Q-values:\nQ₂ = (2mₐ - 2mₑ - 2mₑ)c²\nQ₁ = Q₂ - 2mᵥc²\n\nSince mᵥ > 0, the total kinetic energy available in the second decay (Q₂) is greater than that of the first decay (Q₁). Therefore, the endpoint of the energy spectrum for the E particles increases.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn the variant decay, the energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles remains continuous, but its shape is adjusted due to the different number of particles in the final state. Critically, because the single emitted particle M is massless, while the two V particles it replaces have mass, the total rest mass of the final products is lower. This leads to a higher total kinetic energy release, and thus an increase in the endpoint of the E particle energy spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
