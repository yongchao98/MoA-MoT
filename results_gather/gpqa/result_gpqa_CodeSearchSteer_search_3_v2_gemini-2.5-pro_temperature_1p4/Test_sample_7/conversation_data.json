    "Here is an analysis of the experimental results to determine the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### Analysis of the Genetic Data\n\n1.  **Role of G2:** The knockout mutant *g2* shows 0% resistance, a complete loss of the wild-type phenotype. Furthermore, any double mutant that includes the *g2* knockout (*g1g2* and *g2g3*) also shows 0% resistance. When a double mutant exhibits the phenotype of one of the single mutants, that gene is considered epistatic to the other. In this case, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. This pattern strongly suggests that G2 is an essential upstream gene in the resistance pathway. As the problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor, which are proteins that regulate other genes, G2 is the most logical candidate for this role.\n\n2.  **Roles of G1 and G3:**\n    *   The single mutant *g1* has a moderate effect, reducing resistance to 75%.\n    *   The single mutant *g3* has a stronger effect, reducing resistance to 50%.\n    *   The double mutant *g1g3* shows resistance of only 10%. If the effects were simply additive, one would expect a resistance of 100% - (25% loss from g1 + 50% loss from g3) = 25%.\n    *   The observed phenotype in the *g1g3* double mutant (10% resistance) is much more severe than the expected additive effect (25% resistance). This phenomenon is known as a synergistic interaction. Synergy often points towards **gene redundancy**, where two genes perform similar or parallel functions. The loss of one can be partially compensated for, but the loss of both leads to a much more severe phenotype.\n\n3.  **Epistasis between G1 and G3:** Epistasis occurs when one gene's phenotype masks the effect of another gene. The *g1g3* double mutant has a resistance level (10%) that is different from both the *g1* single mutant (75%) and the *g3* single mutant (50%). Therefore, neither G1 nor G3 is strictly epistatic to the other based on these results. The options provided contain a flawed premise regarding epistasis between G1 and G3.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **G2 is a transcription factor:** This is supported by the complete loss of resistance in the *g2* mutant and its epistatic relationship over G1 and G3.\n*   **G1 and G3 show gene redundancy:** This is the best explanation for the synergistic effect observed in the *g1g3* double mutant, where the combined effect is greater than the sum of individual effects.\n*   **The claims of epistasis between G1 and G3 in the options are incorrect.**\n\nEvaluating the given choices, option A contains the two most accurate conclusions derived from the experimental data, despite having an incorrect statement about epistasis.\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.** This option correctly identifies G2's role and the redundant relationship between G1 and G3. The final clause is incorrect.\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.** \"Pleiotropy\" (one gene affecting multiple traits) cannot be determined from this experiment.\n*   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.** This incorrectly identifies G1 as the transcription factor.\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.** We cannot determine if they share a promoter from this data.\n\nOption A provides the best description of the genetic interactions among the choices.\n\n<<<A>>>"
