    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we must first perform a stoichiometric analysis of the acid-base neutralization reactions. The key is to identify the limiting and excess reactants to find the composition of the final mixture.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial moles of each species.**\n    *   **Weak Acid (CH3COOH):**\n        *   Moles = Molarity × Volume\n        *   Moles = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 moles\n    *   **Strong Acid (HCl):**\n        *   Moles = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 moles\n        *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.080 moles of H⁺ ions.\n    *   **Strong Base (Ba(OH)2):**\n        *   Moles = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 moles\n        *   Barium hydroxide is a strong base that provides two hydroxide ions (OH⁻) per formula unit.\n        *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 moles = 0.180 moles.\n\n2.  **Perform neutralization reactions.**\n    *   First, the strong acid (HCl) will react with the strong base (Ba(OH)2).\n        *   Moles of H⁺ = 0.080 mol\n        *   Moles of OH⁻ = 0.180 mol\n        *   After this reaction, all the H⁺ from HCl is consumed.\n        *   Remaining moles of OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n    *   Next, the remaining strong base (OH⁻) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n        *   Moles of CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n        *   Remaining moles of OH⁻ = 0.100 mol\n        *   After this reaction, all the CH3COOH is consumed.\n        *   Excess moles of OH⁻ = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n3.  **Determine the composition of the final solution.**\n    *   After all reactions, the solution contains an excess of 0.050 moles of OH⁻ ions, which is a strong base.\n    *   The weak acid (CH3COOH) has been completely converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO⁻). However, the pH will be overwhelmingly determined by the concentration of the excess strong base.\n\n4.  **Calculate the final pH.**\n    *   **Total Volume:** The total volume of the mixed solution is the sum of the individual volumes.\n        *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.200 L\n    *   **Final OH⁻ Concentration:**\n        *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n        *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n    *   **Calculate pOH:** The pOH is the negative logarithm of the hydroxide ion concentration.\n        *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n        *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n    *   **Calculate pH:** The pH is found using the relationship pH + pOH = 14.\n        *   pH = 14 - pOH\n        *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nTherefore, the pH of the resulting solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<B>>>"
