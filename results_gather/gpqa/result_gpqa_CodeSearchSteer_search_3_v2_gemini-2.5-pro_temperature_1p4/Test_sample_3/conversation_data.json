    "In a universe where magnetic monopoles (isolated north or south poles) exist, two of Maxwell's equations would need to be modified to account for them.\n\n1.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism (related to the divergence of the magnetic field):** In our universe, this law states that the divergence of the magnetic field (∇ · B) is zero. This is the mathematical expression of the fact that magnetic field lines always form closed loops and that there are no magnetic monopoles to act as sources or sinks. If magnetic monopoles existed, they would be sources of the magnetic field, so this law would be changed to show that the divergence of the magnetic field is proportional to the magnetic charge density (ρm).\n\n2.  **Faraday's Law of Induction (related to the circulation of the electric field):** This law (∇ × E = -∂B/∂t) describes how a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field. If magnetic monopoles exist, they could move, creating a \"magnetic current\" (Jm). This magnetic current would also create a circulating electric field, so an additional term for this magnetic current would need to be added to Faraday's Law.\n\nTherefore, the two equations that would be different are the ones concerning the divergence of the magnetic field and the circulation (or curl) of the electric field.\n\n<<<A>>>"
