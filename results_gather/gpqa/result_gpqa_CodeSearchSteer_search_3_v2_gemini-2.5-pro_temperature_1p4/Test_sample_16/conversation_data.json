    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to determine the concentration of calcium ions.\n\n1.  **Reaction Setup**: The Ca-EDTA complex is in equilibrium with its dissociated ions in solution. The dissociation reaction is:\n    [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Constant**: The problem provides the formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA) for the complex, which is 5x10¹⁰.\n    K_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])\n\n    For dissociation, it's more convenient to use the dissociation constant (K_d), which is the inverse of the formation constant.\n    K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5x10¹⁰) = 2.0 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n3.  **ICE Table**: We can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the equilibrium concentrations. We start with 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex and assume it dissociates by an amount 'x'.\n\n| Species | [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ | Ca²⁺ | EDTA⁴⁻ |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Initial** | 0.02 M | 0 M | 0 M |\n| **Change** | -x | +x | +x |\n| **Equilibrium**| 0.02 - x | x | x |\n\n4.  **Calculation**: Now, we plug the equilibrium concentrations into the dissociation constant expression:\n    K_d = ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]\n    2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n\n5.  **Simplification**: Since the formation constant is very large, the dissociation constant K_d is very small. This means the complex is very stable and the amount of dissociation, 'x', will be negligible compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can simplify the equation:\n    0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n6.  **Solve for x**:\n    2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n    x² ≈ (2.0 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\n    x² ≈ 4.0 x 10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4.0 x 10⁻¹³)\n    x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions in the solution is represented by 'x'.\n\nTherefore, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This matches option B. The problem statement assumes an \"ideal pH\", which implies we should use the given formation constant directly without adjusting for pH-dependent side reactions.\n\n<<<B>>>"
