    "The state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled angular momentum representation as `|l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>`. In this representation, `l₁` and `l₂` are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the individual electrons, while `l` and `m` are the quantum numbers for the total orbital angular momentum and its z-component, respectively.\n\nA measurement of the z-components of the individual electrons' orbital angular momenta, `L₁z` and `L₂z`, corresponds to projecting this coupled state onto the uncoupled basis, which is represented by `|l₁, m₁, l₂, m₂>`. Here, `m₁` and `m₂` are the magnetic quantum numbers for the individual electrons.\n\nThe question asks for the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of `L₁z` as -ħ and the eigenvalue of `L₂z` as -ħ. This corresponds to finding the system in the state where `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n\nA fundamental principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This is expressed by the selection rule `m = m₁ + m₂`. For a measurement to be possible, this condition must be satisfied.\n\nIn this problem:\n*   The initial state has `m = -1`.\n*   The desired final state has `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1`.\n\nLet's check if the selection rule is met:\n`m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`\n\nSince `m = -1`, we have `-1 ≠ -2`. The condition `m = m₁ + m₂` is not satisfied.\n\nBecause of this, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which represents the overlap between the initial coupled state and the desired uncoupled state, is zero. Consequently, the probability of measuring this outcome is also zero.\n\n<<<C>>>"
