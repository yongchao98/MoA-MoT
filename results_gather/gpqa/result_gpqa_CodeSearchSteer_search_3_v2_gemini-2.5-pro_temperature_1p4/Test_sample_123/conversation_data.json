    "The fraction of particles that survive, ƒ, is related to the time of flight in the lab frame, t, the particle's mean proper lifetime, τ, and its Lorentz factor, γ. This relationship is described by the survival probability equation from the theory of special relativity.\n\n### Key Principles\n\n1.  **Particle Decay**: The decay of unstable particles follows an exponential law. The probability P that a particle survives for a time *t* in its own rest frame is given by `P(t) = exp(-t/τ)`, where τ is the mean proper lifetime.\n2.  **Time Dilation**: In the laboratory's frame of reference, the lifetime of a moving particle appears longer due to time dilation. The lifetime as measured in the lab (t_lab) is given by `t_lab = γτ`, where γ is the Lorentz factor and τ is the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's own rest frame).\n3.  **Survival Probability in the Lab Frame**: The fraction of particles, *f*, reaching the detector is the survival probability over the time of flight, *t_flight*. The time of flight is the detector radius R divided by the particle's velocity, v. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, v is approximately the speed of light, c. Therefore, `t_flight ≈ R/c`.\n\nThe survival probability in the lab frame is given by the formula `ƒ = exp( -t_flight / t_lab )`.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for `t_flight` and `t_lab`, we get:\n`ƒ = exp( -(R/c) / (γτ) )` which can be rewritten as `ƒ = exp( -R / (cγτ) )`\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\nThe problem can be solved by setting up a ratio, since the term `R / (cτ)` is constant for both scenarios.\n\n**Initial Scenario:**\n*   Lorentz factor, γ₁ = 20\n*   Fraction of surviving particles, ƒ₁ = 1/3\n\nPlugging these into the equation:\n`1/3 = exp( -R / (20cτ) )`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -R / (20cτ)`\n`-ln(3) = -R / (20cτ)`\n`ln(3) = R / (20cτ)`  (Equation 1)\n\n**Target Scenario:**\n*   Lorentz factor, γ₂ = ?\n*   Fraction of surviving particles, ƒ₂ = 2/3\n\nPlugging these values in:\n`2/3 = exp( -R / (γ₂cτ) )`\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(2/3) = -R / (γ₂cτ)`\n`-ln(3/2) = -R / (γ₂cτ)`\n`ln(3/2) = R / (γ₂cτ)` (Equation 2)\n\n**Solving for γ₂:**\n\nFrom Equation 1, we can express the constant term `R / (cτ)` as:\n`R / (cτ) = 20 * ln(3)`\n\nNow, substitute this into Equation 2:\n`ln(3/2) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n\nRearranging to solve for γ₂:\n`γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(3/2)`\n\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms:\n*   ln(3) ≈ 1.0986\n*   ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055\n\n`γ₂ = (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ = 21.972 / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThis calculated value is approximately 54.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe required Lorentz factor to have about two-thirds of the particles reaching the detector is approximately 54. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) 40\nB) 54\nC) 68\nD) 28\n\nThe closest choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
