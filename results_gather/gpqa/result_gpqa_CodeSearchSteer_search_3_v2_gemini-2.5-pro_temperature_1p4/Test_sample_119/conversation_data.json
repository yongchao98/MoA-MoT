    "Here is the step-by-step derivation for how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with parallax, assuming a uniform distribution of stars in space.\n\n1.  **Uniform Star Distribution**: The initial assumption is that the density of stars, represented by ρ, is constant throughout space. This means there's the same number of stars in any given volume, regardless of its location.\n\n2.  **Volume of a Spherical Shell**: To find the number of stars at a certain distance, we can consider a thin spherical shell of space. Let the distance from Earth be `d` and the thickness of the shell be a very small amount `dd`. The volume of this thin shell (`dV`) is its surface area (4πd²) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`).\n    *   `dV = 4πd² * dd`\n\n3.  **Number of Stars in the Shell**: Since the star density (ρ) is constant, the number of stars (`dN`) within this shell is the density multiplied by the volume of the shell.\n    *   `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n4.  **Relating Distance to Parallax**: Parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`). For simplicity in astronomical calculations, distance in parsecs is defined as the reciprocal of the parallax in arcseconds.\n    *   `d = 1 / plx`\n\n5.  **Converting the Differential**: We also need to relate the thickness of the shell (`dd`) to the change in parallax (`d(plx)`). We can find this by taking the derivative of the distance equation with respect to parallax.\n    *   `d = 1 / plx = plx⁻¹`\n    *   `dd / d(plx) = -1 * plx⁻² = -1 / plx²`\n    *   Therefore, `dd = -(1 / plx²) * d(plx)`. When considering the number of stars, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign (which just indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases).\n\n6.  **Substituting into the Star Count Equation**: Now we replace the distance (`d`) and the shell thickness (`dd`) in the equation for `dN` with their parallax equivalents.\n    *   We start with: `dN = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n    *   Substitute `d = 1 / plx`: `dN = ρ * 4π * (1 / plx)² * dd`\n    *   Substitute `dd = (1 / plx²) * d(plx)`: `dN = ρ * 4π * (1 / plx²) * (1 / plx²) * d(plx)`\n    *   Simplifying this gives: `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Final Proportionality**: The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN / d(plx)`. From the equation above, we can see this relationship:\n    *   `dN / d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n    *   Since 4, π, and ρ are all constants, we find that the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to `1 / plx⁴`. This relationship is a known element in astronomical analyses, such as in the context of the Lutz-Kelker bias.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax as `~ 1/plx⁴`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
