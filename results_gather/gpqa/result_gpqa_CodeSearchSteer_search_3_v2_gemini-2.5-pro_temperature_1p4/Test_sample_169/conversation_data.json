    "The problem asks for the expectation value of the spin component in the y-direction, denoted as ⟨Sy⟩, for an electron in the spin state |ψ⟩ = (3i, 4). The calculation of an expectation value in quantum mechanics is a standard procedure.\n\nFirst, it's necessary to define the spin state and the operator.\n*   The unnormalized spin state is given as a column vector:\n    |ψ⟩ = [ 3i, 4 ]\n*   The corresponding bra vector ⟨ψ| is the conjugate transpose of |ψ⟩:\n    ⟨ψ| = [ -3i, 4 ]\n*   The spin operator in the y-direction, S_y, is defined as S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant and σ_y is the corresponding Pauli matrix.\n    σ_y =\n    ( 0  -i )\n    ( i   0 )\n\nThe expectation value ⟨Sy⟩ is calculated using the formula: ⟨Sy⟩ = ⟨ψ|Sy|ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩.\n\n1.  **Calculate the normalization factor ⟨ψ|ψ⟩:**\n    This is the inner product of the state with itself.\n    ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * [3i, 4] = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = -9(i²) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25.\n\n2.  **Calculate the action of the operator on the state, Sy|ψ⟩:**\n    Sy|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i, 4]\n    Sy|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ (0)(3i) + (-i)(4), (i)(3i) + (0)(4) ]\n    Sy|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ -4i, 3i² ] = (ħ/2) * [ -4i, -3 ]\n\n3.  **Calculate the full expression ⟨ψ|Sy|ψ⟩:**\n    ⟨ψ|Sy|ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * (ħ/2) * [-4i, -3]\n    ⟨ψ|Sy|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) ]\n    ⟨ψ|Sy|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ 12i² - 12 ] = (ħ/2) * [ -12 - 12 ] = (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12ħ.\n    This exact calculation is also demonstrated in an online physics problem solution.\n\n4.  **Compute the final expectation value:**\n    ⟨Sy⟩ = (-12ħ) / 25 = -12ħ/25.\n\nThis result means that if one were to measure the y-component of the spin for a large number of electrons all prepared in this identical state, the average of all the measurements would be -12ħ/25. The possible individual outcomes of a single measurement, however, can only be +ħ/2 or -ħ/2.\n\nComparing the result to the given options:\nA) 25*hbar/2\nB) -12*hbar/25\nC) -25*hbar/2\nD) 12*hbar/25\n\nThe calculated value -12ħ/25 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
