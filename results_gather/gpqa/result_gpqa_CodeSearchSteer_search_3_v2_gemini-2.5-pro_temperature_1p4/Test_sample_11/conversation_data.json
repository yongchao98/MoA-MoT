    "To find the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a stationary pion (Pi+), we will use the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nThe decay process is:\nPi(+) → mu(+) + ν\n\nGiven:\n*   The pion (Pi+) is stationary.\n*   Rest mass of Pi+ (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of mu+ (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The neutrino (ν) is assumed to be massless.\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy**\nSince the pion is at rest, its initial energy is its rest mass energy. This energy is converted into the total energy of the products (muon and neutrino). The total energy of a product particle is the sum of its rest mass energy and its kinetic energy (KE).\n\n*   **Initial Energy (E_initial):**\n    E_initial = m_π * c² = 139.6 MeV\n\n*   **Final Energy (E_final):**\n    E_final = (m_μ * c² + KE_μ) + (m_ν * c² + KE_ν)\n    Since the neutrino is massless, its rest mass energy is zero, so its total energy is just its kinetic energy (E_ν = KE_ν).\n    E_final = (105.7 MeV + KE_μ) + KE_ν\n\n*   **Equating Initial and Final Energies:**\n    139.6 MeV = 105.7 MeV + KE_μ + KE_ν\n    KE_μ + KE_ν = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV\n    KE_μ + KE_ν = 33.9 MeV\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum**\nThe initial momentum is zero because the pion is stationary. To conserve momentum, the product particles must have equal and opposite momenta.\n\n*   Let 'p' be the magnitude of the momentum of both the muon and the neutrino.\n    p_μ = p_ν = p\n\n**3. Calculation**\nWe can express the kinetic energies in terms of momentum.\n\n*   For the massless neutrino, the energy is given by E_ν = p * c. Therefore:\n    KE_ν = p * c\n\n*   For the muon, the total energy (E_μ) is related to its momentum and rest mass by the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E_μ² = (p * c)² + (m_μ * c²)².\n    We also know from energy conservation that E_μ = E_initial - E_ν = (m_π * c²) - (p * c).\n\nNow we can solve for the momentum 'p':\n(m_π * c² - p * c)² = (p * c)² + (m_μ * c²)²\n(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n\nSimplifying the equation gives:\npc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2(m_πc²)]\npc = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\npc = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2\npc = 8315.67 / 279.2\npc ≈ 29.78 MeV\n\nNow we can find the kinetic energies:\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_ν):**\n    KE_ν = pc ≈ 29.8 MeV.\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_μ):**\n    Using the sum of kinetic energies we found earlier:\n    KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - KE_ν\n    KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - 29.8 MeV\n    KE_μ ≈ 4.1 MeV.\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. One source confirms a measured kinetic energy for the muon of 4.13 MeV, consistent with these calculations.\n\nComparing our results with the given options:\nA) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nB) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nC) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nD) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\n\nThe calculated values match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
