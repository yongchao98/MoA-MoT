    "The user wants to find the energy of a Lithium-6 nucleus accelerated to 0.96c. The question is phrased as \"the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC),\" but the options are specific energy values in GeV. This suggests I need to calculate a specific energy for the ion, not a general characteristic of the RHIC. Based on the options, the most plausible interpretation is the *total relativistic energy* of the ion.\n\nHere's a refined plan:\n\n1.  **Confirm the nucleus:** X is Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Lithium's atomic number is 3 (3 protons). Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 (⁶Li), with 3 protons and 3 neutrons.\n2.  **Find the precise rest mass of the ⁶Li nucleus.** I need this in atomic mass units (u) for precision. The search results provide this.\n    *   Result gives the atomic mass of ⁶Li as 6.015122887 u and the calculated nuclear mass as 6.0134771 u. I will use the nuclear mass for the calculation, as the problem is about accelerating the nucleus.\n3.  **Find the conversion factor from atomic mass units (u) to GeV/c².**\n    *   Result gives 1 u = 931.4941 MeV/c² = 0.9314941 GeV/c².\n4.  **Calculate the rest energy (E₀) of the ⁶Li nucleus.**\n    *   E₀ = (mass in u) * (conversion factor in GeV/c²/u) * c²\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ) for v = 0.96c.**\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - (v/c)²)\n6.  **Calculate the total relativistic energy (E).**\n    *   E = γ * E₀\n7.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n\n**Execution of the refined plan:**\n\n**1. Nucleus:** Confirmed as ⁶Li.\n\n**2. Rest Mass (m₀):**\n*   From search result, the nuclear mass of ⁶Li is 6.0134771 u.\n\n**3. Conversion Factor:**\n*   From search result, 1 u = 0.9314941 GeV/c².\n\n**4. Rest Energy (E₀):**\n*   E₀ = 6.0134771 u * 0.9314941 GeV/c²/u * c²\n*   E₀ = 5.601530 GeV\n\n**5. Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n*   v = 0.96c\n*   v²/c² = (0.96)² = 0.9216\n*   1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784\n*   γ = 1 / √0.0784 = 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857\n\n**6. Total Relativistic Energy (E):**\n*   E = γ * E₀\n*   E = 3.57142857 * 5.601530 GeV\n*   E = 20.00546... GeV\n\n**7. Compare with options:**\n*   A) 21.419 GeV\n*   B) 20.132 GeV\n*   C) 18.475 GeV\n*   D) 23.069 GeV\n\nMy calculated value is E ≈ 20.005 GeV. This is very close to option B) 20.132 GeV. Let me check for possible discrepancies in my calculation or constants.\n\nCould the mass be the *atomic* mass instead of the *nuclear* mass? Let's recalculate with the atomic mass. The electrons' rest energy is usually considered negligible in this context, but let's be thorough.\n\n*   Atomic mass of ⁶Li = 6.015122887 u.\n*   E₀ (atomic) = 6.015122887 u * 0.9314941 GeV/c²/u * c² = 5.60305 GeV\n*   E (atomic) = γ * E₀ (atomic) = 3.57142857 * 5.60305 GeV = 20.01089 GeV.\n\nThis value is still approximately 20.01 GeV, which is closer to 20.005 GeV than to 20.132 GeV. The difference is about 0.6%. This discrepancy could arise from slightly different constant values used by the source of the problem.\n\nLet's work backward from option B.\n*   If E = 20.132 GeV, then E₀ = E / γ = 20.132 GeV / 3.57142857 = 5.63702 GeV.\n*   This would imply a mass of m₀ = 5.63702 GeV/c² / 0.9314941 GeV/c²/u = 6.0516 u.\nThis mass (6.0516 u) is not the correct mass for ⁶Li.\n\nLet me re-check the Lorentz factor calculation.\n*   γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28. This is exact.\n\nLet me check the constants again.\n*   Mass of ⁶Li nucleus: 6.0134771 u\n*   Mass of ⁶Li atom: 6.015122 u\n*   1 amu = 931.4941 MeV/c²\n\nThere might be a slight variation in the amu to MeV conversion factor.\nLet's try another source. `1 amu c² = 931.49432 MeV`\nLet's use this value (0.93149432 GeV).\n\n*   E₀ (nuclear) = 6.0134771 u * 0.93149432 GeV/u = 5.601531 GeV\n*   E = 3.57142857 * 5.601531 GeV = 20.00547 GeV.\n\nThis is still ~20.005 GeV.\n\nWhat if the \"Energy of the RHIC\" refers to the total energy *per nucleon*?\n*   Total Energy per nucleon = E / A = 20.005 GeV / 6 = 3.334 GeV/nucleon. This is not among the options.\n\nWhat if it refers to the *kinetic* energy?\n*   KE = E - E₀ = 20.005 GeV - 5.601 GeV = 14.404 GeV. Not among the options.\n*   KE per nucleon = 14.404 GeV / 6 = 2.400 GeV/nucleon. Not among the options.\n\nThe most plausible target for the answer is the total relativistic energy, E = γm₀c². My calculated value is ~20.01 GeV. Option B is 20.132 GeV. The difference is ~127 MeV. This is significant.\n\nLet me reconsider the problem statement and common practices. Collider energies are complex. However, this is a physics problem with multiple-choice answers, which usually points to a specific calculation. The most standard calculation for \"the energy\" of a relativistic particle is its total energy E = γm₀c².\n\nWhere could the discrepancy come from?\n1.  Slightly different constants for mass or conversion factor.\n2.  A misunderstanding of \"energy of the RHIC\".\n3.  An error in the question or options provided.\n\nLet's assume the calculation method is correct and try to find constants that would lead to option B. I already tried working backward from B, which resulted in an incorrect mass.\n\nWhat if the velocity is slightly different?\n*   If E = 20.132 GeV and E₀ = 5.6015 GeV, then γ = E/E₀ = 20.132 / 5.6015 = 3.5941.\n*   γ = 1 / sqrt(1-v²/c²) => γ² = 1 / (1-v²/c²) => 1-v²/c² = 1/γ²\n*   v²/c² = 1 - 1/γ² = 1 - 1/(3.5941)² = 1 - 1/12.917 = 1 - 0.0774 = 0.9226\n*   v/c = sqrt(0.9226) = 0.9605.\nThis is extremely close to 0.96c. It's possible the value 0.96c is rounded.\n\nLet's assume the question and option B are correct and the discrepancy comes from the precision of the constants I am using. The problem asks for a precision of 1e-4.\n\nLet's recalculate with the highest precision I can find.\n*   `m(6Li nucleus)`: The difference between atomic and nuclear mass is the mass of 3 electrons and their binding energy. `m_e` = 0.511 MeV/c². So 3 * `m_e` = 1.533 MeV/c². The electron binding energy is much smaller (in the eV range).\n    *   `m(6Li atom)` = 6.015122887 u\n    *   `m(electrons)` = 3 * 0.00054858 u = 0.00164574 u\n    *   `m(6Li nucleus)` ≈ 6.015122887 - 0.00164574 = 6.013477147 u. This matches the provided nuclear mass value.\n*   `1 u` = 931.49410242 MeV/c² = 0.93149410242 GeV/c²\n\nLet's use these values:\n*   E₀ = 6.013477147 * 0.93149410242 = 5.6015303 GeV\n*   γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²) = 3.5714285714... (this is 1/0.28)\n*   E = 5.6015303 GeV * 3.5714285714 = 20.00546535... GeV\n\nMy calculation is consistently yielding ~20.005 GeV. Option B is 20.132 GeV. This is a 0.63% difference. It's a small but non-negligible difference.\n\nIs there any other interpretation? Maybe \"energy of the RHIC\" implies a collision energy? If two such ions collide head-on, the center-of-mass energy would be `√s = 2 * E_beam`. `2 * 20.005 = 40.01` GeV. This is not among the options.\n\nLet's scrutinize the options again. It's possible that the mass value used to create the question was different. What if it was just 6 * proton mass?\n*   m_p = 938.272 MeV/c²\n*   E₀_approx = 6 * 938.272 MeV = 5629.632 MeV = 5.6296 GeV\n*   E_approx = 3.5714 * 5.6296 GeV = 20.105 GeV.\n\nThis value, 20.105 GeV, is very close to option B, 20.132 GeV. The small remaining difference could be due to using a slightly different proton mass or a mix of proton and neutron masses. Let's try 3 protons and 3 neutrons.\n*   m_p = 938.272 MeV/c²\n*   m_n = 939.565 MeV/c²\n*   E₀_approx2 = (3 * 938.272) + (3 * 939.565) = 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV = 5.6335 GeV. (This ignores the negative binding energy).\n*   E_approx2 = 3.5714 * 5.6335 GeV = 20.1196 GeV.\n\nThis result, 20.120 GeV, is extremely close to option B, 20.132 GeV. The difference is now only 0.012 GeV or 12 MeV. This seems to be the most likely method intended by the question's author. They likely calculated the rest mass by summing the masses of the constituent protons and neutrons, ignoring the binding energy which would make the actual nucleus lighter.\n\nLet's confirm the calculation.\n1.  **Identify Nucleus:** Lithium-6 (3 protons, 3 neutrons).\n2.  **Calculate Rest Mass Energy (E₀):** Sum the rest mass energies of the constituent nucleons.\n    *   Mass of proton: 938.272 MeV/c²\n    *   Mass of neutron: 939.565 MeV/c²\n    *   E₀ = (3 * 938.272 MeV) + (3 * 939.565 MeV) = 5633.511 MeV = 5.633511 GeV.\n3.  **Calculate Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   v = 0.96c\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.96²) = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.571428\n4.  **Calculate Total Relativistic Energy (E):**\n    *   E = γ * E₀ = 3.571428 * 5.633511 GeV ≈ 20.1197 GeV.\n\nThis value (20.120 GeV) is very close to 20.132 GeV. The minor difference might come from slightly different values for the proton/neutron mass. Let's try the values from the provided options.\n\nIf we assume B is the answer, let's see what E0 it implies.\nE0 = 20.132 GeV / (1/0.28) = 5.63696 GeV = 5636.96 MeV.\nThis implies an average nucleon mass of 5636.96 / 6 = 939.49 MeV. This is a very reasonable value, between the proton and neutron mass.\n\nSo, the intended method was almost certainly to calculate the rest mass by summing the nucleon masses, which is physically less accurate than using the measured nuclear mass (as it ignores binding energy), but it's a common simplification in textbook problems. The result of this calculation is extremely close to option B.\n\nFinal check of the steps and logic.\n- The question asks for \"the energy\" to get a ⁶Li nucleus to 0.96c.\n- The options are in GeV and are around 20 GeV.\n- Calculating the total relativistic energy `E = γm₀c²` is the standard approach.\n- Using the precise nuclear mass of ⁶Li gives E ≈ 20.01 GeV.\n- Using a simplified mass (sum of 3 protons and 3 neutrons) gives E ≈ 20.12 GeV.\n- 20.12 GeV is extremely close to option B (20.132 GeV). The small residual difference is likely due to the exact constants used for proton/neutron mass in the source of the problem.\n- This path seems the most plausible to arrive at one of the given answers.\n\nTherefore, B is the intended answer.Final Answer is B. The energy required corresponds to the total relativistic energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus. This energy is calculated using the formula E = γm₀c², where m₀ is the rest mass, c is the speed of light, and γ is the Lorentz factor derived from the velocity.\n\n1.  **Identify the nucleus and its components:** The nucleus is specified as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Lithium has an atomic number of 3, meaning it has 3 protons. The total number of nucleons (protons + neutrons) is 3 + 3 = 6. So, the nucleus is Lithium-6 (⁶Li).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):** The speed is given as v = 0.96c.\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.96²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / √0.0784\n    *   γ = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714\n\n3.  **Calculate the rest energy (E₀):** A common method for such problems, which arrives at the intended answer, is to approximate the nucleus's rest mass by summing the masses of its constituent nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons), ignoring the binding energy.\n    *   Rest mass of a proton (mₚ) ≈ 938.272 MeV/c²\n    *   Rest mass of a neutron (mₙ) ≈ 939.565 MeV/c²\n    *   The rest energy E₀ is (3 * mₚc² + 3 * mₙc²).\n    *   E₀ ≈ (3 * 938.272 MeV) + (3 * 939.565 MeV) = 2814.816 MeV + 2818.695 MeV = 5633.511 MeV.\n    *   E₀ ≈ 5.6335 GeV.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total relativistic energy (E):** The total energy is the product of the Lorentz factor and the rest energy.\n    *   E = γ * E₀\n    *   E ≈ 3.5714 * 5.6335 GeV ≈ 20.120 GeV.\n\nThis calculated value of 20.120 GeV is extremely close to option B, 20.132 GeV. The minor difference can be attributed to using slightly different values for the physical constants. A more precise calculation using the measured mass of the Lithium-6 nucleus (which accounts for binding energy) yields a result of about 20.01 GeV, which does not match any of the options as closely. Therefore, it is most likely that the question intended the simplified calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
