    "To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of the electron, we will use Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle and the relativistic relationship between energy and momentum.\n\n### 1. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle\n\nThe principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) must be greater than or equal to a constant value. For minimum uncertainty, we use the equality:\n\n**Δx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ / 2**\n\nwhere:\n*   **Δx** is the uncertainty in position = 0.1 nm = 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m.\n*   **Δp** is the uncertainty in momentum.\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n\n### 2. Calculating Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp)\n\nFrom the uncertainty principle, we can calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum:\n\n**Δp** = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n**Δp** = (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 ⋅ 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)\n**Δp** ≈ 5.27 × 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\n*Note: In many estimations, the factor of 2 is omitted (Δx ⋅ Δp ≈ ħ), which simplifies the calculation and still provides the correct order of magnitude. Using that approximation, Δp would be approximately 1.054 × 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s.*\n\n### 3. Relating Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE) to Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp)\n\nFor a particle, the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) is related to the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) by the particle's velocity (v), which acts as the group velocity of the electron's wave packet. This relationship holds for both non-relativistic and relativistic cases.\n\n**ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp**\n\nGiven:\n*   **v** = 2 × 10⁸ m/s\n\n### 4. Calculating the Minimum Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE)\n\nNow, we can substitute the values for `v` and `Δp` into the equation:\n\n**ΔE** ≈ (2 × 10⁸ m/s) ⋅ (5.27 × 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)\n**ΔE** ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nIf we use the estimation `Δp ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s`:\n\n**ΔE** ≈ (2 × 10⁸ m/s) ⋅ (1.054 × 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s)\n**ΔE** ≈ 2.108 × 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nBoth calculations yield a result on the order of magnitude of 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\nB) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\nC) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\nD) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\n\nThe calculated minimum uncertainty in the electron's energy is approximately **10⁻¹⁶ J**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
