    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation is 5, suggesting a benzene ring (4 degrees) plus one additional double bond or ring.\n*   **¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift and multiplicity (triplet) are characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical for a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This doublet is a methylene group (-CH2-) coupled to the aldehyde proton, confirming the -CH2CHO fragment.\n*   **Structure:** Assembling the pieces (a para-substituted benzene ring, an -NH2 group, and a -CH2CHO group) gives the starting material as **p-aminophenylacetaldehyde** or **(4-aminophenyl)acetaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO₂ + HCl:** These reagents are used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine. The -NH₂ group is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺Cl⁻). This reaction transforms p-aminophenylacetaldehyde into p-(diazonium chloride)phenylacetaldehyde.\n*   **Step 2: H₂O:** Adding water to the diazonium salt, usually with gentle warming, results in hydrolysis. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (as N₂ gas) and is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group from the water. This is a standard synthesis for phenols. The product after this step is **p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat:** These conditions (a strong base and heat) promote a **self-aldol condensation** reaction. The p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde molecule contains both an aldehyde and α-protons (on the -CH₂- group), allowing it to react with itself.\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** One molecule forms an enolate by deprotonation of the α-carbon. This enolate then attacks the aldehyde carbonyl of a second molecule. After protonation, this forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (structure D).\n    *   **Condensation (Dehydration):** The \"Heat\" in the reaction conditions strongly indicates that the aldol addition product will undergo dehydration. A molecule of water is eliminated to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe sequence of reactions first converts the starting p-aminophenylacetaldehyde to p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This intermediate then undergoes a self-aldol condensation. Due to the applied heat, the reaction proceeds past the initial aldol addition to the final dehydrated product.\n\nTherefore, the final product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
