    "Based on the provided spectroscopic data, the unknown compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2 is identified by systematically analyzing each piece of evidence.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation:**\n    The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as follows:\n    DU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n    A degree of unsaturation of 5 is characteristic of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional double bond, typically a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two medium-to-strong bands in this region is a definitive indicator of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of an ester (R-CO-OR'). The position suggests conjugation with the benzene ring.\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet (3H) and a quartet (2H) is the classic pattern for an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm indicates that the methylene (-CH₂) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom, which is characteristic of an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet that integrates to two protons in this region is typical for the protons of a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂). The broadness is due to quadrupolar relaxation and chemical exchange.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a clear indication of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-donating amino group, while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ethyl ester group.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This compound is a secondary amide and would show only one N-H band in the IR spectrum. Its ¹H NMR spectrum would show a signal for a formyl proton (-CHO) around 8.3 ppm and the quartet for the ethoxy group around 4.0 ppm, which contradicts the given data.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure is fully consistent with all the data. It is a para-substituted benzene ring containing a primary amine (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃). The formula C₉H₁₁NO₂ matches. The IR and ¹H NMR data perfectly align with the expected signals for this compound, also known as Benzocaine.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted (1,3-disubstituted) compound, which would result in a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR, not two clean doublets. It is also a primary amide, which typically shows a C=O stretch at a lower wavenumber than an ester.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** In this isomer, the ethyl group is part of the acid portion of the ester (-O-CO-CH₂CH₃). The ¹H NMR signal for the methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to the carbonyl would appear much further upfield, around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct identification of the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, as it is the only option that satisfies all the information provided by the IR and ¹H NMR spectra.\n\n<<<B>>>"
