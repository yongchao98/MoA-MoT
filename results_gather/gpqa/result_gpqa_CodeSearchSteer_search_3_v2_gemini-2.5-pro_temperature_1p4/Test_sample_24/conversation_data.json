    "Based on the analysis of the reactions and the search results, the reactants for the two name reactions can be identified.\n\n### Reaction A: A + H2SO4 ---> 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one\n\nThis reaction is a type of pinacol rearrangement, where a 1,2-diol rearranges under acidic conditions to form a carbonyl compound. The product is a spiroketone, which is often formed when a fused bicyclic diol undergoes this rearrangement. The starting material 'A', `2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol`, is a vicinal diol on a fused decalin ring system. Treatment with sulfuric acid (H2SO4) would cause one hydroxyl group to be protonated and leave as a water molecule, forming a carbocation. A subsequent 1,2-alkyl shift, where a C-C bond of the ring system migrates, leads to the ring-expanding or contracting rearrangement that forms the spirocyclic carbon skeleton. A final deprotonation yields the ketone product. This is a classic transformation. The alternative reactant, `2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol`, is an alcohol which would likely dehydrate to an alkene under these conditions, not oxidize to a ketone.\n\n### Reaction B: B + BuLi + H+ ---> 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol\n\nThis reaction involves the use of butyllithium (BuLi), a strong base, to rearrange an ether into an alcohol. This is characteristic of a Wittig rearrangement. The reactant 'B' is `(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene`, which is an allyl benzyl ether. BuLi deprotonates the carbon adjacent to both the phenyl group and the ether oxygen, creating a carbanion. This carbanion can then undergo a rearrangement. There are two common pathways: the-Wittig rearrangement and the-Wittig rearrangement.\n*   A **-Wittig rearrangement** is a concerted sigmatropic process that would lead to a different constitutional isomer than the product.\n*   A **-Wittig rearrangement** proceeds through a radical-pair intermediate. The alkyl group attached to the oxygen (the prenyl group in this case) migrates to the carbanionic carbon. Following protonation with H+, this pathway correctly yields `4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol`.\n\nThe alternative reactant for B, `4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-one`, is a ketone. While BuLi could potentially reduce this ketone to the corresponding alcohol product, this is generally considered a simple reduction rather than a specific name reaction like the Wittig rearrangement. Furthermore, the more likely reaction would be the nucleophilic addition of a butyl group to the ketone, which would result in a different product.\n\nTherefore, the correct reactants are `A = 2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol` and `B = (((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
