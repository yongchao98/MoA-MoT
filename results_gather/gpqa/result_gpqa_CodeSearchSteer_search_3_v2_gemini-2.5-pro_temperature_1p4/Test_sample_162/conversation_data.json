    "To determine the minimum volume of strong acid required to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ and the pH of the resulting solution, we must follow a two-step process. First, we calculate the stoichiometric amount of acid needed to react with the iron(III) hydroxide. Second, we determine the pH of the resulting solution containing the dissolved iron(III) ions.\n\n**Part 1: Calculate the Volume of Strong Acid**\n\n1.  **Chemical Reaction:** Iron(III) hydroxide, a base, reacts with a strong monobasic acid (represented by H⁺) in a neutralization reaction:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n2.  **Calculate Moles of Fe(OH)₃:** First, we need the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = Atomic Mass of Fe + 3 * (Atomic Mass of O + Atomic Mass of H)\n    *   Molar Mass ≈ 55.845 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.008) = 106.869 g/mol.\n    *   Next, calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ in 0.1 g:\n        Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.869 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 mol Fe(OH)₃.\n\n3.  **Calculate Moles of H⁺ Needed:** Based on the stoichiometry of the reaction, 3 moles of H⁺ are required for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 * 0.0009357 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol H⁺.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Volume of 0.1 M Acid:** The problem specifies a 0.1 M strong acid.\n    *   Volume (L) = Moles / Molarity = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L.\n    *   Convert the volume to cubic centimeters (cm³):\n        Volume (cm³) = 0.02807 L * 1000 cm³/L = 28.07 cm³.\n\nThis calculated volume of 28.07 cm³ is a very close match to the volume provided in option C (28.05 cm³).\n\n**Part 2: Calculate the pH of the Resulting Solution**\n\n1.  **Formation of Fe³⁺(aq):** After the reaction, the 0.0009357 moles of Fe(OH)₃ have been converted into 0.0009357 moles of aqueous iron(III) ions (Fe³⁺) in a total volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n    *   [Fe³⁺] = 0.0009357 mol / 0.1 L ≈ 0.009357 M.\n\n2.  **Hydrolysis of Fe³⁺:** The Fe³⁺ ion is a small, highly charged metal cation that acts as a Lewis acid in water. It hydrolyzes water molecules, creating an acidic solution. The primary hydrolysis reaction is:\n    Fe³⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H⁺(aq)\n\n3.  **Equilibrium Calculation:** To find the final pH, we use the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for this reaction, which is approximately Ka = 6.3 x 10⁻³. We can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the equilibrium concentration of H⁺.\n\n|             | Fe³⁺      | Fe(OH)²⁺ | H⁺      |\n|-------------|-----------|----------|---------|\n| **Initial** | 0.009357  | 0        | 0       |\n| **Change**  | -x        | +x       | +x      |\n| **Equil.**  | 0.009357-x| x        | x       |\n\n    Ka = [Fe(OH)²⁺][H⁺] / [Fe³⁺] = (x)(x) / (0.009357 - x) = 6.3 x 10⁻³\n\n4.  **Solve for x ([H⁺]):** Since Ka is relatively large, we solve the full quadratic equation:\n    x² = 6.3 x 10⁻³ * (0.009357 - x)\n    x² + (6.3 x 10⁻³)x - (5.895 x 10⁻⁵) = 0\n\n    Using the quadratic formula, x = [-b ± sqrt(b²-4ac)] / 2a, we find the positive root for x:\n    x ≈ 0.00514 M. This is the equilibrium concentration of H⁺.\n\n5.  **Calculate Final pH:**\n    *   pH = -log₁₀[H⁺] = -log₁₀(0.00514) ≈ 2.29.\n\nThis calculated pH of 2.29 is reasonably close to the pH of 2.04 in option C. The slight discrepancy can arise from variations in the published Ka value or the use of activity instead of concentration in a more rigorous calculation. However, the calculated volume (28.07 cm³) and pH (2.29) both strongly indicate that option C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
