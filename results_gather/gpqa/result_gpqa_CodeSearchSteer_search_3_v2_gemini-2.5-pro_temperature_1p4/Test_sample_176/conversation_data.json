    "The provided information has been analyzed, and the initial calculation appears to be correct based on fundamental physics principles. The search results confirm the validity of the Stefan-Boltzmann law, Wien's Displacement Law, and the Doppler effect for light, which are the core concepts needed to solve this problem.\n\n**1. Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star is proportional to the square of its radius (R) and the fourth power of its surface temperature (T). The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴. This leads to the luminosity ratio:\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n**2. Wien's Displacement Law:** This law connects a star's surface temperature (T) to the peak wavelength (λ_max) of its emitted light, where T is inversely proportional to λ_max. Importantly, this temperature is determined by the star's *rest* wavelength, not the wavelength observed from Earth if the star is in motion.\n\n**3. Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength of light from a star is affected by its radial velocity (its motion towards or away from us). For a star moving away, its light is \"redshifted,\" meaning the observed wavelength is longer than its rest wavelength. For a star with no radial velocity, the observed and rest wavelengths are the same.\n\nBased on the problem statement:\n*   The ratio of the radii (R₁/R₂) is 1.5.\n*   The *observed* peak wavelengths are the same (λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂).\n*   Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, so its observed peak wavelength is equal to its rest peak wavelength (λ_obs₁ = λ_rest₁).\n*   Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s away from us, so its light is redshifted. The observed peak wavelength is longer than its rest wavelength: λ_obs₂ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v/c).\n\nFrom this, we deduce that the stars have different rest peak wavelengths and therefore different temperatures.\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n*   L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n*   From Wien's Law, T₁/T₂ = λ_rest₂ / λ_rest₁.\n*   We know λ_rest₁ = λ_obs₁ and since λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂, we have λ_rest₁ = λ_obs₂.\n*   We also have λ_obs₂ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v/c).\n*   Substituting λ_rest₁ for λ_obs₂ gives λ_rest₁ = λ_rest₂ * (1 + v/c).\n*   This gives the ratio of rest wavelengths: λ_rest₂ / λ_rest₁ = 1 / (1 + v/c).\n*   Therefore, the temperature ratio is T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v/c).\n*   The luminosity ratio becomes L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * [1 / (1 + v/c)]⁴.\n*   Plugging in the values: L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / [1 + (700 km/s) / (300,000 km/s)]⁴\n*   L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 7/3000)⁴ ≈ 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴ ≈ 2.25 / 1.00936 ≈ 2.229\n\nThis result is closest to 2.23. The mass information is extraneous to this calculation.\n\nThe luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>"
