    "The final product of the reaction sequence is determined by analyzing each step.\n\n*   **Step 1: Benzene to Product 1**\n    Benzene is treated with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO₃) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction known as nitration. The sulfuric acid acts as a catalyst to generate the nitronium ion (NO₂⁺), which is the electrophile. The result is the formation of **nitrobenzene (Product 1)**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Product 1 to Product 2**\n    Nitrobenzene is treated with bromine (Br₂) and iron (Fe) powder. The iron powder reacts with bromine to form iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃), a Lewis acid catalyst. This facilitates the electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) of the benzene ring. The nitro group (-NO₂) is a deactivating group and a meta-director. Therefore, the bromine atom is added to the position meta (position 3) to the nitro group, yielding **1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene (Product 2)**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Product 2 to Product 3**\n    1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene is stirred with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂). This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. The Pd/C catalyst selectively reduces the nitro group to an amino group (-NH₂) in the presence of a halogen. This forms **3-bromoaniline (Product 3)**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Product 3 to Product 4**\n    3-bromoaniline is treated with sodium nitrite (NaNO₂) and fluoroboric acid (HBF₄). This is a diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine is converted into a diazonium salt. The product is **3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate (Product 4)**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Product 4 to Product 5**\n    Product 4 is heated and treated with anisole (methoxybenzene). This reaction is known as the Gomberg-Bachmann reaction, which involves the coupling of an aryl radical with another aromatic compound. The 3-bromobenzenediazonium salt decomposes to form a 3-bromophenyl radical. Anisole has a methoxy group (-OCH₃), which is an ortho-, para-directing group. Due to less steric hindrance, the para-position is the major site of attack for the radical. The coupling of the 3-bromophenyl radical at the para-position of anisole results in the final product, **3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl (Product 5)**.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.\n\n<<<C>>>"
