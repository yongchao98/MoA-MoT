    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the composition of salts A and B and find the total number of atoms.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Decomposition Products**\n\nThe experiment involves heating a mixture of salts and analyzing the gaseous products. The changes in weight of the successive tubes reveal the identity and quantity of these gases.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent, or desiccant. Its weight gain of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, used to detect acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no such gases were formed.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The weight of the copper tube increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase is entirely from oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = 0.80 g.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Gas C:** The remaining gas, which did not react in any of the tubes, has a volume of 2.24 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol. This non-reactive gas is likely nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### **2. Identifying the Original Salts**\n\nThe products of the decomposition are water (H₂O), nitrogen (N₂), and an oxygen-containing gas that reacts with hot copper. The presence of N, H, and O in the products points to the original salts being ammonium salts of nitrogen-based acids, such as ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\n*   **Hypothesis:** The salts are Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\nThe thermal decomposition reactions for these salts are:\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate):** NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite):** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states the salts are in an equimolar mixture. Let's say we have 'x' moles of each salt.\n\n*   **Products from x moles of NH₄NO₃:** x moles of N₂O and 2x moles of H₂O.\n*   **Products from x moles of NH₄NO₂:** x moles of N₂ and 2x moles of H₂O.\n\n**Total products from the mixture:**\n*   **H₂O:** 2x + 2x = 4x moles\n*   **N₂:** x moles\n*   **N₂O:** x moles\n\n### **3. Verifying the Hypothesis with Experimental Data**\n\nThe gaseous mixture (H₂O, N₂, N₂O) passes through the tubes.\n1.  **H₂O is absorbed:** We found 0.20 mol of H₂O was produced.\n    *   4x = 0.20 mol  => **x = 0.05 mol**.\n    This means the initial mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂.\n\n2.  **N₂O reacts with hot copper:** The gas N₂O reacts with hot copper to form CuO and N₂.\n    *   Reaction: N₂O + Cu → CuO + N₂\n    *   From our calculation, x = 0.05 mol of N₂O was produced. This contains 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms.\n    *   Mass of oxygen = 0.05 mol * 16.00 g/mol = 0.80 g.\n    *   This perfectly matches the 0.80 g mass increase of the copper tube.\n\n3.  **Total N₂ gas (Gas C):** Gas C consists of the N₂ from the original decomposition of NH₄NO₂ and the N₂ produced from the reaction of N₂O with copper.\n    *   N₂ from NH₄NO₂ decomposition = x = 0.05 mol.\n    *   N₂ from N₂O + Cu reaction = x = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Total moles of N₂ = 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This matches the 0.10 mol of Gas C calculated from the volume.\n\n### **4. Final Mass Check and Atom Count**\n\nThe hypothesis is strongly supported. Now, let's verify the initial mass and answer the question.\n\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ ≈ 64.04 g/mol.\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol = 4.002 g.\n*   Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol = 3.202 g.\n*   **Total Mass** = 4.002 g + 3.202 g = 7.204 g. This matches the given initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\nFinally, we calculate the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 3 Oxygen atoms.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):** Contains 2 Nitrogen atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms, and 2 Oxygen atoms.\n    *   Total atoms = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in one molecule of each.\nTotal atoms = 9 (in NH₄NO₃) + 8 (in NH₄NO₂) = 17.\n\n<<<A>>>"
