    "The observation of a peak at 790 nm with a significant flux drop at shorter wavelengths in a quasar's spectrum points to the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line. This prominent feature, normally in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum at a rest wavelength (λ_rest) of about 121.6 nm (1216 Å), is redshifted due to the expansion of the universe.\n\nThe redshift (z) can be calculated using the formula: 1 + z = λ_observed / λ_rest.\n\nGiven:\n*   Observed wavelength (λ_observed) = 790 nm\n*   Rest wavelength of Lyα (λ_rest) = 121.6 nm\n\nCalculation:\n1 + z = 790 nm / 121.6 nm ≈ 6.497\nz ≈ 5.497\n\nWith the redshift determined, the comoving distance to the quasar can be calculated using the parameters of the Lambda-CDM model provided. The comoving distance depends on the Hubble constant (H₀), the matter density parameter (Ω_m), and the dark energy density parameter (Ω_Λ).\n\nThe specified cosmological parameters are:\n*   H₀ = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n*   Ω_m = 0.3\n*   Ω_Λ = 0.7\n*   The universe is flat (Ω_k = 0), which is consistent as Ω_m + Ω_Λ = 1.0.\n\nUsing a standard cosmology calculator with these parameters for a redshift of z ≈ 5.5, the comoving distance is calculated to be approximately 8.9 to 9.0 Gpc. This value is obtained by integrating the Friedmann equation, which describes the expansion of the universe.\n\nComparing this calculated distance with the given options:\n*   A) 7 Gpc\n*   B) 6 Gpc\n*   C) 9 Gpc\n*   D) 8 Gpc\n\nThe calculated value of ~9 Gpc aligns with option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
