    "This is an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds via a benzyne intermediate. The strong base, sodium amide (NaNH2), can abstract a proton from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n\nIn 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such ortho positions:\n*   The hydrogen at position 6 (C6-H)\n*   The deuterium at position 2 (C2-D)\n\nThis leads to the formation of two different benzyne intermediates:\n\n1.  **Abstraction of hydrogen from C6**: The amide ion (NH2-) removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion, creating a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains on the ring. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n2.  **Abstraction of deuterium from C2**: The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This process is slower than proton abstraction due to the kinetic isotope effect, but it is still possible. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion, creating a triple bond between C1 and C2. The resulting intermediate is **non-deuterated benzyne**.\n\nThese two benzyne intermediates then react with the nucleophile (NH2-), which can add to either carbon of the triple bond. The resulting anion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\nLet's analyze the products from each intermediate:\n\n*   **From 3-deuterobenzyne (Intermediate 1)**:\n    *   Attack of NH2- at C1 gives **2-deuterioaniline** (1-amino-2-deuterobenzene).\n    *   Attack of NH2- at C6 gives **3-deuterioaniline** (1-amino-3-deuterobenzene).\n\n*   **From non-deuterated benzyne (Intermediate 2)**:\n    *   Attack of NH2- at either C1 or C2 results in the formation of a single product after protonation: **aniline** (aminobenzene).\n\nTherefore, three distinct organic products are possible:\n1.  Aniline\n2.  2-Deuterioaniline\n3.  3-Deuterioaniline\n\n<<<B>>>"
