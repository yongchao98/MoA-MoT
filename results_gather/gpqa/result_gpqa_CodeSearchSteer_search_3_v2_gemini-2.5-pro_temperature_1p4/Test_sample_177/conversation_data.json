    "To determine the correct option, we will analyze the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ and then determine the renormalizability of the theory based on this information.\n\n### 1. Mass Dimension Calculation\n\nIn natural units (where ħ = c = 1), the action, S, is dimensionless. The action is the integral of the Lagrangian density over four-dimensional spacetime: S = ∫d⁴x L.\n\n*   The spacetime differential d⁴x has a mass dimension of [d⁴x] = -4.\n*   For the action S to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density L must have a mass dimension of [L] = 4.\n\nThe interaction Lagrangian is given by  \\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}. The mass dimension of this entire term must be 4. We can determine the mass dimension of each component:\n\n*   **Fermion field (ψ):** The kinetic term for a fermion in the Dirac Lagrangian is \\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu\\psi. This term must have a mass dimension of 4. Since the derivative ∂µ has a mass dimension of 1, the product \\bar{\\psi}\\psi must have a mass dimension of 3. Therefore, the fermion field ψ has a mass dimension of [ψ] = 3/2.\n*   **Field strength tensor (F<sup>µν</sup>):** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field in the Maxwell Lagrangian is -¼ F<sub>µν</sub>F<sup>µν</sup>. This term must have a mass dimension of 4. Thus, [F<sup>µν</sup>]² = 4, which means the field strength tensor has a mass dimension of [F<sup>µν</sup>] = 2.\n*   **Sigma matrix (σ<sub>µν</sub>):** This is defined as σ<sub>µν</sub> = (i/2)[γ<sub>µ</sub>, γ<sub>ν</sub>]. The gamma matrices (γ<sub>µ</sub>) are dimensionless. Consequently, σ<sub>µν</sub> is also dimensionless.\n\nNow, we can find the mass dimension of κ by ensuring the total dimension of \\mathcal{L}<sub>int</sub> is 4:\n\n[\\mathcal{L}<sub>int</sub>] = [κ] + [\\bar{\\psi}] + [ψ] + [σ<sub>µν</sub>] + [F<sup>µν</sup>] = 4\n[κ] + (3/2) + (3/2) + 0 + 2 = 4\n[κ] + 3 + 2 = 4\n[κ] + 5 = 4\n[κ] = -1\n\nSo, the mass dimension of κ is -1.\n\n### 2. Renormalizability\n\nA key criterion for determining if a quantum field theory is renormalizable is the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n\n*   If all coupling constants have a mass dimension greater than or equal to zero (≥ 0), the theory is generally renormalizable (or super-renormalizable if > 0).\n*   If any coupling constant has a negative mass dimension (< 0), the theory is non-renormalizable. This is because higher-order corrections in perturbation theory would require an infinite number of counter-terms to cancel divergences, causing the theory to lose its predictive power.\n\nSince the mass dimension of our coupling constant κ is -1, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
