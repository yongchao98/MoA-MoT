    "Here is an analysis of each compound for optical isomerism:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Optical isomerism can occur in biphenyls if there is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This phenomenon is known as atropisomerism. For atropisomerism to be observed, the substituents in the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6') must be bulky enough to prevent the rings from rotating freely. In this compound, all four ortho positions are occupied by large groups (nitro and dimethyl carboxylate groups), which creates significant steric hindrance. This restricted rotation leads to a stable, non-planar conformation. Because the substitution pattern is not symmetrical in a way that would create a plane of symmetry within the molecule, the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule has a central carbon atom (the second carbon) bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom with four distinct substituents is a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are chiral and therefore optically active (unless they are part of a racemic mixture). The presence of this chiral carbon means that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exists as two enantiomers (mirror images) and thus shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The central carbon in benzophenone is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. To be a center of chirality, a carbon atom must be bonded to four different groups. Since the central carbon is sp2 hybridized and bonded to only three groups, and since two of those groups (the phenyl rings) are identical, it is not a chiral center. The molecule has a plane of symmetry and is achiral, so it does not exhibit optical isomerism. While some heavily substituted benzophenones can be made to be chiral, the parent molecule itself is not.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The double bond restricts rotation, leading to geometric isomerism (*cis*/*trans*), but not necessarily optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate is a planar molecule and possesses a center of symmetry. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image, making it achiral. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on this analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
