    "The final analysis is as follows:\n\n### Reaction I Analysis\n*   **Reactant**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral ketone with a single stereocenter at the C5 position, which is specified as (S).\n*   **Reaction**: Reduction of the ketone at C3 using Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH). This reaction converts the carbonyl group into a hydroxyl group, creating a new stereocenter at the C3 position.\n*   **Products**: The hydride attack on the planar carbonyl group is not stereospecific and can occur from either face. This leads to the formation of two products: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers because they differ at one stereocenter (C3) but are the same at another (C5).\n\n### Reaction II Analysis\n*   **Reactant**: Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reaction**: Reduction of both ketone groups using excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4). This reaction creates two new stereocenters at the C2 and C4 positions.\n*   **Products**: The reduction results in three stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which are a pair of enantiomers. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, they are formed as a 50:50 racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, which is a meso compound due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n*   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### Combined Product Mixture\nThe final mixture contains five distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol ((2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol)\n\n### Chromatogram Analysis\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It can separate diastereomers but cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the racemic pair of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol will elute together as a **single peak** because enantiomers are not separated.\n*   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the racemic pair and will have a different retention time, resulting in a separate, **second peak** from Reaction II's products.\n*   Since the products of Reaction I (C7H16O2) and Reaction II (C5H12O2) have different molecular formulas and structures, they will elute at different times.\n*   Therefore, the total number of peaks observed in the normal-phase HPLC is 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\nA chiral stationary phase is designed to interact differently with all non-identical stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of both diastereomers and enantiomers.\n*   Each of the five unique stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved.\n    1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   This will result in a total of **5 peaks** in the chromatogram.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>"
