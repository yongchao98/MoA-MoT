    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one with NaH, followed by benzyl bromide**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, deprotonates the alcohol of the hydroxymethyl group, which is the most acidic proton in the starting material. The resulting alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyl bromide in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction.\n*   **Product 1:** The hydroxyl group (-CH₂OH) is converted to a benzyl ether (-CH₂OBn). The product is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide and catalytic HCl**\n\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone functional group reacts with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (also known as tosylhydrazide) to form a tosylhydrazone. This is a condensation reaction where the ketone's oxygen atom is replaced by =N-NHTs.\n*   **Product 2:** The product is the tosylhydrazone derivative, **N'-(3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexylidene)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide**.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 with n-butyllithium, then aqueous ammonium chloride**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is the Shapiro reaction. The tosylhydrazone is treated with two equivalents of a strong base, n-butyllithium. This process eliminates the entire tosylhydrazone group and replaces it with a carbon-carbon double bond. The deprotonation occurs preferentially at the less sterically hindered α-carbon, which is C-6 in this case. The reaction is quenched with aqueous ammonium chloride, a proton source, to yield the final alkene.\n*   **Product 3:** The ketone at C-1 is removed, and a double bond is formed between C-1 and C-6. The product is **3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) is a standard catalyst for this process.\n    *   **Hydrogenation of alkenes:** Both carbon-carbon double bonds—the one in the cyclohexene ring and the one in the isopropenyl side chain—will be reduced to single bonds. The cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane, and the isopropenyl group becomes an isopropyl group.\n    *   **Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether:** Catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C is also a standard method for cleaving benzyl ethers to yield an alcohol and toluene. The benzyloxymethyl group (-CH₂OBn) will be reduced to a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH). While certain conditions or additives can prevent this cleavage, standard hydrogenation conditions typically cause it.\n*   **Product 4:** The combination of these transformations results in a cyclohexane ring substituted with an isopropyl group and a hydroxymethyl group in a 1,3-relationship. The final structure is **(3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol**.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n*   A) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide - Incorrect. The tosylhydrazone is eliminated in step 3.\n*   B) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol - Incorrect. This structure implies an incorrect reaction pathway for the Shapiro reaction and fails to account for the hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether.\n*   C) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol - Correct. This matches the product derived from the full reaction sequence.\n*   D) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene - Incorrect. This would be the product if only hydrogenation occurred without the cleavage of the benzyl ether, which is unlikely under these conditions.\n\n<<<C>>>"
