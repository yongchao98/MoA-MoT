    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product E and its corresponding number of 13C-NMR signals.\n\n**Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**\n*   **Reactants:** Propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) and Ethanedithiol (HSCH₂CH₂SH, abbreviated as EDT). BF₃ is a Lewis acid catalyst.\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction protects the aldehyde functional group by converting it into a cyclic thioacetal, specifically a 1,3-dithiolane.\n*   **Product A:** 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n**Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n*   **Reactants:** Product A (2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane) and Butyllithium (BuLi), a very strong base.\n*   **Reaction:** BuLi removes the most acidic proton from A. The proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (C2) is acidic (pKa ≈ 31) because the resulting carbanion is stabilized by the adjacent sulfur atoms. This is a key step in \"umpolung\" or dipole inversion chemistry.\n*   **Product B:** The lithiated carbanion of 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiolane.\n\n**Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n*   **Reactants:** Product B (the carbanion) and Bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br).\n*   **Reaction:** The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane in an SN2 reaction, adding an ethyl group at the C2 position.\n*   **Product C:** 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane. The C2 carbon is now bonded to two ethyl groups.\n\n**Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n*   **Reactants:** Product C (2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiolane) and mercuric chloride in aqueous acid.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the deprotection step. The thioketal is hydrolyzed back to a carbonyl group.\n*   **Product D:** The C2 carbon, which has two ethyl groups attached, becomes a carbonyl carbon. The product is diethyl ketone, also known as 3-pentanone ((CH₃CH₂)₂C=O).\n\n**Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n*   **Reactants:** Product D (3-pentanone), Triphenylphosphine (PPh₃), 3-bromopentane ((CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr), and Butyllithium (BuLi).\n*   **Reaction:** This combination of reagents performs a Wittig reaction.\n    1.  First, the phosphorus ylide is formed: 3-bromopentane reacts with PPh₃ to form a phosphonium salt, which is then deprotonated by BuLi to yield the ylide, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n    2.  The ylide then reacts with the ketone, 3-pentanone. The oxygen atom of the ketone and the PPh₃ group of the ylide are eliminated, forming a carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   **Assembly:** The reaction connects the carbonyl carbon from 3-pentanone (which has two ethyl groups) to the ylide carbon from 3-bromopentane (which also has two ethyl groups).\n    (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O + (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃ → (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂ + O=PPh₃\n*   **Product E:** The final product is tetraethylethene. Its systematic IUPAC name is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\n**13C-NMR Analysis of Product E**\n\nThe structure of the final product, 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, is highly symmetrical.\n\n```\n        CH₂-CH₃\n       /\nCH₃-CH₂-C = C-CH₂-CH₃\n          \\\n           CH₂-CH₃\n```\n\nTo determine the number of unique carbon signals, we must look at the molecule's symmetry. Due to the free rotation around single bonds and the sterically favored \"propeller\" conformation, the molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry (point group D₂). This symmetry makes several groups of carbons chemically equivalent:\n\n1.  **Alkene Carbons:** The two carbons forming the double bond are in identical environments and are therefore equivalent. This gives **one signal**.\n2.  **Methylene (-CH₂-) Carbons:** There are four ethyl groups, each containing one -CH₂- carbon. Due to the molecule's symmetry, all four methylene carbons are chemically equivalent. This gives **one signal**.\n3.  **Methyl (-CH₃) Carbons:** Similarly, all four terminal -CH₃ carbons of the ethyl groups are equivalent. This gives **one signal**.\n\nTherefore, the 13C-NMR spectrum of the highly symmetrical product E will show a total of **3 signals**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
