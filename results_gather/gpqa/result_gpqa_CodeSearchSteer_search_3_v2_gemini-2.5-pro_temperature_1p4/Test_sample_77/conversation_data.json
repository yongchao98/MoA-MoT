    "The electromagnetic potentials for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. They are derived from Maxwell's equations and account for the fact that electromagnetic fields propagate at the finite speed of light, `c`. This means the potential at an observation point `r` at time `t` is determined by the state of the charge `q` at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time `t_r`.\n\nThe key variables as defined in the problem are:\n*   `q`: the point charge\n*   $\\vec{r}$: the field point (observation point)\n*   $t$: the time of observation\n*   $t_r$: the retarded time, when the signal was emitted\n*   $\\vec{d}$: the vector from the charge's retarded position, $\\vec{s}(t_r)$, to the field point $\\vec{r}$. So, $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$. Its magnitude is $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n*   $\\vec{v}$: the velocity of the charge at the retarded time, $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}(t_r)$.\n\nThe condition `t > t_r` ensures causality, and the relationship between these times is given by the time it takes for light to travel the distance $d$:\n$t - t_r = \\frac{d}{c}$\n\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials are given by the following expressions:\n\n**Scalar Potential (V):**\nThe standard formula for the scalar potential is:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\nThe subscript $t_r$ indicates that all quantities inside the brackets are evaluated at the retarded time. Multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c` gives:\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} \\right]_{t_r}$\nThis matches the expression for the scalar potential in option C.\n\n**Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\nThe standard formula for the vector potential is:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]_{t_r}$\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c` yields:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} \\right]_{t_r}$\nThis expression is identical to the vector potential in option C.\n\nFurthermore, the scalar and vector potentials are related by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$. Using the relation $c^2 = 1/(\\epsilon_o\\mu_o)$, we can verify this from the expressions in option C:\n$\\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t) = (\\epsilon_o\\mu_o)\\vec{v} \\left( \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\right) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} = \\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t)$\nThis confirms the consistency of the expressions.\n\nComparing these derived formulas with the given choices:\n*   A and B use the static potential, which is incorrect as it does not account for retardation effects.\n*   D has the incorrect sign in the denominator (`+` instead of `-`).\n*   C provides the correct expressions for both the scalar and vector Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<C>>>"
