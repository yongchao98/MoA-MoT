    "To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we will use the principles of special relativity and particle physics. The mean decay distance is the average distance the particle travels in the laboratory frame before it decays.\n\nHere are the steps for the calculation:\n\n1.  **Relationship between Lifetime and Decay Width:** The mean lifetime (τ) of a particle in its own rest frame is inversely proportional to its decay width (Γ). This relationship is derived from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and is given by the formula:\n    τ = ħ / Γ\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** For a particle moving at a relativistic speed, its lifetime as observed in the laboratory frame (t') is longer than its proper lifetime (τ) due to time dilation. The formula for time dilation is:\n    t' = γ * τ\n    where γ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Mean Decay Distance:** The mean decay distance (d) in the laboratory frame is the product of the particle's velocity (v) and its lifetime in the laboratory frame (t').\n    d = v * t' = v * γ * τ\n\n4.  **Relativistic Quantities:** We can express the velocity and Lorentz factor in terms of the particle's energy (E) and mass (m).\n    *   The Lorentz factor is γ = E / m.\n    *   The velocity is given by β = v/c, where c is the speed of light. The momentum p is given by p = γ * m * v, which can be rearranged to v * γ = p / m.\n    *   The momentum can also be calculated from the energy and mass by the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². This gives pc = sqrt(E² - (mc²)²).\n\n5.  **Final Formula:** Combining these relationships, we get a convenient formula for the mean decay distance:\n    d = (p / m) * c * τ = (pc / mc²) * (ħc / Γ)\n\nNow, let's plug in the given values:\n*   Production energy, E_X = 8 GeV = 8000 MeV\n*   Mass, m_X = 1.2 GeV = 1200 MeV\n*   Width, Γ_X = 320 MeV\n*   The value of ħc (reduced Planck constant times the speed of light) is approximately 197.3 MeV·fm. (1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m)\n\nCalculation:\n\n1.  **Calculate pc:**\n    pc = sqrt(E_X² - (m_X c²)²)\n    pc = sqrt((8000 MeV)² - (1200 MeV)²)\n    pc = sqrt(64,000,000 MeV² - 1,440,000 MeV²)\n    pc = sqrt(62,560,000 MeV²)\n    pc ≈ 7909.5 MeV\n\n2.  **Calculate the mean decay distance (d):**\n    d = (pc / m_X c²) * (ħc / Γ_X)\n    d = (7909.5 MeV / 1200 MeV) * (197.3 MeV·fm / 320 MeV)\n    d ≈ 6.591 * 0.6166 fm\n    d ≈ 4.0655 fm\n\nSince 1 femtometer (fm) is equal to 10⁻¹⁵ meters, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁵ meters.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\nB) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\nC) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\nD) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
