    "To determine which statement is true about the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation, we must examine the assumptions made in its derivation.\n\nThe Mott-Gurney law describes the current in a space-charge-limited (SCLC) regime. The key assumptions for the basic form of this equation are:\n*   **Single-carrier device:** The current is carried by only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes).\n*   **Trap-free solid:** The semiconductor is assumed to be an insulator with no charge traps within its band gap. The presence of traps would alter the voltage-current relationship.\n*   **Negligible diffusion current:** The model assumes that the current is dominated by the drift of carriers under the influence of the applied electric field. The current arising from the random thermal motion and concentration gradients of carriers (diffusion current) is considered negligible.\n*   **Ohmic contacts (no injection barrier):** The model requires a charge-injecting contact that can supply an unlimited number of carriers into the semiconductor. This means there is no energy barrier for charge injection from the contact into the device. A Schottky contact, which has an inherent energy barrier, would violate this assumption.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options based on these principles:\n\n**A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.**\nThis statement is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney equation specifically describes a **drift-dominated** current. The diffusion current is what is assumed to be negligible, not the drift current.\n\n**B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.**\nThis statement is incorrect because the model is derived for a **single-carrier** (unipolar) device.\n\n**C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.**\nThis statement accurately reflects all the core assumptions of the Mott-Gurney law. \"No carrier injection barrier\" is the condition for a perfect Ohmic contact in this context. The device is for a single carrier, is trap-free, and the current is dominated by drift (negligible diffusion).\n\n**D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.**\nThis statement is incorrect because a Schottky contact creates an energy barrier to injection, which violates the assumption of an ideal, non-limiting Ohmic contact needed for SCLC as described by the Mott-Gurney law.\n\nTherefore, option C is the correct statement.\n\n<<<C>>>"
