    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. Here is the step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference and given information:**\n    *   **Galaxy's reference frame (S):** This is the stationary frame.\n    *   **Ejecta's reference frame (S'):** This is the moving frame.\n    *   **Relative velocity (v):** The ejecta moves at 60,000 km/s relative to the Galaxy.\n    *   **Proper time (Δt₀):** The time that passes in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is 50 seconds.\n    *   **Speed of light (c):** We will use the common approximation of 300,000 km/s.\n\n2.  **Determine the goal:**\n    *   Calculate the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame. This distance (`d`) is the ejecta's velocity (`v`) multiplied by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor describes how much time and length are altered by relativistic effects. The formula is: γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n    *   First, find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n        v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n    *   Next, square this ratio:\n        (v/c)² = 0.2² = 0.04\n    *   Now, calculate the Lorentz factor:\n        γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96\n        γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798\n        γ ≈ 1.02062\n\n4.  **Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt):**\n    *   This is a time dilation problem. A clock moving at a relativistic speed will be measured to tick slower than a stationary clock. The time measured in the stationary frame (Galaxy) is longer than the time measured in the moving frame (ejecta).\n    *   The formula for time dilation is: Δt = γ * Δt₀.\n    *   Δt ≈ 1.02062 * 50 s\n    *   Δt ≈ 51.031 s\n\n5.  **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d):**\n    *   Now, multiply the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame by the ejecta's velocity.\n    *   d = v * Δt\n    *   d ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s\n    *   d ≈ 3,061,860 km\n\n6.  **Compare with the options:**\n    *   The calculated distance is approximately 3,061,860 km. This is very close to option A. The minor difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's options.\n\nTherefore, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame is approximately 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<A>>>"
