    "The search results confirm my initial reasoning.\n\n1.  **Transit Probability:** The probability of a planet transiting is approximately the ratio of the stellar radius to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (ptrans ≈ R_s / a), for circular orbits.\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** The relationship between the orbital period (P), semi-major axis (a), and the mass of the central body (M) is given by P² = (4π² / (G * M)) * a³. This can be simplified to P² ∝ a³ / M. Therefore, a³ ∝ P² * M, which leads to a ∝ (P² * M)^(1/3). This confirms the relationship I used in my derivation.\n\nThe rest of my calculation is a direct application of these principles to the given information.\n\n*   p1 / p2 = (R_s1 / a1) / (R_s2 / a2)\n*   Since R_s1 = R_s2, this simplifies to p1 / p2 = a2 / a1.\n*   Using the relationship from Kepler's Third Law: a2 / a1 = [(P2² * M_s2) / (P1² * M_s1)]^(1/3).\n*   Given P2 = 3 * P1 and M_s1 = 2 * M_s2.\n*   p1 / p2 = [ (3 * P1)² / P1² * M_s2 / (2 * M_s2) ]^(1/3) = [ (9 * P1²) / P1² * M_s2 / (2 * M_s2) ]^(1/3)\n*   p1 / p2 = [ 9 * (1/2) ]^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3)\n*   (4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65096\n\nSo, the transit probability for Planet_1 is about 1.65 times higher than for Planet_2. This means Planet_1 is the preferred target.\n\nThis matches option C.The analysis is complete. Based on the provided information, the transit probability of a planet is proportional to the stellar radius divided by the planet's semi-major axis (p ∝ R_s / a). We are given that the host stars have the same radii (R_s1 = R_s2), so the ratio of transit probabilities simplifies to the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes (p1/p2 = a2/a1).\n\nTo find the ratio of the semi-major axes, we use Kepler's Third Law, which states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis and inversely proportional to the mass of the host star (P² ∝ a³/M_s). Therefore, the semi-major axis can be expressed as a ∝ (P² * M_s)^(1/3).\n\nWe are given the following relationships:\n*   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: P1 = P2 / 3.\n*   The mass of the host star of Planet_1 is twice that of Planet_2's host star: M_s1 = 2 * M_s2.\n\nNow, we can calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n\na2/a1 = [(P2² * M_s2) / (P1² * M_s1)]^(1/3)\na2/a1 = [((3*P1)² * M_s2) / (P1² * (2*M_s2))]^(1/3)\na2/a1 = [(9 * P1² * M_s2) / (2 * P1² * M_s2)]^(1/3)\na2/a1 = [9 / 2]^(1/3)\na2/a1 = (4.5)^(1/3)\na2/a1 ≈ 1.65\n\nSince p1/p2 = a2/a1, the transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred object for observation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
