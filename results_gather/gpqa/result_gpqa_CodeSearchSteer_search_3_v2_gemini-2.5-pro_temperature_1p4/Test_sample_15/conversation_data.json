    "To determine how many of the given compounds will exhibit optical activity, we must assess each one for chirality. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral and not a racemic mixture. Generally, a molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image, which often means it lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  ***(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene***: The atoms connected to the carbon-carbon double bond lie in the same plane. This molecular planarity acts as a plane of symmetry, making the compound achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione***: The name itself specifies a single, complex enantiomer with defined stereochemistry at multiple chiral centers (3aR, 7aS). Such a molecule is inherently chiral and, as a specific enantiomer, is optically active.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid***: This molecule possesses two chiral centers (C2 and C3). However, the (2R, 3S) configuration results in a meso compound. Meso compounds have an internal plane of symmetry despite containing chiral centers, which renders them achiral and optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid***: This is a diastereomer of the meso form mentioned above. The (2R, 3R) configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral. As an enantiomer (the other being 2S, 3S), it is optically active.\n\n5.  ***(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol***: The (R) designation indicates a specific configuration at the chiral carbon C1, which is bonded to four different groups. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral and optically active.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol***: In this compound, the three hydroxyl groups are all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (all-cis). This arrangement creates multiple planes of symmetry in the molecule. For instance, a plane can pass through one hydroxyl group and its attached carbon, bisecting the ring. The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral and optically inactive.\n\n7.  ***1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one***: To determine chirality, we look for chiral centers and planes of symmetry. The molecule does not contain any chiral carbons. A plane of symmetry can be envisioned passing through the carbonyl group and bisecting the cyclopentyl ring, making the molecule achiral and optically inactive.\n\nTallying the results, the following three compounds are optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nTherefore, a total of 3 compounds from the list will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>"
