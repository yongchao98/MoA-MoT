    "### Elucidation of Compound X's Structure\n\nFirst, the structure of the initial reactant, Compound X, must be determined from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   A very broad absorption in the range of **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n*   The strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, a value typical for a carboxylic acid conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   Absorptions at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are indicative of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n\nThese IR data points strongly suggest that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   A broad singlet at **10.5 ppm** with an integration of 1H is a classic signal for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n*   The signals at **8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H)** and **7.2 ppm (doublet, 2H)** are characteristic of a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The two sets of two equivalent protons indicate substitution at opposite ends of the ring. The downfield shift to 8.0 ppm is caused by the electron-withdrawing effect of the carboxylic acid group on the adjacent protons.\n*   The remaining signals describe the other substituent on the ring:\n    *   **0.9 ppm (triplet, 3H):** A methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **1.4 ppm (doublet, 3H):** A methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH-).\n    *   **1.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H):** A methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H):** A methine group (-CH-) likely attached to the aromatic ring.\n\nAssembling this alkyl fragment gives a *sec*-butyl group [-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃].\n\nCombining all the analytical data, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI\n\nCompound X, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, is reacted with red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent. Specifically, it is known to reduce carboxylic acids completely to their corresponding alkanes. The reaction replaces the entire -COOH group with a -CH₃ group. The general transformation is R-COOH → R-CH₃.\n\nThe alkyl substituent (*sec*-butyl group) and the aromatic ring are stable under these conditions and do not react. The reaction will proceed as follows:\n\nThe 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid is reduced to 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. The carboxylic acid group at position 1 of the benzene ring is converted into a methyl group.\n\n### Identifying the Final Product\n\nLet's examine the options:\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material, Compound X.\n*   B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: This structure is inconsistent with both the starting material's NMR data and the expected reaction product.\n*   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: This corresponds to the complete reduction of the carboxylic acid group of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid to a methyl group.\n*   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: This would be the product if the starting material contained an isobutyl group, which contradicts the NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
