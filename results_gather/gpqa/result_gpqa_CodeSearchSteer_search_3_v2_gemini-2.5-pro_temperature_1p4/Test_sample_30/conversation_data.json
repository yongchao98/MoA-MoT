    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 3 and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid.**\nThis reaction is the electrophilic aromatic nitration of toluene. The methyl group (-CH3) on toluene is an ortho, para-directing group. The reaction produces a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. While the ortho isomer is often the major product in terms of yield due to statistical reasons (two ortho positions vs. one para position), the para isomer is sterically less hindered and also a significant product. For problems involving molecular symmetry, it is common to consider the most symmetrical product. Let's proceed by assuming **Product 1 is p-nitrotoluene**.\n\n*   **Product 1:** p-Nitrotoluene\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4.**\nThe combination of manganese dioxide (MnO2) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is a strong oxidizing agent. This reagent will oxidize the methyl group on the aromatic ring to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The nitro group (-NO2) is resistant to oxidation under these conditions. Therefore, p-nitrotoluene is oxidized to p-nitrobenzoic acid.\n\n*   **Product 2:** p-Nitrobenzoic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide.**\nProduct 2, p-nitrobenzoic acid, is an acid. It will react with the strong base, sodium hydroxide (NaOH), in an acid-base neutralization reaction. The NaOH deprotonates the carboxylic acid (-COOH) to form a carboxylate salt (-COO⁻Na⁺) and water. The acetone mentioned is most likely a solvent or is intended to be a distractor, as the primary and most rapid reaction is neutralization. The resulting product is the anion of p-nitrobenzoic acid.\n\n*   **Product 3:** p-Nitrobenzoate anion\n\n**Determining the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\nNow, we must determine the point group for the p-nitrobenzoate anion.\n*   **Structure:** The p-nitrobenzoate anion consists of a benzene ring substituted with a carboxylate group (-COO⁻) at one end and a nitro group (-NO2) at the other, in a para configuration.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:** Assuming the molecule is planar to maximize electronic delocalization, we can identify its symmetry elements. The molecule possesses:\n    *   Three perpendicular C₂ rotation axes. One passes through the C-C bond connecting the two substituent groups, another lies in the molecular plane perpendicular to the first, and a third is perpendicular to the molecular plane passing through the center of the ring.\n    *   Three mirror planes (σ) corresponding to the planes defined by the C₂ axes.\n    *   A center of inversion (i) at the center of the benzene ring.\n\nA molecule that possesses three perpendicular C₂ axes and a center of inversion belongs to the **D₂h** point group. While NMR studies have considered the possibility of a lower C₂v symmetry, D₂h is the expected point group for the idealized planar structure.\n\nIf we had considered the ortho isomer path:\n*   Product 1: o-nitrotoluene\n*   Product 2: o-nitrobenzoic acid\n*   Product 3: o-nitrobenzoate anion\nThis molecule, assuming planarity, only possesses a single plane of symmetry (the molecular plane), which would classify it under the **Cₛ** point group.\n\nGiven the options, and the common practice in such problems to favor the formation of the more symmetric isomer, the reaction pathway via the para-substituted intermediate is the most logical choice.\n\nTherefore, product 3 is the p-nitrobenzoate anion, which has a D₂h molecular symmetry group.\n\n<<<C>>>"
