    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of hydrogen signals in the final product's 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\nAcetic acid (CH₃COOH) is treated with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. This set of reagents points towards an α-bromination reaction. While the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction (using PBr₃) is more common, this alternative method also achieves the bromination at the α-carbon. Pyridine acts as a base to facilitate the formation of an enolate or enol, and acetic anhydride can act as an activator.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\nProduct 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction, where the carboxylic acid is converted to an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\nProduct 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of the Final Product 4**\nProduct 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH₂)₅Br).\n1.  **First Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride is a strong base that removes the acidic α-hydrogen from the methylene group situated between the cyano and the ester groups.\n2.  **First Alkylation:** The resulting carbanion attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane.\n3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since excess NaH is used, the remaining α-hydrogen is also removed, forming a second carbanion.\n4.  **Intramolecular Alkylation (Cyclization):** The carbanion on the α-carbon attacks the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromine atom. This intramolecular reaction is favorable as it forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n*   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate)**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring substituted at one carbon (C1) with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethyl carboxylate group (-COOCH₂CH₃). The other five carbons of the ring (C2 through C6) are methylene (-CH₂) groups.\n\n*   **Protons of the Ethyl Group:**\n    1.  The two protons of the methylene group (-O-**CH₂**-CH₃) are chemically equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce one signal.\n    2.  The three protons of the methyl group (-O-CH₂-**CH₃**) are also chemically equivalent. They will produce a second signal.\n    This gives **2 signals** from the ethyl group.\n\n*   **Protons of the Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    The key to determining the number of signals from the ring is understanding its symmetry and the concept of chemical equivalence.\n    *   The C1 carbon is a quaternary center with two different substituents (-CN and -COOEt). This means the molecule as a whole is asymmetric. In a fixed chair conformation, there are no elements of symmetry. Consequently, all ten protons on the cyclohexane ring (two on each of the five -CH₂- groups) are chemically distinct.\n        *   C2 protons (axial and equatorial) are diastereotopic.\n        *   C6 protons are different from C2 protons.\n        *   C3 protons are different from C5 protons.\n        *   C4 protons are also diastereotopic.\n        This strict analysis would lead to 10 distinct signals for the ring protons, plus 2 for the ethyl group, totaling 12 signals (Option A).\n\n    *   However, in organic chemistry problems, we often consider the possibility of accidental isochrony (accidental equivalence), where non-equivalent protons happen to have the same chemical shift. This is more likely for protons that are further away from the asymmetric center.\n        *   The protons on C2 and C6 are closest to the asymmetric C1 center, so their chemical environments are expected to be significantly different. This would result in four distinct signals: H2-axial, H2-equatorial, H6-axial, and H6-equatorial.\n        *   The protons on C4 (H4-axial and H4-equatorial) are also distinct.\n        *   The protons on C3 and C5 are furthest from the C1 center. While they are technically diastereotopic (C3 protons are different from C5 protons), the difference in their chemical environment is much smaller. It is plausible that they are accidentally isochronous.\n            *   H3-axial and H5-axial may have the same chemical shift (1 signal).\n            *   H3-equatorial and H5-equatorial may have the same chemical shift (1 signal).\n\n    *   Counting the signals based on this model of accidental isochrony:\n        *   Ethyl group: 2 signals\n        *   C2 protons (axial, equatorial): 2 signals\n        *   C6 protons (axial, equatorial): 2 signals\n        *   C4 protons (axial, equatorial): 2 signals\n        *   C3/C5 axial protons (accidentally equivalent): 1 signal\n        *   C3/C5 equatorial protons (accidentally equivalent): 1 signal\n        *   Total signals = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = **10 signals**.\n\nThis analysis provides a strong rationale for 10 distinct signals, which corresponds to one of the given options. The idealized model assuming a plane of symmetry (leading to 8 signals) is an oversimplification, while the strict theoretical model (12 signals) ignores the common phenomenon of accidental equivalence in real spectra.\n\nThus, the number of distinct hydrogen signals observable is 10.\n\n<<<C>>>"
