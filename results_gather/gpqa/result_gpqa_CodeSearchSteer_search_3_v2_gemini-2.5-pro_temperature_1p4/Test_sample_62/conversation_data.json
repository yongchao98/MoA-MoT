    "To determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we must first calculate its energy. The energy of the photon corresponds to the energy difference between the molecule's final and initial states.\n\n### 1. Define Energy Levels and Transitions\n\nThe energy of a diatomic molecule in the rotation-vibration model is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies.\n\n*   **Vibrational Energy:** Eᵥ = ħω(v + 1/2), where `v` is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   **Rotational Energy:** Eⱼ = (ħ²/2I) * J(J+1), where `J` is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...), and `I` is the moment of inertia.\n*   **Total Energy:** Eᵥ,ⱼ = ħω(v + 1/2) + (ħ²/2I) * J(J+1).\n\nThe **fundamental state** (or ground state) is the lowest possible energy state, which corresponds to v=0 and J=0.\n*   **Initial Energy (E_initial):** E₀,₀ = ħω(0 + 1/2) + 0 = (1/2)ħω.\n\nFor a photon to be absorbed, the molecule must transition to a higher energy state. The selection rules for rovibrational transitions dictate the allowed changes in quantum numbers.\n*   **Vibrational selection rule:** Δv = +1.\n*   **Rotational selection rule:** ΔJ = ±1.\n\nStarting from the ground state (J=0), the only possible rotational transition is ΔJ = +1, as J cannot be negative. Therefore, the molecule transitions to the state where v=1 and J=1.\n*   **Final Energy (E_final):** E₁,₁ = ħω(1 + 1/2) + (ħ²/2I) * 1(1+1) = (3/2)ħω + (ħ²/I).\n\n### 2. Calculate the Photon's Energy (ΔE)\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon is the difference between the final and initial energy states.\n*   **ΔE = E_final - E_initial**\n*   ΔE = [ (3/2)ħω + (ħ²/I) ] - [ (1/2)ħω ]\n*   **ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I**\n\n### 3. Calculate Numerical Values\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the reduced mass (μ) and the moment of inertia (I) of the molecule. We will use the following constants:\n*   **Reduced Planck's Constant (ħ):** ≈ 1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** ≈ 2.99792 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   **Atomic Mass Unit (amu) to kg:** 1 amu ≈ 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n**Given Data:**\n*   Mass of atom X (Mx): 20 amu\n*   Mass of atom Y (My): 2 amu\n*   Bond length (R): 2 Å = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   Angular frequency (ω): 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s\n\n**Calculations:**\n*   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n    μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    I = μ * R²\n    I ≈ (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\n    I ≈ 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n*   **Photon Energy (ΔE):**\n    ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I\n    ΔE ≈ (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s * 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) + ( (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) )\n    ΔE ≈ (4.2183 x 10⁻²⁰ J) + (0.0921 x 10⁻²¹ J)\n    ΔE ≈ 4.2275 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n### 4. Calculate the Photon's Momentum (p)\n\nThe energy and momentum of a photon are related by the equation E = pc.\n*   **p = ΔE / c**\n*   p ≈ (4.2275 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.99792 x 10⁸ m/s)\n*   **p ≈ 1.410 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s**\n\nThis calculated value is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
