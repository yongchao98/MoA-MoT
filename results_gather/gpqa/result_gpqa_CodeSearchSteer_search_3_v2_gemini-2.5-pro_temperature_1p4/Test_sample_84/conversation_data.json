    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\n\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the radius of the star.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 ($T_{eq1}$) and Planet2 ($T_{eq2}$).\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A_1)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1}}}{T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A_2)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}}}$\n\nGiven that both planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constants) and have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$), the equation simplifies to:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a_1}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a_2}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets.\n\n### 2. Relating Doppler Shift to Semi-Major Axis\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method measures the periodic Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K).\n\nThe relationship is: $K = c \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$, where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nThe radial velocity amplitude (K) for a star with a single planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $M_p$ is the mass of the planet.\n*   $M_{star}$ is the mass of the star.\n*   $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n*   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis.\n\nSince both planets were detected using the transit method, their orbits must be edge-on, which means the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n\nWe can now rearrange the formula to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n\n$K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2}{M_{star}} \\frac{G}{a} \\implies a = \\frac{G \\cdot M_p^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K^2}$\n\n### 3. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\n\nNow we can compute the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\frac{G \\cdot M_{p2}^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K_2^2}}{\\frac{G \\cdot M_{p1}^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K_1^2}}$\n\nSince $G$ and $M_{star}$ are the same for both planets, they cancel out:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2}{K_2^2} \\cdot \\frac{K_1^2}{M_{p1}^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nThe ratio of the RV amplitudes ($K_1/K_2$) is directly proportional to the ratio of their observed Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$):\n\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\, \\text{Å}}{0.04 \\, \\text{Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nThe ratio of the planet masses is given as:\n\n$\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\, M_{Earth}}{7 \\, M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\nNow, substitute these ratios back into the equation for $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\cdot \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\n\nFinally, calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>"
