    "To correctly identify the 1H NMR data for the described compound, we must first deduce its most likely structure based on the provided information.\n\n**1. Structural Deduction:**\n*   **Parent Structure:** A di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring implies a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents.\n*   **Total Carbons:** The compound has a total of 8 carbon atoms. Since the benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contain 2 carbon atoms.\n*   **FTIR Data:** The spectrum indicates a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X). This means one substituent is a halogen atom (-X) directly attached to the aromatic ring, and the other substituent contains the two extra carbons and the carbonyl group.\n*   **Possible Substituents:** The most plausible substituent containing two carbons and a carbonyl group is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n\nThis leads to the structure of a haloacetophenone (X-C₆H₄-COCH₃). The problem states the compound is di-substituted, and the NMR options show a pattern typical of para-substitution (1,4-disubstitution), which results in a high degree of symmetry. Therefore, the most probable compound is **4-haloacetophenone**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Proposed Structure (4-haloacetophenone):**\n*   **Aromatic Protons:** In a 1,4-disubstituted ring, there are two sets of chemically equivalent protons. This would give rise to two distinct signals, each integrating to 2 protons. Due to coupling with their ortho neighbors, these signals will appear as doublets. Both the halogen and the acetyl group are electron-withdrawing, shifting these protons downfield (to a higher ppm value), typically between 7.4 and 8.0 ppm.\n*   **Aliphatic Protons:** The acetyl group's methyl (-CH₃) protons are equivalent and have no adjacent protons to couple with. Therefore, they will appear as a single sharp peak (a singlet), integrating to 3 protons. The chemical shift for a methyl ketone is characteristically around 2.3-2.6 ppm.\n\n**3. Evaluation of the 1H NMR Options:**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    This data suggests a para-substituted ring, but the peak at 9.9 ppm is typical for an aldehyde proton, and the peak at 3.7 ppm is a methylene (-CH₂) group. This could correspond to 2-(4-halophenyl)acetaldehyde. However, for that structure, the aldehyde proton should be a triplet and the methylene protons a doublet due to coupling. The given singlet multiplicities make this option incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm), which contradicts the compound being an aromatic ring. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    A di-substituted aromatic ring should have 4 protons. This spectrum only shows one proton at 6.9 ppm, which is inconsistent with the structure. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    This spectrum is a perfect match for the proposed 4-haloacetophenone structure.\n    *   **7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d):** These are the two doublets for the 4 protons on the para-substituted aromatic ring.\n    *   **2.3 (3H, s):** This is the singlet for the 3 protons of the acetyl methyl group.\n\nBased on this analysis, Option D provides the correct 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
