    "### Calculation of the Expectation Value\n\nTo determine the expectation value of the operator `10σz + 5σx`, we first need to define the quantum state and the operators involved.\n\nThe spin-half particle is in the state `|ψ⟩`, which is a linear superposition of the spin-up `|↑⟩` and spin-down `|↓⟩` states:\n`|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩`\n\nIn matrix notation, with `|↑⟩ = [1, 0]` and `|↓⟩ = [0, 1]`, the state vector is:\n`|ψ⟩ = [0.5, √3/2]`\n\nThe operator for which we want to find the expectation value is:\n`O = 10σz + 5σx`\n\nThe Pauli matrices `σz` and `σx` are given by:\n`σz = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n`σx = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\nThe expectation value `⟨O⟩` is calculated as `⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩`. Due to the linearity of operators, this can be separated into:\n`⟨O⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩`\n\n**1. Calculate the expectation value of `σz` (`⟨σz⟩`):**\n`⟨σz⟩ = ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩`\nFirst, we apply `σz` to `|ψ⟩`:\n`σz|ψ⟩ = [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [0.5, √3/2] = [0.5, -√3/2]`\n\nThen, we take the inner product with `⟨ψ|`, which is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ⟩` (`[0.5, √3/2]`):\n`⟨σz⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [0.5, -√3/2] = (0.5 * 0.5) + (√3/2 * -√3/2) = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5`\n\n**2. Calculate the expectation value of `σx` (`⟨σx⟩`):**\n`⟨σx⟩ = ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩`\nFirst, we apply `σx` to `|ψ⟩`:\n`σx|ψ⟩ = [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [0.5, √3/2] = [√3/2, 0.5]`\n\nThen, we take the inner product with `⟨ψ|`:\n`⟨σx⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [√3/2, 0.5] = (0.5 * √3/2) + (√3/2 * 0.5) = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2`\n\n**3. Combine the results:**\nNow, we substitute the expectation values of `σz` and `σx` back into the equation for `⟨O⟩`:\n`⟨O⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2)`\n`⟨O⟩ = -5 + (5√3)/2`\n\nTo find the numerical value up to one decimal place, we use the approximation `√3 ≈ 1.732`:\n`⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + (5 * 1.732) / 2`\n`⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 8.66 / 2`\n`⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33`\n`⟨O⟩ ≈ -0.67`\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is -0.7.\n\n<<<D>>>"
