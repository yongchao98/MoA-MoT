    "To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we first need to find the color of the light it emits. The emitted light has an energy of 2.3393 eV.\n\nFirst, we convert the energy of the emitted photon from electronvolts (eV) to its corresponding wavelength in nanometers (nm). The relationship between energy (E) and wavelength (λ) is given by the formula:\n\nλ (nm) ≈ 1240 / E (eV)\n\nPlugging in the given energy:\n\nλ ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 eV ≈ 530 nm\n\nLight with a wavelength of approximately 530 nm corresponds to the color green in the visible spectrum. This means the textile dye emits green light.\n\nAn object's perceived color is the light that it reflects or, in this case, emits. The color of light that a substance absorbs is complementary to the color it reflects or transmits. The complementary color to green is red. Therefore, the organic compound absorbs red light, which causes it to appear green to our eyes.\n\n<<<B>>>"
