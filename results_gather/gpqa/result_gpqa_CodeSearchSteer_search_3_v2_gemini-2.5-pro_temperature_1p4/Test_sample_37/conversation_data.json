    "The correct answer is D. This reaction is a classic example of a Stork enamine alkylation, or more specifically, the alkylation of a metalloenamine, which involves three main steps.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction:**\n\n1.  **Step (i): Formation of the Aza-enolate.** The starting material is the iminium salt derived from pentan-2-one and a secondary amine. LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide), a strong, non-nucleophilic base, is used in a solvent like DME (dimethoxyethane) to deprotonate the α-carbon. For an unsymmetrical ketone like pentan-2-one (CH₃-CO-CH₂CH₂CH₃), deprotonation can occur at either the C1 methyl group or the C3 methylene group. With a sterically hindered base like LDA, the kinetic product is favored, meaning deprotonation occurs at the less substituted and more accessible C1 position. This step forms a highly nucleophilic intermediate called an aza-enolate or metalloenamine.\n\n2.  **Step (ii): Alkylation.** The nucleophilic aza-enolate attacks the electrophilic alkyl halide, ethyl iodide (CH₃CH₂I). This is an Sɴ2 reaction where the ethyl group is added to the C1 carbon, forming a new carbon-carbon bond and a new, larger iminium salt.\n\n3.  **Step (iii): Hydrolysis.** Finally, an acidic workup with H₃O⁺ hydrolyzes the iminium salt back into a carbonyl compound.\n\n**Determining the Product (B):**\n\n*   The initial ketone is pentan-2-one (a 5-carbon chain).\n*   An ethyl group (2 carbons) is added to the C1 position.\n*   The resulting carbon skeleton is CH₃CH₂–CH₂–CO–CH₂CH₂CH₃.\n*   This molecule is heptan-4-one.\n\n**Determining the Reagent Sequence (A):**\n\n*   The correct and logical order for the reagents is:\n    *   (i) Formation of the nucleophile using the base and solvent: **LDA, DME**\n    *   (ii) Addition of the electrophile for alkylation: **CH₃CH₂I**\n    *   (iii) Hydrolysis to yield the final ketone: **H₃O⁺**\n\nThis sequence ensures that the nucleophile is formed first, then allowed to react with the alkylating agent, and finally, the intermediate is converted to the desired product. Adding H₃O⁺ earlier would neutralize the base (LDA) and the nucleophilic intermediate, halting the reaction.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence of reagents (A) is (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH₃CH₂I (iii) H₃O⁺, and the product (B) is heptan-4-one.\n\n<<<D>>>"
