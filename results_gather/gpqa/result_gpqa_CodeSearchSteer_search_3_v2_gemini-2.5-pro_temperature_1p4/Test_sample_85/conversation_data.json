    "To determine the correct starting materials, we must analyze the selectivity of the two different reducing agents and the stereochemical outcome of each reaction.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\nThe starting material in the options is a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid: `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-isobutyl`. This molecule has two distinct functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an ester (`-COO-isobutyl`). It also possesses a chiral center at the carbon bearing the ethyl group.\n\nThe product in both reactions is a delta-lactone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. A lactone is a cyclic ester formed from an intramolecular reaction between a hydroxyl group and a carboxylic acid group within the same molecule. To form this specific lactone, the precursor must be 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid (`HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2OH`).\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in understanding how each reducing agent will selectively act on the starting material to generate the necessary hydroxy-acid intermediate, and how this affects the stereochemistry.\n\n1.  **Reaction A: Reduction with LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride)**\n    *   **Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride is known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. Therefore, LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group (`-COO-isobutyl`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`), while leaving the carboxylic acid group intact.\n    *   **Intermediate:** The reduction of the ester end of the molecule yields the required intermediate, 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction of the ester and the subsequent acid-catalyzed lactonization do not affect the configuration of the existing chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material A will be directly retained in the product lactone.\n    *   **Conclusion:** To produce **(R)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material A must have the **(R)** configuration.\n\n2.  **Reaction B: Reduction with BH₃ (Borane)**\n    *   **Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. It will reduce the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) to a primary alcohol (`-CH2OH`), leaving the isobutyl ester group untouched.\n    *   **Intermediate:** This reaction forms an intermediate hydroxy-ester: isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate. During the acidic workup (H⁺), this intermediate undergoes an intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the stable six-membered lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** As with the first reaction, the reduction of the carboxylic acid and the following lactonization do not alter the chiral center's configuration. The stereochemistry of starting material B is retained in the product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** To produce **(S)**-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the starting material B must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### Summary\n\n*   Starting Material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting Material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
