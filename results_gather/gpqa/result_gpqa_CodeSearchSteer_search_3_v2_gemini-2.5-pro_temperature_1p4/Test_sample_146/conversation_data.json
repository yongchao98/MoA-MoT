    "To determine the velocity of particle A, we apply the principle of conservation of energy. The problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and a slowly moving antiproton ($\\bar{p}$), which means we can consider them to be effectively at rest. Their entire rest mass is converted into the energy of the four resulting particles ($2A^{+}$ and $2A^{-}$).\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Initial Energy**: The total initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton. Since an antiproton has the same mass as a proton, the initial energy ($E_i$) is twice the rest energy of a single proton ($m_p c^2$). The rest energy of a proton is approximately 938.3 MeV.\n    *   $E_i = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938.3 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1876.6 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n2.  **Final Energy**: The initial energy is converted into the total energy of the four A particles. Since the initial momentum is zero, the energy will be distributed equally among the four resulting particles to conserve momentum. The energy of each moving particle A ($E_A$) is given by the relativistic formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) accounts for the kinetic energy. The total final energy ($E_f$) is:\n    *   $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\times \\gamma m_A c^2$\n    *   Given that $m_A c^2 = 300 \\, \\text{MeV}$, the equation becomes:\n    *   $E_f = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times 300 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n3.  **Conservation of Energy**: By equating the initial and final energies:\n    *   $E_i = E_f$\n    *   $1876.6 \\, \\text{MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\, \\text{MeV}$\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n4.  **Calculate Velocity**: The Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ is related to velocity ($v$) by the equation $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$. We can rearrange this to solve for the velocity as a fraction of the speed of light ($c$).\n    *   $\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n    *   $1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    *   $(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n    *   $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n    *   Substituting the value of $\\gamma$:\n    *   $v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n    *   $v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n\nThus, the velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77c.\n\n<<<A>>>"
