    "The phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome are less prominent compared to Down's syndrome due to a mechanism called X-chromosome inactivation (XCI). This process largely compensates for the presence of a supernumerary X chromosome.\n\nIn individuals with more than one X chromosome, such as males with Klinefelter's syndrome (47,XXY), the process of X-inactivation silences one of the X chromosomes in each cell early in embryonic development. This is achieved through epigenetic modifications, including DNA and histone methylation, which compact the extra X chromosome into a transcriptionally inert structure known as a Barr body. This dosage compensation mechanism ensures that the level of gene activity from the X chromosome is roughly equivalent between males (XY), females (XX), and individuals with XXY aneuploidy.\n\nHowever, the compensation is not perfect. Approximately 15% of genes on the inactivated X chromosome \"escape\" silencing and remain expressed. The expression of these genes from the extra X chromosome is thought to contribute to the characteristic features of Klinefelter's syndrome.\n\nIn contrast, Down's syndrome is caused by a trisomy of an autosome, chromosome 21. There is no equivalent inactivation mechanism for autosomes. Consequently, individuals with Down's syndrome have three active copies of the genes on chromosome 21, leading to a more significant gene dosage imbalance and, as a result, more severe and widespread phenotypic effects.\n\nTherefore, the key molecular mechanism is:\n*   **B) chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases in the post-zygote:** This describes the epigenetic process of X-inactivation, which silences the extra X chromosome in Klinefelter's syndrome, mitigating the effects of the aneuploidy. This process involves changes in chromatin structure, including DNA hypermethylation, and occurs after fertilization (post-zygote).\n\nOptions A and C describe events in meiosis that can *cause* nondisjunction, the error leading to aneuploidy, but they do not explain the difference in the severity of the resulting syndromes. Option D is incorrect as the primary molecular difference lies in gene dosage compensation, not DNA replication.\n\n<<<B>>>"
