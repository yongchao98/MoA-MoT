    "Based on the provided options, the physical theory that is believed to never require regularization at high energies is Superstring Theory. Here's a breakdown of why:\n\n*   **A) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** As a quantum field theory, QCD requires regularization to handle the infinities (ultraviolet divergences) that arise in calculations of particle interactions. Methods like lattice QCD are specifically designed to regulate the theory.\n\n*   **B) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory faces its own high-energy problem with the concept of a point-like electron. The self-energy of a point charge is infinite, which is a type of divergence that requires a form of regularization or reinterpretation to avoid unphysical results.\n\n*   **C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** QED is the original and most successful example of a quantum field theory that absolutely requires regularization and the subsequent process of renormalization to make finite, highly accurate predictions. Without it, calculations involving particle interactions would yield infinite results.\n\n*   **D) Superstring Theory:** A primary motivation for superstring theory is to resolve the problem of infinities that plague quantum field theories, especially in the context of gravity. Superstring theory is widely believed to be a finite theory, free from the ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences found in other theories. This is because strings are extended, one-dimensional objects, not point particles. This \"fuzziness\" smooths out interactions at very short distances, naturally avoiding the singularities that lead to infinities. Therefore, it is not expected to need regularization.\n\n<<<D>>>"
