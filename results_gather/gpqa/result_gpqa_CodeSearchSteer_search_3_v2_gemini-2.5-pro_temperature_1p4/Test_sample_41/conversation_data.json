    "To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we must first establish the relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature and its orbital period.\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from its host star and the energy it radiates away. For a planet in a circular orbit, this temperature is related to its distance (d) from the star. The formula shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance (T_eq ∝ 1/√d). This relationship can be rearranged to show that the orbital distance is inversely proportional to the square of the equilibrium temperature (d ∝ 1/T_eq²).\n\n### 2. Orbital Period and Orbital Distance\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis, which for a circular orbit is its orbital distance (d). This can be written as P² ∝ d³. Consequently, the orbital period is proportional to the orbital distance to the power of 3/2 (P ∝ d^(3/2)).\n\n### 3. Combining the Relationships\n\nBy combining these two physical laws, we can find a direct relationship between the orbital period and the equilibrium temperature.\n\nSince P ∝ d^(3/2) and d ∝ T_eq⁻², we can substitute the expression for `d` into the one for `P`:\nP ∝ (T_eq⁻²)^(3/2)\nP ∝ T_eq⁻³\n\nThis means the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature. Therefore, the ratio of the orbital periods of two planets, Pₐ and Pₑ, is equal to the inverse ratio of their equilibrium temperatures cubed: Pₐ/Pₑ = (Tₑ/Tₐ)³.\n\n### 4. Calculation\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio of the orbital period of Planet3 to Planet1 (P₃/P₁). Using the derived formula:\n\nP₃/P₁ = (T₁/T₃)³\n\nWe are given the following temperature ratios:\n*   T₁/T₂ ≈ 1.4\n*   T₂/T₃ ≈ 2.3\n\nTo find T₁/T₃, we can multiply these two ratios:\nT₁/T₃ = (T₁/T₂) * (T₂/T₃) ≈ 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22\n\nNow, we can calculate the ratio of the orbital periods:\nP₃/P₁ ≈ (3.22)³\nP₃/P₁ ≈ 3.22 * 3.22 * 3.22\nP₃/P₁ ≈ 33.386\n\nThis result is approximately 33.4. The information regarding the planets' masses and albedo is not needed for this calculation, as the albedo is uniform for all planets and the planets' masses are negligible compared to the star's mass when applying Kepler's Law in this form.\n\nThus, the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of about 33.4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
