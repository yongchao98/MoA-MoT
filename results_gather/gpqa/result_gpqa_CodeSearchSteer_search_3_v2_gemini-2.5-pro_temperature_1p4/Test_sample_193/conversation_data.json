    "To find the partition function Z for the system of three spins (S1, S2, S3), we must sum the Boltzmann factor, e^(-βE), over all possible spin configurations. Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1, leading to a total of 2³ = 8 possible states for the system.\n\nThe energy of the system is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃]\n\nWe will now calculate the energy for each of the 8 configurations:\n\n**Configuration 1: All spins up**\n*   (S₁, S₂, S₃) = (+1, +1, +1)\n*   E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J\n\n**Configuration 2: All spins down**\n*   (S₁, S₂, S₃) = (-1, -1, -1)\n*   E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J\n\nThese two states have an energy of -3J. The degeneracy (the number of states with the same energy) for this energy level is 2.\n\n**Configuration 3: Two spins up, one spin down**\nThere are three such states:\n*   (+1, +1, -1): E = -J[(1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = J\n*   (+1, -1, +1): E = -J[(1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1)] = -J(-1 + 1 - 1) = J\n*   (-1, +1, +1): E = -J[(-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1)] = -J(-1 - 1 + 1) = J\n\nAll three of these states have an energy of J.\n\n**Configuration 4: One spin up, two spins down**\nThere are three such states:\n*   (+1, -1, -1): E = -J[(1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J(-1 - 1 + 1) = J\n*   (-1, +1, -1): E = -J[(-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1)] = -J(-1 + 1 - 1) = J\n*   (-1, -1, +1): E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1)] = -J(1 - 1 - 1) = J\n\nThese three states also have an energy of J.\n\nIn total, there are 3 + 3 = 6 states with an energy level of J. The degeneracy for this energy level is 6.\n\nNow, we can write the partition function, Z, which is the sum over all states:\nZ = Σᵢ gᵢ * e^(-βEᵢ)\nwhere gᵢ is the degeneracy of the energy level Eᵢ.\n\nWe have two distinct energy levels:\n*   E₁ = -3J with degeneracy g₁ = 2\n*   E₂ = J with degeneracy g₂ = 6\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for the partition function:\nZ = (2 * e^(-β(-3J))) + (6 * e^(-β(J)))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
