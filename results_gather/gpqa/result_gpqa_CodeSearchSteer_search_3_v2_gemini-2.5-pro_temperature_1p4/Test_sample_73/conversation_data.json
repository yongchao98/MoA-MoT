    "The key principle in solving this problem is that radioactive decay is a memoryless process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived. The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its inherent decay probability.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Define the survival probability.**\n    Let S(t) be the probability that the atom survives for a time t. The problem states the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. Therefore, the survival probability for 100 minutes is:\n    S(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\n2.  **Use the exponential decay formula.**\n    The survival probability follows an exponential decay law: S(t) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.\n    So, for t = 100 minutes, we have:\n    e^(-100λ) = 0.68\n\n3.  **Calculate the required probability.**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Because of the memoryless property, this is equivalent to finding the decay probability for a new atom over a 150-minute interval.\n    The probability of decay in 150 minutes, P(150), is:\n    P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)\n\n4.  **Solve for the unknown.**\n    We can rewrite e^(-150λ) in terms of our known value e^(-100λ):\n    e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5\n    Now, substitute the value we found in step 1:\n    e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5\n\n5.  **Perform the final calculation.**\n    Calculate the value of (0.68)^1.5:\n    (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607\n    Now, calculate the decay probability:\n    P(150) = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393\n\nThis probability of 0.4393, or 43.93%, is approximately 44%.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
