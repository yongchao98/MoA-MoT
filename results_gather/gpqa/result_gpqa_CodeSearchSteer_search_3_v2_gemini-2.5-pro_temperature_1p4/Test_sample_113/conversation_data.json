    "The selection of reagents is based on the specific chemical transformations required.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. The carbonyl group of the ketone (butan-2-one) is attacked by the cyanide nucleophile (CN⁻). The reaction is typically performed by mixing the ketone with sodium cyanide (NaCN) and an acid. The acid, in this case, reagent A, serves to protonate the oxygen atom of the tetrahedral intermediate formed after the cyanide attack, yielding the hydroxyl group of the final product. A hydronium ion (H₃O⁺), which signifies aqueous acidic conditions, is the appropriate choice for this step.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (C≡N) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base upon heating. Reagent B, used with water, must facilitate this hydrolysis. A strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl), is commonly used to heat the nitrile under reflux to produce the corresponding carboxylic acid.\n\nTherefore, the suitable reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\n<<<C>>>"
