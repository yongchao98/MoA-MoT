    "An oscillating charge distribution, particularly one with a simple geometry like a spheroid that is small compared to the radiated wavelength, can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole. The key characteristics of the radiation from such a dipole are its angular distribution and its dependence on the oscillation frequency (and thus wavelength).\n\n### Angular Distribution of Radiated Power\n\nFor an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle, `dP/dΩ`, is not uniform in all directions. It follows a specific pattern described by the function:\n\n`dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n\nFrom this relationship, we can see that:\n*   The radiated power is zero along the axis of the dipole (θ = 0° and θ = 180°), as sin²(0°) = 0.\n*   The radiated power is at its maximum in the plane perpendicular to the dipole's axis (θ = 90°), as sin²(90°) = 1.\n\nThe question states that the maximum power radiated is A. This corresponds to the case where θ = 90°.\n`A = k * sin²(90°) = k * 1 = k`\nwhere `k` is a proportionality constant.\n\nWe need to find the fraction of this maximum power that is radiated at an angle of θ = 30°.\n`Power at 30° = k * sin²(30°)`\n\nSince sin(30°) = 1/2, we have:\n`Power at 30° = k * (1/2)² = k/4`\n\nBecause `A = k`, the power at 30° is `A/4`. Therefore, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at 30° is 1/4.\n\n### Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power\n\nThe total power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is described by the Larmor formula, adapted for an oscillating dipole. The total radiated power `<P>` is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency `ω`.\n\n`<P> ∝ ω⁴`\n\nThe angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by the equation `ω = 2πc/λ`, where `c` is the speed of light. Substituting this into the proportionality gives:\n\n`<P> ∝ (2πc/λ)⁴ ∝ 1/λ⁴`\n\nThis means the radiated power is proportional to `λ⁻⁴`. This relationship holds for the power per unit solid angle as well. Therefore, the function `f` describing the radiated power per unit solid angle will have a `λ⁻⁴` dependence.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining these two results:\n*   The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at θ = 30° is **1/4**.\n*   The possible form of the function `f`, representing the power's dependence on wavelength, is **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
