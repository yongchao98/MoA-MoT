    "The correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane needs to be identified.\n\n**Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let's break down the name:\n*   The parent molecule is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`, which is a cyclohexane ring with a `CHO` group attached.\n*   At position 1 of the cyclohexane ring (the same carbon bearing the aldehyde group), there is a substituent named `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)`. This corresponds to a `-CH(OH)(C6H11)` group.\n\nThis structure is the product of a self-aldol addition reaction of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n`2 x Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde --(base)--> 1-((hydroxy)(cyclohexyl)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`\nAldehydes with at least one α-hydrogen can undergo this reaction in the presence of a base. Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde has one such α-hydrogen on the ring at the carbon attached to the CHO group.\n\nTherefore, the main synthetic challenge is to convert the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, into the key intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction Sequences**\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**\n    1.  `Ethynylcyclohexane + NaNH2/CH3Cl → 1-Cyclohexylpropyne`\n    2.  `1-Cyclohexylpropyne + H2/Pd → Propylcyclohexane` (complete reduction to an alkane)\n    3.  An alkane does not react with `Ba(OH)2`. This sequence fails.\n\n*   **B) 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH**\n    1.  `NaNH2` is a strong base that would be neutralized by methanol, a protic solvent. This first step is not productive for building the required carbon skeleton. This sequence is flawed from the beginning.\n\n*   **C) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2**\n    1.  **Alkylation:** `Ethynylcyclohexane (C6H11-C≡CH) + NaNH2/CH3Cl → 1-Cyclohexylpropyne (C6H11-C≡C-CH3)`. This step correctly extends the carbon chain.\n    2.  **Partial Reduction:** `1-Cyclohexylpropyne + H2/Pd-CaCO3 (Lindlar's catalyst) → cis-1-Cyclohexylpropene (cis-C6H11-CH=CH-CH3)`. This is a syn-hydrogenation that produces a cis-alkene.\n    3.  **Ozonolysis:** `cis-1-Cyclohexylpropene + O3/(CH3)2S → Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (C6H11-CHO) + Acetaldehyde (CH3CHO)`. Reductive ozonolysis cleaves the double bond to yield two aldehydes. This step successfully produces the required precursor, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n    4.  **Aldol Reaction:** The mixture of aldehydes is treated with `Ba(OH)2`, a base that catalyzes aldol reactions. While a mixture of four different aldol products is possible, the self-condensation of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the target molecule is one of them. This sequence represents a chemically valid pathway.\n\n*   **D) 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH**\n    1.  `Ethynylcyclohexane + NaNH2/C2H5Cl → 1-Cyclohexylbut-1-yne`\n    2.  `1-Cyclohexylbut-1-yne + Li/liq. NH3 → trans-1-Cyclohexylbut-1-ene`\n    3.  `trans-1-Cyclohexylbut-1-ene + O3/H2O → Cyclohexanecarboxylic acid (C6H11-COOH) + Propanoic acid (CH3CH2COOH)`. Ozonolysis with an oxidative workup (using H2O) yields carboxylic acids, not aldehydes. This sequence fails to produce the necessary aldehyde intermediate.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly option C provides a chemically correct route to synthesize cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which can then undergo a self-aldol reaction to form the final product. The individual reactions in sequence C are standard organic transformations.\n\n<<<C>>>"
