    "Here is the step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compounds for each property.\n\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\nTautomerism is a type of isomerism where a molecule exists in two or more interconvertible forms, which differ in the position of a proton and a double bond. For keto-enol tautomerism, the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is typically required.\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):** This molecule has a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups opposite each other. The carbon atoms are all sp2 hybridized as part of the double bonds. There are no alpha-hydrogens on sp3 hybridized (saturated) carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbons between the ketone groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) each have two alpha-hydrogens. These hydrogens can migrate to the oxygen of the ketone groups, forming double bonds within the ring. This process leads to the formation of its enol tautomer, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and highly stable compound. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily shows tautomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center – a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Let's examine the structure. The carbon at position 2 is bonded to:\n    1.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    2.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n\n    Since the carbon at position 2 is attached to four different groups, it is a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibits optical isomerism and exists as a pair of enantiomers.\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which has a trans-configuration around the carbon-carbon double bond. The molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry that cuts through the double bond. Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral and therefore do not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nCombining the conclusions from both parts:\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
