    "The numerical value of \"a\" is determined by the normalization condition of the wave function. According to the principles of quantum mechanics, the total probability of finding a particle in all possible locations must be 1. This is calculated by integrating the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |ψ(x)|², over the entire space where the particle can exist.\n\nGiven the wave function ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5i, the probability density |ψ(x)|² is calculated as:\n|ψ(x)|² = [Re(ψ)]² + [Im(ψ)]²\n|ψ(x)|² = [a / sqrt(1 + x)]² + [-0.5]²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nThe problem states that the particles are only found in the region between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, the integral of the probability density over this interval must be equal to 1.\n\n∫¹³ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nSolving the integral:\n∫¹³ (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫¹³ 0.25 dx = 1\n[a² * ln(1 + x)] from 1 to 3 + [0.25x] from 1 to 3 = 1\na² * [ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1)] + [0.25 * 3 - 0.25 * 1] = 1\na² * [ln(4) - ln(2)] + [0.75 - 0.25] = 1\na² * ln(4/2) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nTo find \"a\", we take the square root of this value:\na = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))\n\nUsing the value of ln(2) ≈ 0.6931, we can calculate \"a\":\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7214\na ≈ sqrt(0.7214) ≈ 0.849\n\nThis value is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<A>>>"
