    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift for detecting neutral hydrogen clouds via Lyman-alpha absorption with ground-based optical telescopes, we need to consider the atmospheric cutoff wavelength and the rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line.\n\n1.  **Lyman-alpha Rest Wavelength (λ₀):** The Lyman-alpha transition of hydrogen has a rest wavelength of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å). This wavelength is in the far-ultraviolet (UV) part of the spectrum.\n\n2.  **Atmospheric Cutoff:** The Earth's atmosphere absorbs most UV radiation, making it impossible for ground-based telescopes to observe at the 1216 Å rest wavelength. Ground-based optical observations are limited by an \"atmospheric window.\" The atmosphere's transparency drops significantly at shorter wavelengths, with a practical cutoff for most ground-based observatories at around 3200-3300 Å (320-330 nm). Specialized instruments might push this limit slightly, but observing below 3200 Å from the ground is extremely difficult.\n\n3.  **Redshift Calculation:** For the Lyman-alpha absorption line to be detectable, it must be redshifted to a wavelength that can pass through the atmosphere. The relationship between rest wavelength (λ₀), observed wavelength (λ_obs), and redshift (z) is given by the formula: 1 + z = λ_obs / λ₀.\n\nTo find the *lower limit* on the redshift (z_min), we set the observed wavelength (λ_obs) to the atmospheric cutoff wavelength (~3200 Å).\n\nUsing the formula z = (λ_obs / λ₀) - 1:\n\nz_min = (3200 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\nz_min ≈ 2.63 - 1\nz_min ≈ 1.63\n\nThis calculation indicates that a redshift of at least ~1.63 is required. Looking at the provided options:\n\n*   A) 3\n*   B) 1.2\n*   C) 2.4\n*   D) 1.9\n\nA redshift of 1.2 would shift the Lyman-alpha line to ~2675 Å, which is still deep in the UV and blocked by the atmosphere. Redshifts of 2.4 and 3.0 would shift the line well into the observable optical range (~4134 Å and ~4864 Å, respectively), but the question asks for the lower limit. A redshift of 1.9 shifts the line to approximately 3526 Å (1216 * (1 + 1.9)), which is safely within the range of ground-based optical telescopes. While theoretically redshifts down to ~1.6-1.7 might be possible under perfect conditions with specialized equipment, a value of 1.9 represents a more practical and commonly considered lower boundary for effective observation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
