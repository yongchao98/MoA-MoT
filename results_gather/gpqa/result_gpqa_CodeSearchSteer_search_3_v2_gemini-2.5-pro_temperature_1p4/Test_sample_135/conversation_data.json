    "The problem is to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field **f**(r), where the magnitude of the field is `f(r) = 1/r²` and it has a non-zero component only along the radial direction. The integral is to be evaluated within a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.\n\nThe vector field can be written as **f**(r) = (1/r²) **r̂**, where **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nA direct calculation of the divergence of **f** in spherical coordinates gives `∇·f = 0` for any point where r ≠ 0. However, the vector field is singular at the origin (r=0), and the divergence is undefined at this point. This singularity acts as a \"source of divergence\".\n\nTo solve the integral including the singularity, we use the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume V is equal to the surface integral of the vector field over the closed surface S that encloses the volume V:\n\n`∫∫∫_V (∇·f) dV = ∮_S (f · dS)`\n\nHere, the volume V is the sphere of radius R, and the surface S is the surface of this sphere.\n\nWe evaluate the surface integral:\n1.  On the surface of the sphere, the radius is constant, `r = R`. Therefore, the vector field on the surface is **f**(R) = (1/R²) **r̂**.\n2.  The differential surface area element on a sphere in spherical coordinates is `dS = R² sin(θ) dθ dφ` **r̂**, where the direction of the area element is outward, which is along **r̂**.\n3.  The dot product **f** · **dS** is then `[(1/R²) **r̂**] · [R² sin(θ) dθ dφ **r̂**]`.\n4.  Since **r̂** · **r̂** = 1, and the R² terms cancel out, the dot product simplifies to `sin(θ) dθ dφ`.\n\nNow, we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for θ (the polar angle) are 0 to π, and for φ (the azimuthal angle) are 0 to 2π.\n\n`∮_S (f · dS) = ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) ∫(from θ=0 to π) sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nFirst, integrate with respect to θ:\n`∫(from 0 to π) sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)](from 0 to π) = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 2`\n\nNext, integrate the result with respect to φ:\n`∫(from 0 to 2π) 2 dφ = [2φ](from 0 to 2π) = 2(2π) - 2(0) = 4π`\n\nThus, the value of the volume integral of the divergence is 4π. This result is independent of the radius R of the sphere, as long as the sphere encloses the origin.\n\n<<<A>>>"
