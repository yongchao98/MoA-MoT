  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein.

    "To determine why the recombinant protein is not being overexpressed, the provided DNA sequence must be analyzed in the context of the genetic code.\n\n1.  **Identify the Start Codon:** The sequence begins with `ATG`, which is the standard start codon for translation, coding for Methionine.\n\n2.  **Identify the HA Tag Sequence:** The influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag's amino acid sequence is YPYDVPDYA. The corresponding DNA sequence is `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCT`. The provided construct sequence `ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC...` contains the start codon (`ATG`) followed immediately by the sequence coding for the HA tag.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Sequence Following the Tag:** The sequence is read by the ribosome in groups of three nucleotides, called codons. Let's read the sequence in the correct frame, starting from the `ATG` start codon:\n    *   `ATG` (Start - Methionine)\n    *   `TAC` (Tyrosine)\n    *   `CCA` (Proline)\n    *   `TAC` (Tyrosine)\n    *   `GAT` (Aspartic Acid)\n    *   `GTT` (Valine)\n    *   `CCA` (Proline)\n    *   `GAT` (Aspartic Acid)\n    *   `TAC` (Tyrosine)\n    *   `GCC` (Alanine) - This completes the HA tag.\n    *   `AAA` (Lysine)\n    *   `TGA` (?)\n\n4.  **Identify the Problematic Codon:** The codon following `AAA` is `TGA`. According to the standard genetic code, `TGA` is one of the three stop codons (along with `TAA` and `TAG`). These codons signal the termination of protein synthesis. When the ribosome encounters a stop codon, it releases the newly synthesized polypeptide chain.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) The lack of a linker sequence can sometimes cause problems with protein folding or stability, but it would not typically cause a complete failure to produce a full-length protein. The immediate issue here is more fundamental.\n    *   B) The sequence for the HA tag (`TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC`) is correct and does not contain a missense mutation.\n    *   C) The statement that the tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist is biologically correct (release factors, not tRNAs, recognize stop codons). However, the stop codon in the sequence is `TGA`, not `TAA` (`UAA` in RNA), making this option irrelevant to the specific error in the construct.\n    *   D) Due to the presence of the premature `TGA` stop codon immediately following the HA tag and one additional amino acid, the ribosome would indeed terminate translation very early. This would result in a tiny, non-functional peptide instead of the full-length GADD45G protein, perfectly explaining the observed lack of overexpression.\n\nThe annoying reason for the failure is the accidental introduction of a premature stop codon (`TGA`) in the engineered sequence, which causes the ribosome to stop translation before the GADD45G protein can be synthesized.\n\n<<<D>>>"
