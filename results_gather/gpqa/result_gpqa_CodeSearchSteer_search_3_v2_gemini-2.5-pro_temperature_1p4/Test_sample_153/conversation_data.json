    "Based on a thorough analysis of the provided spectral data, the unidentified white solid is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n### **Analysis of Evidence:**\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry:** The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 and the isotopic peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of approximately 32% strongly indicate the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule. The molecular formula for all four possible compounds is C₇H₅ClO₂, which corresponds to a molecular weight of approximately 156.57 g/mol. This data is consistent with any of the choices.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:** The spectrum shows two key features:\n    *   A very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹. This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. This absorption is typical for the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Together, these two peaks are definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group. This makes options A (an aldehyde) and D (a chloroformate) highly unlikely.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The signal at 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H) is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   The signals in the aromatic region, 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H), indicate a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two doublets, each integrating to two protons, represent the two sets of chemically equivalent aromatic protons that are adjacent to each other.\n    *   **2-chlorobenzoic acid** (option C) is a 1,2-disubstituted ring and would produce a more complex splitting pattern with four unique signals in the aromatic region.\n    *   **4-chlorobenzoic acid** (option B) is a 1,4-disubstituted ring. Its symmetrical structure would produce exactly the pattern observed: two doublets in the aromatic region, each for two protons, plus the carboxylic acid proton signal.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe combined spectral data—the chlorine isotope pattern in the mass spectrum, the characteristic carboxylic acid absorptions in the IR spectrum, and the specific 1,4-disubstitution pattern in the ¹H NMR spectrum—unambiguously identify the compound as 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<B>>>"
