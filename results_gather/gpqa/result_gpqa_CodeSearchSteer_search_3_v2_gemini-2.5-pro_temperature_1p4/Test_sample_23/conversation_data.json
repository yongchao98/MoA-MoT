    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n**1. Identify Substance Z**\n*   Substance Z is a hydrocarbon, meaning it contains only carbon (C) and hydrogen (H).\n*   The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. We can determine the empirical formula from this. Let the formula be CxHy. The mass percentage of H is `(y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008) = 0.1428`.\n*   A simpler approach is to test common hydrocarbon formulas. For alkanes (CnH2n+2), the H% decreases as n increases. For cycloalkanes (CnH2n), the H% is constant:\n    `H% = (2n * 1) / (n * 12 + 2n * 1) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857`.\n*   This is a perfect match. So, Z is a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n.\n*   The problem states Z is widely used as a solvent. Among cycloalkanes, cyclohexane (C6H12) is a very common industrial solvent.\n*   Z does not react further with hydrogen, confirming it is a saturated compound like a cycloalkane.\n*   Therefore, Substance Z is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Hydrogenation Reactions**\n*   Hydrogenation of Mixture X gives *only* Z (cyclohexane). This means both components of X must have a six-carbon ring structure.\n*   Hydrogenation of Mixture Y also gives *only* Z (cyclohexane). Since Z (cyclohexane) is already saturated, it won't react. This implies the other component of Y must also have a six-carbon structure that hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n\n**3. Characterize Mixture X and Mixture Y**\n*   **Mixture X** is an equimolar mix of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. This indicates the presence of carbon-carbon double bonds (unsaturation). The problem specifies there are no *conjugated* double bonds.\n*   **Mixture Y** is an equimolar mix of two liquids that does *not* decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated, or in the case of aromatic rings, do not react with bromine water under these conditions. Z (cyclohexane) is one component. The other component, let's call it W, must also not decolorize bromine water but must hydrogenate to cyclohexane. The only common substance that fits this description is **benzene (C6H6)**. Benzene's aromatic ring is stable and does not react with bromine water, but under severe conditions with a platinum catalyst, it hydrogenates completely to cyclohexane.\n*   So, **Mixture Y = Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n**4. Determine the Disproportionation Reaction**\n*   The reaction is: Mixture X → Mixture Y.\n*   This is a disproportionation reaction where an equimolar mixture of two compounds (A and B from mixture X) reacts to form an equimolar mixture of two other compounds (Z and W from mixture Y). This strongly suggests a hydrogen transfer reaction catalyzed by platinum.\n*   The overall reaction is: `A + B --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 + C6H6`.\n*   Since A and B must both have a C6 ring structure, are unsaturated, and one lacks conjugated bonds, let's consider the likely candidates:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**\n    *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)** (This isomer has non-conjugated double bonds, fitting the description).\n*   Let's see if an equimolar reaction between these two produces an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and benzene:\n    `C6H10 + C6H8 --> C6H12 + C6H6`\n*   Let's check the atom balance:\n    *   **Carbon:** 6 + 6 = 12 on the left; 6 + 6 = 12 on the right. (Balanced)\n    *   **Hydrogen:** 10 + 8 = 18 on the left; 12 + 6 = 18 on the right. (Balanced)\n*   The reaction is balanced and proceeds in a 1:1 molar ratio, fulfilling all conditions. In this reaction, cyclohexene is reduced to cyclohexane, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized to benzene.\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Answer**\n*   Mixture X consists of two liquids:\n    *   Liquid 1: **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**, which has 10 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Liquid 2: **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**, which has 8 hydrogen atoms.\n*   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (i.e., in one molecule of each).\n*   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
