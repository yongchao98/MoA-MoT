    "### Calculation of Relative Speed and Total Energy in a Relativistic System\n\nTo determine the correct option, we will first calculate the relative speed of the two astronauts and then the total energy of the system.\n\n#### 1. Relative Speed (v_rel)\n\nThe two astronauts are traveling in the same direction at relativistic speeds. Astronaut 1 has a velocity (v₁) of 0.6c and astronaut 2 has a velocity (v₂) of 0.5c, both relative to a stationary observer. To find the relative speed of astronaut 1 with respect to astronaut 2, we must use the Einstein velocity addition formula, which is appropriate for relativistic speeds.\n\nThe formula for relative velocity (v_rel) is:\n*   *v_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁v₂) / c²)*\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n*   v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\n*   v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3c² / c²)\n*   v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)\n*   v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7\n*   **v_rel ≈ 0.14c**\n\nThis calculation eliminates options A and B.\n\n#### 2. Total Energy (E_total)\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is the sum of its rest energy and its kinetic energy. It is calculated using the formula E = γmc², where 'γ' (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, 'm' is the rest mass, and 'c' is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is given by γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of each astronaut (E_total = E₁ + E₂).\n\n**For Astronaut 1 (mass 2m, velocity 0.6c):**\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ₁):\n    *   γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)² / c²)\n    *   γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - 0.36)\n    *   γ₁ = 1 / √0.64\n    *   γ₁ = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n*   Next, calculate the total energy (E₁):\n    *   E₁ = γ₁ * (2m) * c²\n    *   E₁ = 1.25 * 2mc²\n    *   **E₁ = 2.5 mc²**\n\n**For Astronaut 2 (mass 3m, velocity 0.5c):**\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ₂):\n    *   γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)² / c²)\n    *   γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - 0.25)\n    *   γ₂ = 1 / √0.75\n    *   γ₂ ≈ 1 / 0.866\n    *   γ₂ ≈ 1.1547\n*   Next, calculate the total energy (E₂):\n    *   E₂ = γ₂ * (3m) * c²\n    *   E₂ ≈ 1.1547 * 3mc²\n    *   **E₂ ≈ 3.4641 mc²**\n\n**Total System Energy (E_total):**\n*   E_total = E₁ + E₂\n*   E_total ≈ 2.5 mc² + 3.4641 mc²\n*   **E_total ≈ 5.9641 mc²**\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the calculations:\n*   The relative speed **v_rel** is approximately **0.14c**.\n*   The total energy **E** of the system is approximately **5.96 mc²**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, option D matches both calculated values.\n\n<<<D>>>"
