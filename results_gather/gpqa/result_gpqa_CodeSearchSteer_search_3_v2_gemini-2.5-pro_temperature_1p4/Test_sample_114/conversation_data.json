    "The search results confirm that the fundamental principles for solving this problem are the conservation of energy and momentum. In cases where the initial momentum of the electron-positron system is not zero, the resulting photons will not be emitted at exactly 180 degrees to each other. The calculation method I've outlined is the standard approach for such relativistic collision problems. The steps are:\n\n1.  **Define a coordinate system.** Let the horizontal be the x-axis. The electron moves in the +x direction and the positron in the -x direction.\n2.  **Calculate the initial total energy.** The energy of a relativistic particle is given by `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   Electron energy (E_e) = 4 * m_e * c²\n    *   Positron energy (E_p) = 2 * m_e * c²\n    *   Total initial energy (E_i) = E_e + E_p = 6 * m_e * c²\n3.  **Calculate the initial total momentum.** The momentum of a relativistic particle is `p = sqrt(E² - (mc²)²) / c`.\n    *   Electron momentum (p_e) = `sqrt((4mc²)² - (mc²)²) / c = sqrt(15)mc` in the +x direction.\n    *   Positron momentum (p_p) = `sqrt((2mc²)² - (mc²)²) / c = sqrt(3)mc` in the -x direction.\n    *   Total initial momentum ( **p_i** ) is a vector sum: **p_i** = ( (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * mc, 0).\n4.  **Apply the conservation of energy.** The initial total energy equals the final total energy of the two photons. The problem states the photons have equal energy (E_ph).\n    *   E_i = E_f = E_ph + E_ph = 2 * E_ph\n    *   6mc² = 2 * E_ph\n    *   E_ph = 3mc²\n5.  **Calculate the momentum of each photon.** For a photon, `E = pc`, so the magnitude of the momentum of each photon is `p_ph = E_ph / c = 3mc`.\n6.  **Apply the conservation of momentum.** The total initial momentum must equal the total final momentum of the two photons. Let the upper photon make an angle `θ` with the x-axis and the lower photon make an angle `-φ` with the x-axis.\n    *   **Y-momentum conservation:** The initial y-momentum is zero. The final y-momentum is `p_ph*sin(θ) - p_ph*sin(φ)`. For this to be zero, `sin(θ)` must equal `sin(φ)`, which means `θ = φ`. The angles are symmetric about the x-axis.\n    *   **X-momentum conservation:** The initial x-momentum is `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))mc`. The final x-momentum is `p_ph*cos(θ) + p_ph*cos(φ)`. Since `θ = φ`, this becomes `2 * p_ph * cos(θ)`.\n    *   (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))mc = 2 * (3mc) * cos(θ)\n    *   cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6\n7.  **Calculate the angle.**\n    *   `cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568`\n    *   `θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°`\n8.  **Find the angle between the photons.** The angle between the two photons is `2θ`.\n    *   Angle = 2 * 69.1° ≈ 138.2°\n\nThis value is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
