    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Normalize the initial state vector.**\n    The initial state of the system is given by the column matrix:\n    |ψ⟩ = `[[-1], [2], [1]]`\n\n    First, we need to find the norm of this vector:\n    ||ψ||² = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6\n    ||ψ|| = √6\n\n    The normalized initial state is:\n    |ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * `[[-1], [2], [1]]`\n\n2.  **Find the eigenvector of operator P for the eigenvalue 0.**\n    The matrix for operator P is:\n    P = `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n\n    We need to find the eigenvector |v_P0⟩ corresponding to the eigenvalue λ = 0, which satisfies the equation P|v_P0⟩ = 0|v_P0⟩ = 0.\n    `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]` * `[[x], [y], [z]]` = `[[0], [0], [0]]`\n\n    This gives us the system of equations:\n    *   y/√2 = 0  => y = 0\n    *   x/√2 + z/√2 = 0 => x = -z\n\n    Choosing z = 1, we get x = -1. So the unnormalized eigenvector is:\n    |v_P0⟩ = `[[-1], [0], [1]]`\n\n    Normalizing this eigenvector:\n    ||v_P0||² = (-1)² + 0² + 1² = 2\n    ||v_P0|| = √2\n    The normalized eigenvector for P=0 is:\n    |u_P0⟩ = (1/√2) * `[[-1], [0], [1]]`\n\n3.  **Calculate the probability of measuring P and getting 0.**\n    The probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0 for P is the square of the absolute value of the inner product of the normalized initial state and the normalized eigenvector corresponding to P=0.\n    Prob(P=0) = |⟨u_P0|ψ_norm⟩|²\n\n    ⟨u_P0|ψ_norm⟩ = [(1/√2) * `[-1, 0, 1]`] * [(1/√6) * `[[-1],,]`]\n    = (1/√12) * ((-1)*(-1) + 0*2 + 1*1)\n    = (1/√12) * (1 + 0 + 1)\n    = 2/√12 = 2/(2√3) = 1/√3\n\n    Prob(P=0) = (1/√3)² = 1/3\n\n4.  **Determine the state of the system after the measurement of P.**\n    After measuring the value 0 for P, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding normalized eigenvector.\n    The new state of the system is:\n    |ψ'⟩ = |u_P0⟩ = (1/√2) * `[[-1], [0], [1]]`\n\n5.  **Find the eigenvector of operator Q for the eigenvalue -1.**\n    The matrix for operator Q is:\n    Q = `[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\n    Since Q is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements: 1, 0, and -1. The corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\n    The normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue Q = -1 is:\n    |u_Q-1⟩ = `[[0], [0], [1]]`\n\n6.  **Calculate the probability of measuring Q and getting -1.**\n    This probability is calculated using the state of the system after the measurement of P, which is |ψ'⟩.\n    Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = |⟨u_Q-1|ψ'⟩|²\n\n    ⟨u_Q-1|ψ'⟩ = [``] * [(1/√2) * `[[-1],,]`]\n    = (1/√2) * (0*(-1) + 0*0 + 1*1)\n    = 1/√2\n\n    Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = (1/√2)² = 1/2\n\n7.  **Calculate the combined probability.**\n    The probability of getting 0 for P and then -1 for Q is the product of the individual probabilities calculated in the previous steps.\n    Total Probability = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 after P=0)\n    Total Probability = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6\n\nThus, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements is 1/6.\n\n<<<B>>>"
