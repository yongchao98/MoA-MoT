    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula. Here's a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n1.  **Identify the reference frames.**\n    *   **Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the observer's stationary frame of reference.\n    *   **Glass's Frame (S'):** This is the frame of reference moving along with the glass.\n\n2.  **Determine the velocities.**\n    *   **Velocity of the glass relative to the laboratory (v):** The problem states the glass is moving at a constant velocity `v` in the same direction as the beam.\n    *   **Velocity of the light beam relative to the glass (u'):** The index of refraction `n` is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`). So, `n = c / u'`. The problem specifies that the speed of light in a vacuum `c = 1`. Therefore, the speed of light within the glass, as measured in the glass's own rest frame, is `u' = 1/n`.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula.**\n    The formula for adding velocities that are in the same direction is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n    Where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) relative to the stationary frame (the laboratory). This is what we need to find.\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object relative to the moving frame (light relative to the glass).\n    *   `v` is the velocity of the moving frame relative to the stationary frame (glass relative to the laboratory).\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n4.  **Substitute the known values into the formula.**\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    `u = ((1/n) + v) / (1 + ((1/n) * v) / 1^2)`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression.**\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To clear the fractions in the numerator and denominator, multiply both by `n`:\n\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n * (1/n) + n * v) / (n * 1 + n * (v/n))`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result corresponds to the Fizeau experiment, which was crucial in the development of special relativity. The experiment showed that the speed of light in a moving medium is not a simple sum of the medium's speed and the speed of light in the medium, but is correctly described by the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 1\nB) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\nC) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\nD) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\nThe calculated speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is `(1+n*v)/(n+v)`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
