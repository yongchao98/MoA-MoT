    "Based on the scenario described, here is a breakdown of the physics involved to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Analysis of the Mean Free Paths\n\n*   **λ1: Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules**\n    This is the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. This process is governed by the kinetic theory of gases. The mean free path (λ) is defined as the average distance a particle travels between collisions. For gas-on-gas collisions, the formula is:\n\n    λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ₁)\n\n    Here, `n` is the number density of the gas molecules (number of molecules per unit volume) and `σ₁` is the kinetic collision cross-section, which is related to the physical diameter of the gas molecules. The √2 factor accounts for the fact that all molecules are in random motion relative to each other.\n\n*   **λ2: Mean Free Path of Electrons**\n    This is the average distance an electron from the beam travels before it is scattered by a gas molecule. In a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), especially one operating at a high accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, the electrons are moving at nearly the speed of light. Their velocity is orders of magnitude higher than the thermal velocity of the residual gas molecules. Therefore, the gas molecules can be considered stationary targets.\n\n    The formula for the mean free path of an electron scattering off stationary gas targets is:\n\n    λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ₂)\n\n    In this case, `n` is the same number density of gas molecules, but `σ₂` is the **total scattering cross-section** for an electron and a gas molecule.\n\n### Comparing the Collision Cross-Sections\n\nThe key difference between λ1 and λ2 lies in their respective collision cross-sections, σ₁ and σ₂.\n\n1.  **Kinetic Cross-Section (σ₁):** This represents the effective area for a \"hard-sphere\" collision between two gas molecules. It is fundamentally based on the physical size of the molecules.\n\n2.  **Electron Scattering Cross-Section (σ₂):** This is not a measure of physical contact. A high-energy electron is a charged particle that interacts with the gas molecule via the long-range electrostatic (Coulomb) force. The electron is scattered or deflected by interacting with the electric field of both the molecule's atomic nuclei and its electron clouds. This electrostatic interaction has a much longer range than the physical radius of the molecule. Consequently, the effective \"target area\" a gas molecule presents to a fast-moving electron (σ₂) is significantly larger than the physical target area it presents to another gas molecule (σ₁).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince the electron scattering cross-section (σ₂) is larger than the kinetic collision cross-section (σ₁), and the number density of gas molecules (n) is the same in both scenarios, we can compare the two mean free paths:\n\n*   λ₁ is proportional to 1 / σ₁\n*   λ₂ is proportional to 1 / σ₂\n\nGiven that **σ₂ > σ₁**, it directly follows that **λ₂ < λ₁**. The electrons, interacting with a larger effective target area, will travel a shorter average distance before being scattered compared to the distance gas molecules travel before colliding with each other.\n\n<<<C>>>"
