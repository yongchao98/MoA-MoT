    "The problem asks for the angular distance between the first two minima of a far-field diffraction pattern. The light source is monochromatic with wavelength λ, and it passes through an N-sided polygonal aperture where all apothems have a length of 'a'. A key piece of information is that N is infinitely large.\n\nFirst, let's understand the shape of the aperture. As the number of sides (N) of a regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' approaches infinity, the polygon's shape approaches that of a circle. In this limit, the apothem 'a' becomes the radius of the circle.\n\nTherefore, the problem simplifies to finding the angular separation between the first two minima for Fraunhofer diffraction through a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe diffraction pattern from a circular aperture is characterized by a central bright disc, known as the Airy disk, surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The angular positions of the dark rings (minima) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function, J₁(x).\n\nThe condition for the minima is given by the formula:\nsin(θ) ≈ θ = m * λ / D\n\nwhere:\n*   θ is the angular position of the minimum.\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   D is the diameter of the circular aperture. In this case, the radius is 'a', so the diameter D = 2a.\n*   m is a coefficient corresponding to the order of the minimum.\n\nFor a circular aperture, the values of 'm' for the successive minima are not integers but are approximately 1.220, 2.23, 3.24, and so on.\n\nUsing these values, we can find the angular positions of the first two minima:\n\n*   **First minimum (θ₁):**\n    Using m = 1.220, the angular position of the first minimum is:\n    θ₁ ≈ 1.220 * λ / D = 1.220 * λ / (2a) = 0.610 * λ / a.\n\n*   **Second minimum (θ₂):**\n    Using m = 2.23, the angular position of the second minimum is:\n    θ₂ ≈ 2.23 * λ / D = 2.23 * λ / (2a) = 1.115 * λ / a.\n\nThe question asks for the angular distance between these first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\n\nΔθ ≈ (1.115 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\nΔθ ≈ 0.505 * λ / a\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 1.220 λ /a\nB) 0.506 λ / a\nC) 0.610 λ / a\nD) 0.500 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value of 0.505 λ / a is closest to 0.506 λ / a.\n\n<<<B>>>"
