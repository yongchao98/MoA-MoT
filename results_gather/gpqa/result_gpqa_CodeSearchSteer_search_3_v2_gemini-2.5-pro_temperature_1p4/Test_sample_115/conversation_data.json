    "The problem asks to identify the final product, Compound D, from a multi-step reaction sequence. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. Identification of Compound A:**\nCompound A shows two signals in its proton NMR spectrum: a triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) and a quartet at 1.3 ppm (4H). This splitting pattern (triplet and quartet) and integration (6H and 4H, a 3:2 ratio) are characteristic of two equivalent ethyl groups (CH₃CH₂-). A 6H triplet indicates two CH₃ groups adjacent to a CH₂ group, and a 4H quartet indicates two CH₂ groups adjacent to a CH₃ group. The low chemical shifts are typical for an alkane. The only simple, symmetrical alkane that fits this description is n-butane (CH₃CH₂CH₂CH₃), where the two methyl groups are equivalent and the two methylene groups are equivalent. While the methylene (CH₂) signal in n-butane is technically more complex than a simple quartet, in introductory problems, it is often simplified as such. Thus, Compound A is n-butane.\n\n**2. Formation of Compound B:**\nCompound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination to form Compound B. The bromination of n-butane can produce two isomers: 1-bromobutane and 2-bromobutane.\n\n**3. Formation of Compound C:**\nCompound B reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH), a strong base, in an elimination reaction to form Compound C. The problem states that C has two geometrical isomers.\n*   If B were 1-bromobutane, elimination would yield only but-1-ene, which does not have geometrical isomers.\n*   If B is 2-bromobutane, elimination follows Zaitsev's rule to predominantly form but-2-ene. But-2-ene exists as two geometrical isomers: *cis*-but-2-ene and *trans*-but-2-ene.\nThis confirms that B is 2-bromobutane and C is but-2-ene.\n\n**4. Formation of Compound D (Diels-Alder Reaction):**\nThe *cis*-isomer of C (*cis*-but-2-ene) is used as the dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction. The diene is (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol.\n\n*   **Reactants:**\n    *   **Diene:** (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol. For the reaction, it must adopt the s-cis conformation.\n    *   **Dienophile:** *cis*-but-2-ene.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction, which is stereospecific. The stereochemistry of the reactants determines the stereochemistry of the product.\n*   **Product Skeleton:** The reaction forms a six-membered ring. The resulting product is a substituted cyclohexene. Based on the reactants, the product is 4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    1.  **Dienophile Stereochemistry:** The *cis* relationship of the two methyl groups in *cis*-but-2-ene is retained in the product. Therefore, the methyl groups at positions 5 and 6 of the cyclohexene ring will be *cis* to each other.\n    2.  **Diene Stereochemistry & Endo Rule:** The Diels-Alder reaction generally favors the *endo* product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions in the transition state. For an acyclic diene, this means the \"inner\" substituents of the s-cis diene end up on the same face of the new ring as the dienophile's substituents.\n        *   In the s-cis conformation of (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol, the methyl group (on C4 of the diene) is an \"inner\" group, and the hydroxyl group (on C1 of the diene) is an \"outer\" group.\n        *   According to the endo rule, the methyl groups from the dienophile (at C5 and C6 of the product) will be *cis* to the \"inner\" methyl group from the diene (at C4 of the product).\n        *   Consequently, the \"outer\" hydroxyl group (at C1 of the product) will be *trans* to this cluster of three methyl groups.\n\n*   **Assigning R/S Configuration:**\n    Let's draw the enantiomer where the three methyl groups at C4, C5, and C6 are pointing up (wedge) and the OH group at C1 is pointing down (dash).\n    *   **Numbering:** The IUPAC name is 4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol. The OH group defines C1, and the numbering proceeds through the double bond (C1-C2=C3-C4-C5-C6).\n    *   **Priorities and Configuration:**\n        *   **C1:** Priorities are -OH (1), -C2=C (2), -C6 (3), -H (4, wedge). The path 1→2→3 is counter-clockwise. With H on a wedge, the configuration is **R**.\n        *   **C4:** Priorities are -C3=C (1), -C5 (2), -CH₃ (3), -H (4, dash). The path 1→2→3 is clockwise. With H on a dash, the configuration is **R**.\n        *   **C5:** Priorities are -C6 (1), -C4 (2), -CH₃ (3), -H (4, dash). The path 1→2→3 is clockwise. With H on a dash, the configuration is **R**.\n        *   **C6:** Priorities are -C1 (1), -C5 (2), -CH₃ (3), -H (4, dash). The path 1→2→3 is counter-clockwise. With H on a dash, the configuration is **S**.\n    This gives the (1R, 4R, 5R, 6S) isomer. This is not one of the options.\n\nLet's re-examine the stereochemical rules. The \"exo\" product, which is thermodynamically more stable, would have the dienophile substituents *cis* to the \"outer\" groups of the diene.\n*   **Exo Product Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The methyl groups at C5 and C6 are *cis* to each other.\n    *   They are also *cis* to the \"outer\" OH group at C1.\n    *   The \"inner\" methyl group at C4 is *trans* to this set.\n*   **Assigning R/S for the Exo Product:**\n    Let's draw the enantiomer where the OH group at C1 and the methyl groups at C5 and C6 are pointing up (wedge), and the methyl group at C4 is pointing down (dash). The problem provides options starting with (1S), so let's aim for that. To get 1S, we draw the opposite enantiomer. OH at C1 and methyls at C5/C6 are \"down\" (dash), and methyl at C4 is \"up\" (wedge). Let's check the (1S,4R,5S,6S) option directly.\n    *   Draw **(1S,4R,5S,6S)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**:\n        *   1S: OH is up (wedge).\n        *   4R: Me is down (dash).\n        *   5S: Me is up (wedge).\n        *   6S: Me is up (wedge).\n    *   This structure has the methyl groups at C5 and C6 as *cis*, and the OH at C1 also *cis* to them. The methyl group at C4 is *trans* to this set. This corresponds to the **exo** product. Although the *endo* product is kinetically favored, the *exo* product is a possible outcome, especially if the reaction is under thermodynamic control. Given the options, it is the most plausible product.\n\nLet's verify the R/S assignment for option B: **(1S,4R,5S,6S)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**.\n*   **Structure:** Let the ring be planar. OH at C1 is up, Me at C4 is down, Me at C5 is up, Me at C6 is up.\n*   **C1:** OH(1), C2(2), C6(3), H(4, down). Path 1→2→3 is CCW. H is down. Configuration is **S**. Correct.\n*   **C4:** C3(1), C5(2), CH₃(3, down), H(4, up). Path 1→2→3 is CCW. H is up. Configuration is **R**. Correct.\n*   **C5:** C6(1), C4(2), CH₃(3, up), H(4, down). Path 1→2→3 is CCW. H is down. Configuration is **S**. Correct.\n*   **C6:** C1(1), C5(2), CH₃(3, up), H(4, down). Path 1→2→3 is CCW. H is down. Configuration is **S**. Correct.\n\nThe stereochemistry (1S,4R,5S,6S) is internally consistent and corresponds to one of the two possible diastereomeric products (the exo adduct). Since this is provided as an option, it is the intended answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
