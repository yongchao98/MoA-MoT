    "To solve for the net potential energy of the system, we can use the method of images. A point charge *q* placed a distance *d* from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius *R* induces charges on the surface of the sphere. The electric field and potential outside the sphere can be modeled by replacing the sphere with an \"image\" charge, *q'*, located inside the sphere.\n\n1.  **Determine the Image Charge and its Position**:\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge, *q'*, is given by `q' = -q(R/d)`.\n    *   The image charge is located at a distance `b = R²/d` from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the center and the real charge *q*.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Potential Energy**:\n    The potential energy of the system is equal to the work done to bring the charge *q* from infinity to its final position at distance *d* from the center of the sphere. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charges, which is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge *q'*.\n\n    An alternative and more direct method is to calculate the potential energy as half of the product of the real charge and the potential created by the image charge at the location of the real charge. The factor of 1/2 is crucial because the induced charge distribution is built up as the real charge is brought in from infinity.\n\n    *   The potential, *V'*, created by the image charge *q'* at the location of the real charge *q* (a distance *d* from the center) is calculated as follows:\n        *   The distance between the real charge *q* and the image charge *q'* is `d - b = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d`.\n        *   The potential *V'* is `V' = k * q' / (d - b)`.\n        *   Substituting the expressions for *q'* and `d - b`:\n            `V' = k * [-q(R/d)] / [(d² - R²)/d]`\n            `V' = -k * q * R / (d² - R²)`\n\n    *   The net potential energy of the system, *U*, is then:\n        `U = (1/2) * q * V'`\n        `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d² - R²)]`\n        `U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options, we find that it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
