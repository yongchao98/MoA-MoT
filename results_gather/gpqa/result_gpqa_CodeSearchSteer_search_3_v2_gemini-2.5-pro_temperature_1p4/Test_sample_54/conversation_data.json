    "Based on the analysis of the provided ¹H NMR data, the unknown compound is identified as Trans-propenyl acetate. Here is a breakdown of the evidence:\n\n*   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, singlet):** This signal is characteristic of the three protons of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon in an acetate group (CH₃COO-). All four potential compounds contain an acetate group, so this signal is consistent with any of them.\n*   **Signals in the Vinylic Region (7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm):** The presence of signals between 4.5 and 7.5 ppm indicates protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-). This is a feature of all the proposed structures.\n*   **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, doublet):** A three-proton doublet in this region suggests a methyl group (CH₃) adjacent to a single proton. This is consistent with a propenyl group (`CH₃-CH=`), where the methyl protons are split by the neighboring vinyl proton. This observation rules out the butenyl acetate isomers, which would have an ethyl group (`CH₃CH₂-`) attached to the double bond, leading to more complex signals.\n*   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** The signal at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a large coupling constant of 16.0 Hz. The magnitude of the coupling constant (J) between two protons on a double bond is stereochemically dependent. A large coupling constant, typically in the range of 11-18 Hz, is characteristic of protons that are in a *trans* configuration. In contrast, *cis* protons typically exhibit a smaller coupling constant, usually between 6-14 Hz. The observed J value of 16.0 Hz strongly supports a *trans* geometry for the double bond.\n*   **Splitting Patterns (dq and d):**\n    *   The proton at 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets (dq). This means it is being split by two different sets of neighboring protons: one proton (giving the doublet) and a set of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet). This matches the `-CH=` proton in the `CH₃-CH=` fragment, which is split by the *trans* vinyl proton and the three protons of the adjacent methyl group.\n    *   The proton at 7.0 ppm is a doublet (d), indicating it is split by only one adjacent proton. This corresponds to the `=CH-O` proton, which is only split by the other vinyl proton across the double bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe number of signals, their chemical shifts, integration values, and especially the large coupling constant of 16.0 Hz, collectively point to the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate. The butenyl acetate isomers are eliminated by the presence of a methyl group, not an ethyl group, on the double bond. The Cis-propenyl acetate isomer is eliminated by the large J-coupling value, which is indicative of a *trans* configuration.\n\n<<<A>>>"
