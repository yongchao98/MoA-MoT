    "To clearly distinguish between two energy levels, the difference in their energies must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties, often called their natural linewidths. This relationship stems from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nThe principle is given by the formula ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2, where:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy (the linewidth).\n*   Δt is the uncertainty in time, which corresponds to the lifetime (τ) of the state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy uncertainty (ΔE) for each quantum state:\n\n1.  **For the state with a lifetime of 10⁻⁹ s:**\n    *   τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n2.  **For the state with a lifetime of 10⁻⁸ s:**\n    *   τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nTo resolve the two levels, their energy difference, |E₁ - E₂|, must be greater than the sum of their individual linewidths:\n\n*   |E₁ - E₂| > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂\n*   |E₁ - E₂| > 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV + 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n*   |E₁ - E₂| > 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nNow, let's examine the given options to see which one satisfies this condition:\n*   A) 10⁻⁹ eV is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   C) 10⁻⁴ eV is greater than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   D) 10⁻⁸ eV is less than 7.24 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly 10⁻⁴ eV is significantly larger than the combined energy uncertainty of the two states, allowing them to be clearly distinguished.\n\n<<<C>>>"
