    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can use the principles of planetary equilibrium temperature and orbital mechanics.\n\n### Key Principles:\n\n1.  **Planetary Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its host star and the energy it radiates back into space. For a planet in a circular orbit, this temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance (semi-major axis, `a`). The problem specifies circular orbits, which simplifies the distance to the semi-major axis.\n\n    *   *T_eq ∝ 1/√a*\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion:** This law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a), especially when orbiting the same star.\n\n    *   *P² ∝ a³* or *a ∝ P²/³*\n\n### Deriving the Relationship\n\nBy combining these two principles, we can establish a direct relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature and its orbital period.\n\nFirst, from Kepler's Third Law, we express the semi-major axis in terms of the orbital period:\n`a ∝ P²/³`\n\nNext, we substitute this into the equilibrium temperature formula:\n`T_eq ∝ 1 / √(P²/³)`\n`T_eq ∝ 1 / P¹/³`\n\nThis shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n### Calculation\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to Planet_2 (`T_eq4 / T_eq2`), we can set up the following ratio:\n\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (P₂ / P₄)¹/³`\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods for Planet_1 through Planet_5 as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. From this, we have:\n\n*   The orbital period ratio for Planet_2 (P₂) is 2.\n*   The orbital period ratio for Planet_4 (P₄) is 3.5.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into our equation:\n\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)¹/³`\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ (0.5714)¹/³`\n`T_eq4 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.8298`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.\n\nThe information that the planets have the same albedo is crucial because it means the fraction of absorbed stellar energy is the same for both planets, allowing it to be factored out of the ratio calculation. The discovery of the planets via the TTV (Transit Timing Variation) method confirms they are part of the same system and allows for the determination of their orbital characteristics, but does not directly enter the temperature calculation itself.\n\nBased on the calculation, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<C>>>"
