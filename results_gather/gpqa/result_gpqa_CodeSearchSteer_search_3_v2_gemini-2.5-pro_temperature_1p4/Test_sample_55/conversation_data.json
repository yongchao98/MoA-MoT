    "To determine the correct transition route and probability for the decay of a hydrogen atom from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions, we must apply the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n### 1. Understanding Dipole Transition Selection Rules\n\nIn the non-relativistic theory for the hydrogen atom, electric dipole transitions are governed by the following selection rules for the quantum numbers n, l, and m:\n*   **Δl = ±1**: The orbital angular momentum quantum number must change by exactly 1.\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**: The magnetic quantum number can remain the same or change by 1.\n*   **Δn = any integer**: The principal quantum number change is not restricted, but for a decay, the final n must be smaller than the initial n.\n\nThe problem states the decay happens via *two* dipole transitions, implying a cascade decay through an intermediate state.\n\n### 2. Analyzing the First Transition: |3,0,0⟩ → Intermediate State\n\n*   **Initial State**: |n, l, m⟩ = |3, 0, 0⟩. Here, l=0.\n*   **Applying Δl = ±1**: Since l=0, the intermediate state must have l' = 1.\n*   **Applying Δm = 0, ±1**: Since m=0, the intermediate state can have m' = 0, +1, or -1.\n*   **Applying Δn**: The decay must go to a lower energy level, so the principal quantum number of the intermediate state, n', must be less than 3. The most likely transition is to the next lowest principal quantum number, n'=2.\n\nTherefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.\n\n### 3. Analyzing the Second Transition: Intermediate State → |1,0,0⟩\n\n*   **Final State**: |n, l, m⟩ = |1, 0, 0⟩. Here, the final l is 0 and the final m is 0.\n*   Let's check the allowed transitions from the possible intermediate states identified above:\n    *   **From |2,1,0⟩**: Δl = 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed). Δm = 0 - 0 = 0 (allowed). So, the transition |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is a valid dipole transition.\n    *   **From |2,1,1⟩**: Δl = 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed). Δm = 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed). So, the transition |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is also valid.\n    *   **From |2,1,-1⟩**: Δl = 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed). Δm = 0 - (-1) = +1 (allowed). So, the transition |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is also valid.\n\nThis confirms that all the routes mentioned in the options A, B, and D are physically possible cascade pathways.\n\n### 4. Determining the Transition Probability\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This refers to the branching ratio of the initial decay.\n\n1.  **First Step Probability**: The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is an *s*-orbital, which is spherically symmetric. In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction for the emission of a photon. Therefore, the atom is equally likely to decay into any of the three degenerate *p*-substates (|2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩). This means the probability of transitioning to any single one of these states is 1/3.\n\n2.  **Second Step Probability**: Once the atom is in an intermediate state like |2,1,0⟩, it must decay to a lower energy level. The only state accessible from a 2p state via an electric dipole transition is the 1s state (|1,0,0⟩), as it is the only lower energy state that satisfies Δl = -1. Therefore, the probability of the transition from the intermediate state to the final ground state is 1.\n\n3.  **Overall Probability**: The probability of a specific cascade sequence is the product of the probabilities of each step. For the route |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩:\n    *   Probability ( |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ ) = 1/3\n    *   Probability ( |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ ) = 1\n    *   Total Probability = (1/3) * 1 = 1/3\n\nThe same logic applies to the other possible routes via |2,1,1⟩ and |2,1,-1⟩; each of these specific sequences also has an overall probability of 1/3.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\n*   A) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/3\n*   B) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/4\n*   C) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 2/3\n*   D) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/4\n\nOption A correctly identifies a valid decay path and its corresponding probability.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\n\n<<<A>>>"
