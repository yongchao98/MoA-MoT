    "### Solution Breakdown\n\nThe problem asks for the pH at two different points during the titration of a diluted acetic acid solution with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Here is a step-by-step calculation.\n\n#### **Step 1: Calculate the Concentration of the Diluted Acetic Acid**\n\nFirst, we determine the concentration of the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) solution after it has been diluted with water.\n\n*   **Initial Concentration of Acetic Acid (M₁):** 0.05 M\n*   **Initial Volume of Acetic Acid (V₁):** 20.00 cm³\n*   **Final Volume (V₂):** 20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³\n\nUsing the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, the new concentration (M₂) is:\nM₂ = (0.05 M × 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³ = **0.025 M**\n\nThis is the concentration of the acetic acid solution that will be titrated.\n\n#### **Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH, forming its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). This creates a buffer solution.\n\n*   **Initial moles of CH₃COOH:** 0.025 M × 0.040 L = 0.001 mol\n*   At this point, 25% of the acid has reacted, so the ratio of the conjugate base (A⁻) to the acid (HA) is 25/75, or 1/3.\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.\n\n**pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])**\n\nFirst, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n*   **Ka:** 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n*   **pKa:** -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n\nNow, substitute the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n*   **pH** = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n*   **pH** = 4.73 - 0.477\n*   **pH** ≈ **4.25**\n\n#### **Step 3: Calculate the pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by NaOH to form sodium acetate. The pH at this point is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻), which is a weak base.\n\n1.  **Determine the total volume:**\n    *   First, find the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point. Moles of acid (0.001 mol) must equal moles of base.\n    *   **Volume of NaOH:** Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.010 L or 10.00 cm³\n    *   **Total Volume:** 40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n\n2.  **Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻):**\n    *   At the equivalence point, moles of acetate = initial moles of acetic acid = 0.001 mol.\n    *   **[CH₃COO⁻]:** 0.001 mol / 0.050 L = **0.02 M**\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH from the hydrolysis of the acetate ion:**\n    The reaction is: CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for the acetate ion, which can be found using the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴).\n    *   **Kb:** Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   Set up an equilibrium expression to find the hydroxide concentration [OH⁻]:\n        Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻] ≈ x² / 0.02\n    *   **x²:** (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   **x = [OH⁻]:** √ (1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n4.  **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   **pOH:** -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   **pH:** 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 ≈ **8.52**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26** (rounding 4.253), and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
