  "question": "You have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area.

    "To eliminate an anti-nutritional compound, the most effective strategy is to \"knock out\" the gene responsible for its synthesis, meaning the resulting protein is non-functional. Analyzing the different types of mutations is key to determining which will most likely achieve this goal.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Intact Gene:** The gene begins with `5’-ATG...`, which is the start codon for protein synthesis. The sequence is read in groups of three bases called codons.\n    *   **Intact Gene codons:** `ATG` (Start/Met) - `TTT` (Phe) - `CTC` (Leu) - `GCT` (Ala) ...\n\n2.  **Analyze the Mutants:**\n    *   **Mutant 1:** The sequence `5’-ATGTTCTACGCT...` has changes in the second and third codons. `TTT` becomes `TTC`, which is a **silent mutation** as both code for Phenylalanine (Phe). `CTC` becomes `TAC`, which changes the amino acid from Leucine to Tyrosine. This is a **missense mutation**. A missense mutation might alter the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it.\n    *   **Mutant 2:** The sequence `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCT...` has a critical change in the third codon. The original `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**. This type of change is called a **nonsense mutation**. It causes protein synthesis to stop prematurely, creating a severely shortened and almost certainly non-functional protein. This is the most likely mutation to completely eliminate the compound.\n    *   **Mutant 3:** Comparing the sequence `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTT...` to the intact gene reveals an insertion of three base pairs (`GTC`). This is an **in-frame insertion**, meaning it adds a single amino acid to the protein sequence without altering the subsequent reading frame. While this could disrupt function, it is generally less severe than a nonsense mutation.\n    *   **Mutant 4:** Comparing the sequence `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGT...` to the intact gene shows the deletion of three bases (`GGT`). This is an **in-frame deletion**, which removes one amino acid but keeps the rest of the reading frame intact. Like an in-frame insertion, this might affect protein function but is less likely to cause a complete loss-of-function compared to a nonsense mutation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nA nonsense mutation that introduces an early stop codon is the most reliable way to produce a non-functional, truncated protein and thus \"knock out\" the gene's function. Mutant 2 is the only one with this type of mutation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
