    "The impulse approximation is a foundational concept in many-body nuclear physics that simplifies complex interactions by treating nucleons within a nucleus as if they were free particles. This approximation rests on a set of core assumptions about the nature of the interaction and the nuclear environment.\n\nThe assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons:** This is the principle of a one-body current. It assumes that the probe (for example, an electron or neutrino) interacts with a single nucleon at a time, and the total interaction with the nucleus is the sum of these individual interactions. This neglects more complex phenomena like meson-exchange currents where the probe interacts with the particles that bind the nucleons together.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon:** This assumption means that once the probe has interacted with the chosen nucleon, neither the scattered nucleon nor any particles produced in the interaction re-interact with the other nucleons in the nucleus. This is often referred to as the neglect of final-state interactions (FSI). In this picture, the spectator (A-1) nucleons do not affect the outgoing particles.\n\n3.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces:** The term \"impulse\" itself suggests that the interaction occurs over an infinitesimally short time. During this brief moment, the strong nuclear forces that bind the nucleon within the nucleus are considered negligible compared to the force of the interaction. Therefore, the nucleon can be treated as a free particle, albeit one with an initial momentum determined by its state within the nucleus.\n\nThe assumption that the quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic (3) is not a necessary condition for the impulse approximation. While the internal structure of the nucleon is important for a complete picture of the interaction, the impulse approximation itself is primarily concerned with the interactions and behavior of nucleons as the fundamental constituents of the nucleus, not the quarks within them.\n\nTherefore, the three assumptions that underpin the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
