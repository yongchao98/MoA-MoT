    "To identify the unknown compound, the provided spectroscopic data must be systematically compared with the expected spectra for each of the four possible structures.\n\n### Step 1: Analysis of FTIR Data\n\nThe FTIR spectrum shows two key features:\n*   **A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid. The peak is notably broad due to the strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\nAll four given options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids. Therefore, the FTIR data confirms the presence of the carboxylic acid functional group but does not help in distinguishing between the different alkyl structures.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe ¹H NMR data provides the most crucial information for determining the exact structure.\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H), confirming the compound is saturated. All four options are saturated and consistent with this observation.\n*   **A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex splitting pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton, causing a doublet (**d**) splitting.\n    *   Two neighboring protons (like a CH₂ group), causing a triplet (**t**) splitting.\n    *   Three neighboring protons (like a CH₃ group), causing a quartet (**q**) splitting.\n*   **A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern occurs when a proton is coupled to:\n    *   One neighboring proton, causing a doublet (**d**) splitting.\n    *   Two neighboring protons (a CH₂ group), causing a triplet (**t**) splitting.\n    *   Another group of two neighboring protons (a second CH₂ group), causing another triplet (**t**) splitting.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluating Each Candidate Structure\n\nLet's analyze the expected ¹H NMR splitting patterns for the single protons (methine or CH groups) in each molecule, as these are most likely to exhibit such complex splitting.\n\n**A) CH₃CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   The proton on C3 is adjacent to the CH₂ at C2 (2H, triplet), the CH at C4 (1H, doublet), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H, quartet). This would result in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   The proton on C4 is adjacent to the CH at C3 (1H, doublet), its own CH₃ group (3H, quartet), and the terminal CH₃ group (3H, quartet). This would be a doublet of quartets of quartets (dqq).\n*   This molecule has a `dtq` but lacks a `dtt`.\n\n**B) CH₃CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (Interpreted as 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid)**\nThe condensed formula for B is ambiguous. Interpreting the carbon backbone and substituent placement leads to the IUPAC name 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid:\n`CH₃(f)-CH₂(e)-CH(d)(CH₃)-CH(c)(C₂H₅)-CH₂(b)-COOH(a)`\n*   The proton on C3, H(c), is coupled to the CH on C4 (1H, doublet), the CH₂ group at C2 (2H, triplet), and the CH₂ group of its ethyl substituent (2H, triplet). This signal would be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n*   The proton on C4, H(d), is coupled to the CH on C3 (1H, doublet), the CH₂ group at C5 (2H, triplet), and the CH₃ substituent on C4 (3H, quartet). This signal would be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   This molecule is the only candidate that produces both a `dtt` and a `dtq` signal.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   The proton on C3 is adjacent to the CH₂ at C4 (2H, triplet), the CH at C2 (1H, doublet), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H, quartet). This would be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   The proton on C2 is adjacent to the CH at C3 (1H, doublet) and the CH₃ on C2 (3H, quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq).\n*   This molecule has a `dtq` but does not have a `dtt`.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)COOH (Interpreted as 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n`CH₃-CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-COOH`\n*   The proton on C3 is coupled to the CH₂ at C4 (2H, triplet), the CH at C2 (1H, doublet), and the CH₂ of its ethyl substituent (2H, triplet). This would result in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n*   The proton on C2 is coupled to the CH at C3 (1H, doublet) and the CH₂ of its ethyl substituent (2H, triplet), giving a doublet of triplets (dt).\n*   This molecule has a `dtt` but lacks a `dtq`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the ¹H NMR splitting patterns, only compound B, 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, is consistent with the observation of both a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets.\n\n<<<B>>>"
