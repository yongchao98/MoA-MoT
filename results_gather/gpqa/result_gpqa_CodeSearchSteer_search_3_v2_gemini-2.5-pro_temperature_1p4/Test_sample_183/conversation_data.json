    "The problem asks to identify the sequence of reactions that would lead to the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene.\n\nLet's analyze the target molecule and work backward (retrosynthesis) and then evaluate the given options.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\nThe substituents are:\n*   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n*   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu)\n*   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n\nThe relationships are: -OEt is *ortho* to -tBu and *meta* to -NO2. The -tBu is *ortho* to both -OEt and -NO2.\n\n**Analysis of the final steps:**\nThe final product is an ether. A very common method for synthesizing aryl ethers is the Williamson ether synthesis, which involves reacting a phenoxide with an alkyl halide. The reagent `NaOH/EtBr` (step vii in option B) is characteristic of this reaction. This implies the immediate precursor is a phenol: **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n\nHow is this phenol synthesized? A common route to phenols is through the hydrolysis of a diazonium salt, which is in turn made from an aniline. The reagents `NaNO2/HCl` followed by `H3O+, H2O/Heat` (steps v and vi in option B) correspond to this transformation. This suggests the precursor to the phenol is **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline**.\n\nNow, the central chemical puzzle is how to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitroaniline with the correct regiochemistry. The -NH2 and -NO2 groups are *meta* to each other, while the -tBu group is *ortho* to both. This specific arrangement can be achieved by following a specific sequence of reactions that control the directing effects of the substituents.\n\nLet's evaluate the sequence proposed in Option B, which aligns with our retrosynthetic analysis.\n\n**Evaluation of Option B:**\n\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 on benzene:** This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation which installs the tert-butyl group, forming *tert-butylbenzene*. This is a logical first step.\n\n2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4 on tert-butylbenzene:** This is electrophilic aromatic nitration. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. However, due to its large steric bulk, nitration heavily favors the *para* position (forming 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene) over the *ortho* position (1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene). While the yield of the *ortho* isomer is lower, it is the necessary intermediate for the desired final product. We must proceed with this *ortho* product.\n\n3.  **iii) Fe/HCl on 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene:** This is a standard and high-yield reduction of a nitro group to an amino group, producing *2-tert-butylaniline*.\n\n4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4 on 2-tert-butylaniline:** This is the key step for establishing the correct regiochemistry. Under the strongly acidic conditions of nitration, the amino group (-NH2) is protonated to form the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The anilinium ion is a strongly deactivating, *meta*-director. Although the tert-butyl group is an activating *ortho, para*-director, nitration can be directed to the position *meta* to the -NH3+ group, which is position 3. This reaction is known to produce the desired *2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline*.\n\n5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl on 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline:** This is the diazotization of the primary amino group to form a diazonium salt. This is a standard procedure.\n\n6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat on the diazonium salt:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol upon heating in acidic water, yielding *2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol*.\n\n7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr on 2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol:** The phenol is first deprotonated by NaOH to form the more nucleophilic phenoxide ion, which then reacts with ethyl bromide (EtBr) in a Williamson ether synthesis to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis seven-step sequence is a chemically logical and valid pathway to the target molecule. The remaining steps, (viii) and (ix) in option B, are extraneous as the final product has already been formed. The other options contain chemically flawed sequences. For instance, option C attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on a nitrobenzene ring, which is highly deactivated and does not work. Option A has a nonsensical step of adding nitrating mixture to a diazonium salt.\n\nTherefore, despite the issue of yield in step (ii) and the extraneous final steps, the sequence of reactions i-vii in option B represents the most plausible and correct synthesis.\n\n<<<B>>>"
