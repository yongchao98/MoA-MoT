    "This problem is a classic example of electrostatic shielding. Here's the step-by-step reasoning to find the correct electric field at point P:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity will attract the free electrons within the spherical conductor. This causes a negative charge of `-q` to accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity.\n2.  **Conservation of Charge:** The conductor was initially uncharged. Since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` is left behind on the outer surface of the large spherical conductor to maintain overall neutrality.\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A fundamental property of conductors is that the charges on the outer surface are shielded from the configuration of charges inside. The internal charge `+q` and the induced inner surface charge `-q` combine in such a way that their net electric field is zero everywhere outside the cavity.\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Due to the spherical symmetry of the outer conductor, and the shielding effect, the induced positive charge `+q` will distribute itself uniformly over the outer surface of the large sphere (radius R). The off-center position of the cavity and the charge within it does not affect the uniformity of the charge on the outer shell.\n5.  **Electric Field Outside the Conductor:** For any point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field is identical to that of a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere. In this case, the total charge on the outer surface is `+q`, and it is distributed symmetrically.\n6.  **Calculation:** Therefore, the electric field at point P, which is at a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor, is the same as the field from a point charge `+q` located at the conductor's center.\n\nUsing Coulomb's law, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P is:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe distances `l`, `s`, and the angle `Î¸` are irrelevant for calculating the field outside the conductor due to the principles of electrostatic induction and shielding.\n\n<<<C>>>"
