    "To determine the equivalent exoplanet radius, we must first calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the rotating, spotted star. This amplitude is then equated to the transit depth of a hypothetical exoplanet.\n\n### 1. Brightness Variation due to Starspots\n\nThe problem describes a star with one hemisphere covered in dark spots and the other being unspotted. The variation in brightness is caused by the star's rotation, which alternately presents these two hemispheres to an observer.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere, with a uniform temperature (Teff) of 6000K, is facing the observer. The flux is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere is in view. This hemisphere has a filling factor (f) of 20% (or 0.2), meaning 20% of its surface is covered by spots. The spots have a temperature (T_spot) of 6000K - 1000K = 5000K. The remaining 80% of this hemisphere is at the star's effective temperature of 6000K.\n\nAssuming the filling factor on the hemisphere's surface translates directly to the fraction of the projected stellar disk that is spotted, the minimum flux is a combination of the flux from the hot photosphere and the cooler spots.\n\nThe relative amplitude of this brightness variation is calculated as:\n\n`Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n`Amplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / Teff)^4)`\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n*   f = 0.20\n*   Teff = 6000 K\n*   T_spot = 5000 K\n\n`Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)^4)`\n`Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)^4)`\n`Amplitude = 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225)`\n`Amplitude = 0.20 * 0.51775`\n`Amplitude ≈ 0.10355`\n\n### 2. Equivalent Exoplanet Transit\n\nThe dimming caused by an exoplanet transit is known as the transit depth. It is the fraction of the star's light blocked by the planet. For a transit occurring on an unspotted star, the depth is given by the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area:\n\n`Transit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)^2`\n\nWhere:\n*   `R_pl` is the radius of the planet.\n*   `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n\n### 3. Equating the Signals\n\nTo find the exoplanet radius that produces the same amplitude signal, we set the transit depth equal to the calculated amplitude from the starspots:\n\n`(R_pl / R_star)^2 = 0.10355`\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius of the planet (`R_pl / R_star`):\n\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355)`\n`R_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<B>>>"
