    "To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we first need to establish the apparent visual magnitude (V magnitude) of each star. A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel can be achieved in a one-hour exposure.\n\n### Apparent Magnitudes of the Stars\n\n*   **a) Canopus:** Canopus is the second-brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent visual magnitude of -0.74.\n*   **b) Polaris:** Also known as the North Star, Polaris has an apparent magnitude that fluctuates around 1.98. Other sources list it as 2.00 or varying between 1.86 and 2.13. For our purposes, a value of ~2.0 is sufficient.\n*   **c) Star at 10 pc:** The apparent magnitude (m) can be calculated from the absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d) in parsecs using the formula: m = M + 5 * log10(d) - 5.\n    *   For a star with an absolute V magnitude of 15 at 10 parsecs:\n        m = 15 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 = 15 + 5 * 1 - 5 = 15.\n*   **d) Star at 200 pc:** For a star with an absolute V magnitude of 15 at 200 parsecs:\n    *   m = 15 + 5 * log10(200) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 2.301 - 5 = 15 + 11.505 - 5 = 21.505.\n*   **e) Star at 5 pc:** For a star with an absolute V magnitude of 15 at 5 parsecs:\n    *   m = 15 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 0.699 - 5 = 15 + 3.495 - 5 = 13.495.\n*   **f) Star at 50 pc:** For a star with an absolute V magnitude of 15 at 50 parsecs:\n    *   m = 15 + 5 * log10(50) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 1.699 - 5 = 15 + 8.495 - 5 = 18.495.\n\n### ESPRESSO's Detection Capability\n\nESPRESSO, when coupled with a single 8.2-meter VLT Unit Telescope (1-UT mode), can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 per extracted pixel in a 20-minute exposure for a star with a V magnitude of 16.3 in the high-resolution (HR) mode. The condition for our problem is a 1-hour (60-minute) exposure. Since the S/N ratio scales with the square root of the exposure time, a longer exposure will allow the detection of fainter objects.\n\nSpecifically, for the 1-UT mode, a single one-hour exposure can achieve an S/N of 10 for a star with a V magnitude of 17.1. The limiting magnitude in the HR mode can be extended to V ≈ 16 mag and V ≈ 18 mag with different binning modes (HR21 and HR42, respectively). For the purpose of this question, we can confidently assume that any star with an apparent magnitude significantly brighter than 18 is detectable under the specified conditions.\n\n### Assessing Detectability\n\nNow we compare the apparent magnitudes of the stars with ESPRESSO's capabilities:\n\n*   **Canopus (m = -0.74):** This star is exceptionally bright and therefore easily detectable.\n*   **Polaris (m ≈ 2.0):** This star is also very bright and well within the detection limits.\n*   **Star at 10 pc (m = 15):** This magnitude is well within the capabilities of ESPRESSO for a one-hour exposure.\n*   **Star at 200 pc (m ≈ 21.5):** This star is too faint to be detected with the required S/N in a one-hour exposure with a single VLT unit.\n*   **Star at 5 pc (m ≈ 13.5):** This star is bright enough for detection.\n*   **Star at 50 pc (m ≈ 18.5):** This magnitude is at the very edge or slightly beyond the capabilities for a 1-UT one-hour exposure to reach S/N=10. However, some sources indicate that with optimal binning (HR42 mode), the limiting magnitude can reach V~18, making this detection borderline or unlikely under average conditions. Let's re-examine sources for a more precise limit. A 2013 paper states that in 4-UT mode (combining all four telescopes), an S/N of 10 is achieved for a V=19.4 star in a 1-hour exposure. Another document mentions for the 4-UT mode a V=20.1 star is detectable with S/N=10 in one hour. However, the question specifies coupling with *one* of the 8m telescopes. The documentation states that for the HR42 mode on a single UT, the limiting magnitude is around V~18 mag. Therefore, a star with m=18.5 is likely not detectable.\n\nBased on this analysis, the detectable stars are:\n1.  Canopus (m = -0.74)\n2.  Polaris (m ≈ 2.0)\n3.  Star at 10 pc (m = 15)\n4.  Star at 5 pc (m ≈ 13.5)\n\nThis gives a total of 4 detectable stars.\n\n<<<D>>>"
