    "Final check of the reasoning based on the search results.\n\n1.  **Doppler Effect and Radial Velocity**: The search results confirm that Doppler spectroscopy, or the radial velocity method, works by detecting periodic shifts in the star's spectral lines (redshift and blueshift). The magnitude of this shift is related to the star's radial velocity.\n2.  **Wavelength Shift and Velocity**: The formula relating wavelength shift (Δλ) to radial velocity (v) is Δλ/λ = v/c. This confirms that the amplitude of the wavelength shift (what was measured) is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, K.\n3.  **Radial Velocity Amplitude (K)**: The amplitude of the star's velocity variation, K, is influenced by the planet's mass (m_p), the star's mass (M_star), the orbital period (P), and the inclination of the orbit (i). My formula, K = (m_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3)) * ( (2πG) / P )^(1/3), is correct for a circular orbit.\n4.  **Assumptions**: The problem provides that M_star1 = M_star2 and that the planets have similar masses. As discussed, in the context of RV measurements, \"mass\" refers to the minimum mass, m_p * sin(i), since the inclination is unknown. Therefore, the assumption that (m_p * sin(i))₁ = (m_p * sin(i))₂ is the most logical interpretation to make the problem solvable.\n5.  **Derivation**:\n    *   From Δλ ∝ K, we have K₁/K₂ = Δλ₁/Δλ₂ = 5/7.\n    *   From the RV amplitude formula, with M_star and m_p*sin(i) being the same for both systems, K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3).\n    *   Therefore, K₁/K₂ = (P₂/P₁)^(1/3).\n    *   Equating the two expressions for the K ratio: 5/7 = (P₂/P₁)^(1/3).\n    *   Solving for the period ratio: P₂/P₁ = (5/7)³.\n    *   Calculation: P₂/P₁ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.\n\nThe reasoning holds up perfectly and is well-supported by the fundamental principles of the radial velocity method described in the search results. The answer should be D.\n\nThe question is straightforward enough that it doesn't seem to require further complex searching. I am confident in the result.\n\nFinal calculation:\n(5/7)^3 = 125/343 = 0.364431486...\nThe closest option is D) ~ 0.36.\n\nThe problem relies on understanding the relationship between the observed quantity (wavelength shift) and the physical parameters of the system (masses and period). The core relationship is that the velocity amplitude K is proportional to P^(-1/3). Since the wavelength shift is proportional to K, it is also proportional to P^(-1/3). Thus, P is proportional to (wavelength shift)^(-3).\n\nP₂/P₁ = (Δλ₂/Δλ₁)⁻³ = (Δλ₁/Δλ₂)³ = (5/7)³ ≈ 0.36.\n\nThe logic is sound.\n\nThe question asks for \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\", which is the ratio P₂/P₁. The result 0.36 means that the period of planet #2 is shorter than planet #1, not longer. The phrasing \"how many times... longer\" might be slightly confusing, but it just asks for the ratio. Since the ratio is less than 1, it is shorter. Option D is the correct numerical value for this ratio.\n\nFinal check of the calculation and options.\nA) ~ 0.85\nB) ~ 1.96\nC) ~ 1.40\nD) ~ 0.36\n\nCalculation: (5/7)^3 = 0.364... This matches D.\n\nWhat if the ratio was inverted? P₁/P₂ = (7/5)³ = 343/125 = 2.744. Not an option.\nWhat if the power was not cubed? 5/7 = 0.714. Not an option. 7/5 = 1.4. This is option C. This would happen if P ∝ 1/K. But K ∝ P^(-1/3), so P ∝ K^(-3). So C is incorrect.\nWhat if the power was a square? (5/7)² = 25/49 ≈ 0.51. Not an option.\nWhat if the power was a cube root? (5/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.89. This is close to A. But this would be P₂/P₁ = K₁/K₂, which is wrong.\n\nMy derivation seems robust. The answer is D.\nTo determine the ratio of the orbital periods, we must relate the observable quantity, the wavelength shift (Δλ), to the orbital period (P).\n\n1.  **Doppler Shift and Radial Velocity:** The radial velocity (RV) method is based on the Doppler effect. The observed shift in the wavelength (Δλ) of a spectral line is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) along the line of sight. The amplitude of this periodic shift, Δλ_max, is proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, K.\n    *   Δλ_max ∝ K\n\n    Therefore, the ratio of the velocity amplitudes for the two stars is equal to the ratio of their maximum wavelength shifts:\n    *   K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 miliangstrom / 7 miliangstrom = 5/7\n\n2.  **Radial Velocity Amplitude Formula:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the amplitude of the host star's radial velocity (K) is given by the formula:\n    *   K = ( (2πG) / P )^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3))\n\n    Where:\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   m_p is the planet's mass.\n    *   M_star is the star's mass.\n    *   i is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Applying the Formula to the Two Systems:** We are given that the stars have the same mass (M_star1 = M_star2) and the planets have similar masses. In the context of the RV method, the quantity that is actually determined is the minimum mass, *m_p* sin(*i*). The statement that the planets have \"masses similar to that of Neptune\" implies that the measured minimum masses are the same for both. Therefore, we can assume:\n    *   M_star1 = M_star2 = M_star\n    *   (m_p * sin(i))₁ = (m_p * sin(i))₂\n\n4.  **Finding the Relationship between Period and Velocity Amplitude:** With these assumptions, most terms in the RV amplitude formula are constant for both systems. We can see the relationship between K and P:\n    *   K ∝ (1/P)^(1/3) or K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n5.  **Calculating the Ratio of the Periods:** Now we can set up a ratio for the two systems:\n    *   K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n\n    We already found that K₁ / K₂ = 5/7. Substituting this in:\n    *   5/7 = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)\n\n    To solve for the ratio of the orbital periods (P₂ / P₁), we cube both sides of the equation:\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = (5/7)³\n    *   P₂ / P₁ = 125 / 343\n    *   P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\n    This value is approximately 0.36.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) ~ 0.85\nB) ~ 1.96\nC) ~ 1.40\nD) ~ 0.36\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
