    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms.\n\n### Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H₃O⁺\n\n1.  **Epoxidation**: The treatment of an alkene with a peroxyacid like mCPBA is an epoxidation reaction. This reaction is a *syn*-addition, meaning the oxygen atom adds to both carbons of the double bond from the same face. When the starting alkene is *trans* (E), this results in a *trans*-epoxide. For (E)-oct-4-ene, this step produces a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening**: The subsequent addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring to form a diol (a molecule with two hydroxyl groups). This ring-opening is an *anti*-addition; the incoming water molecule attacks from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen. When the *trans*-epoxide (either the R,R or the S,S enantiomer) undergoes *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl groups, the result is a single, achiral product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**. This meso compound has two chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal plane of symmetry.\n\n### Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA, then H₃O⁺\n\n1.  **Epoxidation**: When the starting alkene is *cis* (Z), the *syn*-addition of the oxygen atom produces a *cis*-epoxide. In the case of (Z)-oct-4-ene, the product is the achiral **meso-4,5-epoxyoctane**.\n\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening**: The acid-catalyzed *anti*-addition of water to the meso-epoxide results in the formation of a pair of enantiomers. Attack at one carbon of the epoxide yields the (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, and attack at the other carbon yields the (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Since both attacks are equally likely, a racemic mixture is formed. The product is **racemic (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct chemical species:\n*   **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThese three compounds are stereoisomers. The meso compound is a diastereomer to both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers. The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) compounds are enantiomers of each other.\n\n### Chromatographic Observation\n\n**1. Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n*   An achiral HPLC column cannot distinguish between enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in a non-chiral environment. Therefore, the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers will have the same retention time and elute together as a single peak.\n*   Diastereomers, however, have different physical properties and can be separated by achiral chromatography. The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different retention time.\n*   Consequently, the chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC:**\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation. Thus, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n*   The meso compound, being a diastereomer of the other two, will also have a unique retention time and will appear as a distinct peak.\n*   Therefore, the chemist will observe **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\nBased on this analysis, there will be 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>"
