    "To determine the energy at which high-energy gamma-rays ($\\gamma$) would have their lifetimes limited by annihilation with a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon to produce an electron-positron pair ($\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$), we need to find the threshold energy for this reaction.\n\n### 1. The Physics of Pair Production\n\nThe creation of an electron ($e^-$) and a positron ($e^+$) pair requires an amount of energy at least equal to their combined rest mass energy. The rest mass energy of an electron is given by Einstein's equation, $E = m_e c^2$.\n\n*   **Electron Rest Mass Energy ($m_e c^2$):** The established value for the rest mass energy of a single electron is approximately 0.511 MeV. Since a positron has the same mass, the minimum energy required to create the pair is $2 \\times m_e c^2 = 1.022$ MeV.\n\n### 2. The Collision Kinematics\n\nThe interaction involves a high-energy gamma-ray ($E_\\gamma$) and a low-energy CMB photon ($\\epsilon$). For the reaction to be possible, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame of the two photons must be at least $2 m_e c^2$.\n\nThe condition to reach this threshold depends on the angle of collision. The minimum energy for the incoming gamma-ray ($E_\\gamma$) is required in a head-on collision, where the two photons travel towards each other.\n\nThe formula for the threshold energy of the high-energy gamma-ray in a head-on collision is:\n\n$E_\\gamma \\ge \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{\\epsilon}$\n\n### 3. Calculation\n\nWe can now calculate the threshold energy using the given and known values:\n\n*   **Rest Mass Energy of an Electron ($m_e c^2$):** 0.511 MeV = $0.511 \\times 10^6$ eV.\n*   **Average Energy of a CMB Photon ($\\epsilon$):** Provided as $10^{-3}$ eV. This is a typical value used for such calculations, as the CMB has a thermal black body spectrum with an average photon energy in this range.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n$E_\\gamma \\ge \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n$E_\\gamma \\ge \\frac{0.2611 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n$E_\\gamma \\ge 0.2611 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\n$E_\\gamma \\ge 2.611 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\n### 4. Conversion to GeV\n\nThe final step is to convert this energy from electronvolts (eV) to giga-electronvolts (GeV).\n\n*   $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$\n\n$E_\\gamma \\ge \\frac{2.611 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}}$\n\n$E_\\gamma \\ge 2.611 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated threshold energy is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV. Gamma-rays with energies at or above this value will interact with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs, a process that significantly limits their travel distance, and thus their lifetime, in the universe. This phenomenon is a key reason why very-high-energy gamma rays from distant sources are attenuated.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n\nA) 1.8*1e5 GeV\nB) 9.5*1e4 GeV\nC) 3.9*1e5 GeV\nD) 2.6*1e5 GeV\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
