    "To identify the unknown compound's chemical formula, we must analyze the data from the characterization techniques provided.\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n*   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in carboxylic acids. The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n*   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch, which is a key feature of carboxylic acids (1760-1690 cm⁻¹).\n*   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n\n**2. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond in the molecule. Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbon atoms of a double bond.\n\n**3. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry:**\n*   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a very common fragment for carboxylic acids, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ ion.\n\n**4. Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\nThe combined spectral data indicate the presence of both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\n*   A carboxylic acid contains one C=O double bond, which accounts for one degree of unsaturation.\n*   A C=C double bond accounts for a second degree of unsaturation.\nTherefore, the molecule must have a total of two degrees of unsaturation.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the possible formulas:\n*   **C6H12O2:** DoU = (2*6 + 2 - 12) / 2 = 2/2 = 1. This can only account for the carboxylic acid's C=O bond, not the additional C=C bond.\n*   **C6H10O2:** DoU = (2*6 + 2 - 10) / 2 = 4/2 = 2. This fits our requirement for one C=O bond and one C=C bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) is strongly supported by the broad FTIR peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, the carbonyl peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, and the mass spectrum fragment at m/z 45. The existence of a carbon-carbon double bond is confirmed by the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ and the vinyl hydrogens in the 1H NMR spectrum. A molecule with both these functional groups must have two degrees of unsaturation. Only the formula C6H10O2 satisfies this condition.\n\n<<<A>>>"
