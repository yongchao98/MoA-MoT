    "To determine the time elapsed for the astronaut, we must use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nFirst, we need to establish the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). According to astronomical observations, the distance to the LMC is approximately 158,200 to 163,000 light-years. For this calculation, we will use a value of approximately 158,200 light-years, which aligns with one of the provided search results.\n\n**1. Time of Travel in Earth's Reference Frame (Δt):**\nThis is the time an observer on Earth would measure for the spacecraft's journey.\n\n*   **Distance (d):** 158,200 light-years\n*   **Speed (v):** 0.99999987 * c\n\nThe time (Δt) is calculated as distance divided by speed:\nΔt = d / v = 158,200 light-years / (0.99999987 * c)\nSince a light-year is the distance light travels in one year (c * 1 year), the 'c' units cancel out.\nΔt ≈ 158,200.02 years\n\nFrom an Earth-based perspective, the journey takes just over 158,200 years.\n\n**2. Time Dilation and the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\nDue to traveling at a relativistic speed, time for the astronaut will pass much slower than for an observer on Earth. This effect is determined by the Lorentz factor (γ).\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.99999987²)\nγ ≈ 1 / √(2.6 x 10⁻⁷)\nγ ≈ 1 / 0.0005099\nγ ≈ 1961.17\n\n**3. Time of Travel for the Astronaut (Δt₀):**\nThe time experienced by the astronaut (the proper time, Δt₀) is the time measured in Earth's frame divided by the Lorentz factor.\n\nΔt₀ = Δt / γ\nΔt₀ ≈ 158,200.02 years / 1961.17\nΔt₀ ≈ 80.66 years\n\nThis is approximately 81 years.\n\n**4. Astronaut's Age Upon Arrival:**\nThe astronaut was 22 years old at the start of the journey. The time elapsed for the astronaut is about 81 years.\n\n*   Final Age = 22 years + 81 years = 103 years.\n\nSince the average lifetime of the alien species is 150 years, the 103-year-old astronaut will arrive on Earth alive. The travel time from the astronaut's point of view is approximately 81 years.\n\n<<<A>>>"
