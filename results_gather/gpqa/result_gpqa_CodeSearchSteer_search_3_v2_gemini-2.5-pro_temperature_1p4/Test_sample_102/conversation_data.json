    "To determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a step-by-step analysis of each proposed pathway is necessary, paying close attention to the directing effects of the substituents and the compatibility of the reactions.\n\nThe target molecule has an acetyl group, a bromo group, and a nitro group at positions 1, 3, and 5, respectively. This meta-directing pattern suggests a specific order of reactions is crucial for a successful synthesis.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Substituent Effects**:\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3)**: Deactivating and a meta-director.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br)**: Deactivating and an ortho-, para-director.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO2)**: Strongly deactivating and a meta-director.\n    *   **Amino group (-NH2)**: Strongly activating and an ortho-, para-director. When protonated in strong acid (e.g., during nitration), it becomes the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a strong deactivating meta-director.\n\n2.  **Evaluation of the Options**:\n\n    *   **Option A**: This route begins with Friedel-Crafts acylation, followed by bromination to correctly form 3-bromoacetophenone. However, the subsequent nitration would likely yield a mixture of products, and the following steps (reduction of the nitro group and then another nitration and deamination) are illogical if the target compound was already formed. This pathway is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option B**: This sequence involves nitration, reduction to aniline, diazotization, and then deamination with H3PO2. This sequence of reactions effectively reverts nitrobenzene back to benzene, making the initial steps pointless. This pathway is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Option C**: This path starts with bromination, followed by nitration. This would primarily produce the para-isomer (1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene) due to the ortho-, para-directing nature of bromine. A subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation is not feasible because the nitro group strongly deactivates the ring. This route cannot produce the desired 1,3,5-substituted product in high yield.\n\n    *   **Option D**: This sequence provides a logical, albeit lengthy, pathway that uses a temporary directing group to achieve the correct substitution pattern.\n        *   **i) HNO3/H2SO4**: Benzene is nitrated to nitrobenzene.\n        *   **ii) Fe/HCl**: The nitro group is reduced to an amino group, forming aniline.\n        *   **iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3**: While direct Friedel-Crafts acylation of aniline is problematic because the amine acts as a Lewis base and reacts with the AlCl3 catalyst, this can refer to a Fries rearrangement of N-phenylacetamide to produce p-aminoacetophenone. Assuming this step yields the intended p-aminoacetophenone, the synthesis proceeds.\n        *   **iv) Br2/FeBr3**: Bromination of p-aminoacetophenone. The powerful activating amino group directs the bromine to the position ortho to it (and meta to the acetyl group), yielding 4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone.\n        *   **v) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of 4-amino-3-bromoacetophenone. The directing effects of the substituents must be carefully considered. The strong ortho-, para-directing amino group (-NH2) and the meta-directing acetyl group (-COCH3) both direct the incoming nitro group to position 5. The ortho-, para-directing bromo group directs to positions 2 and 6. The combined effect of the amino and acetyl groups guides the nitration to position 5, resulting in 4-amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.\n        *   **vi) NaNO2/HCl**: The primary amino group at position 4 is converted into a diazonium salt.\n        *   **vii) H3PO2**: The diazonium group is removed via deamination, replacing it with a hydrogen atom. This final step yields the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThis sequence cleverly uses the amino group as a temporary directing group to install the bromo and nitro substituents in the correct positions before being removed. This multi-step process is a classic strategy to overcome challenging directing-group conflicts and achieve a high yield of a specific polysubstituted isomer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
