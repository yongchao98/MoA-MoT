    "The Google search confirms the general approach. The mole fraction (or percentage) of a specific complex species MLn can be calculated if the stability constants and the free ligand concentration are known. The formula for the fraction of a particular species, let's say ML_i, is given by:\n\nFraction(ML_i) = (β_i * [L]^i) / (1 + Σ(β_n * [L]^n))\n\nwhere:\n*   β_n is the overall stability constant for the complex ML_n.\n*   [L] is the concentration of the free ligand.\n*   The summation in the denominator is over all complex species formed.\n\nIn our specific problem:\n*   The metal is Co(II).\n*   The ligand L is thiocyanate, SCN⁻.\n*   The species are [Co(SCN)]⁺, [Co(SCN)₂], [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻.\n*   The overall stability constants are β₁, β₂, β₃, and β₄.\n*   The free ligand concentration is [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.\n*   We want to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂].\n\nThe formula for the fraction of [Co(SCN)₂] is:\n\nFraction = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nI will now substitute the given values into this formula to calculate the final answer.\n\nGiven values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nCalculations:\n*   Numerator = β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   Denominator terms:\n    *   1\n    *   β₁ * [SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n    *   β₂ * [SCN⁻]² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n    *   β₃ * [SCN⁻]³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n    *   β₄ * [SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n*   Denominator Sum = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n*   Fraction = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n*   Percentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThe calculation matches option C. The provided total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M, is not needed for this specific question because the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co²⁺], cancels out when calculating the relative percentage of the complex. This is a common feature in speciation calculations when the free ligand concentration is known or can be reasonably approximated.\n\nFinal check of the calculation:\nNumerator = 0.4\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\nFraction = 0.4 / 2.3646 = 0.16916180...\nPercentage = 16.916... %\n\nThis result corresponds to answer choice C.\n\nThe problem requires calculating the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], among all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co(II) ion and all the formed complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nUsing the overall stability constants (β), we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co²⁺], and the free thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻]:\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nBy substituting these into the total cobalt concentration equation, we get:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nThe percentage of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex is given by the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration, multiplied by 100:\nPercentage = ([[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)) * 100\nPercentage = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² / ([Co²⁺] (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))) * 100\n\nThe term [Co²⁺] cancels out. The problem states [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M. We can now plug in the given values:\nβ₁ = 9\nβ₂ = 40\nβ₃ = 63\nβ₄ = 16\n[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n\nFirst, let's calculate the terms in the denominator's sum:\n*   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, calculate the full denominator (often called the alpha function denominator or the partition function):\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe term for the desired complex, [Co(SCN)₂], in the fraction is the β₂[SCN⁻]² term, which is 0.4.\n\nNow, calculate the fraction:\nFraction of [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo get the percentage, multiply by 100:\nPercentage ≈ 16.916 %\n\nThis value is closest to 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
