    "To calculate the probability that a measurement of the observable P will yield 0, we must follow the principles of quantum mechanics. The possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the observable's operator. The probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue is found by projecting the system's state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector.\n\nThe procedure is as follows:\n\n1.  **Find the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of the observable matrix P.**\n    The observable `P` is given by the matrix:\n    ```\n    P = | 0    1/√2   0    |\n        | 1/√2   0    1/√2  |\n        | 0    1/√2   0    |\n    ```\n    To find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`, where `I` is the identity matrix.\n    `det(P - λI) = -λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ`\n    Setting the determinant to zero, `λ(1 - λ²) = 0`, gives the eigenvalues λ = 0, 1, and -1.\n\n2.  **Determine the eigenvector for the eigenvalue λ = 0.**\n    We solve the equation `Pv = 0v` for the eigenvector `v₀` corresponding to the eigenvalue 0.\n    ```\n    | 0    1/√2   0    | | x |   | 0 |\n    | 1/√2   0    1/√2  | | y | = | 0 |\n    | 0    1/√2   0    | | z |   | 0 |\n    ```\n    From the first and third rows, we get `(1/√2)y = 0`, which implies `y = 0`.\n    From the second row, `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0`, which simplifies to `x = -z`.\n    Thus, the eigenvector for λ=0 is of the form `(c, 0, -c)`. We can choose a simple representation for this eigenvector, for instance, by setting c=1, which gives `v₀ = (1, 0, -1)`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the probability.**\n    The probability of measuring an eigenvalue is the squared magnitude of the inner product of the normalized state vector and the normalized eigenvector, a principle known as the Born rule. The probability `Prob(λ)` is given by the formula: `Prob(λᵢ) = |⟨vᵢ|ψ⟩|² / (⟨vᵢ|vᵢ⟩⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`, where `vᵢ` is the eigenvector for the eigenvalue `λᵢ` and `ψ` is the state of the system.\n\n    The state of the system at time `t` is given by the column matrix `ψ = (-1, 2, 1)`.\n\n    First, we compute the necessary inner products:\n    *   `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` (the squared norm of the state vector):\n        `(-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n    *   `⟨v₀|v₀⟩` (the squared norm of the eigenvector):\n        `1² + 0² + (-1)² = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`\n    *   `⟨v₀|ψ⟩` (the inner product of the eigenvector and the state vector):\n        `(1 * -1) + (0 * 2) + (-1 * 1) = -1 + 0 - 1 = -2`\n\n    Now, substitute these values into the probability formula:\n    `Prob(0) = |-2|² / (2 * 6) = 4 / 12 = 1/3`\n\nTherefore, the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 is 1/3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
