    "### Analysis of the Solar Neutrino Spectrum\n\nTo determine the ratio of neutrino fluxes in the specified energy bands under the hypothetical condition, we must first understand the standard solar neutrino spectrum. The Sun produces neutrinos through several nuclear reactions, each with a characteristic energy spectrum. The primary reactions are part of the proton-proton (pp) chain and the CNO cycle.\n\n1.  **pp-I Branch**: The initial `p + p → ²H + e⁺ + νₑ` reaction produces the most abundant but lowest-energy \"pp\" neutrinos, with a continuous spectrum up to about 420 keV (0.42 MeV). These do not fall into the energy bands in question.\n\n2.  **pep Reaction**: The rare `p + e⁻ + p → ²H + νₑ` reaction produces a sharp, monochromatic energy line at 1.44 MeV. This is outside the 700-900 keV range.\n\n3.  **pp-II Branch**: This branch involves the electron capture by Beryllium-7 (`⁷Be + e⁻ → ⁷Li + νₑ`). This reaction is the crucial source for the energy bands of interest. It produces two distinct monochromatic neutrino energy lines: a major one at **862 keV (0.862 MeV)** (about 90% of the time) and a minor one at 384 keV (0.384 MeV) (about 10% of the time).\n\n4.  **pp-III Branch**: This branch, which the problem states has stopped, is responsible for producing Boron-8 (⁸B). The subsequent decay of ⁸B (`⁸B → ⁸Be* + e⁺ + νₑ`) produces high-energy \"⁸B\" neutrinos. These neutrinos have a continuous energy spectrum that extends up to about 15 MeV. Normally, these neutrinos contribute a small but significant flux across a wide range of energies, including the 700-900 keV region.\n\n5.  **CNO Cycle**: Neutrinos from the CNO cycle also contribute, but their flux is continuous and significantly lower than the key `⁷Be` and `⁸B` fluxes in this energy region.\n\n### Impact of the Hypothetical Shutdown\n\nThe problem states that the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Since neutrinos travel from the Sun to the Earth in about 8.5 minutes, we are observing the immediate effect of this shutdown.\n\n*   **Effect**: The flux of ⁸B neutrinos drops to zero.\n*   **No Effect**: The fluxes from all other reactions, including pp-I, pp-II (`⁷Be` neutrinos), pep, and the CNO cycle, remain unchanged.\n\n### Calculating the Flux Ratio\n\nNow we evaluate the neutrino flux in the two specified energy bands with the ⁸B neutrino flux removed.\n\n*   **Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n    *   Under normal conditions, this band contains a small contribution from the continuous spectrum of ⁸B neutrinos and some CNO neutrinos.\n    *   Crucially, the prominent 862 keV line from `⁷Be` decay does **not** fall within this band.\n    *   With the pp-III branch shut down, the ⁸B neutrino flux disappears. The remaining flux in this band would be from the low-level continuum of CNO neutrinos.\n\n*   **Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n    *   This band is dominated by the very strong, monochromatic 862 keV line from the `⁷Be` neutrinos produced in the pp-II branch.\n    *   While this band would also normally have a contribution from the continuous ⁸B spectrum, the `⁷Be` line flux is overwhelmingly dominant in this narrow energy window.\n    *   With the pp-III branch shut down, the ⁸B flux vanishes, but the extremely high flux from the `⁷Be` line at 862 keV remains.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter the hypothetical cessation of the pp-III branch:\n\n*   **Flux (Band 1: 700-800 keV)** becomes extremely low, composed of only the tail end of CNO neutrino spectra.\n*   **Flux (Band 2: 800-900 keV)** remains very high due to the dominant, narrow `⁷Be` energy line at 862 keV.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of Flux (Band 1) to Flux (Band 2) will be a very small number divided by a very large number. This results in a ratio that is significantly less than 1. Reviewing the solar neutrino spectrum graphs confirms that the flux from the `⁷Be` line is several orders of magnitude higher than the continuum flux from other sources (like CNO or the now-absent ⁸B) in the adjacent 700-800 keV band.\n\nThe ratio will be much smaller than 1. Of the choices provided:\n*   A) 0.01 (10⁻²)\n*   B) 0.1 (10⁻¹)\n*   C) 1\n*   D) 10\n\nThe most plausible answer is 0.01, representing a two-orders-of-magnitude difference between the near-empty Band 1 and the `⁷Be`-dominated Band 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
