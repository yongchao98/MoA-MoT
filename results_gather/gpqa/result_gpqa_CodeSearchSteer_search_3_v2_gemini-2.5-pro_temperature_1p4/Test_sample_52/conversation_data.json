    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   **Structure:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring (a benzene ring with two substituents).\n    *   **FTIR:** An ester group (-COO-) is present. This means the formula will contain O2.\n    *   **¹H NMR:**\n        *   Six total signals.\n        *   Two aromatic-H signals suggest a symmetrically substituted ring, likely a para (1,4) substitution pattern. A di-substituted ring has 4 aromatic protons (C₆H₄).\n        *   Two vinyl-H signals (C=C-H). The splitting pattern is key: one is a doublet and the other is a doublet of quartets. This pattern strongly indicates a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). The proton on the carbon attached to the ring is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet). The second vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (doublet) and the adjacent three methyl protons (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n        *   Two -CH₃ signals. One methyl group is from the propenyl group identified above. The other must be part of the second substituent.\n        *   No -CH₂ signals. This rules out groups like ethyl, propyl, or allyl (-CH₂-CH=CH₂).\n\n2.  **Assemble the structure:**\n    *   We have a benzene ring (C₆H₄).\n    *   Substituent 1 is a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃), which accounts for one vinyl group and one methyl group. Its formula is C₃H₅.\n    *   Substituent 2 must be an ester and contain the second methyl group. The simplest such group is a methyl ester, -COOCH₃. Its formula is C₂H₃O₂.\n    *   Putting these pieces together gives a molecule like methyl p-(1-propenyl)benzoate. This structure is consistent with all the provided NMR data (para-substituted ring, propenyl group, two different methyl groups, no CH₂ groups).\n\n3.  **Determine the Chemical Formula:**\n    *   Let's count the atoms in the proposed structure, `CH₃-CH=CH-C₆H₄-COOCH₃`:\n        *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (in the benzene ring) + 3 (in the propenyl group) + 1 (in the carbonyl C=O) + 1 (in the ester's methyl group) = **11 Carbons**.\n        *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (on the benzene ring) + 5 (in the propenyl group: 1+1+3) + 3 (in the ester's methyl group) = **12 Hydrogens**.\n        *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (in the ester group).\n    *   The resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. Several known compounds have this formula, including ethyl cinnamate and its isomers, which fit the general description.\n\n4.  **Check the Degree of Unsaturation:**\n    *   The formula for the degree of unsaturation is C - H/2 + 1.\n    *   For C₁₁H₁₂O₂, this is 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = 6.\n    *   The proposed structure has a benzene ring (4 degrees of unsaturation), a C=C double bond (1 degree), and a C=O double bond (1 degree), for a total of 6 degrees of unsaturation. This confirms the formula is consistent with the structural features.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\n    *   B) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\n    *   C) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\n    *   D) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n    *   Our deduced formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
