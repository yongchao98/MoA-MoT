    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution.\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of each component:**\n    *   The molar mass of KH₂PO₄ is 136.09 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol.\n    *   The molar mass of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O is 177.99 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol.\n\n2.  **Determine the initial molar concentrations:**\n    *   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.200 L.\n    *   The concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ is from KH₂PO₄:\n        [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M.\n    *   The concentration of HPO₄²⁻ is from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O:\n        [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M.\n\n3.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]:**\n    *   The solution is a buffer composed of the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻ and its conjugate base HPO₄²⁻. The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n        H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   The acid dissociation constant for this reaction is Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸.\n    *   The equilibrium expression is: Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻].\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n        [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n        [H⁺] ≈ 8.11x10⁻⁸ M.\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO₄³⁻]:**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid, which involves the HPO₄²⁻ ion:\n        HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   The acid dissociation constant for this reaction is Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹².\n    *   The equilibrium expression is: Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻].\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   Using the values calculated above:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11x10⁻⁸ M)\n        [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.\n\nTherefore, the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution is approximately 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<A>>>"
