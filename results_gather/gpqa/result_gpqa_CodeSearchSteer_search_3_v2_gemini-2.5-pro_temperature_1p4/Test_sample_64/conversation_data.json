    "The selection of a suitable mechanism and the determination of the major products for the given reactions require a careful analysis of the substrates and reagents involved.\n\n### **Reaction 1: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol + (THF, KH, H+) → A**\n\n**Mechanism:** This reaction is a classic example of an anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement.\n1.  **Alkoxide Formation:** The strong base, potassium hydride (KH), deprotonates the tertiary alcohol to form a potassium alkoxide.\n2.  **-Sigmatropic Rearrangement:** The resulting alkoxide is a 1,5-dien-3-olate system, primed for a-sigmatropic rearrangement. This type of rearrangement is known to be exceptionally rapid for alkoxides, often accelerated by factors of 10¹⁰ to 10¹⁷ compared to the neutral counterpart. The rearrangement proceeds through a highly ordered, chair-like transition state. In this specific substrate, the rearrangement involves the six-atom chain `(CH₂=CH)–C(O⁻)–(C_spiro–C=C)`. The C-C bond between the cyclobutane ring and the spiro-carbon breaks, while a new C-C bond forms between the terminal carbon of the vinyl group and a carbon of the cyclohexene double bond.\n3.  **Enolate Quenching and Tautomerization:** The rearrangement produces an enolate intermediate. The subsequent acidic workup (H⁺) protonates the enolate, which then rapidly tautomerizes to the more stable ketone product.\n\n**Product A:** The ring-opening of the cyclobutane and the formation of a new bond leads to a bridged bicyclic system. A detailed connectivity analysis of the atoms reveals the formation of a **bicyclo[5.3.1]undecane** skeleton. The ketone group is located on the five-carbon bridge, and a double bond is formed at a bridgehead position. The final structure is **(E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one**.\n\n### **Reaction 2: (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol + acetyl bromide (Base = LDA) → B**\n\n**Mechanism:** This reaction sequence corresponds to an Ireland-Claisen rearrangement.\n1.  **Alkoxide and Ester Formation:** The strong, bulky base Lithium Diisopropylamide (LDA) deprotonates the allylic alcohol. The resulting lithium alkoxide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the acetyl bromide to form an allyl acetate ester, `(E)-pent-2-en-1-yl acetate`.\n2.  **Enolate Formation:** The LDA present in the reaction mixture then deprotonates the α-carbon of the newly formed ester (the methyl group of the acetyl moiety), creating a lithium ester enolate. This is the key step that initiates the rearrangement.\n3.  **-Sigmatropic Rearrangement:** The ester enolate undergoes a concerted-sigmatropic rearrangement. This is a powerful carbon-carbon bond-forming reaction. The C-O bond of the original ester linkage breaks, and a new C-C bond forms, resulting in a γ,δ-unsaturated carboxylate.\n4.  **Final Product:** The direct product from this rearrangement sequence is the lithium salt of the carboxylic acid, as no acidic workup step is specified.\n\n**Product B:** The rearrangement of the `(E)-pent-2-en-1-yl` group leads to a product with a `3-ethyl` substituent and a terminal double bond at the C4-C5 position. The resulting carboxylate is named **lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the mechanistic analysis:\n*   **Product A** is **(E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one**.\n*   **Product B** is **lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to the combination presented in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
