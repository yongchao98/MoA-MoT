    "To solve this problem, we can use the principles of orbital mechanics and the geometry of planetary transits. Here is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Understand the Transit Condition:** A planet is considered to be transiting its star if its center passes across the stellar disk. This is defined by the impact parameter, `b`, which is the projected distance between the center of the planet and the center of the star at mid-transit, normalized by the star's radius. For a transit to occur, the impact parameter `b` must be less than or equal to 1 (`b ≤ 1`). For both a transit and an occultation (when the planet passes behind the star) to occur, this geometric condition must be met. For circular orbits, if a planet transits, it will also be occulted.\n\n2.  **Define the Maximum Orbital Period Condition:** The maximum orbital period for the second planet corresponds to the maximum possible semi-major axis (`a₂`) at which it can still transit the star. This occurs at the maximum possible impact parameter, which is `b₂ = 1`.\n\n3.  **Relate the Two Planets:** The problem states that both planets share the same orbital plane. This means they have the same orbital inclination (`i`) with respect to our line of sight.\n\n4.  **Use Planet 1's Data:** We can use the information for the first planet to determine the constant orbital inclination `i`. The formula for the impact parameter is:\n    *   `b = (a * cos(i)) / Rₛ`\n    *   For planet 1: `b₁ = 0.2`, so `0.2 = (a₁ * cos(i)) / Rₛ`.\n    *   From this, we can express `cos(i)` as: `cos(i) = (0.2 * Rₛ) / a₁`.\n\n5.  **Use Planet 2's Condition:** For the second planet to have the maximum possible period, its impact parameter `b₂` must be 1.\n    *   `b₂ = 1 = (a₂_max * cos(i)) / Rₛ`.\n\n6.  **Combine the Equations:** Now, substitute the expression for `cos(i)` from planet 1 into the equation for planet 2:\n    *   `1 = (a₂_max / Rₛ) * (0.2 * Rₛ / a₁)`\n    *   The stellar radius `Rₛ` cancels out, simplifying the equation to: `1 = 0.2 * (a₂_max / a₁)`\n    *   Solving for the ratio of the semi-major axes: `a₂_max / a₁ = 1 / 0.2 = 5`.\n\n7.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`a`). We can write this as a ratio for our two planets:\n    *   `(P₂_max / P₁)² = (a₂_max / a₁)³`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Maximum Period for Planet 2:** We can now solve for `P₂_max` using the known period of planet 1 (`P₁ = 3` days) and the calculated ratio of the semi-major axes.\n    *   `P₂_max = P₁ * (a₂_max / a₁)^(3/2)`\n    *   `P₂_max = 3 * (5)^(3/2)`\n    *   `P₂_max = 3 * 5 * √5`\n    *   `P₂_max ≈ 3 * 5 * 2.236 = 33.54` days.\n\nThis result of approximately 33.5 days matches option D. The radii of the planets and the star were not needed for this calculation, as the relationship depends on the ratio of the orbital distances, which could be determined from the impact parameters directly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
