    "To calculate the energies of the system, we must first understand the behavior of the four identical spin-1/2 particles within the one-dimensional infinite potential well. These particles are fermions, so they obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle dictates that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state in this system is defined by both the energy level (principal quantum number *n*) and the spin state (spin up or spin down). This means each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\nThe energy for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L is given by `En = n² * (π²ħ²/2mL²)`. The problem defines the base energy unit as `E = π²ħ²/2mL²`, so the single-particle energy levels are `En = n²E`, where *n* = 1, 2, 3, ...\n\n**Ground State Energy**\n\nTo find the ground state energy, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n*   Two particles will fill the lowest energy level, n=1. The energy for these two particles is 2 × E₁ = 2 × (1²E) = 2E.\n*   The remaining two particles will occupy the next energy level, n=2. The energy for these two particles is 2 × E₂ = 2 × (2²E) = 2 × 4E = 8E.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n**First Excited State Energy**\n\nTo determine the energy of the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the next available unoccupied energy level. This represents the smallest possible energy increase.\n*   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2. We will move one particle from n=2 to the n=3 level.\n*   The new configuration will be: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n*   The total energy for this configuration is: (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (2 × 1²E) + (1 × 2²E) + (1 × 3²E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n**Second Excited State Energy**\n\nFor the second excited state, we must find the next lowest energy configuration above the first excited state. There are a few possibilities to consider starting from the ground state configuration:\n1.  Promote one particle from the n=1 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, one particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy: (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × 1²E) + (2 × 2²E) + (1 × 3²E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n2.  Promote both particles from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=3.\n    *   Energy: (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × 1²E) + (2 × 3²E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n3.  Promote one particle from the n=2 level to the n=4 level.\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, one particle in n=4.\n    *   Energy: (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × 1²E) + (1 × 2²E) + (1 × 4²E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing these energies (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest energy above the first excited state is 18E. Therefore, the second excited state energy is 18E.\n\nThe calculated energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<D>>>"
