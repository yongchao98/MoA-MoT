    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each option to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This planet would have a density identical to Earth's, which is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly given as about 5.5 g/cm³, which is nearly the same as Earth's.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** A planet with a smaller mass than Earth, but the same composition, would experience less gravitational compression. Gravity acts on an object's mass, compressing it and increasing its density. With less mass, the gravitational force is weaker, leading to less compression and therefore a lower overall density compared to Earth.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** This planet, having the same raw materials as Earth but five times the mass, would be subject to significantly stronger gravitational compression. This intense gravity would squeeze the planetary materials more tightly together, resulting in a higher overall density. For rocky planets with similar compositions, density tends to increase with mass due to this compression.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the four scenarios, the planet that is five times more massive than Earth but with the same composition (c) will be compressed the most by its own gravity, leading to the highest density. The planets in options (a) and (b) have densities very close to Earth's, and the planet in option (d) would be less dense than Earth. Therefore, option (c) describes the planet with the highest density.\n\n<<<D>>>"
