    "The search results confirm my understanding and the formula I derived. Specifically, result provides the exact formula for the total mass of a binary system: `m1 + m2 = (P / (2 * pi * G)) * ((v1r + v2r)^3 / sin^3(i))`. Here, `v1r` and `v2r` are the radial velocity amplitudes, which are denoted as K1 and K2 in my derivation. Result also states that for eclipsing binaries, the inclination `i` is approximately 90°, so `sin(i)` is approximately 1. This confirms my assumption. Results and further explain that for eclipsing binaries, the inclination can be determined, allowing for the calculation of individual and total masses.\n\nMy derivation and calculation steps are correct. I can proceed with formulating the final answer based on my calculation.\n\n1.  **Identify the relationship between total mass, period, and radial velocity amplitudes.**\n    The total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) of an eclipsing binary system is given by the formula:\n    M_total = [P * (K1 + K2)³] / [2 * π * G * sin³(i)]\n    Since both are eclipsing systems, we assume the inclination i ≈ 90°, so sin³(i) ≈ 1.\n    Therefore, the mass is directly proportional to the period and the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes:\n    M_total ∝ P * (K_total)³\n\n2.  **Calculate the required values for each system.**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Period (P1) = 2 years\n        *   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K_total1) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Period (P2) = 1 year\n        *   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K_total2) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n3.  **Calculate the ratio of the masses (M1 / M2).**\n    M1 / M2 = [P1 * (K_total1)³] / [P2 * (K_total2)³]\n    M1 / M2 = (P1 / P2) * (K_total1 / K_total2)³\n\n4.  **Substitute the values and solve.**\n    M1 / M2 = (2 / 1) * (15 / 25)³\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (3 / 5)³\n    M1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\n    M1 / M2 = 54 / 125\n    M1 / M2 = 0.432\n\n5.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    The calculated ratio is 0.432. This value is closest to option A (~ 0.4).\n\nFinal Answer is A.\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the total mass of each binary system using the provided observational data. The key is to use the formula that relates the total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic binary to its orbital period and the radial velocity amplitudes of its components.\n\n### **1. The Formula for Total Mass**\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the sum of the masses of the two stars (M = m₁ + m₂) can be related to the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves (K₁ and K₂) by the following formula:\n\nM₁ + M₂ = [P * (K₁ + K₂)³] / [2πG * sin³(i)]\n\nwhere:\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   K₁ and K₂ are the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   i is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n\nThe problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. For an eclipsing binary system, the orbit is viewed nearly edge-on, which means the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°. Therefore, sin(i) ≈ 1, and sin³(i) ≈ 1. This simplifies the mass equation significantly, making the total mass directly proportional to the period and the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes.\n\nM_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³\n\n### **2. Calculating the Ratio of Masses**\nWe want to find the factor by which system 1 is more massive than system 2, which is the ratio M₁ / M₂.\n\nUsing the proportionality derived above:\n\nM₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ)³] / [P₂ * (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ)³]\n\n### **3. Plugging in the Values**\nLet's use the data provided for each system:\n\n*   **System 1:**\n    *   Period (P₁) = 2 years\n    *   Sum of RV amplitudes = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n*   **System 2:**\n    *   Period (P₂) = 1 year\n    *   Sum of RV amplitudes = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, substitute these values into the ratio equation:\n\nM₁ / M₂ = (2 years / 1 year) * (15 km/s / 25 km/s)³\n\n### **4. Final Calculation**\nSimplify the expression:\n\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3/5)³\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125\nM₁ / M₂ = 0.432\n\nThe calculated factor is 0.432. Comparing this result to the given options, the closest value is ~0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
