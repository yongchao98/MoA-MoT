    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to identify substance A4 and its molecular weight range.\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y:**\n    *   The prompt states that element Y forms five binary compounds with fluorine. This is a rare property. Gold (Au) is a known element that forms five such compounds: AuF, AuF₂, AuF₃, AuF₅, and AuF₇.\n    *   Let's test this hypothesis with the clue that substance A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%. The decomposition of A1 into A2 and fluorine implies A1 has a higher oxidation state than A2.\n    *   Let's calculate the ɷF for the higher gold fluorides:\n        *   For AuF₃ (Molar Mass ≈ 254 g/mol): ɷF = (3 * 19.00) / 254.0 = 22.4%\n        *   For AuF₅ (Molar Mass ≈ 292 g/mol): ɷF = (5 * 19.00) / 292.0 = 32.5%\n    *   The calculated mass percentage for AuF₅ (32.5%) is a very close match to the given 31.96%. Thus, we can confidently identify **A2 as AuF₅**. This strongly supports the hypothesis that **Y is Gold (Au)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Compounds A1, A2, and A3:**\n    *   **A2** is **AuF₅**.\n    *   **A1** is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K into A2 (AuF₅) and fluorine. This means A1 must be a higher fluoride of gold, which is **AuF₇**. The description of A1 as a powerful oxidizing agent that can react with xenon is consistent with a high-oxidation-state fluoride. Gold(V) fluoride, the core of this compound, is also described as a red solid.\n    *   **A3** is obtained by the fluorination of element Y (Au). The direct reaction of gold with fluorine typically produces **AuF₃**. AuF₃ is also a powerful fluorinating agent and could interact with xenon as stated.\n\n3.  **Identify A4 and A5:**\n    *   The five binary fluorides are AuF, AuF₂, AuF₃, AuF₅, and AuF₇. We have assigned A1, A2, and A3, leaving AuF and AuF₂ for A4 and A5.\n    *   The crucial clue is the reaction: **Y + A4 → A5** in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n    *   Substituting our identified substances: **Au + A4 → A5**.\n    *   This is a comproportionation reaction, where gold in different oxidation states reacts to form a product with an intermediate oxidation state.\n    *   Let's test the possibility where **A4 = AuF₂** and **A5 = AuF**. The reaction would be:\n        Au(0) + Au(II)F₂ → 2Au(I)F\n    *   This reaction is stoichiometrically balanced and chemically plausible. Importantly, the reactants Au (Y) and AuF₂ (A4) are in a **1:1 molar ratio**, perfectly matching the clue. The substance obtained is AuF (A5).\n    *   The final clue, that A5 decomposes in water, is also consistent, as AuF is unstable and would disproportionate in water.\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Weight of A4:**\n    *   Based on the deduction, substance **A4 is AuF₂** (gold(II) fluoride).\n    *   The molecular weight (molar mass) of AuF₂ is calculated as follows:\n        *   Atomic weight of Gold (Au) ≈ 196.97 g/mol\n        *   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 18.998 g/mol\n        *   Molecular Weight of AuF₂ = 196.97 + (2 * 18.998) = **234.966 g/mol**.\n\n5.  **Select the Correct Range:**\n    *   The calculated molecular weight of A4 (≈235 g/mol) falls within the range of **220-240**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
