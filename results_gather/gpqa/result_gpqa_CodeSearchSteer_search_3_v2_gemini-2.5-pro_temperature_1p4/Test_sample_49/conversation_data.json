    "The number of loops in the Feynman diagram can be determined from the mathematical expression provided.\n\nIn quantum field theory, calculations for processes involving loops of virtual particles are performed using a technique called dimensional regularization. A key feature of this method is that for each independent loop in a diagram, the calculation introduces a factor of `1/(4π)^2` into the resulting mathematical expression for a theory in four-dimensional spacetime.\n\nTherefore, a diagram with `L` loops will contain an overall factor of `(1/(4π)^2)^L`, which simplifies to `1/(4π)^(2L)`.\n\nThe note found on the desk has a factor of `1/(4pi)^6`. By comparing this to the general formula, we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n`2L = 6`\n\nSolving this simple equation for `L` gives:\n\n`L = 3`\n\nThus, the Feynman diagram must have contained three loops. The other terms in the expression, such as the coupling constants (`alpha^3 * g^2`) and the mass-to-energy ratio (`(Q/M)^2`), relate to other specific features of the diagram, like the number and type of vertices and the energies of the particles involved, but the power of `4π` is the most direct indicator of the loop number.\n\n<<<D>>>"
