    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Determine the Rest-Masses of the Fragments\n\nThe initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus is given as `Mc² = 300 GeV`. The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m₁` and `m₂`.\n\nWe are given two conditions:\n*   One fragment is twice as massive as the other: `m₁ = 2 * m₂`.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: `m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M`.\n\nBy substituting the first equation into the second, we can solve for the masses:\n`(2 * m₂) + m₂ = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m₂ = 0.99 * M`\n`m₂ = 0.33 * M`\n\nAnd for the more massive fragment:\n`m₁ = 2 * m₂ = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNow, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1 (the more massive one): `m₁c² = 0.66 * (Mc²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2: `m₂c² = 0.33 * (Mc²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the rest-mass energies of the fragments. This energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments, T₁ and T₂.\n`Q = T₁ + T₂ = Mc² - (m₁c² + m₂c²) `\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### 3. Calculate the Kinetic Energy T₁ using Classical Mechanics\n\nIn the classical (non-relativistic) approximation, kinetic energy is given by `T = p² / (2m)`, where `p` is momentum. Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the law of conservation of momentum requires the fragments to have equal and opposite momenta.\n`p₁ = p₂ = p`\n\nTherefore:\n`p² = 2 * m₁ * T₁_classical`\n`p² = 2 * m₂ * T₂_classical`\n\nSetting them equal:\n`m₁ * T₁_classical = m₂ * T₂_classical`\nSince `m₁ = 2 * m₂`:\n`2 * m₂ * T₁_classical = m₂ * T₂_classical`\n`T₂_classical = 2 * T₁_classical`\n\nUsing the total kinetic energy from Step 2:\n`T₁_classical + T₂_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_classical + (2 * T₁_classical) = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T₁_classical = 3 GeV`\n`T₁_classical = 1 GeV`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Kinetic Energy T₁ using Relativistic Mechanics\n\nFor the correct (relativistic) calculation, we use the energy-momentum relation: `E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`. The total energy `E` is the sum of the kinetic energy `T` and the rest-mass energy `mc²`, so `E = T + mc²`.\n`(T + mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\n`T² + 2Tmc² + (mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)²`\n`(pc)² = T² + 2Tmc²`\n\nAgain, from momentum conservation, `p₁ = p₂`, which means `(p₁c)² = (p₂c)²`.\n`T₁² + 2 * T₁ * m₁c² = T₂² + 2 * T₂ * m₂c²`\n\nWe know `T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁`, `m₁c² = 198 GeV`, and `m₂c² = 99 GeV`. Substituting these values:\n`T₁² + 2 * T₁ * (198) = (3 - T₁)² + 2 * (3 - T₁) * (99)`\n`T₁² + 396T₁ = (9 - 6T₁ + T₁²) + (594 - 198T₁)`\n`T₁² + 396T₁ = T₁² - 204T₁ + 603`\n`396T₁ = -204T₁ + 603`\n`600T₁ = 603`\n`T₁ = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\n\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation for T₁.\n`ΔT₁ = T₁ - T₁_classical`\n`ΔT₁ = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nTo match the answer options, we convert this to Mega-electron-volts (MeV), where `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`:\n`ΔT₁ = 0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThe difference between the correct T₁ value and the value calculated using the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
