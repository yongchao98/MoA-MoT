    "Here is the step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify Given Information\n*   **Energy of the particle (E):** 27 GeV\n*   **Rest mass of the particle (m₀):** 3.41 GeV/c² (which means m₀c² = 3.41 GeV)\n*   **Proper lifetime of the particle (τ₀):** 8 x 10⁻¹⁶ s\n*   **Condition:** Observe at least 30% of the decays.\n\n### 2. Determine the Goal\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe the decays. This can be interpreted in a couple of ways in particle physics problems:\n*   **Interpretation A:** The average distance the particle travels before decaying (the mean decay length).\n*   **Interpretation B:** The minimum track length a detector must be able to resolve to confirm that a certain fraction of particles have decayed.\n\nWe will proceed by first calculating the fundamental quantities and then evaluating both interpretations.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)\nThe Lorentz factor relates the total energy of a particle to its rest energy.\nγ = E / (m₀c²)\nγ = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV\nγ ≈ 7.918\n\n### 4. Calculate the Mean Decay Length in the Lab Frame (L)\nDue to time dilation, the particle's lifetime in the laboratory frame (τ) is longer than its proper lifetime (τ₀). The distance it travels is also affected by relativistic effects. The average distance a particle travels before decaying, known as the decay length (L), is calculated as follows:\nL = v * τ = v * (γ * τ₀)\nwhere v is the particle's velocity.\n\nThis can be expressed more directly using the formula:\nL = c * τ₀ * √(γ² - 1)\n\nNow, we plug in the values:\n*   c (speed of light) ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   τ₀ = 8 x 10⁻¹⁶ s\n*   γ ≈ 7.918\n\nL = (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (8 x 10⁻¹⁶ s) * √(7.918² - 1)\nL = (2.4 x 10⁻⁷ m) * √(62.69 - 1)\nL = (2.4 x 10⁻⁷ m) * √(61.69)\nL = (2.4 x 10⁻⁷ m) * 7.854\nL ≈ 1.885 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\nSo, the mean decay length is approximately 1.885 µm.\n\n### 5. Evaluate the \"30% of Decays\" Condition\nThe decay of particles follows an exponential law. The fraction of particles that have *not* decayed after traveling a distance `x` is given by N(x)/N₀ = exp(-x/L), where L is the mean decay length we just calculated.\n\nThe phrase \"minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays\" is slightly ambiguous. Let's analyze the most likely physical interpretation: To \"observe\" a decay, a particle must first travel a track of a minimum length, let's call it `d_res` (the resolution), before it decays. Any particle decaying before this distance is not considered \"observed\". Therefore, the \"observed\" decays are those from particles that travel at least the distance `d_res`.\n\nThe fraction of particles that travel at least a distance `d_res` is N(d_res)/N₀ = exp(-d_res / L).\nWe want this fraction to be at least 30% (0.30).\nexp(-d_res / L) ≥ 0.30\n-d_res / L ≥ ln(0.30)\nd_res ≤ -L * ln(0.30)\nd_res ≤ -L * (-1.204)\nd_res ≤ 1.204 * L\n\nThis gives an upper limit for the resolution. However, the question asks for a single value, which is often the result of setting the condition to equality. Let's calculate the distance `d` where the number of surviving particles is exactly 30%.\nd = -L * ln(0.30)\nd = (1.885 x 10⁻⁶ m) * 1.204\nd ≈ 2.27 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\n### 6. Compare with Options\nWe have two calculated values based on different interpretations:\n1.  **Mean Decay Length (L):** 1.885 x 10⁻⁶ m\n2.  **Resolution for 30% Observation (d):** 2.27 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\nNow let's look at the provided options:\nA) 2.08 x 10⁻³ m\nB) 2.08 x 10⁻¹ m\nC) 2.08 x 10⁻⁹ m\nD) 2.08 x 10⁻⁶ m\n\nBoth of our calculated values (1.885 µm and 2.27 µm) are very close in order of magnitude to option D (2.08 µm). The other options are off by several orders of magnitude. The slight discrepancy between our calculated values and the option value is common in such problems and is likely due to rounding or slight inaccuracies in the provided initial values. Both plausible physical interpretations point toward option D as the correct answer. The value in option D lies between the mean decay length and the length required to observe 30% of decays. Given the choices, 2.08*1e-6 m is the only physically reasonable answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
