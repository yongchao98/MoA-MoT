    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the product of the reaction between (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane and lithium dimethylcuprate (Me₂CuLi).\n\n### 1. Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide. The epoxide involves carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi, a Gilman reagent (an organocuprate). This provides a methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** Nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. Organocuprates are soft nucleophiles that are well-suited for this type of reaction.\n\n### 2. Determine the Regioselectivity\nThe first rule to consider is where the nucleophile will attack.\n*   For reactions with organocuprates and other strong, unhindered nucleophiles under basic or neutral conditions, the attack occurs at the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. This is a classic Sₙ2-type mechanism.\n*   The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6.\n*   **C1** is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group and two other ring carbons (C2 and C6).\n*   **C6** is a secondary carbon, bonded to two other ring carbons (C1 and C5) and a hydrogen.\n*   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile from Me₂CuLi will attack the less hindered **C6**.\n\n### 3. Determine the Stereochemistry\nThe second rule to consider is the stereochemical outcome of the attack.\n*   The ring-opening of epoxides via an Sₙ2 mechanism involves a backside attack. This means the nucleophile approaches from the side opposite the C-O bond, leading to an inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n*   The initial configuration at C6 is given as **(S)**.\n*   The nucleophilic attack by the methyl group at C6 will invert this center to an **(R)** configuration.\n*   The C-O bond at C1 will open and, after an aqueous workup, will form an alcohol (-OH). The stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) will retain their original configurations.\n\n### 4. Assemble the Product Structure\nBased on the analysis above, the resulting product will be a cyclohexanol with the following features:\n*   **Original C1:** Retains its (R) configuration and now has both a methyl group and a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Original C6:** Is now bonded to a new methyl group and its configuration has inverted from (S) to (R).\n*   **Original C3:** Retains its (R) configuration and methyl group.\n*   **Original C4:** Retains its (R) configuration and methyl group.\n\n### 5. Name the Final Product\nTo name the product according to IUPAC rules, we must re-number the cyclohexane ring:\n1.  The hydroxyl group (-OH) gets the highest priority, so the carbon it is attached to (original C1) becomes the new **C1**.\n2.  We number the ring to give the substituent methyl groups the lowest possible locants.\n    *   Numbering clockwise from new C1 (towards original C2) would place methyl groups at 1, 3, 4, and 6.\n    *   Numbering counter-clockwise from new C1 (towards original C6) places the methyl groups at 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n3.  The set {1, 2, 4, 5} is lower than {1, 3, 4, 6}, so we use the counter-clockwise numbering.\n4.  The base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nNow, let's assign the absolute configurations based on the new numbering:\n*   **New C1** (Original C1): Configuration remains **(R)**.\n*   **New C2** (Original C6): Configuration inverted from (S) to **(R)**.\n*   **New C4** (Original C4): Configuration remains **(R)**.\n*   **New C5** (Original C3): Configuration remains **(R)**.\n\nCombining the stereodescriptors and the name, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n*   A) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   B) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   C) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   D) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nThe correct product matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
