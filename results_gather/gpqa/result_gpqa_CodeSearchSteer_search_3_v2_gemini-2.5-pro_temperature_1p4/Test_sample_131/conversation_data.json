    "To determine the two compounds in the 1:1 mixture, we must analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each of the potential compounds and see which pair matches the provided spectral data.\n\n**Analysis of Each Compound's Expected 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, all four methyl groups are equivalent, and both aromatic protons are equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic region:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic region:** One singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has a single plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic region:** Two distinct aromatic protons, leading to two singlets (1H each).\n    *   **Aliphatic region:** Three sets of non-equivalent methyl groups: one group of two equivalent methyls (6H) and two other distinct methyls (3H each). This results in three singlets with a 6:3:3 or 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule also has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic region:** The two aromatic protons are equivalent, producing one singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic region:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups, resulting in two singlets (6H each), giving a 1:1 integration ratio.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic region:** The four aromatic protons are equivalent, leading to one singlet (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic region:** The signal for the ethyl groups would be split, resulting in a quartet (4H) and a triplet (6H), not singlets as the problem describes. Therefore, this compound can be eliminated.\n\n**Evaluation of the Mixture Described in the Options:**\n\nThe experimental data for the 1:1 mixture shows:\n*   **Aromatic region:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic region:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's examine the proposed mixture from the options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would show three aromatic singlets (one from 1,2,3,4-TMB and two from 1,2,3,5-TMB), which contradicts the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would also result in three aromatic singlets (one from 1,2,4,5-TMB and two from 1,2,3,5-TMB), which is inconsistent with the observation.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** This option is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce all singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (2H), and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene also contributes one singlet (2H). In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio** (as 2H:2H simplifies to 1:1). This matches the aromatic region data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides one singlet (12H), and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will therefore show **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the aliphatic region data.\n\nBased on this analysis, the mixture contains 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>"
