    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which stars can be observed by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\n### **1. Observation Criteria**\n\nFirst, let's establish the criteria for a star to be observable by both instruments:\n\n*   **Location of Observatories:**\n    *   The Paranal Observatory (hosting ESPRESSO) is in the Southern Hemisphere (Latitude approx. 24° S). It can observe stars with a declination (DEC) that is not too far north. The theoretical visibility limit is for declinations less than +66°.\n    *   The W. M. Keck Observatory (hosting HIRES) is in the Northern Hemisphere (Latitude approx. 20° N). It can observe stars with a declination that is not too far south. The theoretical visibility limit is for declinations greater than -70°.\n    *   Therefore, for a star to be visible from both observatories, its declination must be between **-70° and +66°**.\n\n*   **Brightness Limits:**\n    *   ESPRESSO can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (m_V) brighter than 17 (i.e., **m_V < 17**).\n    *   HIRES can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (m_V) brighter than 16 (i.e., **m_V < 16**).\n    *   To be observed by both, a star must satisfy the stricter limit, meaning its apparent V magnitude must be **m_V < 16**.\n\n### **2. Star Analysis**\n\nWe will now evaluate each star against these combined criteria (-70° < DEC < +66° and m_V < 16). We will use the standard formula to calculate the apparent magnitude (m_V) from the absolute magnitude (M_V), distance (d), and visual extinction (A_V):\n\n**m_V = M_V + 5 * log₁₀(d / 10 pc) + A_V**\n\nWhere the visual extinction is calculated as **A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)**.\n\n---\n\n**Star1**\n*   **DEC = -75°**: This declination is south of the -70° limit for the Keck Observatory.\n*   **Conclusion**: Star1 is not visible from the Keck Observatory and therefore cannot be observed by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star2**\n*   **DEC = 55°**: This is within the visibility range for both observatories.\n*   **Apparent V magnitude (m_V) = 16.5 mag**: This magnitude is fainter than the m_V < 16 limit required for HIRES.\n*   **Conclusion**: Star2 is too faint to be observed by HIRES.\n\n---\n\n**Star3**\n*   **DEC = 48°**: This is within the visibility range for both observatories.\n*   **Apparent V magnitude (m_V) = 15.5 mag**: The problem directly provides the observed apparent magnitude. This value is brighter than the m_V < 16 limit.\n*   **Conclusion**: Star3 is visible from both locations and bright enough for both instruments.\n\n---\n\n**Star4**\n*   **DEC = -48°**: This is within the visibility range for both observatories.\n*   **Brightness Calculation**:\n    *   Absolute Magnitude (M_V) = 15.5 mag\n    *   Distance (d) = 10 pc\n    *   Extinction (A_V) = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n    *   m_V = 15.5 + 5 * log₁₀(10 / 10) + 1.24 = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = **16.74 mag**\n*   This apparent magnitude of 16.74 is fainter than the m_V < 16 limit for HIRES.\n*   **Conclusion**: Star4 is too faint to be observed by HIRES.\n\n---\n\n**Star5**\n*   **DEC = 60°**: This is within the visibility range for both observatories.\n*   **Brightness Calculation**:\n    *   Absolute Magnitude (M_V) = 16.5 mag\n    *   Distance (d) = 5 pc\n    *   Extinction (A_V) = 0 (not specified)\n    *   m_V = 16.5 + 5 * log₁₀(5 / 10) = 16.5 + 5 * (-0.301) = 16.5 - 1.505 = **14.995 mag**\n*   This apparent magnitude of ~15.0 is brighter than the m_V < 16 limit.\n*   **Conclusion**: Star5 is visible from both locations and bright enough for both instruments.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis, only **Star3** and **Star5** meet both the visibility and brightness requirements for the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\n<<<B>>>"
