    "The search results confirm the fundamental relationship between parallax and distance: distance is inversely proportional to parallax (`d = 1/p`). They also confirm that this method is used for measuring distances to nearby stars. The searches didn't directly address the interpretation of \"number of stars varies with parallax as X\", but the language used in astronomical contexts, such as discussing star counts within a certain volume or out to a certain distance, supports the interpretation that the initial relationship refers to a cumulative number of stars. The logical derivation I performed seems sound and doesn't require further external validation. I will proceed with the final answer based on my derivation.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Define the given relationship**: The problem states that the number of stars, let's call it N, varies with parallax (plx) as `1/plx^5`. This is most reasonably interpreted as the cumulative number of stars with a parallax greater than a certain value `plx`. So, we can write the proportionality:\n    N(>plx) ∝ 1/plx⁵\n\n2.  **Relate parallax to distance**: Parallax is inversely proportional to distance (r).\n    plx = 1/r\n    This means that observing stars with a parallax *greater* than a specific value `plx` is the same as observing stars within a certain distance `r`.\n\n3.  **Express the number of stars as a function of distance**: By substituting the parallax-distance relationship into our initial expression, we can find the cumulative number of stars within a distance `r`, denoted as N(<r).\n    N(<r) ∝ 1 / (1/r)⁵\n    N(<r) ∝ r⁵\n\n4.  **Determine the number of stars per unit distance**: The question asks how the number of stars changes *per unit range of distance*. This is asking for the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance, which is the derivative of the cumulative number of stars with respect to `r`, or `dN/dr`.\n\n5.  **Differentiate the expression**: We differentiate the proportionality for N(<r) with respect to `r`.\n    dN/dr ∝ d/dr (r⁵)\n    dN/dr ∝ 5 * r⁴\n    Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r⁴`.\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
