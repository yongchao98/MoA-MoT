    "The quantum mechanical system described is a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for this system are given by the formula:\nE_n = (n + 3/2)ħω.\n\nHere, n is the principal quantum number, which can be any non-negative integer (n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...), and is the sum of the quantum numbers for each of the three spatial dimensions (n = n_x + n_y + n_z).\n\nThe energy levels are determined as follows:\n*   **Ground State (n=0):** This is the lowest energy level.\n*   **First Excited State (n=1):** This is the next energy level up from the ground state.\n*   **Second Excited State (n=2):** This is the energy level above the first excited state.\n*   **Third Excited State (n=3):** This is the energy level we are interested in.\n\nTo find the energy of the third excited state, we set n = 3 in the energy formula:\nE_3 = (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω.\n\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level is known as its degeneracy. For the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy (g_n) of the n-th energy level is given by the formula:\ng_n = (n + 1)(n + 2) / 2.\n\nTo find the degeneracy of the third excited state, we set n = 3 in this formula:\ng_3 = (3 + 1)(3 + 2) / 2 = (4 * 5) / 2 = 10.\n\nThis means there are 10 different combinations of the quantum numbers n_x, n_y, and n_z that sum to 3, resulting in 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the energy E_3 = (9/2)ħω.\n\nTherefore, the value of the energy of the third excited state is (9/2)ħω, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for this energy eigenvalue.\n\n<<<C>>>"
