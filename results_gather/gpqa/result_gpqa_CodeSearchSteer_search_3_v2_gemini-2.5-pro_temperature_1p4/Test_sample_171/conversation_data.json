    "To solve this problem, we must use the Boltzmann equation, which describes the relative populations of atoms in different energy levels for a system in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).\n\nThe Boltzmann equation is given by:\n\nN_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   N_b and N_a are the number of atoms in the excited state 'b' and a lower energy state 'a', respectively.\n*   g_b and g_a are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the two energy levels.\n*   E_b - E_a is the energy difference between the two levels, denoted as ΔE.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe problem states that iron atoms in star 1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star 2. This is interpreted as the ratio of the population of the specific excited energy level to a lower reference level (e.g., the ground state) is twice as large in star 1 as it is in star 2.\n\nLet's set up the ratio for each star. For star 1, with temperature T_1:\n(N_excited / N_lower)_1 = (g_excited / g_lower) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n\nFor star 2, with temperature T_2:\n(N_excited / N_lower)_2 = (g_excited / g_lower) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nAccording to the problem statement:\n(N_excited / N_lower)_1 = 2 * (N_excited / N_lower)_2\n\nSubstituting the Boltzmann expressions:\n(g_excited / g_lower) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * [(g_excited / g_lower) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]]\n\nThe term for the statistical weights (g_excited / g_lower) is the same for both stars as it relates to the same energy levels of the iron atom, so it cancels out:\nexp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\nTo solve for the temperatures, we can rearrange the equation:\nexp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] = 2\n\nUsing the property of exponents (e^x / e^y = e^(x-y)):\nexp[(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2))] = 2\nexp[(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)] = 2\n\nNow, take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\nln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\nThe problem provides the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. The Boltzmann constant, k, is approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K. Therefore, the ratio ΔE / k is approximately 1.\n\nSubstituting this value into the equation:\nln(2) = 1 * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\nFinally, we combine the terms in the parenthesis:\nln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\nThis equation matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
