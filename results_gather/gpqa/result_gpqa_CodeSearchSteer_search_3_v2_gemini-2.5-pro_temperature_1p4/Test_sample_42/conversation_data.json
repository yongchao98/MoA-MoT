    "To determine the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule, we must systematically apply the rules of chemical nomenclature.\n\n### Structure Determination\n\n1.  **Parent Compound**: The presence of a carboxylic acid on a benzene ring makes the parent compound **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom attached to the carboxylic acid is designated as position 1 (C1).\n2.  **Substituent Positions relative to C1**:\n    *   A methoxy group is **para** to the carboxylic acid, placing it at **C4**.\n    *   A hydroxyl group and a dimethylamino group are **ortho** to the carboxylic acid, meaning they are at **C2** and **C6**.\n3.  **Cross-referencing other substituents**:\n    *   The methoxy group (at C4) and the hydroxyl group are **ortho** to the cyano (nitrile) group. For a substituent at C4 and another to be ortho to a cyano group, the cyano group must be at C5, which makes the hydroxyl group's position C6 (since C4 and C6 are ortho to C5).\n    *   With the hydroxyl group at C6, the remaining ortho position (C2) must be occupied by the dimethylamino group.\n    *   The carbaldehyde (formyl) group is **meta** to the cyano group (at C5). The meta positions to C5 are C1 and C3. Since C1 is the carboxylic acid, the formyl group must be at **C3**.\n\nThis step-by-step placement gives a single, unambiguous structure:\n*   **C1**: -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\n*   **C2**: -N(CH3)2 (Dimethylamino)\n*   **C3**: -CHO (Formyl)\n*   **C4**: -OCH3 (Methoxy)\n*   **C5**: -CN (Cyano)\n*   **C6**: -OH (Hydroxyl)\n\n### IUPAC Naming\n\n1.  **Principal Functional Group**: The carboxylic acid group has the highest priority, so the molecule is named as a benzoic acid.\n2.  **Numbering**: The carbon of the carboxylic acid is C1. We must number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants (positions). Numbering counter-clockwise gives the locant set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Numbering clockwise also gives the set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n3.  **Tie-Breaking Rule**: When two different numbering schemes produce the same lowest locant set, the tie is broken by giving the lower number to the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order.\n    *   The substituents are: **c**yano, **d**imethylamino, **f**ormyl, **h**ydroxy, and **m**ethoxy.\n    *   The two possible numbering schemes are:\n        *   Scheme A (clockwise): 6-dimethylamino, 5-formyl, 4-methoxy, 3-cyano, 2-hydroxy.\n        *   Scheme B (counter-clockwise): 2-dimethylamino, 3-formyl, 4-methoxy, 5-cyano, 6-hydroxy.\n    *   We compare the locants at the first point of difference. At position 2, Scheme A has a hydroxyl group while Scheme B has a dimethylamino group. Since \"dimethylamino\" comes before \"hydroxy\" alphabetically, it is given the lower number. Thus, Scheme B is the correct numbering system.\n4.  **Assembling the Name**: The substituents are listed in alphabetical order, each preceded by its locant number.\n    *   5-cyano\n    *   2-(dimethylamino)\n    *   3-formyl\n    *   6-hydroxy\n    *   4-methoxy\n\nCombining these alphabetically gives the final IUPAC name: **5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\nComparing this to the given options, option C is a perfect match.\n\n<<<C>>>"
