    "Here is a breakdown of the three Michael addition reactions:\n\n### Reaction A:\n**Reactants:** dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH)\n*   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate. The sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) is a strong base that removes a proton from the carbon between the two carbonyl groups, forming a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The nucleophilic enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon.\n*   **Reaction:** The enolate of dimethyl malonate adds to the β-carbon of the acrylate. Subsequent protonation yields the final product.\n*   **Product (A):** The resulting structure is `(MeOOC)₂CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CH₂COOMe`. The IUPAC name for this molecule is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n**Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O+)\n*   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, which serves as a neutral equivalent of an enolate. The carbon atom α to the original carbonyl group (C2 of the cyclohexene ring) is nucleophilic. This type of reaction is known as a Stork enamine synthesis.\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n*   **Reaction:** The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the resulting iminium ion intermediate back into a ketone.\n*   **Product (B):** The final product is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the C2 position with a `–CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group. The name for this product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C:\n**Reactants:** C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) → 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n*   **Michael Acceptor:** But-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK).\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The \"(3-oxobutyl)\" group, `-CH₂CH₂COCH₃`, is formed from the addition of a nucleophile to MVK.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Michael addition where the product structure reveals the identity of the initial Michael donor. The `(3-oxobutyl)` group has been added to the 2-position of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione molecule. The most acidic protons on cyclohexane-1,3-dione are on the carbon at the 2-position, located between the two carbonyls.\n*   **Reactant (C):** The base (KOH) deprotonates the C2-position of **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**, which then acts as the nucleophilic Michael donor.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
