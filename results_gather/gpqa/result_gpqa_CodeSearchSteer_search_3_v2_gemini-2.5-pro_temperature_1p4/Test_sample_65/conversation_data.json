    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as a local, relativistic quantum field theory. This framework has several fundamental symmetry requirements that all operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian must adhere to.\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** This is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime in the Standard Model. All operators in the SMEFT are constructed to be Lorentz scalars, meaning they are invariant under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts).\n2.  **Poincaré Symmetry:** This is an extension of Lorentz symmetry that also includes spacetime translations. Like Lorentz symmetry, it is a foundational assumption in the construction of the SMEFT.\n3.  **CP Symmetry:** This symmetry, which is the combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity inversion (P), is known to be violated in the Standard Model. The SMEFT is designed to parameterize all possible new physics effects, including new sources of CP violation beyond the Standard Model. Consequently, SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry; in fact, many operators are explicitly constructed to violate it.\n4.  **CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem, a cornerstone of quantum field theory, states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory is automatically invariant under the combined operation of charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). Since the SMEFT is built on these principles, it must respect CPT symmetry. The violation of CPT would imply a violation of Lorentz invariance.\n\nBased on these principles, the symmetries that all operators in the SMEFT must respect are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<B>>>"
