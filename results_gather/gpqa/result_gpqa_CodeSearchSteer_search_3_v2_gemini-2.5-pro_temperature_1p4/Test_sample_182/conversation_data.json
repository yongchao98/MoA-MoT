    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we first need to understand the starting material and the chemical transformation it undergoes.\n\n### 1. Structure and Formula of the Reactant\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure to determine its molecular formula:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4.\n*   **-carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group is at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl**: A -CHO (aldehyde) group is at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A -CH=CH₂ group is at position 5.\n\nBased on this structure, the molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\nWe can calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) for the reactant to verify the structure. The formula for IHD is:\nIHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\nIHD = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5.\n\nThis IHD of 5 corresponds to:\n*   1 for the ring structure.\n*   1 for the C=C double bond in the ring.\n*   1 for the C=C double bond in the vinyl group.\n*   1 for the C=O double bond in the formyl group.\n*   1 for the C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group.\n\n### 2. The Reaction\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a very strong reducing agent. It is known to reduce several functional groups completely to alkanes:\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Alkenes (C=C) are reduced to alkanes (C-C).\n\n### 3. Structure and Formula of the Product\n\nThe reduction will transform the functional groups and unsaturations of the reactant:\n*   The cyclohexene ring becomes a saturated cyclohexane ring.\n*   The carboxylic acid group at position 1 becomes a methyl group.\n*   The formyl group at position 2 becomes a methyl group.\n*   The vinyl group at position 5 becomes an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe carbon skeleton remains the same, consisting of 10 carbon atoms. All the double bonds are saturated, and all oxygen atoms are removed. The resulting product is a substituted cyclohexane. The exact name would be a dialkyl-substituted ethylcyclohexane (specifically, 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane based on IUPAC nomenclature of the product), but what matters for the IHD is the molecular formula.\n\nSince the product is a fully saturated cycloalkane with 10 carbon atoms, its general formula is CₙH₂ₙ. For n=10, the molecular formula of the product is **C₁₀H₂₀**.\n\n### 4. Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the Product\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as degrees of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. We can calculate the IHD for the product (C₁₀H₂₀) using the formula:\nIHD = (2C + 2 - H) / 2\nIHD = (2 * 10 + 2 - 20) / 2\nIHD = (22 - 20) / 2\nIHD = 2 / 2 = 1.\n\nAlternatively, the IHD can be determined by inspecting the structure of the product. The product is a substituted cyclohexane. It contains one ring and no multiple bonds. Therefore, its IHD is 1.\n\n<<<B>>>"
