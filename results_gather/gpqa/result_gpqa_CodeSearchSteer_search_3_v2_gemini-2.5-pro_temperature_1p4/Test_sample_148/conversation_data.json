    "Here is an analysis of the provided options:\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n    *   **NMR:** Diastereomers are distinct chemical compounds and are expected to have different NMR spectra. Protons in diastereomeric molecules are in chemically non-equivalent environments and will thus have different chemical shifts. A 1:1 mixture would therefore show two sets of peaks with equal integrals, which is consistent with the observation of two peaks for the alpha-proton, each integrating to ~0.5H.\n    *   **LC-MS:** Diastereomers have different physical properties and can typically be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. Since they have the same molecular formula, they will have identical mass spectra. Therefore, two LC peaks of equal intensity with the same mass spectrum is fully consistent with a 1:1 mixture of diastereoisomers. A common reason for diastereomer formation in peptide synthesis is the partial epimerization (racemization at a single chiral center) of an amino acid during the coupling reactions. Another possibility is the presence of slowly interconverting rotational isomers (atropisomers) around a sterically hindered bond, which are also a form of diastereomers.\n\n*   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n    *   A precursor would be a different molecule with a different chemical formula and, therefore, a different mass. The LC-MS data shows two peaks with the *same* mass spectrum, which matches the expected product. This observation rules out contamination with a typical precursor.\n\n*   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n    *   This side reaction would produce a product with a significantly higher molecular weight than the target peptide. The MS data, which shows a mass consistent with the expected molecule for both peaks, contradicts this explanation.\n\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n    *   **NMR:** Enantiomers are mirror images that have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Standard NMR spectroscopy is an achiral technique, and a mixture of enantiomers will produce a single, identical spectrum. It is not possible to distinguish enantiomers or see separate peaks without using a chiral solvent or a chiral derivatizing agent. The observation of two distinct peaks for the alpha-proton rules out a simple mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   **LC-MS:** Like standard NMR, standard LC uses an achiral stationary phase and cannot separate enantiomers; they would elute as a single peak. While a chiral LC column could separate them, the combination of distinguishability by standard NMR and separability by standard LC strongly points away from enantiomers and towards diastereomers.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe observation of two peaks in both the NMR and LC analyses, where both species have the same mass but different chromatographic and spectroscopic properties, is the classic signature of a diastereomeric mixture. This can arise during peptide synthesis from epimerization or, in some cases, from the presence of stable atropisomers.\n\n<<<A>>>"
