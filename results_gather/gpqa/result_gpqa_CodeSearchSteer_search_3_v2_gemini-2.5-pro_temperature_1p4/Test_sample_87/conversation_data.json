    "Here is a breakdown of the immunological processes to determine the correct answer:\n\n*   **The Experiment:** Rotavirus proteins (antigen) were delivered orally, which targets the gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT). An immune response occurred in the Peyer's patches (a part of the GALT), causing specific immune cells to proliferate. Sequencing the genes of these cells revealed high variability in the variable heavy chain region of their immunoglobulins.\n\n*   **Somatic Hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs in activated B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. It introduces point mutations into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes. This process, driven by the enzyme activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), is responsible for \"fine-tuning\" antibodies, leading to the selection of B cells that produce antibodies with a higher affinity for the specific antigen. The key outcome is high variability specifically in the variable region, which matches the experimental observation perfectly.\n\n*   **Complement Activation:** This is part of the innate immune response and involves a cascade of proteins in the blood that helps to eliminate pathogens. It does not involve genetic mutation in B cells and is therefore incorrect.\n\n*   **V(D)J Recombination:** This is the process that initially creates a diverse set of B cell and T cell receptors *before* the cells encounter an antigen. It occurs in the primary lymphoid organs (bone marrow for B cells) during their development. While it generates diversity, it is not the process responsible for the increased variability in an already-proliferating cell population that has been activated by an antigen in a secondary lymphoid organ.\n\n*   **Class Switch Recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers, often at the same time as somatic hypermutation. However, CSR changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain, not the variable region. This switches the antibody's class (e.g., from IgM to IgG or IgA) and alters its function, but does not change its antigen-binding specificity. The observation of high variability was in the *variable* gene, making this option incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:** The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of proliferating B cells in the Peyer's patches after antigen exposure is the hallmark of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
