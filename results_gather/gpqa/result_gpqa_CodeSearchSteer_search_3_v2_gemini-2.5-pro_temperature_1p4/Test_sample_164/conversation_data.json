    "### Evaluating the Statements\n\nThe core of the question is about a dual-catalyst system that produces branched polyethylene using only ethylene. This works by having one catalyst oligomerize ethylene into short α-olefins (like 1-hexene or 1-octene), which then act as comonomers. A second catalyst copolymerizes these α-olefins with the remaining ethylene to create a branched polymer backbone. This is known as tandem catalysis.\n\n**Statement A: Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.**\n\nThe \"essential additional reaction step\" is the selective oligomerization of ethylene to form α-olefins (e.g., 1-hexene).\n*   Numerous studies show that chromium-based catalysts for ethylene trimerization and tetramerization are effectively activated by aluminum-based compounds.\n*   Activators (or co-catalysts) such as Methylaluminoxane (MAO), Modified Methylaluminoxane (MMAO), and various alkylaluminum compounds (e.g., triethylaluminum) are frequently used to activate these chromium catalysts.\n*   Specifically, Cr(III) complexes activated with MAO show very high activity and selectivity for converting ethylene to 1-hexene.\n*   Similarly, iron-based catalysts for ethylene oligomerization are also activated by MAO and other aluminum alkyls.\n\nTherefore, the statement that aluminum-based activators do not work is incorrect.\n\n**Statement B: Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.**\n\n*   The primary catalysts researched and used for selective ethylene oligomerization to linear α-olefins are based on abundant and less expensive metals like chromium, titanium, iron, and nickel.\n*   While noble metals like palladium are used in some types of ethylene oligomerization, they typically produce hyperbranched oligomers rather than the specific linear α-olefins needed for regular branches in LLDPE.\n*   A recent breakthrough mentioned for producing linear α-olefins from an alternative route (fatty acids) notes the use of an expensive palladium catalyst, highlighting the general high cost of noble metals in this type of chemistry. The search for non-noble metal alternatives is a significant area of research precisely to avoid the high costs.\n\nThis statement is plausible. While they might not be the primary choice for this specific tandem application due to different reactivity, the high cost is a well-known barrier for using noble metal catalysts in large-scale industrial processes. However, the other statements need to be evaluated for definitive correctness.\n\n**Statement C: One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.**\n\n*   Group VIa (or Group 6) includes Chromium (Cr), Molybdenum (Mo), and Tungsten (W).\n*   Chromium-based catalysts are extensively studied and are highly effective for the selective trimerization of ethylene to 1-hexene and tetramerization to 1-octene.\n*   These catalysts, in combination with specific aluminum-based activators like MAO, are well-established for this \"essential additional reaction step\". The Phillips and Sasol processes utilize chromium-based systems.\n*   Tandem systems have been developed that explicitly link a chromium-based ethylene trimerization catalyst part with a polymerization catalyst part.\n\nThis statement is correct. Chromium, a Group 6 metal, is a cornerstone of the technology to produce linear alpha-olefins from ethylene.\n\n**Statement D: Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.**\n\n*   The selective trimerization of ethylene to 1-hexene is a commercial process, notably practiced by Chevron Phillips Chemical. This 1-hexene is then used as a comonomer to produce LLDPE and HDPE. However, this is typically done by producing the 1-hexene in a separate reactor, not necessarily in a single \"one-pot\" tandem system on an industrial scale.\n*   Tandem catalysis for producing branched polyethylene from a single ethylene feed is a significant area of academic and industrial research. The goal is to create a more efficient \"one-pot\" process.\n*   While dual-catalyst systems are used in the US to produce LLDPE with specific properties, these often involve feeding ethylene and a separate α-olefin comonomer into a reactor containing two different catalysts to control polymer properties. This is different from the described system where the comonomer is generated *in situ* from ethylene.\n*   The literature describes tandem catalysis as a field with developing technologies and \"notable examples,\" but large-scale industrial implementation, specifically in the US, is not clearly documented as a widespread, established process in the initial search results. It remains an area of intense development.\n\nThis statement is the most difficult to confirm with certainty. While the components of the technology exist industrially, their integration into a single, large-scale tandem process in the US is not as clearly documented as the fundamental chemistry described in statement C.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nStatement C is the most accurate and well-supported statement. The use of Group 6 (VIa) metal catalysts, particularly chromium, for the selective oligomerization of ethylene to create α-olefins is a foundational and proven technology in this field. Statement A is definitively incorrect. Statement B is likely true in a general sense but less specific to the core of the described process than C. Statement D is questionable regarding the \"implemented on an industrial scale in the US\" part for a single-pot tandem system, whereas the underlying chemistry of statement C is undeniable.\n\nFinal check confirms that chromium catalysts (Group 6) are central to ethylene trimerization to 1-hexene, a key technology for producing comonomers for LLDPE. These catalysts require activation with cocatalysts, often aluminum-based compounds. This directly supports Statement C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
