    "### Analysis Confirms 21-cm Hydrogen Line from Cold Atomic Medium\n\nAn absorption line with an observed energy of 3.9 micro-electron volts (µeV) from a structure at a distance of 2.1 gigaparsecs (Gpc) is most likely the redshifted 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen, which is predominantly found in the cold atomic interstellar medium in the Milky Way.\n\nThe key to identifying the source of the absorption line is to calculate its energy in the rest-frame of the emitting object. The vast distance of 2.1 Gpc means the light from the source is significantly redshifted due to the expansion of the universe. Using standard cosmological parameters, a distance of 2.1 Gpc corresponds to an approximate redshift (z) of 0.49.\n\nThe rest-frame energy (E_rest) can be found using the formula:\n*E_rest = E_observed * (1 + z)*\n\nUsing the given observed energy of 3.9 µeV and the calculated redshift of 0.49, the rest-frame energy is approximately 5.8 µeV.\n\nThis calculated energy closely matches the well-known energy of the hyperfine \"spin-flip\" transition in neutral hydrogen atoms (HI), which is about 5.87 µeV. This transition produces a spectral line with a wavelength of about 21 centimeters.\n\nIn the interstellar medium (ISM), this 21-cm line is a fundamental tool for radio astronomy. It can be observed either in emission or absorption. Absorption lines, like the one detected, are typically seen when cold clouds of neutral atomic gas lie in front of a brighter, background radio source. This phase of the ISM is known as the cold neutral medium (CNM), which is a major component of the cold atomic interstellar medium. Therefore, the equivalent absorption feature in our own galaxy, the Milky Way, would be associated with this cold atomic gas.\n\n<<<D>>>"
