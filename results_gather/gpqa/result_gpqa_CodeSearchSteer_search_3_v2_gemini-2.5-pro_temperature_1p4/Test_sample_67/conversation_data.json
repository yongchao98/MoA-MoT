    "My analysis confirms that the oscillation frequency is the Larmor frequency. The phenomenon of a magnetic moment precessing around an external magnetic field is known as Larmor precession. The angular frequency of this precession, called the Larmor frequency, is given by the equation ω = γB, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and B is the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\nIn this problem, the particle's spin is initially aligned with a magnetic field in the z-direction, meaning its spin state is an eigenstate of the z-component of the spin operator, Sz. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the y-direction, the spin begins to precess around the new field direction. This precession means that the expectation value of the spin's components in the x and z directions will oscillate.\n\nAs derived through three independent methods in the thought process (Schrödinger picture, Heisenberg picture, and Ehrenfest's theorem), the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `⟨μz(t)⟩`, will oscillate according to the function `cos(γBt)`. The angular frequency of this oscillation is the coefficient of the time variable `t`, which is `γB`. This result is a standard outcome in quantum mechanics problems involving spin in a magnetic field.\n\nThe different methods of calculation all yield the same governing differential equation for the expectation value of the z-component of spin, `⟨Sz⟩`:\n\n`d²⟨Sz⟩/dt² = -(γB)²⟨Sz⟩`\n\nThis is the equation of a simple harmonic oscillator with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment is `γB`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
