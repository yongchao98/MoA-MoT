The apothem is the distance from the center of the polygon to the midpoint of a side. It is also the radius of the inscribed circle.\n    The problem asks for the case where N is infinitely large (N → ∞). As the number of sides of a regular polygon increases to infinity, the polygon approaches a circle. The apothem 'a' becomes the radius of this circle.\n    Therefore, the problem simplifies to finding the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Fraunhofer Diffraction by a Circular Aperture:**\n    When monochromatic light of wavelength λ passes through a circular aperture of radius 'a', it produces a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern in the far field. This pattern is known as the Airy pattern.\n    The intensity distribution of the Airy pattern as a function of the angle θ from the central axis is given by:\n    I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(k * a * sinθ) / (k * a * sinθ)]²\n    where:\n    *   I₀ is the maximum intensity at the center.\n    *   J₁(x) is the Bessel function of the first kind of order 1.\n    *   k is the wave number, k = 2π/λ.\n    *   'a' is the radius of the aperture.\n\n3.  **Locating the Minima:**\n    The intensity minima (dark rings) occur at the angles θ where the numerator of the intensity formula is zero, which means J₁(k * a * sinθ) = 0.\n    Let u = k * a * sinθ. The minima correspond to the zeros of the Bessel function J₁(u). The first few zeros of J₁(u) are:\n    *   u₁ ≈ 3.8317\n    *   u₂ ≈ 7.0156\n    *   u₃ ≈ 10.1735\n    ...\n\n4.  **Calculating the Angular Positions of the Minima:**\n    For the m-th minimum, we have:\n    k * a * sin(θₘ) = uₘ\n    (2π/λ) * a * sin(θₘ) = uₘ\n    The problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation (tanθ ≈ θ, which also implies sinθ ≈ θ for small angles).\n    So, sin(θₘ) ≈ θₘ.\n    (2π/λ) * a * θₘ = uₘ\n    Solving for θₘ, we get:\n    θₘ = uₘ * λ / (2π * a)\n\n5.  **Position of the First Minimum (θ₁):**\n    Using the first zero, u₁ ≈ 3.8317:\n    θ₁ = 3.8317 * λ / (2π * a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)\n    This value corresponds to the angular radius of the first dark ring. Note that this is consistent with option D (0.610 λ/a).\n\n6.  **Position of the Second Minimum (θ₂):**\n    Using the second zero, u₂ ≈ 7.0156:\n    θ₂ = 7.0156 * λ / (2π * a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)\n\n7.  **Calculate the Angular Distance Between the First Two Minima:**\n    The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\n    Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [u₂ * λ / (2π * a)] - [u₁ * λ / (2π * a)]\n    Δθ = (u₂ - u₁) * λ / (2π * a)\n    Δθ = (7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ / (2π * a)\n    Δθ = 3.1839 * λ / (2π * a)\n    Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated value is Δθ ≈ 0.5068 λ/a. Let's examine the given options:\n    A) 0.500 λ / a\n    B) 1.220 λ / a\n    C) 0.506 λ / a\n    D) 0.610 λ / a\n\n    Our calculated value of 0.5068 λ/a is extremely close to option C, 0.506 λ/a. The minor difference (less than 0.2%) is likely due to rounding of the constants (zeros of the Bessel function) used to generate the problem's options. For instance, if we use zeros rounded to two decimal places (u₁≈3.83, u₂≈7.01), the calculation yields Δθ = (7.01 - 3.83)λ / (2πa) = 3.18λ / (2πa) ≈ 0.5061 λ/a, which rounds to 0.506 λ/a. This confirms that C is the intended answer.\n\nThe angular distance between the first two minima is 0.506 λ/a.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe problem asks for the angular distance between the first two intensity minima in a far-field diffraction pattern. The aperture is an N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a', and the number of sides, N, is infinitely large.\n\nFirst, we must determine the shape of the aperture as N approaches infinity. A regular polygon with an infinite number of sides and a constant apothem 'a' becomes a circle. The radius of this circle is equal to the apothem 'a'. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the angular distance between the first two minima of a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe diffraction pattern from a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a central bright disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The angular positions of the dark rings (minima) are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\nThe condition for the minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is given by:\nsin(θ) = m * λ / D\n\nwhere:\n*   θ is the angular position of the minimum.\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   D is the diameter of the aperture.\n*   m is a coefficient derived from the zeros of the Bessel function.\n\nFor a circular aperture of radius 'a', the diameter D = 2a. The angular positions of the first and second minima are well-established.\n\nThe angular position of the first minimum (θ₁) is given by:\nsin(θ₁) ≈ θ₁ = 1.220 * λ / D = 1.220 * λ / (2a) = 0.610 * λ / a\n\nThe angular position of the second minimum (θ₂) is given by:\nsin(θ₂) ≈ θ₂ = 2.233 * λ / D = 2.233 * λ / (2a) ≈ 1.1165 * λ / a\n\nThe problem asks for the angular distance between these first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\n\nΔθ = (1.1165 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\nΔθ = (1.1165 - 0.610) * λ / a\nΔθ = 0.5065 * λ / a\n\nThis value is approximately 0.506 λ / a.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.610 λ / a (This is the position of the first minimum, not the distance between the first two)\nB) 0.500 λ / a\nC) 1.220 λ /a (This is related to the diameter, not the radius, for the first minimum)\nD) 0.506 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAn N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a' approaches a circular aperture of radius 'a' as N tends to infinity. Therefore, this problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nHere is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Identify the physical model:** The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is described by the Airy pattern. The angular positions of the dark fringes (minima) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n2.  **Recall the formula for minima:** The condition for the n-th minimum is given by `k * a * sin(θ_n) = z_n`, where:\n    *   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n    *   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n    *   `θ_n` is the angular position of the n-th minimum.\n    *   `z_n` is the n-th zero of the J₁(x) Bessel function.\n3.  **Apply the small-angle approximation:** The problem states we can use `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. The formula becomes `(2π / λ) * a * θ_n = z_n`.\n4.  **Solve for the angular position:** Rearranging the formula, we get `θ_n = (z_n / (2π)) * (λ / a)`.\n5.  **Find the required values:** We need the first two zeros of the J₁(x) function.\n    *   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`.\n    *   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`.\n6.  **Calculate the angular positions:**\n    *   Position of the first minimum: `θ₁ = (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`.\n    *   Position of the second minimum: `θ₂ = (z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`.\n7.  **Calculate the angular distance:** The required quantity is the difference between these two positions: `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = ((z₂ - z₁) / (2π)) * (λ / a)`.\n8.  **Compare with options:** I will compute the numerical coefficient `(z₂ - z₁) / (2π)` and match it with the given choices.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem is about Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture,\n# which is the limit of an N-sided polygon as N -> infinity.\n# The radius of the circle is the apothem 'a'.\n\n# The angular positions of the minima are given by the zeros of the\n# first-order Bessel function, J1(x).\n# The condition for the n-th minimum is: a * sin(theta_n) = (z_n / (2*pi)) * lambda\n# Using the small angle approximation sin(theta) ~ theta:\n# theta_n = (z_n / (2*pi)) * (lambda / a)\n# where z_n is the n-th zero of J1(x).\n\n# Zeros of the first-order Bessel function J1(x)\nz1 = 3.8317  # First zero\nz2 = 7.0156  # Second zero\n\n# The angular position of the first minimum (theta_1) is proportional to lambda/a.\n# The coefficient is z1 / (2*pi).\ncoeff_theta1 = z1 / (2 * math.pi)\n\n# The angular position of the second minimum (theta_2) is proportional to lambda/a.\n# The coefficient is z2 / (2*pi).\ncoeff_theta2 = z2 / (2 * math.pi)\n\n# The angular distance between the first two minima is theta_2 - theta_1.\n# The coefficient for the angular distance is coeff_theta2 - coeff_theta1.\ndelta_coeff = coeff_theta2 - coeff_theta1\n\n# The options are given as coefficients for lambda / a\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 0.500,\n    \"B\": 0.506,\n    \"C\": 1.220,\n    \"D\": 0.610\n}\n\nprint(f\"The angular position of the first minimum is approximately {coeff_theta1:.3f} * (lambda / a)\")\nprint(f\"The angular position of the second minimum is approximately {coeff_theta2:.3f} * (lambda / a)\")\nprint(f\"The angular distance between the first two minima is (theta_2 - theta_1).\")\nprint(f\"The coefficient for this distance is {coeff_theta2:.3f} - {coeff_theta1:.3f} = {delta_coeff:.3f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing the calculated coefficient with the given options:\")\nprint(f\"A) 0.500\")\nprint(f\"B) 0.506\")\nprint(f\"C) 1.220\")\nprint(f\"D) 0.610\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated coefficient {delta_coeff:.3f} is closest to option B.\")\nprint(\"\\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.\")\n\n<<<B>>>\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: \nErrors:   File \"<stdin>\", line 50\n    <<<B>>>\n    ^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Geometry of the Aperture**\nThe problem describes an aperture in the shape of an N-sided regular polygon. A key piece of information is that all apothems have the same length 'a'. The apothem is the distance from the center of the polygon to the midpoint of a side. The problem asks us to consider the case where the number of sides, N, becomes infinitely large (N → ∞).\n\n*   **Careful Point:** As N increases, a regular polygon with a fixed apothem 'a' increasingly resembles a circle. In the limit as N → ∞, the polygon becomes a perfect circle. The apothem 'a' becomes the radius of this circle.\n*   **Conclusion:** The problem is equivalent to analyzing diffraction through a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Physical Phenomenon**\nThe problem states that monochromatic light falls on the aperture and creates an intensity pattern in the \"far-field region\".\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Diffraction in the far-field region is known as Fraunhofer diffraction.\n*   **Conclusion:** We need to use the principles of Fraunhofer diffraction for a circular aperture.\n\n**Step 3: Recall the Formula for Fraunhofer Diffraction by a Circular Aperture**\nThe intensity distribution of the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. The intensity I as a function of the diffraction angle θ is given by:\nI(θ) = I₀ * [ (2 * J₁(k * a * sin(θ))) / (k * a * sin(θ)) ]²\nwhere:\n*   I₀ is the intensity at the center of the pattern (the central maximum).\n*   J₁(x) is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n*   k is the wave number, k = 2π/λ.\n*   'a' is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   θ is the angular position from the central axis.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Condition for Intensity Minima**\nThe intensity minima (dark rings in the pattern) occur when the numerator of the intensity formula is zero, provided the denominator is not also zero. This means the minima are located at angles θ where J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) = 0.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The Bessel function J₁(x) has its first zero at x = 0, but this corresponds to the central maximum, not a minimum (because lim(x→0) [J₁(x)/x] = 1/2). The minima correspond to the subsequent, non-zero roots of J₁(x).\n\n**Step 5: Apply the Small Angle Approximation**\nThe problem states that we can use the small angle approximation, so sin(θ) ≈ θ. The condition for minima becomes:\nJ₁(k * a * θ) = 0\nSubstituting k = 2π/λ, we get:\nJ₁((2π * a * θ) / λ) = 0\n\nLet z = (2π * a * θ) / λ. The minima occur at angles θ_n that satisfy z = z_n, where z_n are the non-zero roots of the Bessel function J₁(z).\n\n**Step 6: Find the Angular Positions of the First Two Minima**\nWe need the values of the first two non-zero roots of J₁(z). From mathematical tables or computation:\n*   First non-zero root: z₁ ≈ 3.8317\n*   Second non-zero root: z₂ ≈ 7.0156\n\nNow, we can find the angular positions (θ₁ and θ₂) of the first two minima:\nFor the first minimum (n=1):\n(2π * a * θ₁) / λ = z₁ ≈ 3.8317\nθ₁ ≈ (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 0.6098 * λ/a ≈ 0.610 * λ/a\n\nFor the second minimum (n=2):\n(2π * a * θ₂) / λ = z₂ ≈ 7.0156\nθ₂ ≈ (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 1.1166 * λ/a\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the Angular Distance Between the Minima**\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\n\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ (1.1166 * λ/a) - (0.6098 * λ/a)\nΔθ ≈ (1.1166 - 0.6098) * λ/a\nΔθ ≈ 0.5068 * λ/a\n\nAlternatively, using the roots directly:\nΔθ = (z₂ * λ / (2π * a)) - (z₁ * λ / (2π * a))\nΔθ = (z₂ - z₁) * λ / (2π * a)\nΔθ ≈ (7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ / (2π * a)\nΔθ ≈ (3.1839) * λ / (2π * a)\nΔθ ≈ 0.5067 * λ/a\n\n**Step 8: Compare the Result with the Given Options**\nThe calculated value is Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * λ/a. Let's examine the options:\nA) 0.500 λ / a\nB) 0.506 λ / a\nC) 1.220 λ / a\nD) 0.610 λ / a\n\nOur calculated value matches option B almost perfectly.\n\n*   **Final Careful Point Check:** Option D (0.610 λ/a) represents the angular position of the *first* minimum, not the distance between the first two. Option C (1.220 λ/a) is related to the Rayleigh criterion for a diameter D=a, which is incorrect as 'a' is the radius. Option A (0.500 λ/a) would result from an approximation that the spacing between Bessel function roots is π, which is only true for very large roots. Since we are dealing with the first two roots, the more precise calculation is required.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is 0.506 λ/a.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe problem asks for the angular distance between the first two diffraction minima for an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a', in the limit where N becomes infinitely large.\n\n1.  **The Limiting Shape of the Aperture**: As the number of sides N of a regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' approaches infinity, the polygon approaches a circle. The radius of this limiting circle is equal to the apothem 'a'.\n\n2.  **The Diffraction Problem**: The problem is therefore equivalent to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'. This pattern is known as the Airy pattern.\n\n3.  **Intensity and Minima**: The intensity `I` at an angle `θ` from the central axis for a circular aperture is given by:\n    `I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) / (k * a * sin(θ))]²`\n    where `I₀` is the central intensity, `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one, `k = 2π/λ` is the wave number, and `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n\n4.  **Locating the Minima**: The minima of the diffraction pattern occur where the intensity is zero. This happens when the numerator `J₁(k * a * sin(θ))` is zero (excluding the central point where `θ=0`). We are given that the angles are small, so we can use the approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. The condition for the minima becomes:\n    `J₁(k * a * θ) = 0`\n\n5.  **Zeros of the Bessel Function**: Let `x_n` be the n-th positive root (or zero) of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`. The angular position `θ_n` of the n-th minimum is found by setting the argument of `J₁` equal to `x_n`:\n    `k * a * θ_n = x_n`\n    Substituting `k = 2π/λ`, we get:\n    `(2π * a / λ) * θ_n = x_n`\n    Solving for `θ_n`:\n    `θ_n = x_n * (λ / (2π * a))`\n\n6.  **Angular Distance Calculation**: We need to find the angular distance between the first two minima, which corresponds to the first two positive zeros of `J₁(x)`, denoted as `x₁` and `x₂`.\n    *   Angular position of the first minimum: `θ₁ = x₁ * (λ / (2π * a))`\n    *   Angular position of the second minimum: `θ₂ = x₂ * (λ / (2π * a))`\n\n    The angular distance `Δθ` is the difference between `θ₂` and `θ₁`:\n    `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (x₂ - x₁) * (λ / (2π * a))`\n\n7.  **Numerical Values**: The values of the first two positive zeros of `J₁(x)` are approximately:\n    *   `x₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n    *   `x₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\n    We need to calculate the coefficient `C = (x₂ - x₁) / (2π)`.\n    `C = (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2 * π) ≈ 3.1839 / 6.2832 ≈ 0.5067`\n\n    The python code execution confirms this calculation with higher precision.\n    ```python\n    import scipy.special as sp\n    import numpy as np\n\n    # Find the first two positive zeros of the Bessel function J1\n    zeros = sp.jn_zeros(1, 2)\n    x1 = zeros[0]\n    x2 = zeros[1]\n\n    # Calculate the coefficient for the angular distance\n    C = (x2 - x1) / (2 * np.pi)\n\n    print(f\"The coefficient C is: {C:.4f}\")\n    ```\n    The output `0.5067` shows that the coefficient is approximately 0.507.\n\n8.  **Conclusion**: The angular distance is `Δθ ≈ 0.507 * (λ / a)`.

The distance between the first minimum (m=1) and the second minimum (m=2) on the same side of the central maximum. This would be `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n2.  The distance between the two first-order minima, which are located symmetrically on opposite sides of the central maximum (at `+θ₁` and `-θ₁`).

An apothem is the line segment from the center of a regular polygon to the midpoint of a side. When the number of sides, N, becomes infinitely large, a regular polygon approaches a circle. In this limit, the apothem 'a' becomes the radius of the circle.\n\n### Step 2: Diffraction by a Circular Aperture\nWhen monochromatic light with wavelength λ passes through a circular aperture, it creates a diffraction pattern in the far-field. This pattern is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central spot called the Airy disk, surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The dark rings correspond to the intensity minima.\n\n### Step 3: Locating the Intensity Minima\nThe angular positions of these minima are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x). The condition for the minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is given by the formula:\n\nsin(θ) = m * λ / d\n\nwhere:\n*   θ is the angular position of the minimum.\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   d is the diameter of the aperture.\n*   m is a coefficient derived from the zeros of the Bessel function.\n\nMore precisely, the angular positions of the minima are given by:\n\nsin(θ) = zₙ / (k * r)\n\nwhere:\n*   r is the radius of the aperture (in this case, r = a).\n*   k is the wave number, k = 2π / λ.\n*   zₙ are the zeros of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\nSubstituting k, we get:\n\nsin(θₙ) = (zₙ * λ) / (2π * a)\n\nThe problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation, so sin(θ) ≈ θ.\n\nθₙ ≈ (zₙ / (2π)) * (λ / a)\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Angular Positions of the First Two Minima\nTo find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need the first two zeros of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n*   The first zero, z₁, is approximately 3.8317.\n*   The second zero, z₂, is approximately 7.0156.\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular position of the first minimum (θ₁):\nθ₁ ≈ (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)\n\nThis is often approximated using the diameter (d=2a), where the first minimum is at θ₁ ≈ 1.22 * λ / d = 1.22 * λ / (2a) = 0.61 * λ / a.\n\nNext, we calculate the angular position of the second minimum (θ₂):\nθ₂ ≈ (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)\n\nSome sources also provide the position of the second minimum as approximately sin(θ) = 2.23 * λ / D, which gives θ₂ ≈ 2.23 * λ / (2a) = 1.115 * λ / a, a very similar value.\n\n### Step 5: Finding the Angular Distance\nThe angular distance between the first two minima is the difference between their angular positions:\n\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁\nΔθ ≈ (1.1166 * λ / a) - (0.6098 * λ / a)\nΔθ ≈ (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ / a)\nΔθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)\n\nThis result is very close to the value given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture:** The problem describes an N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a'. When the number of sides, N, becomes infinitely large (N → ∞), the polygon approaches a perfect circle. The apothem 'a' (the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side) becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Diffraction by a Circular Aperture (Airy Pattern):** When monochromatic light passes through a circular aperture, it produces a diffraction pattern known as the Airy pattern. The intensity distribution in the far-field (Fraunhofer diffraction) as a function of the angle θ from the central axis is given by:\n    $I(\\theta) = I_0 \\left[ \\frac{2 J_1(k a \\sin\\theta)}{k a \\sin\\theta} \\right]^2$\n    where:\n    *   $I_0$ is the maximum intensity at the center (θ = 0).\n    *   $J_1(x)$ is the first-order Bessel function of the first kind.\n    *   $k = 2\\pi / \\lambda$ is the wave number.\n    *   'a' is the radius of the aperture.\n    *   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n\n3.  **Finding the Minima:** The intensity minima occur when the numerator, $J_1(k a \\sin\\theta)$, is equal to zero (and the denominator is not).

The resulting diffraction pattern is an Airy pattern, characterized by a central bright spot surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings.\n3.  **Find the Minima:** The angular positions of the dark rings (minima) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, `J_1(x)`. For small angles, the condition for the n-th minimum is given by:\n    `theta_n = z_n * lambda / (2 * pi * R)`\n    where `lambda` is the wavelength, `R` is the radius of the aperture, and `z_n` is the n-th zero of the `J_1(x)` function.\n4.  **Use Specific Values:**\n    *   The radius of our aperture is `R = a`.\n    *   The first zero of `J_1(x)` is `z_1 ≈ 3.8317`.

A key piece of information is that all apothems are of the same length 'a'. The apothem is the perpendicular distance from the center of the polygon to one of its sides.\nAs the number of sides N of a regular polygon approaches infinity, the polygon itself approaches a circle. In this limit, the apothem 'a' becomes the radius of the circle.\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n**Step 2: Apply Fraunhofer Diffraction Theory for a Circular Aperture**\nWhen monochromatic light passes through a circular aperture, it produces a diffraction pattern in the far field known as the Airy pattern. The intensity distribution of this pattern is described by:\nI(θ) = I₀ * [ (2 * J₁(k * a * sinθ)) / (k * a * sinθ) ]²\nWhere:\n*   I₀ is the maximum intensity at the center.\n*   J₁(x) is the Bessel function of the first kind, order 1.\n*   k is the wave number, defined as k = 2π/λ.\n*   'a' is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   θ is the angular position from the central axis.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Positions of Intensity Minima**\nThe intensity minima (dark rings) in the Airy pattern occur where the intensity I(θ) is zero. This happens when the numerator of the expression is zero, which means J₁(k * a * sinθ) = 0.\nThe minima correspond to the angles θ for which the argument of the Bessel function is equal to one of its non-zero roots. Let's denote the roots of J₁(x) = 0 as z₁, z₂, z₃, ...\n\n**Step 4: Use the Known Zeros of the Bessel Function J₁(x)**\nThe first two non-zero roots of the Bessel function J₁(x) are well-established values:\n*   First root, z₁ ≈ 3.8317\n*   Second root, z₂ ≈ 7.0156\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Angular Position of the First Minimum (θ₁)**\nThe first minimum occurs when k * a * sin(θ₁) = z₁.\nUsing the given small angle approximation (sinθ ≈ θ), this becomes:\nk * a * θ₁ ≈ z₁\n(2π/λ) * a * θ₁ ≈ 3.8317\nSolving for θ₁:\nθ₁ ≈ (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a)\nθ₁ ≈ 0.6098 * (λ/a)\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Angular Position of the Second Minimum (θ₂)**\nThe second minimum occurs when k * a * sin(θ₂) = z₂.\nUsing the small angle approximation again:\nk * a * θ₂ ≈ z₂\n(2π/λ) * a * θ₂ ≈ 7.0156\nSolving for θ₂:\nθ₂ ≈ (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a)\nθ₂ ≈ 1.1166 * (λ/a)\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the Angular Distance Between the First Two Minima**\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\nΔθ = [1.1166 * (λ/a)] - [0.6098 * (λ/a)]\nΔθ = (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ/a)\nΔθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ/a)\n\n**Step 8: Compare with the Options**\nThe calculated value Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ/a) is closest to option A.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Aperture Shape:** The critical first step is realizing that an N-sided polygon with N→∞ and a constant apothem 'a' becomes a circle of radius 'a'.\n2.  **Diffraction Formula:** You must use the correct formula for a circular aperture (Airy pattern), not a single slit.\n3.  **Bessel Zeros:** The numerical values of the Bessel function zeros are required. An error here would lead to an incorrect result.\n4.  **Question Interpretation:** It is crucial to calculate the *distance between* the minima (θ₂ - θ₁), not the position of the first minimum (θ₁, which corresponds to option C) or the width of the central bright fringe (2θ₁, which corresponds to option D).\n\nFinal calculation gives 0.5068 * (λ/a), which rounds to 0.507 * (λ/a). This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nAn N-sided polygon where the number of sides N approaches infinity, while the apothem 'a' is held constant, becomes a circle of radius 'a'.

Therefore, this problem is equivalent to finding the angular distance between the first two minima in the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe intensity of the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is given by the Airy pattern:\n\nI(θ) = I₀ * [ (2 * J₁(k * a * sinθ)) / (k * a * sinθ) ]²\n\nwhere:\n*   `I₀` is the intensity at the center of the pattern.\n*   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n*   `k` is the wave number, given by `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n*   `θ` is the diffraction angle.\n\nThe intensity minima occur when the numerator `J₁(k * a * sinθ)` is equal to zero, excluding the case where the argument `k * a * sinθ` is zero (which corresponds to the central maximum).\n\nUsing the small-angle approximation `sinθ ≈ θ`, the condition for the m-th minimum is:\n\nJ₁(k * a * θₘ) = 0\n\nThis means that the argument `k * a * θₘ` must be equal to one of the zeros of the J₁ Bessel function. Let's denote the m-th non-zero root of J₁(x) as zₘ.\n\nSo, `k * a * θₘ = zₘ`.\n\nSubstituting `k = 2π / λ`, we can solve for the angular position of the m-th minimum `θₘ`:\n\n(2π / λ) * a * θ_m = z_m\nθₘ = (zₘ * λ) / (2π * a)\n\nWe need to find the angular distance between the first two minima, `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n\n*   The first minimum (`m=1`) corresponds to the first zero of `J₁`, which is `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`.\n*   The second minimum (`m=2`) corresponds to the second zero of `J₁`, which is `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`.\n\nThe angular positions are:\nθ₁ = (z₁ * λ) / (2π * a)\nθ₂ = (z₂ * λ) / (2π * a)\n\nThe angular distance between them is:\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁\nΔθ = [ (z₂ * λ) / (2π * a) ] - [ (z₁ * λ) / (2π * a) ]\nΔθ = (z₂ - z₁) * λ / (2π * a)\n\nNow, we substitute the values of the zeros:\nΔθ = (7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ / (2π * a)\nΔθ = (3.1839) * λ / (6.2832 * a)\nΔθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.506 λ / a\nB) 0.500 λ / a\nC) 1.220 λ /a\nD) 0.610 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value of 0.5067 * (λ / a) is closest to option A. The Python code executed in the thinking process confirms this, calculating the coefficient as 0.507, which is also closest to 0.506.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nThe problem asks for the angular distance between the first two intensity minima in a far-field diffraction pattern. The aperture is an N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a', and the number of sides, N, is infinitely large.\n\nFirst, we must determine the shape of the aperture as N approaches infinity. A regular N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a' (the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side) will approach a circle. As N becomes infinitely large, the distance from the center to any point on the polygon's perimeter becomes equal to the apothem 'a'. Therefore, the aperture is effectively a circle of radius 'a'.\n\nNext, we need to analyze the Fraunhofer (far-field) diffraction pattern for a circular aperture. This pattern is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The intensity of this pattern is described using Bessel functions.\n\nThe angular positions of the minima (the dark rings) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function, J₁(x). The condition for a minimum is given by:\n\nsin(θ) = c * (λ / D)\n\nwhere θ is the angular position of the minimum, λ is the wavelength of the light, D is the diameter of the circular aperture, and 'c' is a constant determined by the zeros of the Bessel function. In our case, the radius of the aperture is 'a', so the diameter D = 2a.\n\nThe equation for the minima becomes:\n\nsin(θ) = (x / π) * (λ / D) = (x / π) * (λ / 2a)\n\nwhere 'x' represents the zeros of the J₁(x) Bessel function. The first few zeros are approximately x₁ = 3.8317 and x₂ = 7.0156.\n\nThe problem states that we can use the small angle approximation, so sin(θ) ≈ θ.\n\nThe angular position of the first minimum (θ₁) is found using the first zero of J₁(x):\nθ₁ = (3.8317 / π) * (λ / 2a) ≈ 1.22 * (λ / 2a) = 0.610 * (λ / a).\n\nThe angular position of the second minimum (θ₂) is found using the second zero of J₁(x):\nθ₂ = (7.0156 / π) * (λ / 2a) ≈ 2.23 * (λ / 2a) = 1.115 * (λ / a).\n\nThe question asks for the angular distance *between* the first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\n\nΔθ = (1.115 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\nΔθ = (1.115 - 0.610) * λ / a\nΔθ = 0.505 * λ / a\n\nThis value is very close to 0.506 λ / a. A more precise calculation using more significant figures for the Bessel function zeros (x₁ ≈ 3.83171, x₂ ≈ 7.01559) gives:\n\nθ₁ ≈ (3.83171 / (2π)) * λ / a ≈ 0.6098 * λ / a\nθ₂ ≈ (7.01559 / (2π)) * λ / a ≈ 1.1166 * λ / a\nΔθ = (1.1166 - 0.6098) * λ / a = 0.5068 * λ / a\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nWhen the number of sides N of a regular polygon becomes infinitely large, the polygon approaches a circle. In this case, the apothem 'a' becomes the radius of the circle. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe intensity of the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture is described by a function involving Bessel functions. The angular positions of the intensity minima (the dark rings) are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\nThe condition for the m-th minimum is given by:\n`sin(θ_m) = (z_m / (2πa)) * λ`\n\nWhere:\n*   `θ_m` is the angular position of the m-th minimum.\n*   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n*   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `z_m` is the m-th zero of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\nUsing the small-angle approximation (sin(θ) ≈ θ), the formula becomes:\n`θ_m = (z_m / (2π)) * (λ/a)`\n\nTo find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need to calculate `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n\n1.  **Angular position of the first minimum (θ₁):**\n    This corresponds to the first zero of J₁(x), which is `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`.\n    `θ₁ = (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ/a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ/a)`\n\n2.  **Angular position of the second minimum (θ₂):**\n    This corresponds to the second zero of J₁(x), which is `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`.\n    `θ₂ = (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ/a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ/a)`\n\n3.  **Angular distance between the first two minima (Δθ):**\n    `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (1.1166 * λ/a) - (0.6098 * λ/a)`\n    `Δθ = 0.5068 * (λ/a)`\n\nThis value is approximately `0.506 λ/a`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture:** The problem describes an N-sided polygon where all apothems are of the same length 'a'. As the number of sides, N, becomes infinitely large, a regular polygon approaches a circle. The apothem 'a' becomes the radius of this circle.\n\n2.  **Identify the Physics Phenomenon:** When light passes through an aperture, it diffracts. For observations in the \"far field region,\" we use Fraunhofer diffraction theory. The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is a series of concentric bright and dark rings, known as an Airy pattern.\n\n3.  **Locate the Intensity Minima:** The intensity distribution for Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture of radius 'a' involves a first-order Bessel function, J₁(x). The minima (dark rings) of the diffraction pattern occur at the zeros of this Bessel function. The condition for the minima is given by:\n    `k * a * sin(θ) = x_n`\n    where:\n    *   `k` is the wave number (2π / λ).\n    *   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n    *   `θ` is the angular position of the minimum.\n    *   `x_n` are the roots (zeros) of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\n4.  **Apply the Small Angle Approximation:** The problem states that we can use the small angle approximation, so `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. The formula becomes:\n    `(2π / λ) * a * θ_n = x_n`\n    Rearranging for the angular position of the nth minimum, `θ_n`:\n    `θ_n = (x_n * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\n5.  **Find the Zeros of the Bessel Function:** The minima of the diffraction pattern correspond to the zeros of the J₁ Bessel function. We need the first two non-zero roots:\n    *   First zero (x₁): ≈ 3.8317\n    *   Second zero (x₂): ≈ 7.0156\n\n6.  **Calculate the Angular Positions of the First Two Minima:**\n    *   The angular position of the first minimum (θ₁) is:\n        `θ₁ = (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 0.6098 * λ / a`\n    *   The angular position of the second minimum (θ₂) is:\n        `θ₂ = (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 1.1168 * λ / a`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Angular Distance Between the Minima:** The question asks for the \"angular distance between the first two minima.\" This is the difference between the angular positions of the second and the first minimum.\n    *   `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`\n    *   `Δθ ≈ (1.1168 * λ / a) - (0.6098 * λ / a)`\n    *   `Δθ ≈ 0.507 * λ / a`\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 0.610 λ / a (This is the position of the first minimum, `θ₁`)\n    *   B) 1.220 λ / a (This is twice the position of the first minimum, `2θ₁`, which would be the angular diameter of the central bright spot, also known as the Airy disk)\n    *   C) 0.506 λ / a (This matches our calculated angular separation, `Δθ`)\n    *   D) 0.500 λ / a\n\nThe calculation based on the positions of the first two minima yields a result that matches option C. Textbooks and academic sources confirm the locations of the minima for a circular aperture. For instance, the positions are given by sin(θ) = 1.22λ/D, 2.23λ/D, and so on, where D is the diameter (D=2a). This is equivalent to `θ = 0.61λ/a` and `θ = 1.115λ/a`. The difference between these two is `0.505λ/a`, which confirms the result.\n\nTherefore, the angular distance between the first and second minima is approximately 0.506 λ / a.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nAn N-sided regular polygon with an infinitely large number of sides (N → ∞) approaches the shape of a circle. The problem states that all apothems have the same length 'a'. For a regular polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. As N → ∞, the apothem becomes the radius of the circle.\n\nThus, the problem is equivalent to analyzing the Fraunhofer diffraction of light through a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nWhen monochromatic light of wavelength λ passes through a circular aperture, it produces a characteristic diffraction pattern called an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a central bright spot (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n\nThe angular position `θ` of the dark rings (intensity minima) is given by the formula:\n`sin(θ) = z * λ / (2π * a)`\nwhere:\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n*   `z` represents the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, of order one, `J₁(z)`. The minima occur at the non-zero roots of this function.\n\nThe problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation, so `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. The formula for the angular positions of the minima becomes:\n`θₘ = zₘ * λ / (2π * a)`\nwhere `θₘ` is the angular position of the m-th minimum and `zₘ` is the m-th positive zero of `J₁(z)`.\n\nThe first two positive zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(z)` are approximately:\n*   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we can find the angular positions of the first two minima:\n*   Angular position of the first minimum (`θ₁`):\n    `θ₁ = z₁ * λ / (2π * a) ≈ 3.8317 * λ / (2π * a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n\n*   Angular position of the second minimum (`θ₂`):\n    `θ₂ = z₂ * λ / (2π * a) ≈ 7.0156 * λ / (2π * a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\nThe question asks for the angular distance *between* the first two minima. This is the difference between `θ₂` and `θ₁`:\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`\n`Δθ = [z₂ * λ / (2π * a)] - [z₁ * λ / (2π * a)]`\n`Δθ = (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n\nSubstituting the values of the zeros:\n`Δθ ≈ (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 3.1839 / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.50679 * (λ / a)`\n\nThe calculated coefficient is approximately `0.5068`. Now let's compare this with the given options:\nA) 0.500 λ / a\nB) 1.220 λ / a  (This corresponds to the angular *diameter* of the central Airy disk, `2θ₁`).\nC) 0.506 λ / a\nD) 0.610 λ / a  (This corresponds to the angular *radius* of the central Airy disk, `θ₁`).\n\nThe value we calculated, `0.50679 λ / a`, is closest to `0.506 λ / a`.

When the number of sides, N, becomes infinitely large (N → ∞), the polygon approaches a circle. The apothem 'a' of the polygon becomes the radius 'a' of this circle. Therefore, the problem simplifies to calculating the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Recall the Theory:** The diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. The intensity `I` of the light at an angle `θ` relative to the central axis is given by the formula:\n    `I(θ) = I₀ * [ 2 * J₁(k * a * sinθ) / (k * a * sinθ) ]²`\n    where:\n    *   `I₀` is the intensity at the center of the pattern (θ=0).\n    *   `J₁(x)` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n    *   `k` is the wave number, given by `k = 2π / λ`.\n    *   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n    *   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n\n3.  **Locate the Minima:** The intensity minima (the dark rings in the pattern) occur at angles `θ` where the numerator of the intensity formula is zero, which means `J₁(k * a * sinθ) = 0`. Let `z_n` be the n-th positive zero of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`. The condition for the n-th minimum is:\n    `k * a * sin(θ_n) = z_n`\n\n4.  **Apply the Small Angle Approximation:** The problem states that the angles are small, so we can use the approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. The condition for the minima becomes:\n    `k * a * θ_n = z_n`\n\n5.  **Solve for the Angular Position of the Minima:** We substitute `k = 2π / λ` into the equation:\n    `(2π / λ) * a * θ_n = z_n`\n    Solving for the angular position `θ_n` of the n-th minimum, we get:\n    `θ_n = (z_n * λ) / (2π * a) = (z_n / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Angular Distance:** The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n    *   `θ₁ = (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n    *   `θ₂ = (z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n    `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [ (z₂ / (2π)) - (z₁ / (2π)) ] * (λ / a)`\n    `Δθ = (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n\n7.  **Find the Zeros of the Bessel Function and Compute the Coefficient:** We need the values of the first two positive zeros (`z₁` and `z₂`) of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`.

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The angular positions of the dark rings (intensity minima) are what we need to determine.\n\nFor a circular aperture, the angle θ for the minima in the far-field diffraction pattern is given by the formula:\nsin(θ) = m * λ / D\n\nwhere:\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   D is the diameter of the aperture. In this problem, the apothem 'a' becomes the radius of the circle, so the diameter D = 2a.\n*   m is a coefficient determined by the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\nThe formula is more precisely written as:\nsin(θ) = (xₙ / π) * λ / D = (xₙ) * λ / (2π * a)\n\nThe intensity minima occur when the argument of the Bessel function, `(π * D / λ) * sin(θ)`, corresponds to the non-zero roots of the function. For the first two minima, we need the first two non-zero roots of the J₁ Bessel function.\n\nLet's find the angular positions for the first two minima:\n*   **First minimum (θ₁):** The location of the first minimum is given by the well-known formula for the Airy disk radius, where `sin(θ₁) ≈ 1.22 * λ / D`. Since D = 2a, we have `sin(θ₁) ≈ 1.22 * λ / (2a) = 0.61 * λ / a`.\n*   **Second minimum (θ₂):** The second minimum corresponds to the next zero of the Bessel function. Its position is given as `sin(θ₂) ≈ 2.23 * λ / D`. Substituting D = 2a, we get `sin(θ₂) ≈ 2.23 * λ / (2a) = 1.115 * λ / a`.\n\nThe problem asks for the angular distance between these first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁. Using the small angle approximation (sinθ ≈ θ), we have:\n*   θ₁ ≈ 0.61 * λ / a\n*   θ₂ ≈ 1.115 * λ / a\n\nNow, we calculate the difference:\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (1.115 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\nΔθ = 0.505 * λ / a\n\nThis value is very close to 0.506 λ / a. A more precise calculation using the zeros of the J₁ Bessel function (x₁ ≈ 3.8317 and x₂ ≈ 7.0156) would yield:\n*   θ₁ = (x₁ / 2π) * λ / a = (3.8317 / 6.2832) * λ / a ≈ 0.6098 * λ / a\n*   θ₂ = (x₂ / 2π) * λ / a = (7.0156 / 6.2832) * λ / a ≈ 1.1166 * λ / a\n\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (1.1166 - 0.6098) * λ / a = 0.5068 * λ / a\n\nThis result rounds to 0.507 λ / a. Comparing this with the given options, the closest one is 0.506 λ / a.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe angular distance between the first two minima is calculated to be approximately 0.507 λ / a.

The apothem 'a' becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Recall Diffraction from a Circular Aperture:** The far-field (Fraunhofer) diffraction pattern from a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. The intensity of this pattern is not zero at the center and has concentric rings of maxima and minima.\n\n3.  **Condition for Minima:** The angular positions (θ) of the intensity minima are given by the formula:\n    `a * sin(θ) = C * λ`\n    where 'a' is the radius of the aperture, λ is the wavelength, and C is a constant determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function, J₁(x).

For small angles, this also means `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. The condition for minima simplifies to:\n    `(2π/λ) * a * θ_j = z_j`\n    Rearranging for the angular position of the j-th minimum (θ_j), we get:\n    `θ_j = (z_j * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Angular Distance:** We need the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n    `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [(z₂ * λ) / (2π * a)] - [(z₁ * λ) / (2π * a)]`\n    `Δθ = (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n    Here, z₁ and z₂ are the first and second zeros of the J₁(x) Bessel function.\n\n6.  **Find Bessel Function Zeros and Compute:** We will use Python's `scipy` library to find the precise values for z₁ and z₂ and then compute the final coefficient `(z₂ - z₁) / (2π)`.

It consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n    *   The dark rings correspond to the intensity minima. Their angular positions are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function, J₁(x).\n    *   The condition for the minima is given by:\n        `sin(θ) = c * (λ / D)`\n        where:\n        *   `θ` is the angular position of the minimum.\n        *   `λ` is the wavelength of light.\n        *   `D` is the diameter of the aperture.\n        *   `c` is a numerical constant that depends on the order of the minimum.\n\n4.  **Determine the Positions of the Minima:**\n    *   The diameter of our circular aperture is `D = 2 * r = 2 * a`.\n    *   **First Minimum:** For the first dark ring, the well-established constant is `c₁ ≈ 1.220`. This value comes from the first non-zero root of the Bessel function J₁(x). The angular position `θ₁` is:\n        `sin(θ₁) = 1.220 * (λ / D) = 1.220 * (λ / 2a) = 0.610 * (λ / a)`\n    *   **Second Minimum:** For the second dark ring, the constant is `c₂ ≈ 2.233`. This comes from the second non-zero root of the Bessel function. The angular position `θ₂` is:\n        `sin(θ₂) = 2.233 * (λ / D) = 2.233 * (λ / 2a) ≈ 1.117 * (λ / a)`\n    *   Using the small angle approximation (`sin θ ≈ θ`), we have:\n        *   `θ₁ ≈ 0.610 * (λ / a)`\n        *   `θ₂ ≈ 1.117 * (λ / a)`\n\n5.  **Interpret the Question:**\n    *   The question asks for \"the angular distance between the first two minima\". This phrasing can be ambiguous. Let's analyze the possible interpretations in the context of diffraction patterns.\n    *   **Interpretation A:** The angular position of the first minimum relative to the central maximum (at θ=0). This would be `θ₁ ≈ 0.610 λ / a`. This matches option A.\n    *   **Interpretation B:** The angular separation between the first and second minima on the same side of the central maximum. This would be `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ (1.117 - 0.610) λ / a = 0.507 λ / a`. This is very close to option C (0.506 λ / a).\n    *   **Interpretation C:** The angular separation between the first minimum on one side of the center (at `+θ₁`) and the first minimum on the other side of the center (at `-θ₁`). The Airy pattern is symmetric. These are the two minima closest to the center, and thus can be described as \"the first two minima\". The distance between them defines the angular width of the central Airy disk. This distance would be `Δθ = θ₁ - (-θ₁) = 2θ₁`.\n        `2θ₁ ≈ 2 * (0.610 * λ / a) = 1.220 * λ / a`. This matches option D exactly.\n\n6.  **Select the Most Likely Interpretation:**\n    *   The angular width of the central maximum (`2θ₁`) is a very common and fundamentally important characteristic of a diffraction pattern, as it relates directly to the resolving power of the aperture (Rayleigh criterion).\n    *   Phrasing \"the angular distance between the first two minima\" is a very plausible, if slightly indirect, way of asking for the width of the central bright fringe. The \"first two minima\" are the ones that bound this central fringe.\n    *   Given that this interpretation leads to an exact match with option D (`1.220 λ/a`), it is the most probable intended meaning of the question.

As N → ∞, the apothem becomes equal to the radius of the resulting circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to analyzing the diffraction of light through a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the Physical Phenomenon**\n    The light passes through the aperture and forms a pattern of maxima and minima in the far field. This is a classic example of Fraunhofer diffraction. The specific pattern formed by a circular aperture is called an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a central bright disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The minima are the dark rings.\n\n*   **Step 3: Formulate the Condition for Minima**\n    The angular positions of the intensity minima in a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern from a circular aperture are given by the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind of order one, `J₁(x)`. The condition for the m-th minimum (m = 1, 2, 3, ...) is:\n    `k * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`\n    where:\n    *   `θ_m` is the angular position of the m-th minimum.\n    *   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n    *   `k = 2π / λ` is the wave number of the monochromatic light.\n    *   `z_m` is the m-th non-trivial zero of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`.\n\n*   **Step 4: Apply the Small-Angle Approximation**\n    The problem states that we can assume the angles are small. Therefore, we use the approximation `sin(θ_m) ≈ θ_m`. The condition for the minima simplifies to:\n    `k * a * θ_m = z_m`\n\n    Solving for the angular position `θ_m`:\n    `θ_m = z_m / (k * a)`\n    Substituting `k = 2π / λ`, we get:\n    `θ_m = z_m * λ / (2π * a)`\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the Angular Distance**\n    We need to find the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`. This requires the first two non-trivial zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`:\n    *   First zero: `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n    *   Second zero: `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\n    The angular distance is therefore:\n    `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (z₂ * λ / (2π * a)) - (z₁ * λ / (2π * a))`\n    `Δθ = (z₂ - z₁) * λ / (2π * a)`\n    `Δθ = (7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ / (2π * a)`\n    `Δθ = 3.1839 * λ / (2π * a)`\n\n*   **Step 6: Compute the Numerical Coefficient**\n    To find the final numerical value, we calculate the coefficient `3.1839 / (2π)`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The first two non-trivial zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, J1(x)\nz1 = 3.8317\nz2 = 7.0156\n\n# The angular distance is Δθ = (z2 - z1) * λ / (2π * a)\n# We compute the coefficient C = (z2 - z1) / (2π)\ncoefficient = (z2 - z1) / (2 * math.pi)\nprint(coefficient)\n```\n<execute_ipython>\nimport math\n\n# The first two non-trivial zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, J1(x)\nz1 = 3.8317\nz2 = 7.0156\n\n# The angular distance is Δθ = (z2 - z1) * λ / (2π * a)\n# We compute the coefficient C = (z2 - z1) / (2π)\ncoefficient = (z2 - z1) / (2 * math.pi)\nprint(coefficient)\n</execute_ipython>\n[stdout]\n0.5067200257969351\n[/stdout]\nThe calculated coefficient is approximately 0.5067.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and the provided answers.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Geometry of the Aperture\nThe first step is to understand the shape of the aperture. The problem describes an N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a'. When the number of sides, N, approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. The apothem 'a' (the perpendicular distance from the center to a side) becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'. All candidate agents correctly identify this crucial first step.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Physical Phenomenon\nThe problem describes monochromatic light creating an intensity pattern in the \"far-field region\". This is Fraunhofer diffraction. The specific diffraction pattern from a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The dark rings represent the intensity minima.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Angular Positions of the Minima\nThe angular positions of the intensity minima are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, `J₁(x)`. The condition for the m-th minimum at an angle `θ_m` is:\n\n`k * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`\n\nwhere:\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π/λ`.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `z_m` is the m-th non-zero root of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`.\n\nThe problem allows for the small-angle approximation, `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. The formula simplifies to:\n\n`(2π/λ) * a * θ_m = z_m`\n\nSolving for the angular position `θ_m`:\n\n`θ_m = (z_m / (2π)) * (λ/a)`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Angular Distance\nThe question asks for the **angular distance between the first two minima**, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`. This requires the first two non-zero zeros of `J₁(x)`:\n\n*   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nNow, we can write the expressions for `θ₁` and `θ₂`:\n\n*   `θ₁ = (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ/a) ≈ (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ/a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ/a)`\n*   `θ₂ = (z₂ / (2π)) * (λ/a) ≈ (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ/a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ/a)`\n\nThe angular distance is the difference:\n\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (θ₂ - θ₁) * (λ/a) / (2π) = (7.0156 - 3.8317) * (λ/a) / (2π)`\n`Δθ ≈ (3.1839 / 6.2832) * (λ/a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ/a)`\n\n### Step 5: Compare with Options and Identify Pitfalls\nThe calculated value is `Δθ ≈ 0.507 λ/a`. We compare this to the provided options:\n\n*   **A) 1.220 λ/a:** This corresponds to `2 * θ₁ ≈ 2 * 0.610 λ/a`. This is the angular *diameter* of the central bright disk. This would be the answer if the question were misinterpreted as the distance between the first minimum on the left and the first minimum on the right of the center.\n*   **B) 0.506 λ/a:** This value is an excellent match for our calculated `0.5068 λ/a`.\n*   **C) 0.500 λ/a:** This would be the approximate answer for a square aperture of side length `2a`, where `Δθ = (2λ/2a) - (1λ/2a) = 0.5λ/a`.\n*   **D) 0.610 λ/a:** This corresponds to the angular *position* of the first minimum, `θ₁`, not the distance between the first and second minima.\n\nThe overwhelming consensus among the agents that perform the calculation correctly is that the result is approximately `0.507 λ/a`, which matches the option `0.506 λ/a`. The slight difference is due to the rounding of the value in the option.\n\n<<<B>>>"

The apothem is the distance from the center of the polygon to the midpoint of a side. It is also the radius of the inscribed circle.\n    The problem asks for the case where N is infinitely large (N → ∞). As the number of sides of a regular polygon increases to infinity, the polygon approaches a circle. The apothem 'a' becomes the radius of this circle.\n    Therefore, the problem simplifies to finding the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Fraunhofer Diffraction by a Circular Aperture:**\n    When monochromatic light of wavelength λ passes through a circular aperture of radius 'a', it produces a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern in the far field. This pattern is known as the Airy pattern.\n    The intensity distribution of the Airy pattern as a function of the angle θ from the central axis is given by:\n    I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(k * a * sinθ) / (k * a * sinθ)]²\n    where:\n    *   I₀ is the maximum intensity at the center.\n    *   J₁(x) is the Bessel function of the first kind of order 1.\n    *   k is the wave number, k = 2π/λ.\n    *   'a' is the radius of the aperture.\n\n3.  **Locating the Minima:**\n    The intensity minima (dark rings) occur at the angles θ where the numerator of the intensity formula is zero, which means J₁(k * a * sinθ) = 0.\n    Let u = k * a * sinθ. The minima correspond to the zeros of the Bessel function J₁(u). The first few zeros of J₁(u) are:\n    *   u₁ ≈ 3.8317\n    *   u₂ ≈ 7.0156\n    *   u₃ ≈ 10.1735\n    ...\n\n4.  **Calculating the Angular Positions of the Minima:**\n    For the m-th minimum, we have:\n    k * a * sin(θₘ) = uₘ\n    (2π/λ) * a * sin(θₘ) = uₘ\n    The problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation (tanθ ≈ θ, which also implies sinθ ≈ θ for small angles).\n    So, sin(θₘ) ≈ θₘ.\n    (2π/λ) * a * θₘ = uₘ\n    Solving for θₘ, we get:\n    θₘ = uₘ * λ / (2π * a)\n\n5.  **Position of the First Minimum (θ₁):**\n    Using the first zero, u₁ ≈ 3.8317:\n    θ₁ = 3.8317 * λ / (2π * a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)\n    This value corresponds to the angular radius of the first dark ring. Note that this is consistent with option D (0.610 λ/a).\n\n6.  **Position of the Second Minimum (θ₂):**\n    Using the second zero, u₂ ≈ 7.0156:\n    θ₂ = 7.0156 * λ / (2π * a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)\n\n7.  **Calculate the Angular Distance Between the First Two Minima:**\n    The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\n    Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [u₂ * λ / (2π * a)] - [u₁ * λ / (2π * a)]\n    Δθ = (u₂ - u₁) * λ / (2π * a)\n    Δθ = (7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ / (2π * a)\n    Δθ = 3.1839 * λ / (2π * a)\n    Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated value is Δθ ≈ 0.5068 λ/a. Let's examine the given options:\n    A) 0.500 λ / a\n    B) 1.220 λ / a\n    C) 0.506 λ / a\n    D) 0.610 λ / a\n\n    Our calculated value of 0.5068 λ/a is extremely close to option C, 0.506 λ/a. The minor difference (less than 0.2%) is likely due to rounding of the constants (zeros of the Bessel function) used to generate the problem's options. For instance, if we use zeros rounded to two decimal places (u₁≈3.83, u₂≈7.01), the calculation yields Δθ = (7.01 - 3.83)λ / (2πa) = 3.18λ / (2πa) ≈ 0.5061 λ/a, which rounds to 0.506 λ/a. This confirms that C is the intended answer.\n\nThe angular distance between the first two minima is 0.506 λ/a.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe problem asks for the angular distance between the first two intensity minima in a far-field diffraction pattern.

A regular polygon with an infinite number of sides and a constant apothem 'a' becomes a circle. The radius of this circle is equal to the apothem 'a'.

Therefore, this problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nHere is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Identify the physical model:** The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is described by the Airy pattern. The angular positions of the dark fringes (minima) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n2.  **Recall the formula for minima:** The condition for the n-th minimum is given by `k * a * sin(θ_n) = z_n`, where:\n    *   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n    *   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n    *   `θ_n` is the angular position of the n-th minimum.\n    *   `z_n` is the n-th zero of the J₁(x) Bessel function.\n3.  **Apply the small-angle approximation:** The problem states we can use `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. The formula becomes `(2π / λ) * a * θ_n = z_n`.\n4.  **Solve for the angular position:** Rearranging the formula, we get `θ_n = (z_n / (2π)) * (λ / a)`.\n5.  **Find the required values:** We need the first two zeros of the J₁(x) function.\n    *   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`.\n    *   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`.\n6.  **Calculate the angular positions:**\n    *   Position of the first minimum: `θ₁ = (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`.\n    *   Position of the second minimum: `θ₂ = (z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`.\n7.  **Calculate the angular distance:** The required quantity is the difference between these two positions: `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = ((z₂ - z₁) / (2π)) * (λ / a)`.\n8.  **Compare with options:** I will compute the numerical coefficient `(z₂ - z₁) / (2π)` and match it with the given choices.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem is about Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture,\n# which is the limit of an N-sided polygon as N -> infinity.\n# The radius of the circle is the apothem 'a'.\n\n# The angular positions of the minima are given by the zeros of the\n# first-order Bessel function, J1(x).\n# The condition for the n-th minimum is: a * sin(theta_n) = (z_n / (2*pi)) * lambda\n# Using the small angle approximation sin(theta) ~ theta:\n# theta_n = (z_n / (2*pi)) * (lambda / a)\n# where z_n is the n-th zero of J1(x).\n\n# Zeros of the first-order Bessel function J1(x)\nz1 = 3.8317  # First zero\nz2 = 7.0156  # Second zero\n\n# The angular position of the first minimum (theta_1) is proportional to lambda/a.\n# The coefficient is z1 / (2*pi).\ncoeff_theta1 = z1 / (2 * math.pi)\n\n# The angular position of the second minimum (theta_2) is proportional to lambda/a.\n# The coefficient is z2 / (2*pi).\ncoeff_theta2 = z2 / (2 * math.pi)\n\n# The angular distance between the first two minima is theta_2 - theta_1.\n# The coefficient for the angular distance is coeff_theta2 - coeff_theta1.\ndelta_coeff = coeff_theta2 - coeff_theta1\n\n# The options are given as coefficients for lambda / a\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 0.500,\n    \"B\": 0.506,\n    \"C\": 1.220,\n    \"D\": 0.610\n}\n\nprint(f\"The angular position of the first minimum is approximately {coeff_theta1:.3f} * (lambda / a)\")\nprint(f\"The angular position of the second minimum is approximately {coeff_theta2:.3f} * (lambda / a)\")\nprint(f\"The angular distance between the first two minima is (theta_2 - theta_1).\")\nprint(f\"The coefficient for this distance is {coeff_theta2:.3f} - {coeff_theta1:.3f} = {delta_coeff:.3f}\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing the calculated coefficient with the given options:\")\nprint(f\"A) 0.500\")\nprint(f\"B) 0.506\")\nprint(f\"C) 1.220\")\nprint(f\"D) 0.610\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated coefficient {delta_coeff:.3f} is closest to option B.\")\nprint(\"\\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.\")\n\n<<<B>>>\n```\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: \nErrors:   File \"<stdin>\", line 50\n    <<<B>>>\n    ^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Geometry of the Aperture**\nThe problem describes an aperture in the shape of an N-sided regular polygon. A key piece of information is that all apothems have the same length 'a'. The apothem is the distance from the center of the polygon to the midpoint of a side. The problem asks us to consider the case where the number of sides, N, becomes infinitely large (N → ∞).\n\n*   **Careful Point:** As N increases, a regular polygon with a fixed apothem 'a' increasingly resembles a circle. In the limit as N → ∞, the polygon becomes a perfect circle. The apothem 'a' becomes the radius of this circle.\n*   **Conclusion:** The problem is equivalent to analyzing diffraction through a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Physical Phenomenon**\nThe problem states that monochromatic light falls on the aperture and creates an intensity pattern in the \"far-field region\".\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Diffraction in the far-field region is known as Fraunhofer diffraction.\n*   **Conclusion:** We need to use the principles of Fraunhofer diffraction for a circular aperture.\n\n**Step 3: Recall the Formula for Fraunhofer Diffraction by a Circular Aperture**\nThe intensity distribution of the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. The intensity I as a function of the diffraction angle θ is given by:\nI(θ) = I₀ * [ (2 * J₁(k * a * sin(θ))) / (k * a * sin(θ)) ]²\nwhere:\n*   I₀ is the intensity at the center of the pattern (the central maximum).\n*   J₁(x) is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n*   k is the wave number, k = 2π/λ.\n*   'a' is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   θ is the angular position from the central axis.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Condition for Intensity Minima**\nThe intensity minima (dark rings in the pattern) occur when the numerator of the intensity formula is zero, provided the denominator is not also zero. This means the minima are located at angles θ where J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) = 0.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The Bessel function J₁(x) has its first zero at x = 0, but this corresponds to the central maximum, not a minimum (because lim(x→0) [J₁(x)/x] = 1/2). The minima correspond to the subsequent, non-zero roots of J₁(x).\n\n**Step 5: Apply the Small Angle Approximation**\nThe problem states that we can use the small angle approximation, so sin(θ) ≈ θ. The condition for minima becomes:\nJ₁(k * a * θ) = 0\nSubstituting k = 2π/λ, we get:\nJ₁((2π * a * θ) / λ) = 0\n\nLet z = (2π * a * θ) / λ. The minima occur at angles θ_n that satisfy z = z_n, where z_n are the non-zero roots of the Bessel function J₁(z).\n\n**Step 6: Find the Angular Positions of the First Two Minima**\nWe need the values of the first two non-zero roots of J₁(z). From mathematical tables or computation:\n*   First non-zero root: z₁ ≈ 3.8317\n*   Second non-zero root: z₂ ≈ 7.0156\n\nNow, we can find the angular positions (θ₁ and θ₂) of the first two minima:\nFor the first minimum (n=1):\n(2π * a * θ₁) / λ = z₁ ≈ 3.8317\nθ₁ ≈ (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 0.6098 * λ/a ≈ 0.610 * λ/a\n\nFor the second minimum (n=2):\n(2π * a * θ₂) / λ = z₂ ≈ 7.0156\nθ₂ ≈ (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 1.1166 * λ/a\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the Angular Distance Between the Minima**\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\n\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ (1.1166 * λ/a) - (0.6098 * λ/a)\nΔθ ≈ (1.1166 - 0.6098) * λ/a\nΔθ ≈ 0.5068 * λ/a\n\nAlternatively, using the roots directly:\nΔθ = (z₂ * λ / (2π * a)) - (z₁ * λ / (2π * a))\nΔθ = (z₂ - z₁) * λ / (2π * a)\nΔθ ≈ (7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ / (2π * a)\nΔθ ≈ (3.1839) * λ / (2π * a)\nΔθ ≈ 0.5067 * λ/a\n\n**Step 8: Compare the Result with the Given Options**\nThe calculated value is Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * λ/a. Let's examine the options:\nA) 0.500 λ / a\nB) 0.506 λ / a\nC) 1.220 λ / a\nD) 0.610 λ / a\n\nOur calculated value matches option B almost perfectly.\n\n*   **Final Careful Point Check:** Option D (0.610 λ/a) represents the angular position of the *first* minimum, not the distance between the first two. Option C (1.220 λ/a) is related to the Rayleigh criterion for a diameter D=a, which is incorrect as 'a' is the radius. Option A (0.500 λ/a) would result from an approximation that the spacing between Bessel function roots is π, which is only true for very large roots. Since we are dealing with the first two roots, the more precise calculation is required.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is 0.506 λ/a.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe problem asks for the angular distance between the first two diffraction minima for an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a', in the limit where N becomes infinitely large.\n\n1.  **The Limiting Shape of the Aperture**: As the number of sides N of a regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' approaches infinity, the polygon approaches a circle. The radius of this limiting circle is equal to the apothem 'a'.\n\n2.  **The Diffraction Problem**: The problem is therefore equivalent to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'. This pattern is known as the Airy pattern.\n\n3.  **Intensity and Minima**: The intensity `I` at an angle `θ` from the central axis for a circular aperture is given by:\n    `I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) / (k * a * sin(θ))]²`\n    where `I₀` is the central intensity, `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one, `k = 2π/λ` is the wave number, and `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n\n4.  **Locating the Minima**: The minima of the diffraction pattern occur where the intensity is zero. This happens when the numerator `J₁(k * a * sin(θ))` is zero (excluding the central point where `θ=0`). We are given that the angles are small, so we can use the approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. The condition for the minima becomes:\n    `J₁(k * a * θ) = 0`\n\n5.  **Zeros of the Bessel Function**: Let `x_n` be the n-th positive root (or zero) of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`. The angular position `θ_n` of the n-th minimum is found by setting the argument of `J₁` equal to `x_n`:\n    `k * a * θ_n = x_n`\n    Substituting `k = 2π/λ`, we get:\n    `(2π * a / λ) * θ_n = x_n`\n    Solving for `θ_n`:\n    `θ_n = x_n * (λ / (2π * a))`\n\n6.  **Angular Distance Calculation**: We need to find the angular distance between the first two minima, which corresponds to the first two positive zeros of `J₁(x)`, denoted as `x₁` and `x₂`.\n    *   Angular position of the first minimum: `θ₁ = x₁ * (λ / (2π * a))`\n    *   Angular position of the second minimum: `θ₂ = x₂ * (λ / (2π * a))`\n\n    The angular distance `Δθ` is the difference between `θ₂` and `θ₁`:\n    `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (x₂ - x₁) * (λ / (2π * a))`\n\n7.  **Numerical Values**: The values of the first two positive zeros of `J₁(x)` are approximately:\n    *   `x₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n    *   `x₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\n    We need to calculate the coefficient `C = (x₂ - x₁) / (2π)`.\n    `C = (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2 * π) ≈ 3.1839 / 6.2832 ≈ 0.5067`\n\n    The python code execution confirms this calculation with higher precision.\n    ```python\n    import scipy.special as sp\n    import numpy as np\n\n    # Find the first two positive zeros of the Bessel function J1\n    zeros = sp.jn_zeros(1, 2)\n    x1 = zeros[0]\n    x2 = zeros[1]\n\n    # Calculate the coefficient for the angular distance\n    C = (x2 - x1) / (2 * np.pi)\n\n    print(f\"The coefficient C is: {C:.4f}\")\n    ```\n    The output `0.5067` shows that the coefficient is approximately 0.507.\n\n8.  **Conclusion**: The angular distance is `Δθ ≈ 0.507 * (λ / a)`.

Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius `a`.\n\nThe phenomenon described is Fraunhofer diffraction. For a circular aperture, the resulting diffraction pattern is known as an Airy pattern.

The distance between the first minimum (m=1) and the second minimum (m=2) on the same side of the central maximum. This would be `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n2.  The distance between the two first-order minima, which are located symmetrically on opposite sides of the central maximum (at `+θ₁` and `-θ₁`). This distance is the angular diameter of the central Airy disk and is equal to `Δθ = θ₁ - (-θ₁) = 2θ₁`.\n\nLet's calculate the values for both interpretations:\n\n**Interpretation 1: Distance between the 1st and 2nd dark rings (`θ₂ - θ₁`)**\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (x₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a) - (x₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ = ((x₂ - x₁) / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ ((7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2 * 3.14159)) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ (3.1839 / 6.2832) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n**Interpretation 2: Distance between the two first-order minima (`2θ₁`)**\nThis is the angular width of the central bright maximum (the Airy disk).\n`θ₁ = (x₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (3.8317 / 6.2832) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.610 * (λ / a)`\nThe angular distance between the two first-order minima is:\n`Δθ = 2 * θ₁ ≈ 2 * 0.610 * (λ / a) = 1.220 * (λ / a)`\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\nIn physics, the angular width of the central maximum (`2θ₁`) is a much more fundamental and frequently discussed quantity than the spacing between subsequent rings. It is directly related to the resolving power of optical instruments (the Rayleigh criterion is `θ_res = θ₁`). Given that both interpretations lead to one of the options, it is most probable that the question is asking for this fundamental quantity. The phrasing \"distance between the first two minima\" is a common, albeit slightly ambiguous, way to ask for the width of the central peak, defined by the two symmetric first-order minima.\n\nTherefore, we choose the second interpretation.

This pattern consists of a central bright disk, called the Airy disk, surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The angular positions of the dark rings (minima) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function.\n\nFor a circular aperture of diameter D, the angular positions of the minima are given by the formula:\nsin(θ) ≈ θ = m * λ / D\nwhere:\n*   θ is the angular position of the minimum.\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   D is the diameter of the aperture.\n*   m is a coefficient corresponding to the order of the minimum.\n\nIn this problem, the radius of the aperture is 'a', so its diameter D = 2a. The positions of the first two minima are given by specific values for 'm'.\n\n*   **First Minimum:** This occurs at the edge of the central Airy disk. The accepted value for m₁ is approximately 1.220.\n    The angular position of the first minimum (θ₁) is:\n    θ₁ = 1.220 * λ / (2a) = 0.610 * λ / a\n\n*   **Second Minimum:** This is the next dark ring in the pattern. The value for m₂ is approximately 2.233.\n    The angular position of the second minimum (θ₂) is:\n    θ₂ = 2.233 * λ / (2a) ≈ 1.1165 * λ / a\n\nThe angular distance between these first two minima is the difference between their angular positions:\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁\nΔθ = (1.1165 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\nΔθ = (1.1165 - 0.610) * λ / a\nΔθ = 0.5065 * λ / a\n\nThis value is approximately 0.506 λ / a.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nWhen an N-sided polygon-shaped aperture with a constant apothem 'a' has an infinitely large number of sides (N), it approximates a circular aperture. The radius of this circle is equal to the apothem 'a'.\n\nWhen monochromatic light passes through a circular aperture, it creates a diffraction pattern known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central disk, called the Airy disk, surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The dark rings correspond to the minima of the light intensity.\n\nThe angular positions of these dark rings (minima) in the far-field region can be determined using the following formula, especially for small angles:\n*θ ≈ m * λ / d*\n\nWhere:\n*   **θ** is the angular position of the minimum.\n*   **λ** is the wavelength of the light.\n*   **d** is the diameter of the circular aperture.\n*   **m** is a coefficient corresponding to the order of the minimum.\n\nFor a circular aperture, the diameter 'd' is twice the radius 'r'. In this case, the radius is the apothem 'a', so d = 2a.\n\nThe coefficients 'm' for the first two minima are derived from the zeros of the first-order Bessel function and are approximately:\n*   **m₁ ≈ 1.220** for the first minimum.\n*   **m₂ ≈ 2.233** for the second minimum.\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular positions of the first and second minima:\n\n**Angular position of the first minimum (θ₁):**\nθ₁ ≈ (1.220 * λ) / (2a) = 0.610 * λ / a.\n\n**Angular position of the second minimum (θ₂):**\nθ₂ ≈ (2.233 * λ) / (2a) ≈ 1.1165 * λ / a.\n\nThe angular distance between the first two minima is the difference between their angular positions:\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁\nΔθ ≈ (1.1165 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\nΔθ ≈ 0.5065 * λ / a\n\nThis result is closest to the option 0.506 λ / a.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nAn N-sided polygon with an infinitely large N and a constant apothem 'a' converges to a circle of radius 'a'. Therefore, the problem is to find the angular distance between the first two diffraction minima for a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe diffraction pattern created by a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern. The intensity minima of this pattern occur at angles (θ) that satisfy the equation:\n\nsin(θ) = (xₘ * λ) / (2π * a)\n\nwhere:\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   a is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   xₘ is the m-th zero of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\nUsing the small-angle approximation (sin(θ) ≈ θ), the angular position of the m-th minimum is:\n\nθₘ = (xₘ * λ) / (2π * a)\n\nThe first two zeros of the Bessel function J₁(x) are approximately:\n*   x₁ ≈ 3.8317\n*   x₂ ≈ 7.0156\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular positions of the first and second minima:\n\n**First Minimum (θ₁):**\nθ₁ = (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 0.6098 λ / a\n\nThis value corresponds to the well-known position of the first minimum in an Airy pattern, often expressed as θ = 1.22 λ / D, where D is the diameter (2a). Note that 1.22 ≈ 3.8317 / π.\n\n**Second Minimum (θ₂):**\nθ₂ = (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 1.1166 λ / a\n\nThe angular distance between these two minima is the difference between their positions:\n\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁\nΔθ = (1.1166 λ / a) - (0.6098 λ / a)\nΔθ = 0.5068 λ / a\n\nComparing this result to the given options, it most closely matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Determine the Shape of the Aperture**\n\nThe problem describes an N-sided regular polygon aperture where the number of sides, N, is infinitely large (`N -> ∞`).\n*   The apothem `a` is the distance from the center of the polygon to the midpoint of a side.\n*   The radius `R` is the distance from the center to a vertex.\n*   The relationship between the radius and the apothem in a regular N-sided polygon is given by `a = R * cos(π/N)`.\n*   As `N` approaches infinity (`N -> ∞`), the angle `π/N` approaches 0.\n*   Since `cos(0) = 1`, in the limit as `N -> ∞`, we have `a = R * cos(0)`, which means `a = R`.\n*   An N-sided polygon where `N -> ∞` and the apothem equals the radius is a circle. Therefore, the aperture is a circle of radius `a`.\n\n**2. Identify the Diffraction Pattern**\n\nThe diffraction of a monochromatic light wave by a circular aperture in the far-field region (Fraunhofer diffraction) produces a characteristic pattern known as the Airy pattern. The intensity `I` of this pattern as a function of the angle `θ` from the central axis is given by:\n\n`I(θ) = I₀ * [ (2 * J₁(k * a * sinθ)) / (k * a * sinθ) ]²`\n\nwhere:\n*   `I₀` is the central maximum intensity.\n*   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind, of order one.\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n\n**3. Locate the Intensity Minima**\n\nThe intensity minima (dark rings) occur when the numerator of the intensity formula is zero, which corresponds to the zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`. Let `x = k * a * sinθ`. The minima are found where `J₁(x) = 0`.\n\nThe first few zeros of `J₁(x)` are:\n*   First zero (`x₁`): `x₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero (`x₂`): `x₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\n**4. Calculate the Angular Positions of the Minima**\n\nThe angular position `θ_m` of the m-th minimum is given by the condition:\n`k * a * sin(θ_m) = x_m`\n`(2π / λ) * a * sin(θ_m) = x_m`\n\nThe problem states we can use the small angle approximation, so `sin(θ) ≈ θ`.\n`(2π / λ) * a * θ_m = x_m`\n`θ_m = (x_m * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular positions of the first and second minima:\n*   **First Minimum (`θ₁`):**\n    `θ₁ = (x₁ * λ) / (2π * a) = (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n\n*   **Second Minimum (`θ₂`):**\n    `θ₂ = (x₂ * λ) / (2π * a) = (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\n**5. Find the Angular Distance**\n\nThe angular distance between the first two minima is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n`Δθ = [1.1166 * (λ / a)] - [0.6098 * (λ / a)]`\n`Δθ = (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ = 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\n\n**6.

An N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' (the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side) approaches a circle as N approaches infinity. The radius of this limiting circle is equal to its apothem, so we have a circular aperture of radius `r = a`.\n\n2.  **Recall Diffraction by a Circular Aperture:** The far-field diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings.\n\n3.  **Identify the Minima Positions:** The angular positions `(theta)` of the dark rings (intensity minima) are given by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function, `J1(x)`. The condition for a minimum is:\n    `sin(theta) = m * lambda / D`\n    where:\n    *   `lambda` is the wavelength of the light.\n    *   `D` is the diameter of the circular aperture.

The aperture is an N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a', and the number of sides, N, is infinitely large.\n\nFirst, we must determine the shape of the aperture as N approaches infinity. A regular N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a' (the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side) will approach a circle. As N becomes infinitely large, the distance from the center to any point on the polygon's perimeter becomes equal to the apothem 'a'. Therefore, the aperture is effectively a circle of radius 'a'.\n\nNext, we need to analyze the Fraunhofer (far-field) diffraction pattern for a circular aperture. This pattern is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The intensity of this pattern is described using Bessel functions.\n\nThe angular positions of the minima (the dark rings) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function, J₁(x). The condition for a minimum is given by:\n\nsin(θ) = c * (λ / D)\n\nwhere θ is the angular position of the minimum, λ is the wavelength of the light, D is the diameter of the circular aperture, and 'c' is a constant determined by the zeros of the Bessel function. In our case, the radius of the aperture is 'a', so the diameter D = 2a.\n\nThe equation for the minima becomes:\n\nsin(θ) = (x / π) * (λ / D) = (x / π) * (λ / 2a)\n\nwhere 'x' represents the zeros of the J₁(x) Bessel function. The first few zeros are approximately x₁ = 3.8317 and x₂ = 7.0156.\n\nThe problem states that we can use the small angle approximation, so sin(θ) ≈ θ.\n\nThe angular position of the first minimum (θ₁) is found using the first zero of J₁(x):\nθ₁ = (3.8317 / π) * (λ / 2a) ≈ 1.22 * (λ / 2a) = 0.610 * (λ / a).\n\nThe angular position of the second minimum (θ₂) is found using the second zero of J₁(x):\nθ₂ = (7.0156 / π) * (λ / 2a) ≈ 2.23 * (λ / 2a) = 1.115 * (λ / a).\n\nThe question asks for the angular distance *between* the first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\n\nΔθ = (1.115 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\nΔθ = (1.115 - 0.610) * λ / a\nΔθ = 0.505 * λ / a\n\nThis value is very close to 0.506 λ / a. A more precise calculation using more significant figures for the Bessel function zeros (x₁ ≈ 3.83171, x₂ ≈ 7.01559) gives:\n\nθ₁ ≈ (3.83171 / (2π)) * λ / a ≈ 0.6098 * λ / a\nθ₂ ≈ (7.01559 / (2π)) * λ / a ≈ 1.1166 * λ / a\nΔθ = (1.1166 - 0.6098) * λ / a = 0.5068 * λ / a\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nWhen the number of sides N of a regular polygon becomes infinitely large, the polygon approaches a circle.

As the number of sides, N, becomes infinitely large, a regular polygon approaches a circle. The apothem 'a' becomes the radius of this circle.\n\n2.  **Identify the Physics Phenomenon:** When light passes through an aperture, it diffracts. For observations in the \"far field region,\" we use Fraunhofer diffraction theory. The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is a series of concentric bright and dark rings, known as an Airy pattern.\n\n3.  **Locate the Intensity Minima:** The intensity distribution for Fraunhofer diffraction from a circular aperture of radius 'a' involves a first-order Bessel function, J₁(x). The minima (dark rings) of the diffraction pattern occur at the zeros of this Bessel function.

The formula becomes:\n    `(2π / λ) * a * θ_n = x_n`\n    Rearranging for the angular position of the nth minimum, `θ_n`:\n    `θ_n = (x_n * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\n5.  **Find the Zeros of the Bessel Function:** The minima of the diffraction pattern correspond to the zeros of the J₁ Bessel function. We need the first two non-zero roots:\n    *   First zero (x₁): ≈ 3.8317\n    *   Second zero (x₂): ≈ 7.0156\n\n6.  **Calculate the Angular Positions of the First Two Minima:**\n    *   The angular position of the first minimum (θ₁) is:\n        `θ₁ = (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 0.6098 * λ / a`\n    *   The angular position of the second minimum (θ₂) is:\n        `θ₂ = (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 1.1168 * λ / a`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Angular Distance Between the Minima:** The question asks for the \"angular distance between the first two minima.\" This is the difference between the angular positions of the second and the first minimum.\n    *   `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`\n    *   `Δθ ≈ (1.1168 * λ / a) - (0.6098 * λ / a)`\n    *   `Δθ ≈ 0.507 * λ / a`\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 0.610 λ / a (This is the position of the first minimum, `θ₁`)\n    *   B) 1.220 λ / a (This is twice the position of the first minimum, `2θ₁`, which would be the angular diameter of the central bright spot, also known as the Airy disk)\n    *   C) 0.506 λ / a (This matches our calculated angular separation, `Δθ`)\n    *   D) 0.500 λ / a\n\nThe calculation based on the positions of the first two minima yields a result that matches option C. Textbooks and academic sources confirm the locations of the minima for a circular aperture. For instance, the positions are given by sin(θ) = 1.22λ/D, 2.23λ/D, and so on, where D is the diameter (D=2a). This is equivalent to `θ = 0.61λ/a` and `θ = 1.115λ/a`. The difference between these two is `0.505λ/a`, which confirms the result.\n\nTherefore, the angular distance between the first and second minima is approximately 0.506 λ / a.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nAn N-sided regular polygon with an infinitely large number of sides (N → ∞) approaches the shape of a circle.

The light source is monochromatic with wavelength λ, and it passes through an N-sided polygonal aperture where all apothems have a length of 'a'. A key piece of information is that N is infinitely large.\n\nFirst, let's understand the shape of the aperture. As the number of sides (N) of a regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' approaches infinity, the polygon's shape approaches that of a circle. In this limit, the apothem 'a' becomes the radius of the circle.\n\nTherefore, the problem simplifies to finding the angular separation between the first two minima for Fraunhofer diffraction through a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe diffraction pattern from a circular aperture is characterized by a central bright disc, known as the Airy disk, surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The angular positions of the dark rings (minima) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function, J₁(x).\n\nThe condition for the minima is given by the formula:\nsin(θ) ≈ θ = m * λ / D\n\nwhere:\n*   θ is the angular position of the minimum.\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   D is the diameter of the circular aperture. In this case, the radius is 'a', so the diameter D = 2a.\n*   m is a coefficient corresponding to the order of the minimum.\n\nFor a circular aperture, the values of 'm' for the successive minima are not integers but are approximately 1.220, 2.23, 3.24, and so on.\n\nUsing these values, we can find the angular positions of the first two minima:\n\n*   **First minimum (θ₁):**\n    Using m = 1.220, the angular position of the first minimum is:\n    θ₁ ≈ 1.220 * λ / D = 1.220 * λ / (2a) = 0.610 * λ / a.\n\n*   **Second minimum (θ₂):**\n    Using m = 2.23, the angular position of the second minimum is:\n    θ₂ ≈ 2.23 * λ / D = 2.23 * λ / (2a) = 1.115 * λ / a.\n\nThe question asks for the angular distance between these first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\n\nΔθ ≈ (1.115 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\nΔθ ≈ 0.505 * λ / a\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 1.220 λ /a\nB) 0.506 λ / a\nC) 0.610 λ / a\nD) 0.500 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value of 0.505 λ / a is closest to 0.506 λ / a.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the shape of the aperture for N -> infinity.**\nThe aperture is an N-sided regular polygon. A key property given is that all apothems have the same length, 'a'. The apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. This distance 'a' is the radius of the circle inscribed within the polygon.\n\nLet R be the circumradius, which is the distance from the center to a vertex. The relationship between the apothem 'a' and the circumradius 'R' for an N-sided regular polygon is given by:\n$a = R \\cos(\\pi/N)$\n\nAs the number of sides N approaches infinity ($N \\to \\infty$), the angle $\\pi/N$ approaches 0.\n$\\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\cos(\\pi/N) = \\cos(0) = 1$\nTherefore, in the limit, $a = R \\times 1$, which means $R = a$.\n\nSince both the inscribed radius and the circumscribed radius approach 'a', the polygon itself converges to a perfect circle of radius 'a'.\n\n**Step 2: Use the formula for Fraunhofer diffraction by a circular aperture.**\nThe problem now simplifies to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'. The far-field (Fraunhofer) diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. The intensity $I$ at an angle $\\theta$ from the central axis is given by:\n\n$I(\\theta) = I_0 \\left[ \\frac{2 J_1(k a \\sin \\theta)}{k a \\sin \\theta} \\right]^2$\n\nwhere:\n*   $I_0$ is the intensity at the center.\n*   $J_1$ is the Bessel function of the first kind, of order one.\n*   $k = 2\\pi/\\lambda$ is the wave number.\n*   'a' is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light.\n\n**Step 3: Find the angular positions of the minima.**\nThe intensity minima occur when the numerator is zero, which means $J_1(k a \\sin \\theta) = 0$ (for $\\theta \\neq 0$). The minima are determined by the zeros of the Bessel function $J_1(x)$. Let's denote the zeros as $x_1, x_2, x_3, \\dots$. The first few values are:\n*   $x_1 \\approx 3.8317$ (This gives the first minimum)\n*   $x_2 \\approx 7.0156$ (This gives the second minimum)\n*   $x_3 \\approx 10.1735$ (This gives the third minimum)\n\nFor the m-th minimum, the condition is:\n$k a \\sin(\\theta_m) = x_m$\n$\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} a \\sin(\\theta_m) = x_m$\n\nThe problem states we can use the small angle approximation, so $\\sin(\\theta_m) \\approx \\theta_m$.\n$\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} a \\theta_m = x_m$\nSolving for the angular position $\\theta_m$:\n$\\theta_m = \\frac{x_m \\lambda}{2\\pi a}$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the angular distance between the first two minima.**\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima. This corresponds to the difference between the angular position of the second minimum ($\\theta_2$) and the first minimum ($\\theta_1$).\n\nAngular position of the first minimum ($\\theta_1$):\n$\\theta_1 = \\frac{x_1 \\lambda}{2\\pi a} = \\frac{3.8317 \\lambda}{2\\pi a}$\n\nAngular position of the second minimum ($\\theta_2$):\n$\\theta_2 = \\frac{x_2 \\lambda}{2\\pi a} = \\frac{7.0156 \\lambda}{2\\pi a}$\n\nThe angular distance between them is $\\Delta\\theta = \\theta_2 - \\theta_1$:\n$\\Delta\\theta = \\frac{x_2 \\lambda}{2\\pi a} - \\frac{x_1 \\lambda}{2\\pi a} = \\frac{(x_2 - x_1)\\lambda}{2\\pi a}$\n\nNow, substitute the values of the zeros:\n$\\Delta\\theta = \\frac{(7.0156 - 3.8317)\\lambda}{2\\pi a} = \\frac{3.1839 \\lambda}{2\\pi a}$\n\nFinally, calculate the numerical coefficient:\n$\\frac{3.1839}{2\\pi} \\approx \\frac{3.1839}{6.2832} \\approx 0.5067...$\n\nSo, the angular distance is:\n$\\Delta\\theta \\approx 0.507 \\frac{\\lambda}{a}$\n\n**Step 5: Compare with the given options.**\nThe calculated value is approximately $0.507 \\lambda/a$. Let's examine the options:\nA) $0.610 \\lambda / a$ (This corresponds to the position of the first minimum, $\\theta_1$)\nB) $1.220 \\lambda /a$ (This corresponds to the angular width of the central maximum, $2\\theta_1$)\nC) $0.506 \\lambda / a$\nD) $0.500 \\lambda / a$ (This would be the answer for a square aperture)\n\nOur calculated value $0.507 \\lambda/a$ is extremely close to option C, $0.506 \\lambda/a$. The small difference is likely due to the rounding of the coefficient in the option. Thus, C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\n### Analysis\nAn N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a' approaches the shape of a circle with radius 'a' as N becomes infinitely large. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The angular positions of the dark rings (intensity minima) are what we need to determine.\n\nFor a circular aperture, the angle θ for the minima in the far-field diffraction pattern is given by the formula:\nsin(θ) = m * λ / D\n\nwhere:\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   D is the diameter of the aperture. In this problem, the apothem 'a' becomes the radius of the circle, so the diameter D = 2a.\n*   m is a coefficient determined by the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\nThe formula is more precisely written as:\nsin(θ) = (xₙ / π) * λ / D = (xₙ) * λ / (2π * a)\n\nThe intensity minima occur when the argument of the Bessel function, `(π * D / λ) * sin(θ)`, corresponds to the non-zero roots of the function. For the first two minima, we need the first two non-zero roots of the J₁ Bessel function.\n\nLet's find the angular positions for the first two minima:\n*   **First minimum (θ₁):** The location of the first minimum is given by the well-known formula for the Airy disk radius, where `sin(θ₁) ≈ 1.22 * λ / D`. Since D = 2a, we have `sin(θ₁) ≈ 1.22 * λ / (2a) = 0.61 * λ / a`.\n*   **Second minimum (θ₂):** The second minimum corresponds to the next zero of the Bessel function. Its position is given as `sin(θ₂) ≈ 2.23 * λ / D`. Substituting D = 2a, we get `sin(θ₂) ≈ 2.23 * λ / (2a) = 1.115 * λ / a`.\n\nThe problem asks for the angular distance between these first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁. Using the small angle approximation (sinθ ≈ θ), we have:\n*   θ₁ ≈ 0.61 * λ / a\n*   θ₂ ≈ 1.115 * λ / a\n\nNow, we calculate the difference:\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (1.115 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\nΔθ = 0.505 * λ / a\n\nThis value is very close to 0.506 λ / a. A more precise calculation using the zeros of the J₁ Bessel function (x₁ ≈ 3.8317 and x₂ ≈ 7.0156) would yield:\n*   θ₁ = (x₁ / 2π) * λ / a = (3.8317 / 6.2832) * λ / a ≈ 0.6098 * λ / a\n*   θ₂ = (x₂ / 2π) * λ / a = (7.0156 / 6.2832) * λ / a ≈ 1.1166 * λ / a\n\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (1.1166 - 0.6098) * λ / a = 0.5068 * λ / a\n\nThis result rounds to 0.507 λ / a. Comparing this with the given options, the closest one is 0.506 λ / a.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe angular distance between the first two minima is calculated to be approximately 0.507 λ / a. Option B is the nearest value.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Limiting Shape:** An N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a' and an infinitely large number of sides (N → ∞) converges to a circle. The apothem 'a' becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Recall Diffraction from a Circular Aperture:** The far-field (Fraunhofer) diffraction pattern from a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. The intensity of this pattern is not zero at the center and has concentric rings of maxima and minima.\n\n3.  **Condition for Minima:** The angular positions (θ) of the intensity minima are given by the formula:\n    `a * sin(θ) = C * λ`\n    where 'a' is the radius of the aperture, λ is the wavelength, and C is a constant determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function, J₁(x). Specifically, the minima occur when:\n    `k * a * sin(θ) = z_j`\n    where `k = 2π/λ` is the wavenumber and `z_j` are the roots (zeros) of the J₁(x) Bessel function.\n\n4.  **Use Small Angle Approximation:** The problem states we can use the `tan(θ) ≈ θ` approximation. For small angles, this also means `sin(θ) ≈ θ`. The condition for minima simplifies to:\n    `(2π/λ) * a * θ_j = z_j`\n    Rearranging for the angular position of the j-th minimum (θ_j), we get:\n    `θ_j = (z_j * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Angular Distance:** We need the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n    `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [(z₂ * λ) / (2π * a)] - [(z₁ * λ) / (2π * a)]`\n    `Δθ = (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) * (λ / a)`\n    Here, z₁ and z₂ are the first and second zeros of the J₁(x) Bessel function.\n\n6.  **Find Bessel Function Zeros and Compute:** We will use Python's `scipy` library to find the precise values for z₁ and z₂ and then compute the final coefficient `(z₂ - z₁) / (2π)`.

The apothem is the line segment from the center of a regular polygon to the midpoint of a side.\n    *   **Light:** Monochromatic light of wavelength λ, traveling along the z-axis (i.e., normal incidence).\n    *   **Phenomenon:** Fraunhofer (far-field) diffraction.\n    *   **Goal:** Find the angular distance between the first two minima.\n    *   **Approximation:** Small angle approximation (sin θ ≈ tan θ ≈ θ) is valid.\n\n2.  **Identify the Shape of the Aperture:**\n    *   A regular polygon with an infinite number of sides (N → ∞) converges to a circle.\n    *   As N → ∞, the apothem 'a' becomes the radius 'r' of the circle.\n    *   Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius `r = a`.\n\n3.  **Recall Diffraction by a Circular Aperture:**\n    *   The far-field diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. It consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n    *   The dark rings correspond to the intensity minima. Their angular positions are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function, J₁(x).\n    *   The condition for the minima is given by:\n        `sin(θ) = c * (λ / D)`\n        where:\n        *   `θ` is the angular position of the minimum.\n        *   `λ` is the wavelength of light.\n        *   `D` is the diameter of the aperture.\n        *   `c` is a numerical constant that depends on the order of the minimum.\n\n4.  **Determine the Positions of the Minima:**\n    *   The diameter of our circular aperture is `D = 2 * r = 2 * a`.\n    *   **First Minimum:** For the first dark ring, the well-established constant is `c₁ ≈ 1.220`. This value comes from the first non-zero root of the Bessel function J₁(x). The angular position `θ₁` is:\n        `sin(θ₁) = 1.220 * (λ / D) = 1.220 * (λ / 2a) = 0.610 * (λ / a)`\n    *   **Second Minimum:** For the second dark ring, the constant is `c₂ ≈ 2.233`. This comes from the second non-zero root of the Bessel function. The angular position `θ₂` is:\n        `sin(θ₂) = 2.233 * (λ / D) = 2.233 * (λ / 2a) ≈ 1.117 * (λ / a)`\n    *   Using the small angle approximation (`sin θ ≈ θ`), we have:\n        *   `θ₁ ≈ 0.610 * (λ / a)`\n        *   `θ₂ ≈ 1.117 * (λ / a)`\n\n5.  **Interpret the Question:**\n    *   The question asks for \"the angular distance between the first two minima\". This phrasing can be ambiguous. Let's analyze the possible interpretations in the context of diffraction patterns.\n    *   **Interpretation A:** The angular position of the first minimum relative to the central maximum (at θ=0). This would be `θ₁ ≈ 0.610 λ / a`. This matches option A.\n    *   **Interpretation B:** The angular separation between the first and second minima on the same side of the central maximum. This would be `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ (1.117 - 0.610) λ / a = 0.507 λ / a`. This is very close to option C (0.506 λ / a).\n    *   **Interpretation C:** The angular separation between the first minimum on one side of the center (at `+θ₁`) and the first minimum on the other side of the center (at `-θ₁`). The Airy pattern is symmetric. These are the two minima closest to the center, and thus can be described as \"the first two minima\". The distance between them defines the angular width of the central Airy disk. This distance would be `Δθ = θ₁ - (-θ₁) = 2θ₁`.\n        `2θ₁ ≈ 2 * (0.610 * λ / a) = 1.220 * λ / a`. This matches option D exactly.\n\n6.  **Select the Most Likely Interpretation:**\n    *   The angular width of the central maximum (`2θ₁`) is a very common and fundamentally important characteristic of a diffraction pattern, as it relates directly to the resolving power of the aperture (Rayleigh criterion).\n    *   Phrasing \"the angular distance between the first two minima\" is a very plausible, if slightly indirect, way of asking for the width of the central bright fringe. The \"first two minima\" are the ones that bound this central fringe.\n    *   Given that this interpretation leads to an exact match with option D (`1.220 λ/a`), it is the most probable intended meaning of the question. The other interpretations either represent a different physical quantity (Option A) or result in a slight numerical mismatch (Option C).\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The angular position of the first minimum is `θ₁ = 0.610 * (λ / a)`.\n    *   The first two minima are located at `+θ₁` and `-θ₁`.\n    *   The angular distance between them is `2 * θ₁ = 2 * 0.610 * (λ / a) = 1.220 * (λ / a)`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\n*   **Step 1: Simplify the Aperture Geometry**\n    The problem describes an N-sided regular polygon where the number of sides, N, approaches infinity. In this limit, a regular polygon becomes a circle. The apothem 'a' is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. As N → ∞, the apothem becomes equal to the radius of the resulting circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to analyzing the diffraction of light through a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the Physical Phenomenon**\n    The light passes through the aperture and forms a pattern of maxima and minima in the far field. This is a classic example of Fraunhofer diffraction. The specific pattern formed by a circular aperture is called an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a central bright disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The minima are the dark rings.\n\n*   **Step 3: Formulate the Condition for Minima**\n    The angular positions of the intensity minima in a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern from a circular aperture are given by the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind of order one, `J₁(x)`. The condition for the m-th minimum (m = 1, 2, 3, ...) is:\n    `k * a * sin(θ_m) = z_m`\n    where:\n    *   `θ_m` is the angular position of the m-th minimum.\n    *   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n    *   `k = 2π / λ` is the wave number of the monochromatic light.\n    *   `z_m` is the m-th non-trivial zero of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`.\n\n*   **Step 4: Apply the Small-Angle Approximation**\n    The problem states that we can assume the angles are small. Therefore, we use the approximation `sin(θ_m) ≈ θ_m`. The condition for the minima simplifies to:\n    `k * a * θ_m = z_m`\n\n    Solving for the angular position `θ_m`:\n    `θ_m = z_m / (k * a)`\n    Substituting `k = 2π / λ`, we get:\n    `θ_m = z_m * λ / (2π * a)`\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the Angular Distance**\n    We need to find the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`. This requires the first two non-trivial zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`:\n    *   First zero: `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n    *   Second zero: `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\n    The angular distance is therefore:\n    `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (z₂ * λ / (2π * a)) - (z₁ * λ / (2π * a))`\n    `Δθ = (z₂ - z₁) * λ / (2π * a)`\n    `Δθ = (7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ / (2π * a)`\n    `Δθ = 3.1839 * λ / (2π * a)`\n\n*   **Step 6: Compute the Numerical Coefficient**\n    To find the final numerical value, we calculate the coefficient `3.1839 / (2π)`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The first two non-trivial zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, J1(x)\nz1 = 3.8317\nz2 = 7.0156\n\n# The angular distance is Δθ = (z2 - z1) * λ / (2π * a)\n# We compute the coefficient C = (z2 - z1) / (2π)\ncoefficient = (z2 - z1) / (2 * math.pi)\nprint(coefficient)\n```\n<execute_ipython>\nimport math\n\n# The first two non-trivial zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, J1(x)\nz1 = 3.8317\nz2 = 7.0156\n\n# The angular distance is Δθ = (z2 - z1) * λ / (2π * a)\n# We compute the coefficient C = (z2 - z1) / (2π)\ncoefficient = (z2 - z1) / (2 * math.pi)\nprint(coefficient)\n</execute_ipython>\n[stdout]\n0.5067200257969351\n[/stdout]\nThe calculated coefficient is approximately 0.5067.

Therefore, the aperture is a circle with radius R = a, and its diameter is D = 2a.\n\nWhen monochromatic light passes through a circular aperture, it creates a diffraction pattern known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central disk surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The angular positions of the dark rings (minima) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\nUsing the small angle approximation, the angular position, θ, of the minima is given by the formula:\nθ = (constant * λ) / D\n\nWhere λ is the wavelength of the light and D is the diameter of the aperture.\n\nA more precise formulation gives the positions of the minima as:\nsin(θ) ≈ θ = cₙ * λ / D\n\nWhere the constants cₙ for the first few minima are:\n*   For the first minimum: c₁ ≈ 1.220\n*   For the second minimum: c₂ ≈ 2.233\n\nIn this problem, the diameter of the circular aperture is D = 2a.\n\nThe angular position of the first minimum (θ₁) is:\nθ₁ ≈ 1.220 * λ / (2a) = 0.610 * λ / a\n\nThe angular position of the second minimum (θ₂) is:\nθ₂ ≈ 2.233 * λ / (2a) ≈ 1.1165 * λ / a\n\nThe question asks for the angular distance between these first two minima, which is Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁.\n\nΔθ = (1.1165 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\nΔθ = (1.1165 - 0.610) * λ / a\nΔθ = 0.5065 * λ / a\n\nThis result is closest to option B. The small discrepancy arises from using more precise values for the constants, which are derived from the zeros of the Bessel function. The value for the second minimum is often cited as 2.23, and the calculation using this gives a result of 0.505. The option 0.506 accounts for a more precise value.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 60:\nAn N-sided polygonal aperture with a constant apothem `a` will approach the shape of a circle as N becomes infinitely large. The radius of this circle will be equal to the apothem, `a`. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius `a`.\n\nWhen monochromatic light passes through a circular aperture, it creates a diffraction pattern known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a central bright spot, called the Airy disk, surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The dark rings correspond to the minima of the light intensity.\n\nFor a circular aperture of diameter `D`, the angular positions of the intensity minima are given by the formula:\nsin(θ) ≈ θ ≈ m * (λ / D)\nwhere λ is the wavelength of the light and `m` is a coefficient that determines the order of the minimum.\n\nIn this case, the radius of the aperture is `a`, so its diameter `D` is `2a`. The positions of the minima are found at specific angles related to the zeros of the first-order Bessel function.\n\nThe first minimum occurs at an angle θ₁ given by:\nθ₁ ≈ 1.22 * (λ / D) = 1.22 * (λ / 2a) = 0.610 * (λ / a).\n\nThe second minimum occurs at an angle θ₂ given by:\nθ₂ ≈ 2.23 * (λ / D) = 2.23 * (λ / 2a) = 1.115 * (λ / a).\n\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is the difference between the angular position of the second minimum and the first minimum:\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁\nΔθ ≈ (1.115 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\nΔθ ≈ 0.505 * (λ / a)\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 1.220 λ /a\nB) 0.610 λ / a\nC) 0.500 λ / a\nD) 0.506 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 0.505 λ / a is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
