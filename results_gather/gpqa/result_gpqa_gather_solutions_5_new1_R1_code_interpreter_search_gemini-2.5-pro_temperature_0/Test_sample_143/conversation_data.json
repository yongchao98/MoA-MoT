Understand the Key Concepts:\n\n*   **Decay Width (Γ):** This is a measure of the uncertainty in the energy of an unstable particle. It is inversely proportional to the particle's lifetime.\n*   **Mean Proper Lifetime (τ₀):** This is the average lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame. It is related to the decay width by the formula τ₀ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n*   **Time Dilation:** Due to relativistic effects, a moving particle's lifetime appears longer to an observer in the lab frame. This observed lifetime (τ_lab) is given by τ_lab = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Mean Decay Distance (d):** This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before it decays. It is calculated as d = v * τ_lab, where v is the particle's velocity.\n\n### 2. The Formula:\n\nCombining these concepts, the mean decay distance can be expressed as:\nd = v * γ * τ₀ = β * c * γ * (ħ / Γ)\nwhere:\n*   β = v/c (velocity as a fraction of the speed of light)\n*   c is the speed of light\n*   ħc is a useful physical constant, approximately 197.3 MeV·fm.\n*   The term βγ can also be expressed as p/m, where p is the momentum and m is the mass of the particle.\n\n### 3. Calculation Steps:\n\nFirst, we calculate the relativistic factor βγ using the given energy and mass.\n\n*   **Given:**\n    *   Total energy E_X = 8 GeV = 8000 MeV\n    *   Rest mass m_X = 1.2 GeV = 1200 MeV (This is technically m_X*c²)\n    *   Decay width Γ_X = 320 MeV\n\n*   **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    γ = E_X / m_X = 8000 MeV / 1200 MeV = 20 / 3\n\n*   **Calculate β:**\n    β = √(1 - 1/γ²) = √(1 - 1/(20/3)²) = √(1 - 9/400) = √(391/400)\n\n*   **Calculate βγ:**\n    βγ = (√(391)/20) * (20/3) = √(391)/3 ≈ 6.591\n\nNext, we use this value to calculate the mean decay distance.\n\n*   **Calculate the mean decay distance (d):**\n    d = βγ * (ħc / Γ_X)\n    d ≈ 6.591 * (197.3 MeV·fm / 320 MeV)\n    d ≈ 6.591 * 0.6166 fm\n    d ≈ 4.0655 fm\n\nFinally, we convert the result from femtometers (fm) to meters (m).\n\n*   **Conversion:**\n    1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m\n    d ≈ 4.0655 × 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Calculate the lifetime ($\\tau$) of the particle in its rest frame.** The lifetime of a particle is inversely proportional to its decay width ($\\Gamma$). The relationship is given by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: $\\tau = \\hbar / \\Gamma$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n2.  **Calculate the particle's momentum ($p$).** We can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$. From this, we can find the momentum term $pc$.\n3.  **Calculate the mean decay distance ($L$).** The mean decay distance in the lab frame is the distance the particle travels at its velocity ($v$) during its dilated lifetime ($\\tau_{lab}$). The formula is $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$. Using relativistic kinematics, this can be expressed more conveniently as $L = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} c \\tau$.\n4.  **Combine and compute.** We will substitute the values for momentum, mass, lifetime, and the speed of light ($c$) into the formula to get the final distance in meters. All units must be consistent (e.g., using eV for energy, seconds for time, and meters/second for speed).\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Define constants and given values ---\n\n# Constants\nhbar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16  # Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\nc_ms = 299792458           # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Given values from the problem\nE_X_GeV = 8.0   # Production energy in GeV\nm_X_GeV = 1.2   # Mass in GeV/c^2\nGamma_X_MeV = 320.0 # Decay width in MeV\n\n# --- Convert all units to a consistent base (eV) ---\nE_X_eV = E_X_GeV * 1e9\nm_X_c2_eV = m_X_GeV * 1e9\nGamma_X_eV = Gamma_X_MeV * 1e6\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate the lifetime in the rest frame (tau) ---\n# tau = hbar / Gamma\ntau_s = hbar_eVs / Gamma_X_eV\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate the momentum term (pc) ---\n# E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2  =>  pc = sqrt(E^2 - (mc^2)^2)\npc_sq_eV2 = E_X_eV**2 - m_X_c2_eV**2\npc_eV = math.sqrt(pc_sq_eV2)\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate the mean decay distance (L) ---\n# L = (pc / mc^2) * c * tau\nmean_decay_distance_m = (pc_eV / m_X_c2_eV) * c_ms * tau_s\n\n# --- Print the final result and the options ---\nprint(f\"The calculated mean decay distance is: {mean_decay_distance_m:.4e} m\")\nprint(\"\\nComparing with the given options:\")\nprint(f\"A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\")\nprint(f\"B) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\")\nprint(f\"C) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\")\nprint(f\"D) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\")\n```\n<<<C>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The calculated mean decay distance is: 4.0645e-15 m\n\nComparing with the given options:\nA) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\nB) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\nC) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\nD) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the mean distance a particle travels in the laboratory frame before it decays. This is known as the mean decay distance or mean decay length, denoted by $L$.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Physical Principles:**\n    *   **Mean Lifetime:** The mean decay distance is the product of the particle's velocity ($v$) and its mean lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$): $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** The lifetime of a moving particle as measured in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$) is longer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime, $\\tau_0$) due to relativistic time dilation. The relationship is $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** The decay width ($\\Gamma$) of an unstable particle is related to its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by the uncertainty principle: $\\Gamma \\cdot \\tau_0 \\approx \\hbar$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. Therefore, $\\tau_0 = \\hbar / \\Gamma$.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation Strategy:**\n    *   Combine the principles above to get a single formula for the mean decay distance $L$.\n        *   Start with $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$.\n        *   Substitute $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$: $L = \\gamma v \\tau_0$.\n        *   Introduce $\\beta = v/c$, so $v = \\beta c$: $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau_0$.\n        *   Substitute $\\tau_0 = \\hbar / \\Gamma_X$: $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$.\n        *   This can be conveniently rewritten as $L = (\\gamma \\beta) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$.\n    *   Calculate the necessary quantities ($\\gamma$ and $\\beta$) from the given information.\n    *   Substitute all values into the final formula to find $L$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Units:** It is crucial to maintain consistent units. In particle physics, it's common to use Mega-electron-volts (MeV) or Giga-electron-volts (GeV) for energy, mass, and width. The product $\\hbar c$ is a useful constant that helps convert between energy units and length units.\n*   **Proper vs. Lab Frame:** The decay width $\\Gamma_X$ is an intrinsic property of the particle and is related to its *proper* lifetime $\\tau_0$. The decay distance, however, is measured in the *lab frame*, so the time-dilated lifetime $\\tau_{lab}$ must be used. The Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ correctly bridges these two frames.\n*   **Relativistic Kinematics:** The particle's energy ($E_X = 8$ GeV) is much larger than its rest mass ($m_X = 1.2$ GeV), indicating it is highly relativistic. Therefore, using relativistic formulas for energy and time is essential.\n\n### Calculation Steps\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$)**:\n    The Lorentz factor is the ratio of the total energy to the rest mass energy.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X c^2} = \\frac{8 \\text{ GeV}}{1.2 \\text{ GeV}} = \\frac{80}{12} = \\frac{20}{3}$\n\n2.  **Calculate the velocity factor ($\\beta = v/c$)**:\n    The velocity factor is related to the Lorentz factor by $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}$. We can solve for $\\beta$:\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{3}{20}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{9}{400}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{391}{400}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{391}}{20}$\n\n3.  **Calculate the product $\\gamma \\beta$**:\n    This term represents the particle's momentum in units of its rest mass ($p/m_X c$).\n    $\\gamma \\beta = \\left(\\frac{20}{3}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{391}}{20}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{391}}{3}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the mean decay distance ($L$)**:\n    Now, use the formula $L = (\\gamma \\beta) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$.\n    *   Given: $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Constant: $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$ (where 1 femtometer, fm, is $10^{-15}$ m).\n    *   Substitute the values:\n        $L = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{391}}{3}\\right) \\times \\frac{197.327 \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}}{320 \\text{ MeV}}$\n    *   Calculate the numerical values:\n        $\\sqrt{391} \\approx 19.7737$\n        $L \\approx \\left(\\frac{19.7737}{3}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{197.327}{320}\\right) \\text{ fm}$\n        $L \\approx (6.5912) \\times (0.6166) \\text{ fm}$\n        $L \\approx 4.0655 \\text{ fm}$\n\n5.  **Convert to Meters**:\n    Since $1 \\text{ fm} = 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$:\n    $L \\approx 4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe code execution was successful and produced the result: `The calculated mean decay distance is 4.0645e-15 m`.\n\nThis result, $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m, is the correct value based on the provided data and standard physical constants.\n\nLet's compare this calculated value to the given options:\nA) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\nB) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\nC) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\nD) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n\nThe calculated value ($4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m) is extremely close to option D ($4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m).

This is the average distance the particle travels in the laboratory frame before it decays. We are given the following information:\n*   Total energy of the particle in the lab frame: $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   Rest mass of the particle: $m_X = 1.2 \\text{ GeV}$ (Note: In particle physics, mass is often given in units of energy, representing $mc^2$)\n*   Decay width of the particle: $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n### **Careful Points and Key Concepts**\n\n1.  **Mean Proper Lifetime ($\\tau$):** The decay width ($\\Gamma$) of an unstable particle is related to its mean lifetime in its own rest frame ($\\tau$) by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The formula is:\n    $\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** The particle is moving at a relativistic speed, as its total energy ($8 \\text{ GeV}$) is much larger than its rest mass energy ($1.2 \\text{ GeV}$). Therefore, its lifetime as measured in the laboratory frame ($\\tau'$) will be longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau$) due to time dilation. The relationship is:\n    $\\tau' = \\gamma \\tau$\n    where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The Lorentz factor is the ratio of the particle's total energy to its rest mass energy:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X c^2}$\n\n4.  **Mean Decay Distance ($L$):** The mean decay distance is the product of the particle's velocity ($v$) and its lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau'$):\n    $L = v \\cdot \\tau'$\n    Since $v = \\beta c$ (where $\\beta$ is the velocity as a fraction of the speed of light $c$) and $\\tau' = \\gamma \\tau$, the formula becomes:\n    $L = (\\beta c) (\\gamma \\tau) = \\beta\\gamma (c\\tau)$\n\n5.  **Useful Combination ($\\beta\\gamma$):** The product $\\beta\\gamma$ can be calculated directly from the particle's energy and mass.\n    We know that $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. The momentum is $p = \\gamma m v = \\gamma m (\\beta c)$.\n    So, $pc = \\beta\\gamma (mc^2)$.\n    Therefore, $\\beta\\gamma = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2}$.\n\n6.  **Constants and Units:** We need to be consistent with units.

Understand the Key Concepts\n\nTo find the mean decay distance (also known as the decay length) of a relativistic particle, we need to consider time dilation. The particle's internal clock runs slower than the observer's clock in the laboratory frame.\n\n*   **Proper Lifetime (τ):** This is the lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame. It is inversely related to the decay width (Γ) by the formula τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n*   **Decay Width (Γ):** This represents the uncertainty in the particle's mass-energy and is given in units of energy. A larger width implies a shorter lifetime.\n*   **Time Dilation and Lorentz Factor (γ):** In the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is dilated by the Lorentz factor, γ. The observed lifetime is γτ. The Lorentz factor is calculated as γ = E / m, where E is the total energy and m is the rest mass of the particle.\n*   **Mean Decay Distance (L):** This is the distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It is calculated by multiplying the particle's velocity (v) by its dilated lifetime (γτ). The formula is `L = γ * v * τ`.\n\n### 2. Formulate the Calculation\n\nA convenient combined formula for the mean decay length is `L = (pc / mc²) * (ħc / Γ)`, where `p` is the momentum, `m` is the mass, `c` is the speed of light, `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, and `Γ` is the decay width.

However, the particle is moving at a relativistic speed in the lab, so its lifetime will be longer due to time dilation. We must calculate the lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$) to find the decay distance in the lab.\n2.  **Units:** All units must be consistent throughout the calculation. The energy and mass are given in GeV, while the width is in MeV. It is best to convert everything to a single unit of energy (e.g., MeV or GeV).\n3.  **Constants:** We will need the values of the reduced Planck constant ($\\hbar$) and the speed of light ($c$). It is often convenient to use the combined constant $\\hbar c$, which has units of energy times length (e.g., MeV·fm).\n4.  **Relativistic Formulas:** We must use the correct relativistic formulas for energy, momentum, time dilation, and velocity.

The relationship is given by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: $\\tau = \\hbar / \\Gamma$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n2.  **Calculate the particle's momentum ($p$).** We can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$. From this, we can find the momentum term $pc$.\n3.  **Calculate the mean decay distance ($L$).** The mean decay distance in the lab frame is the distance the particle travels at its velocity ($v$) during its dilated lifetime ($\\tau_{lab}$). The formula is $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$. Using relativistic kinematics, this can be expressed more conveniently as $L = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} c \\tau$.\n4.  **Combine and compute.** We will substitute the values for momentum, mass, lifetime, and the speed of light ($c$) into the formula to get the final distance in meters.

This is known as the mean decay distance or mean decay length, denoted by $L$.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Physical Principles:**\n    *   **Mean Lifetime:** The mean decay distance is the product of the particle's velocity ($v$) and its mean lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$): $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** The lifetime of a moving particle as measured in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$) is longer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime, $\\tau_0$) due to relativistic time dilation. The relationship is $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** The decay width ($\\Gamma$) of an unstable particle is related to its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) by the uncertainty principle: $\\Gamma \\cdot \\tau_0 \\approx \\hbar$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. Therefore, $\\tau_0 = \\hbar / \\Gamma$.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation Strategy:**\n    *   Combine the principles above to get a single formula for the mean decay distance $L$.\n        *   Start with $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$.\n        *   Substitute $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$: $L = \\gamma v \\tau_0$.\n        *   Introduce $\\beta = v/c$, so $v = \\beta c$: $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau_0$.\n        *   Substitute $\\tau_0 = \\hbar / \\Gamma_X$: $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$.\n        *   This can be conveniently rewritten as $L = (\\gamma \\beta) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$.\n    *   Calculate the necessary quantities ($\\gamma$ and $\\beta$) from the given information.\n    *   Substitute all values into the final formula to find $L$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Units:** It is crucial to maintain consistent units. In particle physics, it's common to use Mega-electron-volts (MeV) or Giga-electron-volts (GeV) for energy, mass, and width. The product $\\hbar c$ is a useful constant that helps convert between energy units and length units.\n*   **Proper vs. Lab Frame:** The decay width $\\Gamma_X$ is an intrinsic property of the particle and is related to its *proper* lifetime $\\tau_0$. The decay distance, however, is measured in the *lab frame*, so the time-dilated lifetime $\\tau_{lab}$ must be used. The Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ correctly bridges these two frames.\n*   **Relativistic Kinematics:** The particle's energy ($E_X = 8$ GeV) is much larger than its rest mass ($m_X = 1.2$ GeV), indicating it is highly relativistic. Therefore, using relativistic formulas for energy and time is essential.\n\n### Calculation Steps\n\n1.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$)**:\n    The Lorentz factor is the ratio of the total energy to the rest mass energy.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X c^2} = \\frac{8 \\text{ GeV}}{1.2 \\text{ GeV}} = \\frac{80}{12} = \\frac{20}{3}$\n\n2.  **Calculate the velocity factor ($\\beta = v/c$)**:\n    The velocity factor is related to the Lorentz factor by $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}$. We can solve for $\\beta$:\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{3}{20}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{9}{400}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{391}{400}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{391}}{20}$\n\n3.  **Calculate the product $\\gamma \\beta$**:\n    This term represents the particle's momentum in units of its rest mass ($p/m_X c$).\n    $\\gamma \\beta = \\left(\\frac{20}{3}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{391}}{20}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{391}}{3}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the mean decay distance ($L$)**:\n    Now, use the formula $L = (\\gamma \\beta) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$.\n    *   Given: $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$\n    *   Constant: $\\hbar c \\approx 197.327 \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}$ (where 1 femtometer, fm, is $10^{-15}$ m).\n    *   Substitute the values:\n        $L = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{391}}{3}\\right) \\times \\frac{197.327 \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{fm}}{320 \\text{ MeV}}$\n    *   Calculate the numerical values:\n        $\\sqrt{391} \\approx 19.7737$\n        $L \\approx \\left(\\frac{19.7737}{3}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{197.327}{320}\\right) \\text{ fm}$\n        $L \\approx (6.5912) \\times (0.6166) \\text{ fm}$\n        $L \\approx 4.0655 \\text{ fm}$\n\n5.  **Convert to Meters**:\n    Since $1 \\text{ fm} = 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$:\n    $L \\approx 4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe code execution was successful and produced the result: `The calculated mean decay distance is 4.0645e-15 m`.\n\nThis result, $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m, is the correct value based on the provided data and standard physical constants.\n\nLet's compare this calculated value to the given options:\nA) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\nB) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\nC) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\nD) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n\nThe calculated value ($4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m) is extremely close to option D ($4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m).

It's calculated as the ratio of the particle's total energy ($E_X$) to its rest mass energy ($m_X c^2$). In particle physics units where c=1, this is simply $\\gamma = E_X / m_X$.\n3.  **Calculate the particle's velocity factor ($\\beta$)**: $\\beta = v/c$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity and $c$ is the speed of light. It can be found from the Lorentz factor using the relation $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\n4.  **Calculate the mean decay distance ($d$)**: The distance is the particle's velocity multiplied by its lifetime in the lab frame. The lab frame lifetime is dilated by the Lorentz factor ($\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$). Therefore, the mean decay distance is $d = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab} = (\\beta c) \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau)$.

This is the average distance the particle travels in the laboratory frame before it decays. We are given the following information:\n*   Total energy of the particle in the lab frame: $E_X = 8 \\text{ GeV}$\n*   Rest mass of the particle: $m_X = 1.2 \\text{ GeV}$ (Note: In particle physics, mass is often given in units of energy, representing $mc^2$)\n*   Decay width of the particle: $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n### **Careful Points and Key Concepts**\n\n1.  **Mean Proper Lifetime ($\\tau$):** The decay width ($\\Gamma$) of an unstable particle is related to its mean lifetime in its own rest frame ($\\tau$) by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The formula is:\n    $\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** The particle is moving at a relativistic speed, as its total energy ($8 \\text{ GeV}$) is much larger than its rest mass energy ($1.2 \\text{ GeV}$). Therefore, its lifetime as measured in the laboratory frame ($\\tau'$) will be longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau$) due to time dilation. The relationship is:\n    $\\tau' = \\gamma \\tau$\n    where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The Lorentz factor is the ratio of the particle's total energy to its rest mass energy:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E_X}{m_X c^2}$\n\n4.  **Mean Decay Distance ($L$):** The mean decay distance is the product of the particle's velocity ($v$) and its lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau'$):\n    $L = v \\cdot \\tau'$\n    Since $v = \\beta c$ (where $\\beta$ is the velocity as a fraction of the speed of light $c$) and $\\tau' = \\gamma \\tau$, the formula becomes:\n    $L = (\\beta c) (\\gamma \\tau) = \\beta\\gamma (c\\tau)$\n\n5.  **Useful Combination ($\\beta\\gamma$):** The product $\\beta\\gamma$ can be calculated directly from the particle's energy and mass.\n    We know that $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. The momentum is $p = \\gamma m v = \\gamma m (\\beta c)$.\n    So, $pc = \\beta\\gamma (mc^2)$.\n    Therefore, $\\beta\\gamma = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2}$.\n\n6.  **Constants and Units:** We need to be consistent with units.

Understand the Key Concepts\n\nTo find the mean decay distance (also known as the decay length) of a relativistic particle, we need to consider time dilation. The particle's internal clock runs slower than the observer's clock in the laboratory frame.\n\n*   **Proper Lifetime (τ):** This is the lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame. It is inversely related to the decay width (Γ) by the formula τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n*   **Decay Width (Γ):** This represents the uncertainty in the particle's mass-energy and is given in units of energy. A larger width implies a shorter lifetime.\n*   **Time Dilation and Lorentz Factor (γ):** In the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is dilated by the Lorentz factor, γ. The observed lifetime is γτ. The Lorentz factor is calculated as γ = E / m, where E is the total energy and m is the rest mass of the particle.\n*   **Mean Decay Distance (L):** This is the distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It is calculated by multiplying the particle's velocity (v) by its dilated lifetime (γτ). The formula is `L = γ * v * τ`.\n\n### 2. Formulate the Calculation\n\nA convenient combined formula for the mean decay length is `L = (pc / mc²) * (ħc / Γ)`, where `p` is the momentum, `m` is the mass, `c` is the speed of light, `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, and `Γ` is the decay width.

However, the particle is moving at a relativistic speed in the lab, so its lifetime will be longer due to time dilation. We must calculate the lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau$) to find the decay distance in the lab.\n2.  **Units:** All units must be consistent throughout the calculation. The energy and mass are given in GeV, while the width is in MeV. It is best to convert everything to a single unit of energy (e.g., MeV or GeV).\n3.  **Constants:** We will need the values of the reduced Planck constant ($\\hbar$) and the speed of light ($c$). It is often convenient to use the combined constant $\\hbar c$, which has units of energy times length (e.g., MeV·fm).\n4.  **Relativistic Formulas:** We must use the correct relativistic formulas for energy, momentum, time dilation, and velocity.

This distance depends on its velocity and its lifetime as observed in the laboratory frame.\n\nFirst, we determine the particle's proper lifetime (τ), which is its lifetime in its own rest frame. This is inversely related to the decay width (Γ) by the formula τ = ħ/Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻²⁵ GeV·s).\n\nGiven:\n*   Decay width, Γ_X = 320 MeV = 0.320 GeV\n\nCalculation of proper lifetime:\nτ = (6.582 x 10⁻²⁵ GeV·s) / 0.320 GeV ≈ 2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s\n\nNext, we need to account for relativistic effects, as the particle is moving at a high velocity. We calculate the Lorentz factor (γ), which describes the time dilation effect.\n\nGiven:\n*   Total energy, E_X = 8 GeV\n*   Rest mass, m_X = 1.2 GeV\n\nCalculation of the Lorentz factor:\nγ = E_X / m_X = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV ≈ 6.667\n\nThe lifetime in the lab frame (τ_lab) is the proper lifetime multiplied by the Lorentz factor (τ_lab = γ * τ). The particle's velocity (v) can be expressed as a fraction of the speed of light, β = v/c, where c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10⁸ m/s). The value of β is related to γ by β = √(1 - 1/γ²).\n\nCalculation of β:\nβ = √(1 - 1 / 6.667²) ≈ √(1 - 0.0225) ≈ 0.9887\n\nFinally, the mean decay distance (L) is the particle's velocity multiplied by its lifetime in the lab frame.\nL = v * τ_lab = (βc) * (γτ) = βγcτ\n\nCalculation of mean decay distance:\nL ≈ 0.9887 * 6.667 * (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s)\nL ≈ 4.065 x 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nA more direct way to calculate the decay length is using the formula L = (γβ / Γ) * ħc, where ħc is approximately 0.1973 GeV·fm (1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m).\n\nCalculation using ħc:\nγβ = 6.667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.591\nL = (6.591 / 0.320 GeV) * (0.1973 GeV·fm) ≈ 20.597 * 0.1973 fm ≈ 4.064 fm\nL ≈ 4.064 x 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nBoth calculation methods yield a result of approximately 4.065 x 10⁻¹⁵ m.

The distance it travels is its velocity (v = βc) multiplied by its dilated lifetime (γτ). The formula for the mean decay distance is d = γβcτ.\n    *   d = (20/3) * √(391/400) * (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s)\n    *   d ≈ 6.667 * 0.9887 * (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * (2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s)\n    *   d ≈ 4.0655 x 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nAn alternative and equivalent calculation uses the relativistic momentum (p).
