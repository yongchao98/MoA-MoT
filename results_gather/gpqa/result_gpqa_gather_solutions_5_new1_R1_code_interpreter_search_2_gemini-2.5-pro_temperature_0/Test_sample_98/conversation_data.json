Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four structures are saturated, consistent with this observation.\n*   **Key Splitting Patterns:** The spectrum shows two particularly complex and informative signals:\n    1.  A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    2.  A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nTo understand these patterns, we use the (n+1) rule, where a proton signal is split into (n+1) lines by 'n' equivalent neighboring protons. For a proton coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of neighbors, the multiplicities multiply.\n\n*   **dtq (doublet of triplets of quartets):** A proton showing this pattern must be coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons:\n    *   A group of 1 proton (n=1, gives a doublet, d)\n    *   A group of 2 equivalent protons (n=2, gives a triplet, t)\n    *   A group of 3 equivalent protons (n=3, gives a quartet, q)\n    The ideal structural environment for this is a CH proton adjacent to a CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group: **-CH(neighbor)-CH(signal)-[CH₂(neighbor)]-[CH₃(neighbor)]-**\n\n*   **dtt (doublet of triplets of triplets):** A proton showing this pattern must be coupled to:\n    *   A group of 1 proton (n=1, gives a doublet, d)\n    *   A group of 2 equivalent protons (n=2, gives a triplet, t)\n    *   Another group of 2 equivalent protons (n=2, gives another triplet, t)\n    The ideal structural environment for this is a CH proton adjacent to a CH group and two different CH₂ groups: **-CH(neighbor)-CH(signal)-[CH₂(neighbor)]-[CH₂(neighbor)]-**\n\n**3. Evaluating the Candidate Structures**\n\nLet's examine each structure to see if its protons match these required environments. Note that in molecules with chiral centers, protons on an adjacent CH₂ group are often diastereotopic (non-equivalent), which would complicate the splitting. However, for the purpose of identifying these characteristic patterns, we can assume accidental equivalence (where the coupling constants are coincidentally the same), which simplifies the observed multiplet.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton on C3 is adjacent to a CH₂ group (on the main chain), a CH group (at C2), and another CH₂ group (on the C3-ethyl substituent). This matches the environment for a **dtt**.\n    *   There is no proton in an environment that would produce a dtq.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton on C3 is adjacent to a CH group (at C4), a CH₂ group (at C2), and another CH₂ group (on the C3-ethyl substituent). This matches the environment for a **dtt**.\n    *   There is no proton in an environment that would produce a dtq.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton on C3 is adjacent to a CH group (at C4), a CH₂ group (at C2), and a CH₃ group (on C3). This matches the environment for a **dtq**.\n    *   There is no proton in an environment that would produce a dtt.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   Let's analyze the proton on C3. It is adjacent to:\n        *   A CH group at C2 (1 proton neighbor → doublet).\n        *   A CH₂ group at C4 (2 proton neighbors → triplet).\n        *   A CH₃ group attached to C3 (3 proton neighbors → quartet).\n    *   This proton is in the perfect structural environment to produce a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   Now let's look for the dtt. Consider one of the diastereotopic protons on the CH₂ group at C4. It is coupled to its geminal partner (1H, doublet), the proton at C3 (1H, doublet), and the terminal CH₃ group (3H, quartet). This would give a doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq). While complex, this is not a dtt. However, in complex molecules, it is not uncommon for a complex multiplet like a ddq to be mis-assigned or to appear as a different pattern due to overlapping signals or specific coupling constant values. Given that structure D provides a perfect and unambiguous origin for the highly specific dtq signal, it is the most likely candidate. The dtt signal likely arises from another proton in the molecule, with the pattern being the result of complex second-order effects or accidental equivalence that makes it appear as a dtt. No other structure provides a clear origin for the dtq signal.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nStructure D is the only one that contains a proton in the precise environment [-CH(neighbor)-CH(signal)-[CH₂(neighbor)]-[CH₃(neighbor)]-] required to produce the observed **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** signal. While the origin of the dtt is less clear from a simple first-order analysis, the presence of the dtq is a very strong piece of evidence pointing uniquely to structure D among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n### Compound Identification\n\nBased on the provided spectroscopic data, the unknown compound is identified as **B) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH**.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n**1. Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy:**\n\n*   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in carboxylic acids. The significant broadness of this peak is a result of hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, which is also a key feature of carboxylic acids.\n\nAll four potential compounds are carboxylic acids, meaning the FTIR data is consistent with any of the choices. Therefore, the ¹H NMR data is crucial for distinguishing the correct structure.\n\n**2. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n\nThe ¹H NMR data provides the most definitive clues for identifying the correct structure through the analysis of spin-spin splitting patterns. The problem states that there are no signals corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens, which is consistent with all four saturated structures. The key is the presence of two specific complex signals: a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** and a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting for the methine (CH) protons in each proposed structure:\n\n*   **A) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid):** This structure would show a proton with a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) pattern, but it lacks a proton that would produce a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq). Instead, it would have a signal with a doublet of triplets (dt) pattern.\n\n*   **B) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH (3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at carbon 3 is adjacent to one proton at carbon 4 (giving a doublet), two protons at carbon 2 (giving a triplet), and the two protons of the ethyl group at carbon 3 (giving another triplet). This results in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**, matching one of the observed signals.\n    *   The proton at carbon 4 is adjacent to one proton at carbon 3 (giving a doublet), the two protons of the ethyl group at carbon 5 (giving a triplet), and the three protons of the methyl group at carbon 4 (giving a quartet). This results in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**, matching the other key signal.\n    This structure is the only one that accounts for both observed complex splitting patterns.\n\n*   **C) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):** This molecule has a proton that would appear as a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq), but it does not have a proton that would give a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt). It would instead show a doublet of quartets (dq).\n\n*   **D) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):** This structure contains a proton that would give a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq). However, the other key methine proton would be split into a doublet of quartets of quartets (dqq), not a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly structure B, which corresponds to 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data, as it is the only option that would produce both a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to identify the correct chemical structure by systematically analyzing the provided spectroscopic data (FTIR and 1H NMR) for each of the four options.\n\n1.  **Analyze FTIR Data**: The peaks at 3000 cm⁻¹ (broad O-H) and 1700 cm⁻¹ (strong C=O) strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this confirms the functional group type but doesn't distinguish between the isomers.\n\n2.  **Analyze 1H NMR Data**: The key to solving this problem lies in the complex splitting patterns (multiplicity) described.\n    *   A signal is described as a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   Another signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   I will examine the structure of each candidate molecule to predict the splitting patterns of its methine (CH) protons, as these are most likely to exhibit such complex splitting. I will use the n+1 rule, where a proton's signal is split by its 'n' neighboring protons.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Candidate**:\n    *   **A) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH**: I will check its methine protons for `dtq` and `dtt` signals.\n    *   **B) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH**: I will check its methine protons for `dtq` and `dtt` signals.\n    *   **C) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH**: I will check its methine protons for `dtq` and `dtt` signals.\n    *   **D) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH**: I will check its methine protons for `dtq` and `dtt` signals.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: The molecule whose predicted splitting patterns match both the observed `dtq` and `dtt` signals will be the correct answer.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze the provided spectroscopic data.\n# The FTIR data (broad peak at 3000 cm-1 for O-H and strong peak at 1700 cm-1 for C=O) confirms the compound is a carboxylic acid.

The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules. This peak often overlaps with the C-H stretching peaks which also appear in this region (around 2850-3000 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration.

All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This tells us that the compound does not contain any C=C double bonds with attached protons. All four options are saturated alkanoic acids, which is consistent with this observation.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This is a very complex splitting pattern and provides a significant clue.

However, there is no proton coupled to one H and two different CH₂ groups.\n\n    *   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n        *   Let's analyze the structure: `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(C₂H₅)-CH(3)(C₂H₅)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n        *   **Consider the proton on C3 (H_B):**\n            *   It is adjacent to the proton on C4 (1H) -> **doublet**.\n            *   It is adjacent to the protons on C2 (2H) -> **triplet**.\n            *   It is adjacent to the protons of its own ethyl group's CH₂ (2H) -> **triplet**.\n            *   This proton's signal would be a **doublet of triplets of triplets**.

Since all four options are carboxylic acids, the FTIR data does not help distinguish between them but confirms the functional group present.\n\n### Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\nThe key to identifying the correct structure lies in the complex splitting patterns described. The n+1 rule states that a proton's signal is split into n+1 peaks by 'n' equivalent neighboring protons. When a proton is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons, more complex patterns emerge.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H). All four proposed structures are saturated alkanoic acids and are consistent with this observation.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex multiplet indicates that a single proton is being split by three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   A **doublet (d)** arises from coupling to one adjacent proton (n=1, so 1+1=2 peaks).\n    *   A **triplet (t)** arises from coupling to two adjacent protons (n=2, so 2+1=3 peaks).\n    *   A **quartet (q)** arises from coupling to three adjacent protons (n=3, so 3+1=4 peaks).\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This indicates a different proton is being split by:\n    *   A **doublet (d)** from one adjacent proton.\n    *   A **triplet (t)** from two adjacent protons.\n    *   Another **triplet (t)** from a different set of two adjacent protons.\n\n### Evaluating the Candidate Structures\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting patterns for the methine (CH) protons in each candidate molecule.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton on C3 is coupled to the proton on C2 (doublet), the CH₂ of its ethyl group (triplet), and the CH₂ at C4 (triplet). This would produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**, which matches one of the observed signals.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule would give a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq). For instance, the proton on C2 is coupled to the proton on C3 (doublet) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (triplet), resulting in a doublet of triplets (dt). Therefore, this structure is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton on C3 is coupled to the proton on C2 (doublet), the CH₃ on C3 (quartet), and the CH₂ at C4 (triplet). This gives a doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt). This does not match the observed patterns.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton on C3 is coupled to the CH₂ at C2 (triplet), the proton on C4 (doublet), and the CH₃ on C3 (quartet). This gives a triplet of doublets of quartets (tdq). This does not match the observed patterns.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   Let's label the key protons: HOOC-CH₂(a)-CH(b)(Et)-CH(c)(Et)-CH₃\n    *   **Proton H(c) at C4:** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The single proton H(b) at C3, giving a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   The two protons of the CH₂ group in its ethyl substituent, giving a **triplet (t)**.\n        *   The three protons of the terminal CH₃ group at C5, giving a **quartet (q)**.\n        *   This combination results in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**, exactly matching the first signal described.\n    *   **Proton H(b) at C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The single proton H(c) at C4, giving a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   The two protons of the CH₂(a) group at C2, giving a **triplet (t)**.\n        *   The two protons of the CH₂ group in its own ethyl substituent, giving another **triplet (t)**.\n        *   This combination results in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**, exactly matching the second signal described.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe splitting patterns observed in the ¹H NMR spectrum are uniquely consistent with the structure of 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo identify the unknown compound, the provided spectroscopic data must be systematically compared against the expected data for each of the four possible structures.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** The spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹. The broad peak is characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid, which is broadened due to hydrogen bonding. The strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid. Since all four options are carboxylic acids, this data confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds. All four proposed structures are saturated and consistent with this observation.\n    *   **Complex Splitting:** The key to identifying the correct structure lies in the complex splitting patterns described. These patterns arise from a proton being coupled to multiple, non-equivalent neighboring protons. The multiplicity of a signal is determined by the (n+1) rule, where 'n' is the number of equivalent neighboring protons. When a proton is coupled to multiple *sets* of non-equivalent protons, the splitting pattern becomes more complex (e.g., a doublet of triplets).\n\n### Evaluation of Candidate Structures\n\nLet's analyze the expected ¹H NMR splitting patterns for the most substituted protons (the methine, or C-H, protons) in each candidate molecule.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\n*   This molecule has two chiral centers. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the ethyl group would be split by the CH₂ of the ethyl group (triplet), the neighboring C-H (doublet), and the methyl group attached to the same carbon (quartet). This would result in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   However, the other C-H proton (alpha to the COOH group) would be split by its neighboring C-H (doublet) and the adjacent methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This structure does not account for the observed doublet of triplets of triplets.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\n*   This structure has protons on a carbon chain that would lead to different splitting patterns, such as a doublet of septets, but not the specific dtq and dtt combination observed.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\n*   The splitting patterns in this molecule would be complex, but would likely involve quintets due to coupling with CH₂ groups of the ethyl substituents. It would not produce the specific dtq and dtt signals.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\nLet's label the key protons in this structure:\n`CH₃(a)-CH(b)(CH₂CH₃)-CH(c)(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂(d)-COOH`\n\n*   **Proton (b):** This proton is coupled to three distinct sets of neighbors:\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (a) → **quartet**.\n    *   The single proton at position (c) → **doublet**.\n    *   The two protons of the ethyl's CH₂ group → **triplet**.\n    *   Combining these gives a predicted signal of a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal described.\n\n*   **Proton (c):** This proton is also coupled to three distinct sets of neighbors:\n    *   The single proton at position (b) → **doublet**.\n    *   The two protons of the ethyl's CH₂ group attached to the same carbon → **triplet**.\n    *   The two protons of the CH₂ group at position (d) → **triplet**.\n    *   Combining these gives a predicted signal of a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal described.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe splitting patterns observed in the ¹H NMR spectrum, specifically a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets, are uniquely consistent with the structure of **CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo identify the unknown compound, we must analyze the provided spectroscopic data (FTIR and 1H NMR) and match it to one of the four possible structures.\n\n### Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\nThe FTIR data confirms that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. Since all four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, the FTIR data is consistent with all of them. Therefore, we must rely on the 1H NMR data to distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### Analysis of 1H NMR Data\n\nThe key information from the 1H NMR spectrum lies in the complex splitting patterns (multiplicities) of two specific signals:\n1.  A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n2.  A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nThis means we need to find a molecule that has two different protons with these specific environments. Let's analyze the structure of each candidate. The structures provided in options B and C contain a carbon atom with five bonds, which is chemically impossible. Assuming these are typographical errors and the intended structures are the correspondingly named acids, we will proceed with the analysis. The most plausible candidates that could exhibit such complex splitting are C and D due to their multiple chiral centers and varied adjacent groups.\n\nLet's analyze the protons on the carbon backbone for candidates C and D, as these are most likely to exhibit such complex splitting.\n\n#### Candidate D: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)\n\nLet's label the key protons in the structure:\n```\n      H(a)   H(b)\n      |      |\nCH₃(d)-CH₂(c)-CH(b)-CH(a)-COOH\n             |      |\n             CH₃(f) CH₃(e)\n```\n\n*   **Analysis of H(b) at position C3:**\n    *   It is coupled to the single proton **H(a)** at C2, which splits the signal into a **doublet (d)**.\n    *   It is coupled to the two protons of the methylene group **CH₂(c)** at C4, which splits the signal into a **triplet (t)**.\n    *   It is coupled to the three protons of the methyl group **CH₃(f)** attached to C3, which splits the signal into a **quartet (q)**.\n    *   Therefore, the signal for H(b) is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one of the signals described in the problem.\n\n*   **Analysis for a `dtt` signal:**\n    *   A doublet of triplets of triplets requires a proton to be coupled to three different neighboring groups: one with a single proton, one with two protons, and a third with two protons.\n    *   Let's examine other protons in molecule D. The proton H(a) is coupled to H(b) (1H) and the methyl group CH₃(e) (3H), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). The diastereotopic protons of the CH₂(c) group would each be split by H(b) (1H), their geminal partner (1H), and the CH₃(d) group (3H), resulting in a doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq).\n    *   Molecule D does not have a proton environment that would produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n#### Candidate C: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)\n\nLet's label the key protons in the structure:\n```\n      H(a)   H(b)\n      |      |\nCH₃(d)-CH₂(c)-CH(b)-CH(a)-COOH\n             |      |\n           Et(g)  Et(e)  (where Et is -CH₂CH₃)\n```\n\n*   **Analysis of H(b) at position C3:**\n    *   It is coupled to the single proton **H(a)** at C2, which splits the signal into a **doublet (d)**.\n    *   It is coupled to the two protons of the methylene group **CH₂(c)** at C4, which splits the signal into a **triplet (t)**.\n    *   It is coupled to the two protons of the methylene group within the ethyl substituent **Et(g)**, which splits the signal into another **triplet (t)**.\n    *   Therefore, the signal for H(b) is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the other signal described in the problem.\n\n*   **Analysis for a `dtq` signal:**\n    *   A doublet of triplets of quartets requires a proton to be coupled to a single proton, a group of two protons, and a group of three protons.\n    *   Let's examine other protons in molecule C. The proton H(a) is coupled to H(b) (1H) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group Et(e) (2H), resulting in a doublet of triplets (dt). The diastereotopic protons of the various CH₂ groups (at C4, and in each ethyl group) would result in doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq), not a `dtq`.\n    *   Molecule C does not have a proton environment that would produce a `dtq` signal.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on a detailed analysis of the expected 1H NMR splitting patterns:\n*   Molecule **D (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)** is predicted to show a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** for the proton at C3.\n*   Molecule **C (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)** is predicted to show a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** for the proton at C3.\n\nThe problem states that the spectrum of the unknown compound shows *both* of these signals. This indicates that the unknown sample is not a single pure compound but rather a mixture of compound C and compound D. However, since the question asks to identify the compound as one of the options, and each option represents a single compound, there is a flaw in the premise of the question.\n\nIf forced to choose the \"best\" answer or if there is an error in the problem statement where only one of these complex signals is truly present and correctly identified, we cannot definitively select one compound over the other as both are partially supported by the data.\n\nHowever, in multiple-choice questions of this nature, it is common for one of the options to be the intended answer despite potential ambiguities. Given that both complex splitting patterns are explicitly mentioned, and each is uniquely characteristic of one of the molecules (C and D), it is impossible to select a single correct structure from the list provided. If we assume there is a typo and only one of the splitting patterns is correct, we cannot know which one.\n\nGiven the constraints and the detailed analysis, no single option can account for all the provided data. But if we must choose the compound that gives the `dtq` and `dtt` signals, and we have found that D gives the `dtq` and C gives the `dtt`, the question is unanswerable as stated. Let's re-evaluate D as the most likely intended answer, as `dtq` is a very distinct pattern.\n\nLet's assume the question is asking to identify the compound that is **most likely** described, and there might be an error in reporting one of the signals. Both C and D are highly complex molecules that would produce multiple overlapping multiplets. The proton at C3 in molecule D gives a clear `dtq` signal, which is a very specific pattern. The proton at C3 in molecule C gives a clear `dtt` signal. Without further information or clarification, a definitive choice is not possible. However, if a single choice must be made, and acknowledging the ambiguity, we select the structure that provides the first, and arguably more complex, described signal.\n\nLet's reconsider the possibility of both signals in one molecule. The analysis holds that D gives a `dtq` and C gives a `dtt`, but neither gives both. Therefore, the question is flawed. However, in the context of a test, if a choice must be made, there might be an intended answer. Let's assume the question is valid and re-examine D.\n\n**Revisiting D: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\n- H at C3: Coupled to H at C2 (d), CH₂ at C4 (t), CH₃ at C3 (q) -> **dtq**. (Confirmed)\n- Is there any way to get a `dtt`? No proton is adjacent to one H, a CH₂, and another CH₂.\n\nLet's assume the question is about compound D.\n\nFinal consideration: The problem is fundamentally flawed as no single compound listed produces both signals. However, if a single answer must be selected, this is a guess. Let's stick to the most rigorous analysis: D provides the `dtq` and C provides the `dtt`. The question asks for a compound that has both. No such compound is listed. Let's assume the question meant to ask which compound gives a `dtq` signal, pointing towards D.\n\nGiven the options and the detailed analysis, molecule D, 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid, is the only one that produces a doublet of triplets of quartets. Molecule C is the only one that produces a doublet of triplets of triplets. Since the problem states the compound exhibits both, it implies a mixture or a flawed question. If we are forced to choose the structure that gives the most uniquely described and complex signal (`dtq`), D would be a plausible guess.\n\nLet's assume the question is correct and my analysis is wrong. Where could the error be? Perhaps long-range coupling? It's unlikely to be strong enough to create these clean, high-order multiplets. The most straightforward interpretation (1st-order rules) leads to the conclusion that D gives a `dtq` and C gives a `dtt`.\n\nLet's choose D based on the presence of the `dtq` signal.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration. The significant broadness of the peak is characteristic of the O-H group in a carboxylic acid, which participates in strong hydrogen bonding, causing the peak to broaden.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position (around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹) is consistent with the carbonyl group of a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four given options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data is consistent with all of them. We must use the NMR data to distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the complex splitting patterns described. Let's analyze what these patterns mean:\n\n*   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** A proton that shows this splitting pattern must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (giving the **d**oublet, n=1, splits into n+1=2 lines).\n    *   A group of two adjacent protons (giving the **t**riplet, n=2, splits into n+1=3 lines).\n    *   A group of three adjacent protons (giving the **q**uartet, n=3, splits into n+1=4 lines).\n*   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** A proton that shows this splitting pattern must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (giving the **d**oublet, n=1, splits into n+1=2 lines).\n    *   A group of two adjacent protons (giving the first **t**riplet, n=2, splits into n+1=3 lines).\n    *   Another, different group of two adjacent protons (giving the second **t**riplet, n=2, splits into n+1=3 lines).\n\nNow, let's examine the structure of each option to see if its protons would produce these specific splitting patterns. We will focus on the methine (CH) protons, as they are the most likely to have multiple, distinct neighbors.\n\n---\n\n#### **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\n\nLet's label the key protons: `CH₃-CH₂(b)-CH(c)(Et)-CH(d)(Et)-COOH`\n*   **Proton H(c):** It is coupled to H(d) (1H, doublet), the CH₂(b) group (2H, triplet), and the CH₂ of its ethyl substituent (2H, triplet). This gives a **dtt** pattern. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **Proton H(d):** It is coupled to H(c) (1H, doublet) and the CH₂ of its ethyl substituent (2H, triplet). This gives a **dt** pattern.\n*   **Proton H(b):** It is coupled to the CH₃ group (3H, quartet) and H(c) (1H, doublet). This gives a **qd** (quartet of doublets).\n*   **Conclusion for A:** This structure has a `dtt` signal but does not have a `dtq` signal. So, it is incorrect.\n\n---\n\n#### **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\n\nLet's label the key protons: `CH₃(a)-CH(b)(Et)-CH(c)(Et)-CH₂(d)-COOH`\n*   **Proton H(c):** It is coupled to H(b) (1H, doublet), the CH₂(d) group (2H, triplet), and the CH₂ of its ethyl substituent (2H, triplet). This gives a **dtt** (doublet of triplets of triplets) pattern. **This matches one of the required signals.**\n*   **Proton H(b):** It is coupled to H(c) (1H, doublet), the CH₂ of its ethyl substituent (2H, triplet), and the CH₃(a) group (3H, quartet). This gives a **dtq** (doublet of triplets of quartets) pattern. **This matches the other required signal.**\n*   **Conclusion for B:** This structure is predicted to have both a `dtt` signal and a `dtq` signal. This is a perfect match for the experimental data.\n\n---\n\n#### **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\n\nLet's label the key protons: `CH₃-CH₂(b)-CH(c)(Me)-CH(d)(Me)-COOH`\n*   **Proton H(c):** It is coupled to H(d) (1H, doublet), the CH₂(b) group (2H, triplet), and the CH₃ of its methyl substituent (3H, quartet). This gives a **dtq** pattern. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **Proton H(d):** It is coupled to H(c) (1H, doublet) and the CH₃ of its methyl substituent (3H, quartet). This gives a **dq** (doublet of quartets).\n*   **Conclusion for C:** This structure has a `dtq` signal but does not have a `dtt` signal. So, it is incorrect.\n\n---\n\n#### **D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\n\nLet's label the key protons: `CH₃(a)-CH(b)(Me)-CH(c)(Me)-CH₂(d)-COOH`\n*   **Proton H(c):** It is coupled to H(b) (1H, doublet), the CH₂(d) group (2H, triplet), and the CH₃ of its methyl substituent (3H, quartet).

This matches one of the signals.\n*   **Proton H(b):** It is coupled to H(c) (1H, doublet), the CH₃(a) group (3H, quartet), and the CH₃ of its methyl substituent (3H, quartet). This gives a **dqq** (doublet of quartets of quartets).\n*   **Conclusion for D:** This structure has a `dtq` signal but does not have a `dtt` signal.

Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid.

All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group present but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe most discriminating information comes from the proton NMR spectrum, specifically the complex splitting patterns.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four candidate structures are saturated, consistent with this observation.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nWe need to find the structure that has protons which would give rise to *both* of these specific splitting patterns. Let's analyze the splitting for a proton (H) based on its neighbors using the n+1 rule:\n*   **Doublet (d):** 1 neighboring proton (n=1).\n*   **Triplet (t):** 2 equivalent neighboring protons (n=2).\n*   **Quartet (q):** 3 equivalent neighboring protons (n=3).\n\nTherefore:\n*   A **dtq** arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: one proton (d), a set of two equivalent protons (t), and a set of three equivalent protons (q).\n*   A **dtt** arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: one proton (d), a set of two equivalent protons (t), and a second, different set of two equivalent protons (t).\n\nNow, let's analyze the structure of each candidate molecule. The most likely protons to exhibit such complex splitting are the ones on the chiral centers (the `C(H)` groups).\n\n#### **Candidate A: CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\nThis is 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid: `(CH₃)₂CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH`\n*   **H at C3:** Is coupled to H at C4 (1H, gives a doublet), the CH₂ at C2 (2H, gives a triplet), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H, gives a quartet). This proton's signal would be a **dtq**.\n*   **H at C4:** Is coupled to H at C3 (1H, gives a doublet) and the two CH₃ groups on C4 (6H, gives a septet). This signal would be a doublet of septets.\n*   **Result:** This molecule has a `dtq` but does not have a `dtt`. It is not the correct compound.\n\n#### **Candidate B: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\nThis is 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid: `CH₃CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`\n*   **H at C3:** Is coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet), the CH₂ at C4 (2H, triplet), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H, quartet). This signal is a **dtq**.\n*   **H at C2:** Is coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and the CH₃ on C2 (3H, quartet). This signal is a doublet of quartets (dq).\n*   **Result:** This molecule has a `dtq` but does not have a `dtt`. It is not the correct compound.\n\n#### **Candidate C: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\nThis is 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid: `CH₃CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-COOH`\n*   **H at C3:** Is coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet), the CH₂ at C4 (2H, triplet), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C3 (2H, triplet). This signal is a **dtt**.\n*   **H at C2:** Is coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C2 (2H, triplet). This signal is a doublet of triplets (dt).\n*   **Result:** This molecule has a `dtt` but does not have a `dtq`. It is not the correct compound.\n\n#### **Candidate D: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\nThis is 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid: `CH₃-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH`\nLet's analyze the two protons on the chiral centers (C3 and C4).\n*   **H at C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n    *   The H on C4 (1 neighbor) → **doublet**\n    *   The CH₂ group at C2 (2 neighbors) → **triplet**\n    *   The CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2 neighbors) → **triplet**\n    *   The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n\n*   **H at C4:** This proton is coupled to:\n    *   The H on C3 (1 neighbor) → **doublet**\n    *   The CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on C4 (2 neighbors) → **triplet**\n    *   The terminal CH₃ group at C5 (3 neighbors) → **quartet**\n    *   The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the other required signal.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nStructure D is the only candidate that would produce both a doublet of triplets of triplets (from the proton at C3) and a doublet of triplets of quartets (from the proton at C4) in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a systematic analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the correct chemical structure from the given options.\n\n### Step 1: Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.

The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is characteristic of a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four given options are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group is present in all candidates but does not help us differentiate between them.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in interpreting the complex splitting patterns described. A splitting pattern like \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" means a single proton is being split by three different, non-equivalent groups of neighboring protons. We will use the n+1 rule for each coupling.\n\n*   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This signal arises from a proton that is coupled to:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), causing a **doublet** (1+1=2 lines).\n    *   A group of two adjacent protons (n=2), causing a **triplet** (2+1=3 lines).\n    *   A group of three adjacent protons (n=3), causing a **quartet** (3+1=4 lines).\n*   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This signal arises from a proton that is coupled to:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), causing a **doublet** (1+1=2 lines).\n    *   A group of two adjacent protons (n=2), causing a **triplet** (2+1=3 lines).\n    *   Another, different group of two adjacent protons (n=2), causing another **triplet** (2+1=3 lines).\n\n### Step 3: Evaluating the Candidate Structures\n\nLet's examine the protons on the chiral centers (the C-H groups) of each molecule to see if they can produce the observed splitting patterns.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH:** This is 3,4-diethyl-5-methylhexanoic acid. This structure is overly complex and does not fit the pattern of the other options. We can likely disregard it.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    ```\n          H_c  H_b\n          |    |\n    CH₃-CH₂-CH - CH - COOH\n               |    |\n               CH₃  CH₃\n    ```\n    Let's analyze proton **H_c** (on carbon 3):\n    *   It is adjacent to **H_b** on C2 (1 proton) -> **doublet (d)**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the **CH₂** of the ethyl group (2 protons) -> **triplet (t)**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the **CH₃** group on C3 (3 protons) -> **quartet (q)**.\n    *   Combining these, the signal for **H_c** is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This perfectly matches one of the signals described in the problem.\n    *   Now, let's look for the `dtt`. The CH₂ protons of the ethyl group are diastereotopic (because they are adjacent to the C3 chiral center). They split each other (geminal coupling, a doublet) and are split by H_c (a doublet) and the terminal CH₃ (a quartet). This would result in a doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq). A complex 16-line `ddq` can be easily misidentified as an 18-line `dtt` in a real spectrum, especially with overlapping lines or similar coupling constants. This is a very plausible explanation for the observed `dtt`.\n\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    ```\n          H_c      H_b\n          |        |\n    CH₃-CH₂-CH - CH - COOH\n               |    |\n               C₂H₅ C₂H₅\n    ```\n    Let's analyze proton **H_c** (on carbon 3):\n    *   It is adjacent to **H_b** on C2 (1 proton) -> **doublet (d)**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the **CH₂** of the terminal ethyl group (2 protons) -> **triplet (t)**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the **CH₂** of the ethyl group on C3 (2 protons) -> **triplet (t)**.\n    *   Combining these, the signal for **H_c** is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the other signal. However, this molecule has no proton that could produce a `dtq`, as there is no proton coupled simultaneously to groups of 1, 2, and 3 protons.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    ```\n          H_d  H_c\n          |    |\n    CH₃ - CH - CH - CH₂ - COOH\n          |    |\n          CH₃  CH₃\n    ```\n    Let's analyze proton **H_c** (on carbon 3):\n    *   It is adjacent to **H_d** on C4 (1 proton) -> **doublet (d)**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the **CH₂** next to the COOH group (2 protons) -> **triplet (t)**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the **CH₃** group on C3 (3 protons) -> **quartet (q)**.\n    *   This gives a **dtq**. However, this molecule cannot produce a `dtt`. The other chiral proton, H_d, would be a doublet of quartets of quartets (dqq).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nStructure **B** is the only candidate that can definitively produce a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** for one of its protons (H_c). It also contains another complex signal (a `ddq` from the diastereotopic CH₂ protons) that could plausibly be misinterpreted as the reported **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. The other structures can produce one of the signals at best, but not both. Therefore, structure B is the correct identification.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectroscopy**: The presence of a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic indicator of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) group of a carboxylic acid. These two pieces of information strongly suggest the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy**: The ¹H NMR data is crucial for determining the carbon skeleton of the molecule. The absence of signals for vinyl hydrogens confirms that there are no carbon-carbon double bonds, which is consistent with all four proposed structures. The key to solving this problem lies in analyzing the complex splitting patterns.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**: This pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: a single proton (n=1, giving a doublet), a set of two equivalent protons (n=2, giving a triplet), and a set of three equivalent protons (n=3, giving a quartet). The total number of neighboring protons is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**: This pattern occurs when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: a single proton (n=1, giving a doublet), a set of two equivalent protons (n=2, giving a triplet), and another, different set of two equivalent protons (n=2, giving another triplet). The total number of neighboring protons is 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n\n### Evaluation of Potential Structures\n\nLet's analyze the proton environments in each of the candidate molecules to see which one would produce both of these specific splitting patterns. We will label the backbone carbons starting with the carboxyl carbon as C1.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**:\n    *   The proton on C3 is adjacent to the proton on C2 (1H), the CH₂ group at C4 (2H), and its own methyl group (3H). This environment (neighbors of 1H, 2H, and 3H) would produce a **dtq** signal.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule has neighbors consisting of one proton, a group of two protons, and another group of two protons. Thus, it cannot produce a **dtt** signal.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**:\n    *   The proton on C3 is adjacent to the CH₂ group at C2 (2H), the proton on C4 (1H), and its own methyl group (3H). This environment would produce a **dtq** signal.\n    *   Similar to structure B, there is no proton environment that would lead to a **dtt** signal.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**:\n    *   The proton on C3 is adjacent to the proton on C2 (1H), the CH₂ group at C4 (2H), and the CH₂ group of its own ethyl substituent (2H). This environment (neighbors of 1H, 2H, and 2H) would produce a **dtt** signal.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule has the correct set of neighbors (1H, 2H, and 3H) to produce a **dtq** signal.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid)**:\n    *   Let's analyze the protons on the main chain: `CH₃(C6)-CH(C5)(C₂H₅)-CH(C4)(C₂H₅)-CH(C3)₂-COOH(C1)`\n    *   **Proton on C4**: This proton is adjacent to the proton on C5 (1H), the CH₂ group at C3 (2H), and the CH₂ group of its own ethyl substituent (2H). This set of neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H) would result in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   **Proton on C5**: This proton is adjacent to the proton on C4 (1H), the CH₂ group of its own ethyl substituent (2H), and the terminal CH₃ group at C6 (3H). This set of neighbors (1H, 2H, 3H) would result in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly structure A, 3,4-diethylhexanoic acid, has protons in two different locations that perfectly match the described complex splitting patterns of both a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) and a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound:\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid that is undergoing hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n\nBoth pieces of FTIR data strongly indicate that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid.

All four proposed structures are saturated and lack C=C bonds, which is consistent with this information.\n    *   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**: This complex splitting pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   A \"doublet\" implies coupling to **one** adjacent proton (n=1, n+1=2).\n        *   A \"triplet\" implies coupling to **two** equivalent adjacent protons (n=2, n+1=3).\n        *   A \"quartet\" implies coupling to **three** equivalent adjacent protons (n=3, n+1=4).\n    *   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**: This pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   A \"doublet\" implies coupling to **one** adjacent proton (n=1, n+1=2).\n        *   A \"triplet\" implies coupling to **two** equivalent adjacent protons (n=2, n+1=3).\n        *   Another \"triplet\" implies coupling to another set of **two** non-equivalent adjacent protons (n=2, n+1=3).\n\n### Analysis of the Candidate Structures\n\nLet's analyze the proton environments in each proposed structure to see if they can produce the observed splitting patterns. We will focus on the methine (C-H) protons on the chiral centers, as they are most likely to exhibit such complex splitting.\n\n*   **B) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Let's analyze the proton on carbon 3 (C3-H): `CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)COOH`.\n    *   This proton is adjacent to:\n        1.  The `CH2` group of the ethyl chain (2 protons) -> would cause a **triplet**.\n        2.  The `CH` proton on carbon 2 (1 proton) -> would cause a **doublet**.\n        3.  The `CH3` group attached to carbon 3 (3 protons) -> would cause a **quartet**.\n    *   Therefore, the C3-H proton would show a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one of the signals. However, there is no proton in this molecule that is adjacent to one proton and two different CH2 groups, so a `dtt` signal is not possible.\n\n*   **C) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Let's analyze the proton on carbon 3 (C3-H): `CH3CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2COOH`.\n    *   This proton is adjacent to:\n        1.  The `CH` proton on carbon 4 (1 proton) -> would cause a **doublet**.\n        2.  The `CH3` group attached to carbon 3 (3 protons) -> would cause a **quartet**.\n        3.  The `CH2` group adjacent to the carboxyl group (2 protons) -> would cause a **triplet**.\n    *   Therefore, the C3-H proton would show a **doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**. This also matches the first signal. Similar to structure B, there is no proton environment that would produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **D) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Let's analyze the proton on carbon 3 (C3-H): `CH3CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)COOH`.\n    *   This proton is adjacent to:\n        1.  The `CH` proton on carbon 2 (1 proton) -> would cause a **doublet**.\n        2.  The `CH2` group of the main chain's ethyl group (2 protons) -> would cause a **triplet**.\n        3.  The `CH2` group of the ethyl substituent on carbon 3 (2 protons) -> would cause another **triplet**.\n    *   Therefore, the C3-H proton would show a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal described.\n    *   Now let's check for a `dtq`. A `dtq` requires a proton to be adjacent to a CH, a CH2, and a CH3 group. No such proton exists in this molecule. The other complex signals would be from the diastereotopic CH2 protons, which would likely appear as quartets of doublets of doublets (`qdd`), not a `dtq`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThere appears to be a contradiction in the problem statement, as none of the single structures (B, C, or D) can produce *both* a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal.\n*   Structures B and C can produce a `dtq` but not a `dtt`.\n*   Structure D can produce a `dtt` but not a `dtq`.\n\nHowever, in a forced-choice scenario, we must select the best possible answer. Structure D is the only one capable of producing the highly specific and less common \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" pattern. The other signal, a \"doublet of triplets of quartets,\" might be a misinterpretation of another complex multiplet present in structure D, such as a \"quartet of doublets of doublets\" (`qdd`), which arises from the diastereotopic methylene protons in the ethyl groups. Given that the `dtt` is unambiguously produced by structure D and only structure D, it is the most plausible intended answer, assuming an error in the description of the second signal. The structure for option A is ambiguous and its molecular formula (C10H20O2) is inconsistent with a logical interpretation of its condensed notation (C9H18O2).\n\nTherefore, based on the presence of the unique `dtt` signal, structure D is the most likely candidate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound.\n\n### 1. Analyze the FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules. This peak typically spans from about 2500 to 3300 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. For a carboxylic acid, this peak usually appears between 1700 and 1725 cm⁻¹.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the choices.\n\n### 2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated alkanoic acids, which is consistent with this observation.\n*   **A signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This is a complex splitting pattern. For a proton to show this pattern, it must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), giving a doublet (n+1=2).\n    *   Two adjacent protons (n=2), giving a triplet (n+1=3).\n    *   Three adjacent protons (n=3), giving a quartet (n+1=4).\n    The set of neighboring protons is {1H, 2H, 3H}.\n*   **A different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** For a proton to show this pattern, it must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), giving a doublet (n+1=2).\n    *   Two adjacent protons (n=2), giving a triplet (n+1=3).\n    *   Another group of two adjacent protons (n=2), giving another triplet (n+1=3).\n    The set of neighboring protons is {1H, 2H, 2H}.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Candidate Structure\n\nWe need to find the structure that has one proton with {1H, 2H, 3H} neighbors AND another proton with {1H, 2H, 2H} neighbors. Let's analyze the protons on the carbon backbone for each option, as these are the most likely to have such complex splitting.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`HOOC-CH(b)(Et)-CH(c)(Et)-CH₂(f)-CH₃(g)`\n*   Proton **H(c)** is coupled to H(b) (1H), the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H), and the CH₂(f) of the pentanoic chain (2H). Neighbors = {1H, 2H, 2H}. This gives a **dtt** signal.\n*   No proton in this molecule has a {1H, 2H, 3H} neighbor set. For example, H(b) has neighbors {1H, 2H}. Thus, there is no `dtq` signal.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`HOOC-CH₂(b)-CH(c)(Me)-CH(d)(Me)-CH₃(e)`\n*   Proton **H(c)** is coupled to CH₂(b) (2H), H(d) (1H), and the methyl group CH₃ (3H). Neighbors = {1H, 2H, 3H}. This gives a **dtq** (or tdq) signal.\n*   No proton in this molecule has a {1H, 2H, 2H} neighbor set. For example, H(d) has neighbors {1H, 3H, 3H}. Thus, there is no `dtt` signal.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid**\n`HOOC-CH₂(b)-CH(c)(Me)-CH(d)(Me)-CH₂(e)-CH₃(f)`\n*   Proton **H(d)** is coupled to H(c) (1H), CH₂(e) (2H), and its methyl group (3H). Neighbors = {1H, 2H, 3H}. This gives a **dtq** signal.\n*   Proton **H(c)** is also coupled to H(d) (1H), CH₂(b) (2H), and its methyl group (3H). Neighbors = {1H, 2H, 3H}. This gives another **dtq** signal.\n*   There is no proton with a {1H, 2H, 2H} neighbor set. Thus, there is no `dtt` signal.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\nStructure:\n```\n           Et(f)          Et(h)\n           |              |\n(a)CH₃ -- CH(b) -- CH(c) -- CH₂(d) -- COOH\n```\n*   Let's analyze proton **H(b)** (on C4):\n    *   It is adjacent to **CH₃(a)** (3 protons) → gives a quartet.\n    *   It is adjacent to **H(c)** (1 proton) → gives a doublet.\n    *   It is adjacent to the **CH₂** of its ethyl group **Et(h)** (2 protons) → gives a triplet.\n    *   The neighbors of H(b) are {1H, 2H, 3H}. This proton will show a **dtq** (doublet of triplets of quartets) signal. This matches the data.\n\n*   Now let's analyze proton **H(c)** (on C3):\n    *   It is adjacent to **H(b)** (1 proton) → gives a doublet.\n    *   It is adjacent to the **CH₂(d)** group (2 protons) → gives a triplet.\n    *   It is adjacent to the **CH₂** of its ethyl group **Et(f)** (2 protons) → gives another triplet.\n    *   The neighbors of H(c) are {1H, 2H, 2H}. This proton will show a **dtt** (doublet of triplets of triplets) signal. This also matches the data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMolecule D, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, is the only structure that contains a proton (H_b) that would produce a `dtq` signal and a different proton (H_c) that would produce a `dtt` signal. Therefore, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nAfter a thorough analysis of the provided spectroscopic data and the candidate structures, the correct compound can be identified.\n\n### Spectroscopic Analysis\n\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy**: The presence of a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carboxylic acid functional group (COOH). The broadness of the 3000 cm⁻¹ peak is due to the hydrogen bonding of the O-H group, and the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch. All four possible compounds are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy**: The problem states that there are no signals corresponding to vinyl hydrogens, which is consistent with all four structures as they are all saturated alkanoic acids. The key to identifying the correct structure lies in the complex splitting patterns observed. A signal is described as a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**, and another as a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\n### Analysis of Candidate Structures\n\nTo produce a specific splitting pattern, a proton must be coupled to a precise number of neighboring non-equivalent protons.\n*   A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** means a proton is coupled to one proton (giving the doublet), a group of two equivalent protons (giving the triplet), and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet). This proton has a total of 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 neighboring protons.\n*   A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** implies a proton is coupled to one proton (doublet), a group of two equivalent protons (first triplet), and another distinct group of two equivalent protons (second triplet). This proton has a total of 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 neighboring protons.\n\nLet's analyze the structures based on these requirements:\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**: The proton at the C3 position is coupled to the proton at C2 (1H, doublet), the two protons of the ethyl's CH₂ group (2H, triplet), and the three protons of the methyl group on C3 (3H, quartet). This proton would indeed show a **dtq** signal. However, this molecule lacks a proton with the required five neighbors (split into groups of 1, 2, and 2) to produce a dtt signal.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**: The proton at the C3 position is coupled to the proton at C4 (1H, doublet), the two protons of the CH₂ group at C2 (2H, triplet), and the three protons of the methyl group at C3 (3H, quartet). This would also produce a **dtq** signal. Similar to option B, this molecule does not have a proton environment that would lead to a dtt signal.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**: The proton at the C3 position is coupled to the proton at C2 (1H, doublet), the two protons of the CH₂ group at C4 (2H, triplet), and the two protons of the CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent at C3 (2H, triplet). This proton's signal would be a **dtt**. However, this molecule does not possess a proton with the six required neighbors (1, 2, and 3) to generate a dtq signal. The other methine proton (H-2) and the various diastereotopic methylene protons would lead to other complex signals like doublet of triplets (dt) or doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq), but not a dtq.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid)**: Let's analyze the protons on the main chain.\n    *   The proton at the C4 position is coupled to the proton at C3 (1H, doublet), the two protons of the CH₂ group at C5 (2H, triplet), and the two protons of the CH₂ of the ethyl group attached to C4 (2H, triplet). This creates a **dtt** signal.\n    *   Now, let's examine the protons on the CH₂ group at position 5 (`-CH₂-CH₃`). These two protons are diastereotopic (chemically non-equivalent) due to the adjacent chiral center at C4. Let's consider one of them. It is coupled to its geminal partner (1H, doublet), the proton at C4 (1H, doublet), and the three protons of the terminal methyl group (3H, quartet). This would result in a doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq), not a dtq.\n\nThere appears to be a contradiction, as no single structure seems to produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` based on a standard first-order analysis. However, in complex molecules, predicting exact splitting patterns can be difficult. It's possible that in one of the molecules, a combination of chiral centers leads to unexpected equivalences or long-range couplings that produce the observed patterns.\n\nRevisiting the most complex structures, A and D, they are the only ones with enough methylene groups to plausibly generate a dtt signal. Between the options that can generate a `dtq` (B and C) and those that can generate a `dtt` (A and D), there must be a correct choice. Given the complexity, let's reconsider the structure from option A. The problem lists two signals, a `dtq` and a `dtt`. It is the only structure that is complex enough to potentially exhibit both through more subtle effects, and it definitively has a proton environment (`dtt`) that is impossible in B and C. If we are forced to choose the best fit, **A** is the only one that contains the necessary structural elements for both complex patterns, even if the dtq is not immediately obvious from a simple analysis. The combination of multiple chiral centers and flexible ethyl chains in compound A makes it the most likely candidate to exhibit such complex and varied splitting patterns.\n\nUpon re-evaluating C: `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH`, H-3 is coupled to H-4 (1H), the C2-`CH2` (2H), and the C3-`CH3` (3H). This is a clean **dtq**. Let's reconsider H-4. It is coupled to H-3 (1H), the C4-`CH3` (3H), and the C5-`CH3` (3H). This would be a doublet of quartets of quartets (dqq), not a dtt. Therefore, based on the clear presence of a `dtq` and the lack of a clear `dtt` in other molecules, and the presence of a clear `dtt` in molecule A, there might be an error in the problem description or one of the provided structures. However, among the choices, `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH` provides the clearest example of a proton with a `dtq` splitting pattern.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the question and only one of the splitting patterns is the key identifier.\n- If the key is the `dtq`, the answer could be B or C.\n- If the key is the `dtt`, the answer could be A or D.\n\nLet's assume the question is correct and both patterns exist. We must find the molecule that can support both. As argued above, H-3 in molecule C (`CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH`) is a clear `dtq`. While a `dtt` is not immediately apparent, this structure is less complex than A or D. A definitive assignment without ambiguity is difficult. However, let's re-examine the splitting pattern description. A \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" is less common than a \"doublet of triplets of quartets\". It is possible that the \"dtt\" is a misinterpretation of a more complex multiplet. The `dtq` in structure C is textbook. No other structure presents such a clear `dtq` while also being plausible.\n\nLet's choose the structure with the most certain match.\nStructure C, `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH`, has a proton at C-3 which is coupled to H-4 (1H, gives a doublet), the CH2 group at C-2 (2H, gives a triplet), and the methyl group on C-3 (3H, gives a quartet). This proton signal is unambiguously a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq). While the origin of the dtt signal is not obvious in this structure, the presence of the dtq is certain. None of the other molecules provide such a clear origin for both described signals.\n\nFinal decision leans towards the most unambiguous assignment. The H-3 proton in molecule C perfectly matches the `dtq` description.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is my step-by-step thinking process to identify the correct compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but doesn't distinguish between the isomers.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   The problem states there are no vinyl-hydrogens, which means no C=C double bonds. This is consistent with all four saturated structures.\n    *   The key information lies in the splitting patterns (multiplicity) of two specific signals:\n        *   Signal 1: A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This means a single proton is coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons: one group with 1 proton (giving the doublet), one group with 2 protons (giving the triplet), and one group with 3 protons (giving the quartet).\n        *   Signal 2: A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This means a single proton is coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons: one group with 1 proton (giving the doublet), one group with 2 protons (giving a triplet), and another different group with 2 protons (giving the second triplet).\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Candidate Structure:**\n    I will now analyze the protons on the carbon backbone of each molecule to see if they can produce these specific splitting patterns. I will focus on the methine (CH) protons, as they are most likely to have multiple different neighbors.\n\n    *   **A) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid):**\n        Let's label the key protons: `CH3-CH2-CH(c)(C2H5)-CH(f)(C2H5)-COOH`\n        *   Proton H(f): Coupled to H(c) (1H, doublet) and the adjacent CH2 of its ethyl group (2H, triplet).

So, A is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n        Let's label the key protons: `CH3(a)-CH(b)(C2H5)-CH(e)(C2H5)-CH2(h)-COOH`\n        *   Proton H(b): Coupled to the terminal CH3(a) group (3H, quartet), the adjacent H(e) proton (1H, doublet), and the adjacent CH2 of its ethyl group (2H, triplet).

This matches the first signal.\n        *   Proton H(e): Coupled to the adjacent H(b) proton (1H, doublet), the adjacent CH2(h) group (2H, triplet), and the adjacent CH2 of its ethyl group (2H, triplet). The neighbors are [1H, 2H, 2H]. This gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal.\n        *   Since this molecule has protons that produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt`, it is a perfect match for the data.\n\n    *   **C) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n        Let's label the key protons: `CH3CH2-CH(c)(CH3)-CH(e)(CH3)-COOH`\n        *   Proton H(c): Coupled to H(e) (1H, doublet), the adjacent CH2 on the main chain (2H, triplet), and the adjacent CH3 group (3H, quartet).

The significant broadening is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group is correct but does not help distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Data\n\nThe most crucial information for distinguishing between the isomers lies in the proton NMR splitting patterns. We are given two specific, complex splitting patterns for two different protons in the molecule.\n\n*   **No vinyl hydrogens:** This confirms the compound is saturated (contains no C=C double bonds), which is consistent with all four options.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a **doublet** (n+1 = 2).\n    *   Two neighboring protons (n=2), causing a **triplet** (n+1 = 3).\n    *   Three neighboring protons (n=3), causing a **quartet** (n+1 = 4).\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This means a different proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a **doublet** (n+1 = 2).\n    *   Two neighboring protons (n=2), causing a **triplet** (n+1 = 3).\n    *   Another, different set of two neighboring protons (n=2), causing a second **triplet** (n+1 = 3).\n\nOur task is to find the single structure among the options that contains protons matching both of these complex splitting patterns. We will analyze the methine protons (CH groups) on the main carbon chain, as they are most likely to exhibit such complex splitting.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Proposed Structure\n\nLet's draw each structure and analyze the expected splitting for its key protons. We will number the carbon chain starting from the COOH group as C1.\n\n**A) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH -> 3,4-Dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH3(5)-CH(4)(CH3)-CH(3)(CH3)-CH2(2)-COOH(1)`\n*   **Proton at C3 (H-3):** Coupled to H-2 (2 protons, triplet), H-4 (1 proton, doublet), and the C3-methyl (3 protons, quartet). This gives a **dtq**. This structure has one of the required signals.\n*   **Proton at C4 (H-4):** Coupled to H-3 (1 proton, doublet) and the two methyl groups attached to it (6 protons total, likely a septet). This would be a doublet of septets.\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure A has a `dtq` but not a `dtt`.\n\n**B) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH -> 2,3-Dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH3(5)-CH2(4)-CH(3)(CH3)-CH(2)(CH3)-COOH(1)`\n*   **Proton at C3 (H-3):** Coupled to H-2 (1 proton, doublet), H-4 (2 protons, triplet), and the C3-methyl (3 protons, quartet). This gives a **dtq**. This structure has one of the required signals.\n*   **Proton at C2 (H-2):** Coupled to H-3 (1 proton, doublet) and the C2-methyl (3 protons, quartet). This gives a doublet of quartets (`dq`).\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure B has a `dtq` but not a `dtt`.\n\n**D) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH -> 3,4-Diethylhexanoic acid**\n`CH3(6)-CH2(5)-CH(4)(C2H5)-CH(3)(C2H5)-COOH(1)`\n*   **Proton at C4 (H-4):** Coupled to H-3 (1 proton, doublet), H-5 (2 protons, triplet), and the CH2 of its ethyl group (2 protons, triplet). This gives a **dtt**. This structure has one of the required signals.\n*   **Proton at C3 (H-3):** Coupled to H-4 (1 proton, doublet) and the CH2 of its ethyl group (2 protons, triplet). This gives a doublet of triplets (`dt`).\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure D has a `dtt` but not a `dtq`.\n\n**C) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH -> 3,4-Diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH3(5)-CH(4)(C2H5)-CH(3)(C2H5)-CH2(2)-COOH(1)`\n\nLet's analyze the two key methine protons, H-3 and H-4.\n\n*   **Proton at C4 (H-4):**\n    *   It is adjacent to the methine proton at C3 (1 proton) -> gives a **doublet**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the CH3 group at C5 (3 protons) -> gives a **quartet**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the CH2 group of the ethyl substituent on C4 (2 protons) -> gives a **triplet**.\n    *   Combining these, the signal for H-4 will be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first required signal.\n\n*   **Proton at C3 (H-3):**\n    *   It is adjacent to the methine proton at C4 (1 proton) -> gives a **doublet**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the CH2 group at C2 (2 protons) -> gives a **triplet**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the CH2 group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2 protons) -> gives another **triplet**.\n    *   Combining these, the signal for H-3 will be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second required signal.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure C is the only candidate that contains a proton (H-4) that produces a `dtq` signal AND a different proton (H-3) that produces a `dtt` signal.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nThe FTIR data confirms a carboxylic acid. The 1H NMR splitting patterns are the deciding factor. Only structure C, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, has two different methine protons whose neighboring environments perfectly match the requirements to produce one `doublet of triplets of quartets` signal and one `doublet of triplets of triplets` signal.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers. We must use the ¹H NMR data for this.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in analyzing the complex splitting patterns (multiplicities) described. We need to find the structure that would produce both a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** and a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\nLet's break down what these multiplicities mean according to the n+1 rule:\n*   **Doublet (d):** The proton is coupled to 1 neighboring proton.\n*   **Triplet (t):** The proton is coupled to 2 equivalent neighboring protons (like a CH₂ group).\n*   **Quartet (q):** The proton is coupled to 3 equivalent neighboring protons (like a CH₃ group).\n*   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** The proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: one proton (giving the doublet), a CH₂ group (giving the triplet), and a CH₃ group (giving the quartet).\n*   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** The proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: one proton (giving the doublet), a CH₂ group (giving a triplet), and a second, different CH₂ group (giving another triplet).\n\nNow, let's analyze the expected splitting patterns for the methine (CH) protons in each candidate molecule. We will number the carbon chain starting from the COOH group as carbon 1.\n\n---\n\n#### **Candidate A: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\nThis structure is **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n```\n         Et      Et\n         |       |\nCH₃(5)CH₂(4)-C(H)₃-C(H)₂-COOH(1)\n```\n*   **H₃:** Is coupled to H₂ (1H, doublet), H₄ (2H, triplet), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, triplet).

This signal would be a **doublet of quartets of quartets (dqq)**.\n*   **H₃:** Is coupled to H₄ (1H, doublet), the CH₂ group at C2 (2H, triplet), and the methyl group on C3 (3H, quartet). This signal would be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   **Result:** This structure provides a `dtq` but also a `dqq`, not the required `dtt`. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n---\n\n#### **Candidate D: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\nThis structure is **2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n```\n         Me      Me\n         |       |\nCH₃(5)CH₂(4)-C(H)₃-C(H)₂-COOH(1)\n```\n*   **H₃:** Is coupled to H₂ (1H, doublet), the CH₂ group at C4 (2H, triplet), and the methyl group on C3 (3H, quartet). This signal would be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n*   **H₂:** Is coupled to H₃ (1H, doublet) and the methyl group on C2 (3H, quartet). This signal would be a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n*   **Result:** This structure provides a `dtq` but not a `dtt`. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOnly the structure corresponding to **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH** (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid) correctly predicts the presence of both a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nTo identify the unknown compound, the provided spectroscopic data must be matched with one of the four possible chemical structures.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid.

This combination results in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   The proton **H(e)** is coupled to three neighbors: H(b) (1H, creating a doublet), the adjacent CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, creating a triplet), and the CH₂ group alpha to the carbonyl (2H, creating another triplet).

The broadness is a result of hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch, and its position is consistent with that of a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n\nThe FTIR data strongly suggest that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. Since all four possible options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n\nThe ¹H NMR data provides the key details needed to determine the carbon skeleton. We are looking for a molecule that shows two specific complex splitting patterns for two different proton signals.\n\n1.  **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    This complex splitting, also called a multiplet, arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Indicates coupling to one adjacent proton (-CH).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Indicates coupling to two adjacent, equivalent protons (-CH₂).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** Indicates coupling to three adjacent, equivalent protons (-CH₃).\n\n2.  **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    This pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Indicates coupling to one adjacent proton (-CH).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Indicates coupling to two adjacent, equivalent protons (-CH₂).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Indicates coupling to another, different set of two adjacent, equivalent protons (-CH₂).\n\n### **Evaluating the Candidate Structures**\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting for the key protons (the ones on the main carbon chain) in each molecule.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   This structure contains a proton that is coupled to one methine (-CH) and two different methylene (-CH₂) groups. This would produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**, matching the second signal.\n    *   However, there is no proton in this molecule that is adjacent to a methyl (-CH₃), a methylene (-CH₂), and a methine (-CH) group simultaneously. Therefore, it cannot produce a doublet of triplets of quartets.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   This structure has a proton (at C3) that is adjacent to a methine (-CH), a methylene (-CH₂), and a methyl (-CH₃) group. This would result in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**, matching the first signal.\n    *   However, it does not have any proton that is adjacent to one methine and two different methylene groups. Therefore, it cannot produce a doublet of triplets of triplets.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   **Proton at C4**: This proton is adjacent to a methine (H at C3), a methyl group (at C5), and the methylene group of the ethyl substituent at C4. This environment leads to coupling with one proton (doublet), three protons (quartet), and two protons (triplet). This perfectly matches the **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** signal.\n    *   **Proton at C3**: This proton is adjacent to a methine (H at C4), the methylene group in the main chain (at C2), and the methylene group of the ethyl substituent at C3. This environment leads to coupling with one proton (doublet), two protons (triplet), and another set of two protons (triplet). This perfectly matches the **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** signal.\n    *   This molecule is the only candidate that satisfies both ¹H NMR signal descriptions.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   This structure has a proton (at C3) that would give a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   However, the proton at C4 is coupled to a methine and two methyl groups, which would result in a doublet of quartets of quartets, not a doublet of triplets of triplets.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of both FTIR and ¹H NMR data, only compound C, CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH, is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nThe problem asks to identify an unknown compound from four possible structures based on its FTIR and 1H NMR spectra.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data\n\n*   **A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.

All four given structures are saturated, consistent with this information.\n*   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex splitting pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** The proton is coupled to one adjacent proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** The proton is coupled to two adjacent protons (a CH₂ group, n=2).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** The proton is coupled to three adjacent protons (a CH₃ group, n=3).\n    Therefore, the proton giving the `dtq` signal must be bonded to a carbon that is adjacent to a CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group.\n*   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern arises from a proton coupled to three different sets of neighbors:\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Coupled to one adjacent proton (a CH group, n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Coupled to two adjacent protons (a CH₂ group, n=2).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Coupled to another, different set of two adjacent protons (another CH₂ group, n=2).\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Structures\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting for the key protons (the methine, -CH-, protons) in each structure.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is adjacent to the C4-H (1H), the C2-CH₂ (2H), and the C3-CH₃ (3H). This would result in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   However, there is no proton in this molecule that is adjacent to one CH group and two separate CH₂ groups, so a `dtt` signal is not possible.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid):**\n    *   Let's analyze the proton at C4: `Et-CH(at C4)(Et)-CH(at C3)(Et)-COOH`. This proton is adjacent to the C3-H (1H), the CH₂ of the main-chain ethyl group (2H), and the CH₂ of the ethyl substituent on C4 (2H). This proton would show a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches Signal 2.\n    *   However, for a `dtq` signal, a proton needs to be adjacent to a methyl group. None of the methine (CH) protons in this molecule are adjacent to a methyl group. The methylene (CH₂) protons are adjacent to methyl groups, but their splitting pattern would be a doublet of doublets of quartets (`ddq`), not a `dtq`.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH:** The chemical formula for this structure is C₁₀H₂₀O₂, but the written structure is ambiguous and does not easily conform to standard valency rules. It is likely an erroneous representation.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   Let's label the key protons: `CH₃-CH₂-CHᵃ(CH₃)-CHᵇ(CH₃)-COOH`.\n    *   **Proton Hᵃ (at C3):** This proton is adjacent to the C2 proton Hᵇ (1H), the CH₂ group of the ethyl chain (2H), and the methyl group at C3 (3H). According to the n+1 rule for complex splitting, its signal would be a **doublet** (from Hᵇ), a **triplet** (from the CH₂), and a **quartet** (from the CH₃). This gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**, a perfect match for Signal 1.\n    *   **Proton Hᵇ (at C2):** This proton is adjacent to the C3 proton Hᵃ (1H), the methyl group at C2 (3H), and the carboxylic acid proton (1H). Coupling to the COOH proton is often suppressed, but if it occurs, the signal would be a doublet of quartets of doublets (`dqd`). If it does not occur, it would be a doublet of quartets (`dq`). Neither of these patterns is a `dtt`. There is no proton in this molecule that could produce a `dtt` signal as it lacks a proton neighbored by two different CH₂ groups.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThere is a contradiction in the provided spectral data, as no single molecule from the options perfectly explains both the `dtq` and the `dtt` signals based on standard first-order splitting rules.\n*   Molecule **D** provides a perfect explanation for the **dtq** signal.\n*   Molecule **B** provides a perfect explanation for the **dtt** signal.\n\nHowever, we must select the best possible answer. The `dtq` signal explicitly requires coupling to a methyl group (to produce the quartet). Molecule D has methyl groups appropriately positioned on the chiral carbons (C2 and C3). Molecule B lacks methyl groups on the relevant methine carbons. Therefore, molecule D is the only one of the plausible structures that can produce the `dtq` signal as described. It is most likely that the second signal (`dtt`) is a misinterpretation of a different complex multiplet present in molecule D (like a `dqd`), which can occur in molecules with multiple chiral centers. Given the unambiguous origin of the `dtq` signal in molecule D, it stands as the most plausible candidate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic spectroscopic feature for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is typical for the carbonyl group within a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group present but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n### **2. Analysis of 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four given structures are saturated alkanoic acids, which is consistent with this observation.\n*   **Key Splitting Patterns:** The most distinctive information comes from the complex splitting patterns (multiplets) described:\n    *   One signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   A different signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\nTo understand these patterns, let's break down what they mean in terms of neighboring protons according to the n+1 rule:\n*   **Doublet (d):** The proton is coupled to 1 adjacent proton (a CH group).\n*   **Triplet (t):** The proton is coupled to 2 equivalent adjacent protons (a CH₂ group).\n*   **Quartet (q):** The proton is coupled to 3 equivalent adjacent protons (a CH₃ group).\n\nTherefore:\n*   A proton that appears as a **dtq** must be a single proton (a CH methine group) that has three distinct neighboring groups: another CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group.\n*   A proton that appears as a **dtt** must be a single proton (a CH methine group) that has three distinct neighboring groups: another CH group and two different CH₂ groups.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Each Proposed Structure**\n\nNow, let's examine each of the four possible structures to see if its protons would produce these specific splitting patterns. We will use IUPAC names for clarity.\n\n**A) `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`**\nThis condensed formula represents **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\nLet's draw and label the structure for analysis (numbering from the COOH group):\n```\n        CH₂-CH₃ (from C4-ethyl)\n        |\n(5)CH₃-CH(4)-CH(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)\n             |\n             CH₂-CH₃ (from C3-ethyl)\n```\n*   **Proton on C3 (H-3):** This proton is on a chiral center. Its neighbors are:\n    *   The CH₂ group at C2 (2 protons → gives a **triplet**).\n    *   The CH group at C4 (1 proton → gives a **doublet**).\n    *   The CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2 protons → gives a **triplet**).\n    Therefore, the signal for H-3 will be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n\n*   **Proton on C4 (H-4):** This proton is also on a chiral center. Its neighbors are:\n    *   The CH group at C3 (1 proton → gives a **doublet**).\n    *   The CH₃ group at C5 (3 protons → gives a **quartet**).\n    *   The CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on C4 (2 protons → gives a **triplet**).\n    Therefore, the signal for H-4 will be a **doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**. This is a permutation of `dtq` and arises from the same set of neighbors (CH, CH₂, CH₃). The order of the letters (d, q, t) depends on the relative magnitudes of the coupling constants (J-values), but the multiplicity and the neighbors are correct. This matches the other observed signal.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** Structure A is consistent with having both a `dtt` signal and a `dtq`-type signal.\n\n**B) `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH`**\nThis is **2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   **H-3:** Neighbors are H-2 (CH), H-4 (CH₂), and the C3-methyl (CH₃). This gives a **dtq** signal.\n*   **H-2:** Neighbors are H-3 (CH) and the C2-methyl (CH₃). This gives a doublet of quartets (dq).\nThis structure has a `dtq` signal but lacks a `dtt` signal.\n\n**C) `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH`**\nThis is **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   **H-3:** Neighbors are H-2 (CH), H-4 (CH₂), and the C3-ethyl (CH₂). This gives a **dtt** signal.\n*   **H-2:** Neighbors are H-3 (CH) and the C2-ethyl (CH₂). This gives a doublet of triplets (dt).\nThis structure has a `dtt` signal but lacks a `dtq` signal.\n\n**D) `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH`**\nThis is **3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   **H-3:** Neighbors are H-2 (CH₂), H-4 (CH), and the C3-methyl (CH₃). This gives a **tdq** (or `dtq`-type) signal.\n*   **H-4:** Neighbors are H-3 (CH) and the two C4-methyl groups (6 protons). This gives a doublet of septets (ds).\nThis structure has a `dtq`-type signal but lacks a `dtt` signal.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly structure **A (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)** has two different methine (CH) protons that match the described NMR splitting patterns: one proton (H-3) gives a `dtt` signal, and another proton (H-4) gives a `dqt` (or `dtq`) signal. Therefore, the unknown compound is the one represented by formula A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the region of 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretching in a carboxylic acid that is undergoing hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** A strong, sharp peak around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) bond stretching, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible options (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH), so this information confirms the functional group but does not help differentiate between the choices.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\nThe key to solving this problem lies in analyzing the complex splitting patterns described. The multiplicity of a signal is determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons according to the n+1 rule. When a proton is coupled to multiple, different sets of neighboring protons, it results in complex splitting (a multiplet of multiplets).\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   This means the proton giving rise to this signal is coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Coupled to **one** neighboring proton (1+1=2).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Coupled to **two** neighboring protons (2+1=3).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** Coupled to **three** neighboring protons (3+1=4).\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton (let's call it Hx) with the following neighbors: a CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group. `(CH)-CHx-(CH₂)-(CH₃)`\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   This means a different proton in the molecule is also coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Coupled to **one** neighboring proton.\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Coupled to **two** neighboring protons.\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Coupled to another, different set of **two** neighboring protons.\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton (let's call it Hy) with the following neighbors: a CH group and two different CH₂ groups. `(CH)-CHy-(CH₂)-(CH₂)`\n\n**3. Evaluating the Candidate Structures**\n\nLet's examine the protons on the chiral centers (the `C(H)` carbons) for each molecule, as they will have the most complex splitting.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH:**\n    *   Proton at C3 (`-CH(CH₃)-CH₂COOH`): Coupled to H at C4 (d), CH₂ at C2 (t), and its own CH₃ (q). This gives a **dtq**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   Proton at C4 (`-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-`): Coupled to H at C3 (d) and two different CH₃ groups (q and q). This does not give a dtt.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH:**\n    Let's draw the main chain and label the key protons Ha and Hb.\n    ```\n          Ha    Hb\n          |     |\n    CH₃ - C  -  C  - CH₂(c) - COOH\n          |     |\n        C₂H₅(d) C₂H₅(e)\n    ```\n    *   **Proton Ha:**\n        *   Coupled to **Hb** (1H) → doublet (d)\n        *   Coupled to the adjacent **CH₃** group (3H) → quartet (q)\n        *   Coupled to the **CH₂** of its ethyl group (C₂H₅(d)) (2H) → triplet (t)\n        *   The resulting signal for Ha is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   **Proton Hb:**\n        *   Coupled to **Ha** (1H) → doublet (d)\n        *   Coupled to the adjacent **CH₂(c)** group (2H) → triplet (t)\n        *   Coupled to the **CH₂** of its ethyl group (C₂H₅(e)) (2H) → triplet (t)\n        *   The resulting signal for Hb is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches Signal 2.\n    *   **This molecule exhibits both required splitting patterns.**\n\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH:**\n    *   Proton at C3 (`-CH₂(b)-CHa(C₂H₅)-`): Coupled to Hb (d), CH₂ at C4 (t), and CH₂ of its ethyl group (t). This gives a **dtt**. This matches Signal 2.\n    *   Proton at C2 (`-CHb(C₂H₅)-COOH`): Coupled to Ha (d) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (t). This gives a doublet of triplets. It does not give a dtq.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH:**\n    *   Proton at C3 (`-CH₂(b)-CHa(CH₃)-`): Coupled to Hb (d), CH₂(b) (t), and its own CH₃ (q). This gives a **dtq**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   Proton at C2 (`-CHb(CH₃)-COOH`): Coupled to Ha (d) and its own CH₃ (q). This gives a doublet of quartets. It does not give a dtt.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nOnly structure B, `CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH`, contains protons that would produce both a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the correct compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Spectroscopy Data\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded system. The significant broadening is characteristic of carboxylic acids, which form dimers through hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. A frequency of 1700 cm⁻¹ is typical for the carbonyl group in a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The data strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. All four provided options are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirm the functional group type but do not help distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in analyzing the splitting patterns (multiplicity) of the signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **No Vinyl Hydrogens:** This tells us the molecule is saturated and contains no C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated, which is consistent with this finding.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex splitting means there is a proton in the molecule that is coupled to three different, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   A single proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **d**oublet (n+1 = 2).\n    *   A group of two protons (n=2), which splits the signal into a **t**riplet (n+1 = 3).\n    *   A group of three protons (n=3), which splits the signal into a **q**uartet (n+1 = 4).\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This means a different proton in the molecule is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   A single proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **d**oublet (n+1 = 2).\n    *   A group of two protons (n=2), which splits the signal into a **t**riplet (n+1 = 3).\n    *   Another, chemically distinct group of two protons (n=2), which splits the signal into another **t**riplet (n+1 = 3).\n\n### 3. Evaluation of Each Candidate Structure\n\nWe must now analyze the protons on the main carbon chain (the methine, or CH, protons) for each option to see if they can produce these specific splitting patterns.\n\n**A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   The proton at C3 is coupled to the CH₂ at C2 (2H), the CH at C4 (1H), and the C3-methyl group (3H). This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n*   However, no proton in this molecule is coupled to one proton, a group of two protons, and another group of two protons.

This would produce a **dtt** signal.\n*   However, no proton in this molecule is coupled to a group of one, two, and three protons.

The `CH₃` group above it (3H) → gives a **quartet**.\n    2.  The `CH` proton next to it (Hd, 1H) → gives a **doublet**.\n    3.  The `CH₂` of the ethyl group on the same carbon (2H) → gives a **triplet**.\n    The resulting signal for Hc is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This perfectly matches the first signal described.\n\n*   **Proton Hd:** This proton is coupled to:\n    1.  The `CH` proton next to it (Hc, 1H) → gives a **doublet**.\n    2.  The `CH₂` group in the chain towards the acid (2H) → gives a **triplet**.\n    3.

The broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This signal is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with the carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group is present in all candidates but doesn't help distinguish between them.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data\n\nThe key to identifying the correct isomer lies in the complex splitting patterns (multiplicity) of the proton signals. The multiplicity is described by the \"n+1\" rule, where 'n' is the number of equivalent neighboring protons. When a proton is coupled to multiple *different* sets of neighboring protons, the splitting pattern becomes more complex (e.g., a doublet of triplets).\n\nThe problem states there are two particularly complex signals:\n\n1.  **A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This means a single proton is being split by three different, non-equivalent groups of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** implies coupling to 1 neighboring proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** implies coupling to 2 neighboring protons (n=2, typically a -CH₂- group).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** implies coupling to 3 neighboring protons (n=3, typically a -CH₃ group).\n    *   Therefore, the proton that gives this signal must be a methine (-CH-) proton adjacent to a -CH- group, a -CH₂- group, and a -CH₃ group. The set of neighboring protons is **{1H, 2H, 3H}**.\n\n2.  **A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This means another, different proton is also being split by three non-equivalent groups of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** implies coupling to 1 neighboring proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** implies coupling to 2 neighboring protons (n=2).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** implies coupling to another, non-equivalent group of 2 neighboring protons (n=2).\n    *   Therefore, the proton that gives this signal must be a methine (-CH-) proton adjacent to a -CH- group and two different -CH₂- groups. The set of neighboring protons is **{1H, 2H, 2H}**.\n\n**The task is to find the structure that has one methine proton with a {1H, 2H, 3H} neighborhood and another methine proton with a {1H, 2H, 2H} neighborhood.**\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Candidate Structure\n\nThe code output confirms the manual analysis of the neighboring protons for the methine (CH) groups in each structure.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Let's draw and number the main chain:\n        `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **Proton at C3 (H³):** Its neighbors are H⁴ (1H), the two H's at C2 (2H), and the two H's on the ethyl group's CH₂ (2H). The neighbor set is **{1H, 2H, 2H}**. This will produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   **Proton at C4 (H⁴):** Its neighbors are H³ (1H), the three H's at C5 (3H), and the two H's on the ethyl group's CH₂ (2H).

It is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(Me)-CH(3)(Me)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **Proton at C3:** Neighbors are H⁴ (1H), C2-H's (2H), and the C3-methyl group (3H). Neighbor set is {1H, 2H, 3H} -> **dtq**.\n    *   **Proton at C4:** Neighbors are H³ (1H), C5-H's (3H), and the C4-methyl group (3H). Neighbor set is {1H, 3H, 3H} -> **doublet of quartets of quartets (dqq)**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This structure has a `dtq` but not a `dtt`.

Neighbor set is {1H, 2H, 2H} -> **dtt**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This structure has a `dtt` but not a `dtq`. It is incorrect.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nOnly structure A, **CH₃CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**, possesses the two required methine proton environments to produce both a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nTo identify the unknown compound, we must analyze the provided spectral data and compare it to the structures of the four possible options.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) bond in a carboxylic acid.\n    *   This information confirms the compound is a carboxylic acid.

The splitting of a signal can be predicted using the n+1 rule, where n is the number of equivalent adjacent protons. For complex cases, these effects are multiplicative.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C2 (doublet), the CH₂ group at C4 (triplet), and the CH₃ group on C3 (quartet). This would result in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   However, no other proton in this molecule would produce a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt). Therefore, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C2 (doublet), the CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent at C3 (triplet), and the CH₂ group at C4 (triplet). This would result in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   No proton in this molecule would produce a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq). Therefore, B is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C4 (doublet), the CH₂ group at C2 (triplet), and the CH₃ group at C3 (quartet). This would give a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   No proton in this molecule would produce a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt). Therefore, C is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid):**\n    Let's analyze the structure `CH₃-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`.\n    *   **Proton at C4:** This proton (H-C4) is coupled to the CH₃ group at C5 (quartet), the proton at C3 (doublet), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group attached to C4 (triplet). This matches the **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** signal.\n    *   **Proton at C3:** This proton (H-C3) is coupled to the proton at C4 (doublet), the CH₂ group at C2 (triplet), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group attached to C3 (triplet). This matches the **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** signal.\n\nSince molecule D is the only structure that contains protons corresponding to both of the observed complex splitting patterns, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nThe user wants me to identify an unknown compound from a list of four options based on its FTIR and 1H NMR spectral data.\n\n**1.

All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this data confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n**2. Analysis of 1H NMR Data:**\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated molecules, which is consistent with this information.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex splitting pattern arises from a single proton being coupled to three different, neighboring groups of protons.\n    *   The **doublet (d)** component means it is coupled to one adjacent proton (a -CH group).\n    *   The **triplet (t)** component means it is coupled to two adjacent, equivalent protons (a -CH₂- group).\n    *   The **quartet (q)** component means it is coupled to three adjacent, equivalent protons (a -CH₃ group).\n    *   Therefore, the proton responsible for this signal must be a methine (-CH) proton that is adjacent to another -CH group, a -CH₂- group, and a -CH₃ group.\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This splitting pattern arises from a proton being coupled to three different neighboring groups.\n    *   The **doublet (d)** component means it is coupled to one adjacent proton (a -CH group).\n    *   The first **triplet (t)** component means it is coupled to two adjacent, equivalent protons (a -CH₂- group).\n    *   The second **triplet (t)** component means it is coupled to another set of two adjacent, equivalent protons (a different -CH₂- group).\n    *   Therefore, the proton responsible for this signal must be a methine (-CH) proton that is adjacent to another -CH group and two non-equivalent -CH₂- groups.\n\n**3. Evaluation of the Candidate Structures:**\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH:**\n    *   Let's analyze the methine (C**H**) protons.\n    *   The CH next to the COOH is coupled to one CH and one CH₃.

This would be a doublet of triplets.\n    *   The other CH is coupled to one CH and two different CH₂ groups (one from the ethyl group on the same carbon, and one from the ethyl group on the adjacent carbon). This would produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   This molecule does not have a proton environment that would produce a `dtq` signal.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH:**\n    *   Let's analyze the two different methine (C**H**) protons in the main chain.\n    *   **Proton 1 (the CH attached to a CH₃ and an ethyl group):** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The neighboring CH proton (1H) -> **doublet**.\n        *   The adjacent CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H) -> **triplet**.\n        *   The adjacent CH₃ group (3H) -> **quartet**.\n        *   This proton's signal would be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal.\n    *   **Proton 2 (the CH attached to the CH₂COOH and an ethyl group):** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The neighboring CH proton (1H) -> **doublet**.\n        *   The adjacent CH₂ of the CH₂COOH group (2H) -> **triplet**.\n        *   The adjacent CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H) -> **triplet**.\n        *   This proton's signal would be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nStructure D is the only candidate that possesses two different methine protons whose coupling environments perfectly match both the \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" and the \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" signals described in the 1H NMR data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 30:\nTo identify the unknown compound, a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data is necessary.\n\n### **Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of an O-H bond involved in hydrogen bonding, which is characteristic of the hydroxyl group in a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, which is also a key feature of a carboxylic acid.\n\nConclusion from FTIR: The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid group, so this data confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n### **Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe crucial information for distinguishing between the isomers lies in the complex splitting patterns described. The `n+1 rule` states that a signal is split into `n+1` peaks by `n` neighboring, non-equivalent protons. When a proton is coupled to multiple, different sets of neighboring protons, complex patterns like \"doublet of triplets\" emerge.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds, which is consistent with all four proposed saturated structures.\n*   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This indicates a proton is coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons: one proton (giving the doublet), two protons (giving the triplet), and three protons (giving the quartet).\n*   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This implies a proton is coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons: one proton (giving the doublet), a set of two protons (giving a triplet), and another set of two protons (giving another triplet).\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting for the methine (CH) protons in each structure, as these are most likely to show such complex splitting.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is adjacent to a CH at C2 (1H), a CH₃ group (3H), and a CH₂ group (2H). This would result in a **doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**, which matches the \"dtq\" description.\n    *   However, no other proton in this molecule is adjacent to three distinct groups of protons that would create a \"dtt\" pattern.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is adjacent to a CH at C2 (1H), a CH₂ group from the ethyl at C3 (2H), and a CH₂ group at C4 (2H).

The longest carbon chain containing the COOH group has six carbons, with an ethyl group at C3 and a methyl group at C4. The IUPAC name is 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid.\n    *   **Proton at C3:** This proton is coupled to the proton at C4 (1H, a doublet), the protons at C2 (2H, a triplet), and the protons of the ethyl group's CH₂ at C3 (2H, a triplet). This results in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   **Proton at C4:** This proton is coupled to the proton at C3 (1H, a doublet), the protons at C5 (2H, a triplet), and the protons of the methyl group at C4 (3H, a quartet). This results in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nStructure D is the only compound that has two different protons whose predicted splitting patterns perfectly match both the \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" and the \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" signals described in the ¹H NMR data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 31:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data\n\n*   **A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The broadening is a key characteristic.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. For a carboxylic acid, this peak typically appears between 1700 and 1725 cm⁻¹.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the class of compound but doesn't distinguish between the options.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates that there are no C=C double bonds in the molecule. All four options are saturated alkanoic acids, which is consistent with this observation.\n*   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex splitting pattern means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   **d** (doublet): one neighboring proton (1H).\n    *   **t** (triplet): two neighboring protons (2H).\n    *   **q** (quartet): three neighboring protons (3H).\n*   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   **d** (doublet): one neighboring proton (1H).\n    *   **t** (triplet): two neighboring protons (2H).\n    *   **t** (triplet): another set of two neighboring protons (2H).\n\nThe key to solving the problem is to find the structure that contains protons with these exact neighboring environments.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Proposed Structure\n\nLet's examine the protons on the main carbon chain for each option, as these are the most likely to exhibit such complex splitting.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n\n```\n      CH₃(g)  CH₃(h)\n      |       |\n(f)H₃(e)H₂C - C(Hb) - C(Ha) - COOH\n```\n*   **Ha (proton on C2):** It is coupled to Hb (1H) giving a doublet, and the methyl group (h) (3H) giving a quartet. **Signal: doublet of quartets (dq).**\n*   **Hb (proton on C3):** It is coupled to Ha (1H, doublet), its own methyl group (g) (3H, quartet), and the adjacent methylene group (e) (2H, triplet). **Signal: doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**, which is equivalent to a **dtq**.\n*   **Conclusion for D:** This structure has a **dtq** signal (from Hb), but it does not have any proton that would produce a **dtt** signal. Therefore, D is incorrect.\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n\n```\n      (d)CH₃\n      |\n(e)H₃C - C(Hb) - C(Ha)(CH₃f) - CH₂(c) - COOH\n```\n*   **Ha (proton on C3):** It is coupled to Hb (1H, doublet), its methyl group (f) (3H, quartet), and the methylene group (c) (2H, triplet). **Signal: doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**, which is a **dtq**.\n*   **Hb (proton on C4):** It is coupled to Ha (1H, doublet) and the two methyl groups (d, e) on its carbon (a total of 6H). This gives a septet. **Signal: doublet of septets (d-sept).**\n*   **Conclusion for C:** This structure has a **dtq** signal, but the other complex signal is a d-sept, not a dtt. Therefore, C is incorrect.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid)**\n\n```\n      C₂H₅(g)  C₂H₅(h)\n      |        |\n(f)H₃(e)H₂C - C(Hb) - C(Ha) - COOH\n```\nLet's break down the ethyl groups (C₂H₅ = -CH₂CH₃).\n*   **Hb (proton on C4):** This proton is coupled to Ha (1H, doublet), the CH₂ of the terminal ethyl group (e) (2H, triplet), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group substituent (g) (2H, triplet). **Signal: doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** This matches one of the required signals.\n*   **Ha (proton on C3):** This proton is coupled to Hb (1H, doublet) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group substituent (h) (2H, triplet). This would normally give a doublet of triplets (dt). However, 4-bond (long-range) coupling can sometimes be observed. If Ha also couples to the terminal CH₃ of its ethyl group (h) (3H), the signal would become a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This is a plausible explanation for the second observed signal.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** This structure definitively contains a proton (Hb) that gives a **dtt** signal. It also contains a proton (Ha) that could plausibly give the **dtq** signal if a 4-bond coupling is observed. Compared to the other options which definitively lack one of the signals, this is the most viable candidate.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\nThis formula is ambiguous, but it corresponds to a C₉H₁₈O₂ isomer like structure A. While an isomer of C₉H₁₈O₂ exists that perfectly fits both NMR signals (3-methyl-4-ethylhexanoic acid), it does not match the written condensed formula of any of the options. Given the choices, we must evaluate the structures as presented.\n\n### Final Decision\n\n*   Structure A definitively exhibits a **dtt** signal from standard couplings and can plausibly exhibit a **dtq** signal through a common long-range coupling effect.\n*   Structures C and D exhibit a **dtq** signal but definitively cannot exhibit a **dtt** signal.\n*   Structure A is the only one that can account for both observed complex multiplets.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid, where the peak is significantly broadened due to hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\nThis information confirms that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible structures are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the candidates.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of hydrogen atoms attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H). All four candidate molecules are saturated, consistent with this information.\n*   **Key Splitting Patterns:** The identification relies on matching the complex splitting patterns to one of the structures.\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This means a single proton is magnetically coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: one single proton (giving a doublet, n=1), a group of two equivalent protons (giving a triplet, n=2), and a group of three equivalent protons (giving a quartet, n=3).\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This means a different single proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: one single proton (giving a doublet, n=1), a group of two equivalent protons (giving a triplet, n=2), and another different group of two equivalent protons (giving another triplet, n=2).\n\n### 3. Structural Analysis of the Candidates\n\nLet's analyze the structure of each candidate to see if its protons could produce the observed splitting patterns. We will assume the condensed formulas represent a continuous chain unless brackets indicate a branch.\n\n*   **A) `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH` -> 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH3CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH`\n    The proton at C2 is coupled to one proton at C3 (doublet) and the two `CH₂` protons of the ethyl group at C2 (triplet). This would result in a doublet of triplets (`dt`), which is not what is observed.\n\n*   **B) `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH` -> 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    The proton at C2 is coupled to one proton at C3 (doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group at C2 (quartet). This results in a doublet of quartets (`dq`). This does not match the observed patterns.\n\n*   **C) `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH` -> 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH`\n    The protons in the `CH₂` group at C2 are adjacent to the chiral center at C3, making them diastereotopic. Each would be split by the other (a doublet) and by the proton at C3 (a doublet), resulting in a doublet of doublets (`dd`). This does not match.\n\n*   **D) `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH` -> 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH`\n    Let's draw this structure and number the main carbon chain:\n    <pre>\n          Et(A)     Et(B)\n          |         |\n    HOOC¹-CH₂²-CH³-CH⁴-CH₃⁵\n    </pre>\n    This molecule has two chiral centers (C3 and C4). Let's analyze the signals for the protons on the main chain:\n\n    *   **Proton at C3 (H3):** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The proton at C4 (H4) -> gives a **doublet**.\n        *   The two protons of the `CH₂` group at C2 -> gives a **triplet**.\n        *   The two protons of the `CH₂` group of the ethyl substituent at C3 (Et_A) -> gives a **triplet**.\n        Therefore, the signal for H3 is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n\n    *   **Proton at C4 (H4):** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The proton at C3 (H3) -> gives a **doublet**.\n        *   The two protons of the `CH₂` group of the ethyl substituent at C4 (Et_B) -> gives a **triplet**.\n        *   The three protons of the methyl group at C5 -> gives a **quartet**.\n        Therefore, the signal for H4 is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the second observed signal.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe proton NMR splitting patterns described in the problem, a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) and a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq), are perfectly explained by the structure of 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid. This corresponds to the formula given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The goal is to identify a specific chemical compound from four choices using given spectroscopic data (FTIR and 1H NMR).\n\n2.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   **\"very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers (cm⁻¹)\"**: This is a classic signature for an O-H stretch in a hydrogen-bonded environment, specifically a carboxylic acid (R-COOH). The O-H stretch of an alcohol is also in this region but the O-H of a carboxylic acid is typically much broader.\n    *   **\"strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers (cm⁻¹)\"**: This is the characteristic region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. For a carboxylic acid, this peak typically appears around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR**: The presence of both a very broad O-H and a strong C=O peak strongly indicates the compound is a carboxylic acid. I'll check the options: A, B, C, and D all contain a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). So, the FTIR data confirms the class of compound but doesn't distinguish between the choices. The deciding factor must be the 1H NMR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **\"none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens\"**: This tells us there are no hydrogens attached to C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated alkanoic acids, so this information is consistent with all choices and doesn't help differentiate.\n    *   **The Key Information: Splitting Patterns**. The problem states there are two specific, complex signals:\n        1.  **A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n        2.  **A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   **Understand Splitting (n+1 rule)**: A signal for a proton (or a group of equivalent protons) is split into (n+1) lines by 'n' equivalent neighboring protons.\n        *   Doublet (d): 1 neighbor (n=1)\n        *   Triplet (t): 2 neighbors (n=2)\n        *   Quartet (q): 3 neighbors (n=3)\n    *   **Deconstruct the Complex Patterns**: For a signal to be a \"multiplet of multiplets,\" the proton must be coupled to multiple *non-equivalent* groups of protons.\n        *   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**: A proton must have three sets of non-equivalent neighbors: one single proton (gives doublet), one group of 2 protons (gives triplet), and one group of 3 protons (gives quartet).\n        *   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**: A proton must have three sets of non-equivalent neighbors: one single proton (gives doublet), one group of 2 protons (gives triplet), and *another, different* group of 2 protons (gives the second triplet).\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Candidate Molecule:** I will now systematically examine the structure of each option to see if any of its protons would produce these specific splitting patterns. I will focus on the methine (C-H) protons, as they are bonded to the most other carbons and are most likely to have complex splitting.\n\n    *   **A) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH**\n        *   Let's label the key protons: `CH3CH2-CH(c)(CH3)-CH(f)(CH3)-COOH`\n        *   Look at proton `H(c)`: It's bonded to `CH2` (2 neighbors -> t), `CH(f)` (1 neighbor -> d), and `CH3` (3 neighbors -> q). This gives a **dtq**. This matches one of the signals!\n        *   Look at proton `H(f)`: It's bonded to `CH(c)` (1 neighbor -> d) and `CH3` (3 neighbors -> q). This gives a doublet of quartets (dq). This is not a dtt.\n        *   *Conclusion for A*: Has a `dtq`, but not a `dtt`. So, it's incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH**\n        *   Let's label the key protons: `CH3-CH(c)(CH3)-CH(e)(CH3)-CH2-COOH`\n        *   Look at proton `H(e)`: It's bonded to `CH(c)` (1 neighbor -> d), `CH2` (2 neighbors -> t), and `CH3` (3 neighbors -> q). This gives a **dtq**. This also matches one of the signals.\n        *   Look at proton `H(c)`: It's bonded to `CH(e)` (1 neighbor -> d) and two different `CH3` groups (each 3 neighbors -> q). This gives a doublet of quartets of quartets (dqq). Not a dtt.\n        *   *Conclusion for B*: Has a `dtq`, but not a `dtt`. So, it's incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH** (Note: C2H5 is -CH2CH3)\n        *   Structure: `CH3CH2-CH(c)(CH2CH3)-CH(d)(CH2CH3)-COOH`\n        *   Look at proton `H(c)`: It's bonded to `CH(d)` (1 neighbor -> d), the `CH2` of the attached ethyl group (2 neighbors -> t), and the `CH2` of the main chain (2 neighbors -> t). This gives a **dtt**. This matches the other signal!\n        *   Look at proton `H(d)`: It's bonded to `CH(c)` (1 neighbor -> d) and the `CH2` of its attached ethyl group (2 neighbors -> t). This gives a doublet of triplets (dt). This is not a dtq.\n        *   *Conclusion for C*: Has a `dtt`, but not a `dtq`. So, it's incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH**\n        *   Structure: `CH3-CH(b)(CH2CH3)-CH(d)(CH2CH3)-CH2-COOH`\n        *   Look at proton `H(b)`: It's bonded to `CH(d)` (1 neighbor -> d), the attached `CH3` group (3 neighbors -> q), and the `CH2` of the attached ethyl group (2 neighbors -> t). This gives a **dtq**. This matches the first signal!\n        *   Look at proton `H(d)`: It's bonded to `CH(b)` (1 neighbor -> d), the `CH2` of the attached ethyl group (2 neighbors -> t), and the `CH2` of the main chain next to the COOH (2 neighbors -> t). This gives a **dtt**. This matches the second signal!\n        *   *Conclusion for D*: This molecule has a proton that produces a `dtq` signal AND a different proton that produces a `dtt` signal. This perfectly matches all the 1H NMR data.\n\n5.  **Final Synthesis and Code Generation:**\n    *   The FTIR data identified a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The 1H NMR data provided two unique splitting patterns (`dtq` and `dtt`).\n    *   By analyzing each structure, only structure D contains protons that would result in both of these specific splitting patterns.\n    *   The Python code will present this logic clearly and print the final choice.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef identify_compound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies a compound based on FTIR and 1H NMR data by analyzing splitting patterns.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Options provided to the user\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH\",\n        \"B\": \"CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH\",\n        \"C\": \"CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH\",\n        \"D\": \"CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH\"\n    }\n\n    # Explanation of the reasoning process\n    analysis_steps = [\n        \"1.

Conclusion:\n  - Compound D is the only structure that contains protons that would exhibit both of the specific\nsplitting patterns described in the 1H NMR data.\n\nThe correct compound is:\nD) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH\n\n<<<D>>>\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) bond stretch. The position (~1700-1725 cm⁻¹) is typical for a carbonyl in a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the candidates.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates that there are no protons attached to C=C double bonds in the molecule. All four options are saturated alkanoic acids, so this is consistent with all candidates.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This is a very specific and complex splitting pattern. It means a single proton is being split by three different groups of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a **doublet** (1+1=2).\n    *   Two neighboring protons (n=2), causing a **triplet** (2+1=3).\n    *   Three neighboring protons (n=3), causing a **quartet** (3+1=4).\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a methine (CH) proton that is adjacent to another methine (CH), a methylene (CH₂), and a methyl (CH₃) group.\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This is another highly specific pattern. It means a different single proton is being split by three different groups of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a **doublet** (1+1=2).\n    *   Two neighboring protons (n=2), causing a **triplet** (2+1=3).\n    *   Another group of two neighboring protons (n=2), causing another **triplet** (2+1=3).\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a methine (CH) proton that is adjacent to another methine (CH) and two different methylene (CH₂) groups.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Each Candidate Structure**\n\nTo determine which molecule fits the NMR data, we will analyze the structure of each option and look for protons that would produce the required `dtq` and `dtt` signals. We must first determine the correct IUPAC name for each condensed formula by identifying the longest carbon chain containing the COOH group.\n\n**A) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\n*   **Structure Determination:** Let's trace the longest carbon chain containing the COOH. It is a hexanoic acid chain with a methyl group at position 4 and an ethyl group at position 3. The IUPAC name is **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**.\n    ```\n             Et(i)    Me(h)\n             |        |\n    HOOC(d)-CH₂(c)-CH(b)-CH(a)-CH₂(g)-CH₃(f)\n    ```\n*   **Analysis of Proton (a):** This is a methine proton on carbon 4. Its neighbors are:\n    *   Proton (b) on C3 (1H) → doublet\n    *   Protons (g) on C5 (2H) → triplet\n    *   Protons (h) on the methyl group (3H) → quartet\n    *   This proton's signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first required signal.\n*   **Analysis of Proton (b):** This is a methine proton on carbon 3. Its neighbors are:\n    *   Proton (a) on C4 (1H) → doublet\n    *   Protons (c) on C2 (2H) → triplet\n    *   Protons (i) on the ethyl group's CH₂ (2H) → triplet\n    *   This proton's signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second required signal.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule fits both pieces of key NMR evidence.\n\n**B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\n*   **Structure Determination:** The IUPAC name is **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   Proton at C3: Neighbors are 1H (at C2), 2H (at C4), and 2H (on its ethyl group). This gives a **dtt**.\n    *   Proton at C2: Neighbors are 1H (at C3) and 2H (on its ethyl group). This gives a **dt**.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule does not have a `dtq` signal. It is incorrect.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\n*   **Structure Determination:** The IUPAC name is **2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   Proton at C3: Neighbors are 1H (at C2), 2H (at C4), and 3H (on its methyl group). This gives a **dqt**.\n    *   Proton at C2: Neighbors are 1H (at C3) and 3H (on its methyl group). This gives a **dq** (doublet of quartets).\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule does not have a `dtt` signal. It is incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\n*   **Structure Determination:** The IUPAC name is **3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   Proton at C3: Neighbors are 1H (at C4), 2H (at C2), and 3H (on its methyl group). This gives a **dqt**.\n    *   Proton at C4: Neighbors are 1H (at C3), 3H (at C5), and 3H (on its methyl group). This gives a **dqq** (doublet of quartet of quartets).\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule does not have a `dtt` signal. It is incorrect.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, only structure A, **CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH** (3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid), has protons that would exhibit both a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nHere is my reasoning to identify the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **FTIR Analysis:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is a definitive indicator of an O-H stretch from a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this data confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the choices.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds, which is consistent with all four saturated structures.\n    *   **\"doublet of triplets of quartets\" (dtq):** This complex splitting pattern tells us about the neighbors of a specific proton. According to the n+1 rule, a proton showing a `dtq` signal must be coupled to:\n        *   One adjacent proton (for the **d**oublet).\n        *   A group of two equivalent adjacent protons (for the **t**riplet).\n        *   A group of three equivalent adjacent protons (for the **q**uartet).\n        Therefore, we are searching for a methine proton (`CH`) that is adjacent to a `CH` group, a `CH₂` group, and a `CH₃` group.\n    *   **\"doublet of triplets of triplets\" (dtt):** Similarly, a proton showing a `dtt` signal must be coupled to:\n        *   One adjacent proton (for the **d**oublet).\n        *   A group of two equivalent adjacent protons (for the first **t**riplet).\n        *   A second, non-equivalent group of two equivalent adjacent protons (for the second **t**riplet).\n        Therefore, we are searching for a methine proton (`CH`) that is adjacent to a `CH` group and two non-equivalent `CH₂` groups.\n    *   **Key Requirement:** The correct structure must contain *both* a proton that produces a `dtq` signal and a different proton that produces a `dtt` signal.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Candidate Molecules:**\n\n    *   **A) `CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH` (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):** This molecule has a proton that would give a `dtq` signal, but it lacks a proton environment that would produce a `dtt` signal.\n    *   **B) `CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH` (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid):** This molecule has a proton that would give a `dtt` signal, but it lacks a proton environment that would produce a `dtq` signal.\n    *   **C) `CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH` (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):** This molecule has a proton that would give a `dtq` signal, but it lacks a proton environment that would produce a `dtt` signal.\n    *   **D) `CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH`:** Let's determine the structure and analyze its protons. The formula corresponds to **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Et)-CH₃(5)`.\n\n        *   **Proton at C3:** This `CH` is adjacent to the `CH₂` group at C2 (2 neighbors), the `CH` group at C4 (1 neighbor), and the `CH₂` group of its own ethyl substituent (2 neighbors). The signal would be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n        *   **Proton at C4:** This `CH` is adjacent to the `CH` group at C3 (1 neighbor), the `CH₃` group at C5 (3 neighbors), and the `CH₂` group of its own ethyl substituent (2 neighbors). The signal would be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the second required signal.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nStructure D is the only option that contains both a proton that would exhibit `dtt` splitting and another proton that would exhibit `dtq` splitting. It is therefore the only structure that is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n\nThe provided code output correctly identifies that a molecule with the name `3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid` would also fit the NMR criteria. While this is true, that molecule's structure is different from the one described by the condensed formula in option D (`3,4-diethylpentanoic acid`). Since my task is to choose the correct option from the list, and the formula in option D corresponds to a molecule (`3,4-diethylpentanoic acid`) that perfectly matches the spectral data, D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nBased on the provided spectroscopic data, the unknown compound is identified by analyzing the information from both FTIR and ¹H NMR.\n\n### **Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\nThe FTIR spectrum provides information about the functional groups present in the molecule.\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness of the peak is a result of hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also a key feature of a carboxylic acid.\n\nBoth of these signals strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). All four possible compounds (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid group, so the FTIR data confirms this class of compound but does not differentiate between the specific structures.\n\n### **Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe ¹H NMR data, particularly the complex splitting patterns, is crucial for determining the exact structure of the carbon skeleton. The simple \"n+1 rule\" is used for protons with equivalent neighbors, but when a proton is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of protons, more complex patterns like \"doublet of triplets\" emerge.\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting patterns for the most complex signals in each proposed structure:\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH:** The proton at C3 would be a doublet of triplets, and the proton at C2 would be a doublet of quartets. This does not match the observed doublet of triplets of triplets and doublet of triplets of quartets.\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH:** The proton at C3 would be a doublet of quartets of triplets. This does not match the described signals.\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH:** The protons in this structure would lead to very complex multiplets, but it is unlikely to produce the specific combination of a doublet of triplets of triplets and a doublet of triplets of quartets. The proton at C3 could be a doublet of triplet of triplets, but there is no proton that would result in a doublet of triplets of quartets.\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH:** Let's examine the structure `CH₃(a)-CH(b)(CH₂(c)CH₃(d))-CH(e)(CH₂(f)CH₃(g))-CH₂(h)-COOH`.\n    *   **Proton H(b):** This proton is coupled to three distinct groups of neighboring protons:\n        *   The single proton H(e), which splits the signal into a **doublet**.\n        *   The two protons of the CH₂(c) group, which split each line of the doublet into a **triplet**.\n        *   The three protons of the CH₃(a) group, which split each line of the doublet of triplets into a **quartet**.\n        *   This results in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**, which perfectly matches one of the described signals.\n    *   **Proton H(e):** This proton is also coupled to three distinct groups of neighboring protons:\n        *   The single proton H(b), which splits the signal into a **doublet**.\n        *   The two protons of the CH₂(f) group, which split each line of the doublet into a **triplet**.\n        *   The two protons of the CH₂(h) group, which split each line of the doublet of triplets into another **triplet**.\n        *   This results in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**, matching the other complex signal described.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe FTIR data confirms the compound is a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR splitting patterns are unique to the arrangement of protons in the molecule. Only structure **D** can account for both the observed **doublet of triplets of quartets** and the **doublet of triplets of triplets**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nTo identify the unknown compound, a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data is necessary.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad Absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The broadness is due to the formation of dimers.\n*   **Strong Absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also characteristic of a carboxylic acid. The position around 1700 cm⁻¹ is typical for a saturated, dimeric carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The data strongly indicate that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group present but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe ¹H NMR spectrum provides detailed information about the carbon-hydrogen framework of the molecule. The key to solving this problem lies in deciphering the complex splitting patterns reported.\n\n*   **No Vinyl-Hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H), which is consistent with all four structures being saturated alkanoic acids.\n*   **Complex Splitting:** When a proton is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons, its signal is split sequentially by each set. The resulting pattern is named based on these successive splittings (e.g., doublet of triplets).\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This pattern arises when a single proton has three sets of non-equivalent neighbors on adjacent carbons: one neighboring proton (giving the doublet), a group of two equivalent protons (giving the triplet), and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet).\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern arises when a single proton has three sets of non-equivalent neighbors on adjacent carbons: one neighboring proton (giving the doublet), a group of two equivalent protons (giving the first triplet), and another distinct group of two equivalent protons (giving the second triplet).\n\n### 3. Structural Evaluation\n\nLet's analyze the structure that would produce both of the described splitting patterns.\n\n*   **Structure C: `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`**\n\n    Let's first interpret this condensed formula. Assuming the atoms are listed sequentially, the structure is `CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH`. The longest carbon chain containing the `COOH` group determines the parent name. This results in the IUPAC name **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n\n    Let's number the carbon chain starting from the carboxyl carbon as C1:\n    `CH3(5)-CH(4)(CH2CH3)-CH(3)(CH2CH3)-CH2(2)-COOH(1)`\n\n    Now, let's analyze the splitting for the key protons on the chiral centers (C3 and C4):\n\n    1.  **Proton on C4 (H4):** This proton is on a carbon adjacent to C3, C5, and the CH₂ of its ethyl group.\n        *   It is coupled to **H3** (1 proton), which splits its signal into a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   It is coupled to the **CH₃ group at C5** (3 protons), which splits its signal into a **quartet (q)**.\n        *   It is coupled to the **CH₂ of the ethyl group on C4** (2 protons), which splits its signal into a **triplet (t)**.\n        *   The resulting pattern for H4 is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This perfectly matches the first signal described.\n\n    2.  **Proton on C3 (H3):** This proton is on a carbon adjacent to C2, C4, and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group.\n        *   It is coupled to **H4** (1 proton), which splits its signal into a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   It is coupled to the **CH₂ group at C2** (2 protons), which splits its signal into a **triplet (t)**.\n        *   It is coupled to the **CH₂ of the ethyl group on C3** (2 protons), which splits its signal into another **triplet (t)**.\n        *   The resulting pattern for H3 is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This perfectly matches the second signal described.\n\nSince the structure corresponding to 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid exhibits both of the complex splitting patterns observed in the ¹H NMR spectrum, it is the correct compound. The formula provided in option C, interpreted as `CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH`, correctly represents this molecule. A similar analysis of options A, B, and D does not yield both of these specific complex splitting patterns.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nBased on the detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the unknown compound is identified by interpreting its key features in the FTIR and ¹H NMR spectra.\n\n### Spectroscopic Analysis\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** The presence of a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic indicator of the O-H bond stretching in a carboxylic acid, with the broadness resulting from hydrogen bonding. The strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) bond stretching, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid. This confirms the functional group present in the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid, which is consistent with all four possible structures.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The ¹H NMR data provides the specific details needed to distinguish between the isomers. The absence of vinyl-protons indicates that there are no carbon-carbon double bonds in the molecule, which is true for all options. The crucial information lies in two complex splitting patterns observed for two different signals:\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This splitting pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: a single proton (causing the doublet), a set of two equivalent protons (causing the triplet), and a set of three equivalent protons (causing the quartet).\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern occurs when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: a single proton (causing the doublet), a set of two equivalent protons (causing the first triplet), and another, different set of two equivalent protons (causing the second triplet).\n\n### Structural Elucidation\n\nBy examining the four possible structures, we can predict the expected splitting patterns for their protons:\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid):** This molecule has a proton that would exhibit a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) signal. However, it lacks a proton environment that would produce a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid):** This structure has a proton that would result in a dtq signal but does not have one that would produce a dtt signal.\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):** Similar to option B, a proton in this molecule would show a dtq signal, but none would produce a dtt signal.\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (interpreted as 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid):** Although the condensed structural formula is written in a non-standard way, it corresponds to the molecular formula C₉H₁₈O₂. The isomer that fits this formula and the NMR data is 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid:\n    ```\n       CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-COOH\n    ```\n    In this structure:\n    *   The proton on carbon-3, `–CH(CH₂CH₃)–`, is coupled to the proton on carbon-4 (1H, doublet), the adjacent methylene group in the ethyl substituent (2H, triplet), and the methylene group at carbon-2 (2H, triplet). This creates a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   The proton on carbon-4, `–CH(CH₃)–`, is coupled to the proton on carbon-3 (1H, doublet), the adjacent methylene group on the main chain (2H, triplet), and the adjacent methyl group (3H, quartet). This creates a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n\nSince the structure corresponding to option D is the only one that can produce both of the described complex ¹H NMR signals, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group present but does not differentiate between the options.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   \"None of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens\" indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four structures are saturated alkanoic acids, which is consistent with this information.\n    *   The crucial pieces of information are the complex splitting patterns (multiplicities):\n        1.  One signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n        2.  A different signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\n### **2. Understand the Splitting Patterns**\n\nTo predict these complex patterns, we use the (n+1) rule for each group of non-equivalent neighboring protons.\n*   **dtq (doublet of triplets of quartets):** This pattern arises when a proton (or a group of equivalent protons) is coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons:\n    *   A group of **one** proton (n=1, split into a doublet).\n    *   A group of **two** equivalent protons (n=2, split into a triplet).\n    *   A group of **three** equivalent protons (n=3, split into a quartet).\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a `CH` proton that is adjacent to another `CH`, a `CH₂` group, and a `CH₃` group.\n\n*   **dtt (doublet of triplets of triplets):** This pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons:\n    *   A group of **one** proton (n=1, split into a doublet).\n    *   A group of **two** equivalent protons (n=2, split into a triplet).\n    *   Another, different group of **two** equivalent protons (n=2, split into another triplet).\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a `CH` proton that is adjacent to another `CH` group and two different `CH₂` groups.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Structure of Each Option**\n\nLet's analyze each candidate molecule to see if its structure can produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal. The condensed formulas can be ambiguous, so we must carefully deduce the structure.\n\n**A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n```\n          CH₃\n          |\n(CH₃)₂CH(4)-CH(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)\n```\n*   **H at C3:** Neighbors are H at C4 (1H), the C3-methyl (3H), and the CH₂ at C2 (2H). This proton would indeed be a **dtq**.\n*   **H at C4:** Neighbors are H at C3 (1H) and the two C4-methyl groups (6H). This proton would be a doublet of septets (ds).\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule has a `dtq` but no `dtt`. So, A is incorrect.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n```\n           CH₃     CH₃\n           |       |\nCH₃CH₂(4)-CH(3)-CH(2)-COOH(1)\n```\n*   **H at C3:** Neighbors are H at C2 (1H), the C3-methyl (3H), and the CH₂ at C4 (2H). This proton is a **dtq**.\n*   **H at C2:** Neighbors are H at C3 (1H) and the C2-methyl (3H). This is a doublet of quartets (dq).\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule has a `dtq` but no `dtt`. So, C is incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n```\n           CH₂CH₃     CH₂CH₃\n           |           |\nCH₃CH₂(4)-CH(3)----CH(2)----COOH(1)\n```\n*   **H at C3:** Neighbors are H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₂ of the C3-ethyl group (2H). This proton is a **dtt**.\n*   **H at C2:** Neighbors are H at C3 (1H) and the CH₂ of the C2-ethyl group (2H). This is a doublet of triplets (dt).\n*   **Methylene protons:** The protons on the various CH₂ groups are diastereotopic and would give complex `ddq` signals, not a `dtq`.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule has a `dtt` but no `dtq`. So, D is incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\nThis is the most plausible structure from the formula. The backbone is a pentanoic acid chain starting from the terminal CH₃.\n```\n           CH₂(e)CH₃(f)   <-- C4-ethyl\n           |\nCH₃(h)-CH(g)----CH(b)----CH₂(a)----COOH(1)\n           |\n           CH₂(c)CH₃(d)   <-- C3-ethyl\n```\nLet's analyze the key methine (`CH`) protons:\n*   **Proton H(b) at C3:**\n    *   Neighbors: The CH₂ group at C2 (2H, `triplet`), the CH group at C4 (1H, `doublet`), and the CH₂ group of the C3-ethyl sidechain (2H, `triplet`).\n    *   Predicted splitting: **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n*   **Proton H(g) at C4:**\n    *   Neighbors: The CH group at C3 (1H, `doublet`), the CH₂ group of the C4-ethyl sidechain (2H, `triplet`), and the terminal CH₃ group at C5 (3H, `quartet`).\n    *   Predicted splitting: **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the second required signal.\n\n### **4. Final Conclusion**\n\nStructure B, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, is the only compound among the choices that has a proton environment that would produce a `dtt` signal (the proton at C3) and another distinct proton environment that would produce a `dtq` signal (the proton at C4). Therefore, this is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\n**1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid that is undergoing hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group present but does not distinguish between the choices.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated molecules, consistent with this data.\n    *   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** This means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons:\n        *   A set of 1 proton (n=1, gives n+1 = 2 lines, a doublet)\n        *   A set of 2 protons (n=2, gives n+1 = 3 lines, a triplet)\n        *   A set of 3 protons (n=3, gives n+1 = 4 lines, a quartet)\n    *   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** This means a different proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons:\n        *   A set of 1 proton (n=1, gives n+1 = 2 lines, a doublet)\n        *   A set of 2 protons (n=2, gives n+1 = 3 lines, a triplet)\n        *   Another set of 2 protons (n=2, gives n+1 = 3 lines, a triplet)\n\n**2. Analyze the Candidate Structures**\n\nWe need to find the structure that would produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal in its 1H NMR spectrum. Let's analyze each option.\n\n*   **Option D: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    ```\n          CH3   CH3\n          |     |\n    CH3 - CH(e)- CH(d)- CH2 - COOH\n    ```\n    *   **H(d):** Coupled to H(e) (1H) and the CH2 group (2H). This would be a doublet of triplets (`dt`).\n    *   **H(e):** Coupled to H(d) (1H), the terminal CH3 group (3H), and its own attached CH3 group (3H). This would be a complex multiplet, likely a doublet of quartets of quartets (`dqq`).\n    *   This structure does not have both a `dtt` and `dtq`.\n\n*   **Option C: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    ```\n          CH3   CH3\n          |     |\n    CH3CH2 - CH(d)- CH(c)- COOH\n    ```\n    *   **H(c):** Coupled to H(d) (1H). It would be a doublet (ignoring coupling to COOH).\n    *   **H(d):** Coupled to H(c) (1H) and the CH2 of the ethyl group (2H). This would be a doublet of triplets (`dt`).\n    *   This structure does not have both a `dtt` and `dtq`.\n\n*   **Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    ```\n             Et    Et\n             |     |\n    CH3CH2 - CH(e)- CH(d)- COOH\n    ```\n    *   **H(e):** Coupled to H(d) (1H), the CH2 of its own ethyl group (2H), and the CH2 of the terminal ethyl group (2H). This signal would be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n    *   Let's check for a `dtq`. A `dtq` requires coupling to sets of 1, 2, and 3 protons. There is no proton in this molecule that fits this description. For example, the methylene (`CH2`) protons of the ethyl groups are coupled to a methine (`CH`, 1H) and a methyl (`CH3`, 3H). This would result in a doublet of quartets (`dq`), complicated by diastereotopicity (which would add another doublet coupling, making it a `ddq`).\n    *   This structure has a `dtt` but lacks a `dtq`.\n\n*   **Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    ```\n          Et    Et\n          |     |\n    CH3 - CH(e)- CH(d)- CH2 - COOH\n    ```\n    Let's analyze the key methine protons, H(d) and H(e).\n    *   **Proton H(d):** This proton is on carbon-3.\n        *   It is adjacent to H(e) on carbon-4 (1 proton) -> gives a **doublet**.\n        *   It is adjacent to the CH2 group on carbon-2 (2 protons) -> gives a **triplet**.\n        *   It is adjacent to the CH2 of its attached ethyl group (2 protons) -> gives a **triplet**.\n        *   The combined signal for H(d) is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n\n    *   **Proton H(e):** This proton is on carbon-4.\n        *   It is adjacent to H(d) on carbon-3 (1 proton) -> gives a **doublet**.\n        *   It is adjacent to the terminal CH3 group on carbon-5 (3 protons) -> gives a **quartet**.\n        *   It is adjacent to the CH2 of its attached ethyl group (2 protons) -> gives a **triplet**.\n        *   The combined signal for H(e) is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the other required signal.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly structure A, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, has a proton environment that would produce a doublet of triplets of triplets (`dtt`) and another proton environment that would produce a doublet of triplets of quartets (`dtq`). Therefore, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze FTIR Data**\n    *   A \"very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers (cm⁻¹)\" is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is forming hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen bonding causes the peak to become very broad.\n    *   A \"strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹\" is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for a carboxylic acid carbonyl.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group. All four provided options are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the class of the compound but does not help distinguish between the isomers.\n\n2.  **Analyze ¹H NMR Data**\n    *   \"none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens\": This indicates there are no protons attached to sp²-hybridized carbons of a C=C double bond. All four candidate structures are saturated (alkanoic acids), so they are all consistent with this observation.\n    *   **Splitting Patterns:** This is the key piece of data for distinguishing the isomers. Splitting (multiplicity) in ¹H NMR is described by the \"n+1\" rule, where 'n' is the number of equivalent vicinal protons (protons on adjacent carbons, separated by 3 bonds). When a proton is coupled to multiple *different* sets of vicinal neighbors, its signal is split sequentially by each set.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct the Splitting Patterns**\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This indicates a single proton is being coupled by three different sets of neighboring protons through 3-bond (vicinal) coupling.\n        *   **Doublet (d):** Coupling to **1** vicinal proton (`n=1`). This neighbor is likely another methine (`-CH-`) proton.\n        *   **Triplet (t):** Coupling to **2** vicinal protons (`n=2`). This neighbor is likely a methylene (`-CH₂-`) group.\n        *   **Quartet (q):** Coupling to **3** vicinal protons (`n=3`). This neighbor is likely a methyl (`-CH₃-`) group.\n        *   **Summary for `dtq`:** We are looking for a methine proton (`-CH-`) that has one `CH` group, one `CH₂` group, and one `CH₃` group on its adjacent carbons.\n\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This indicates a different, single proton is being coupled by three different sets of vicinal neighbors.\n        *   **Doublet (d):** Coupling to **1** vicinal proton (`n=1`). This neighbor is likely another methine (`-CH-`) proton.\n        *   **Triplet (t):** Coupling to **2** vicinal protons (`n=2`). This is likely a methylene (`-CH₂-`) group.\n        *   **Another Triplet (t):** Coupling to another, non-equivalent set of **2** vicinal protons (`n=2`). This is likely a second, distinct methylene (`-CH₂-`) group.\n        *   **Summary for `dtt`:** We are looking for a methine proton (`-CH-`) that has one `CH` group and two different `CH₂` groups on its adjacent carbons.\n\n4.  **Analyze Each Candidate Structure**\n\n    *   First, we must correctly interpret the condensed structural formulas. We will determine the IUPAC name for each to be unambiguous.\n\n    *   **A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid**\n        *   Structure: `CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH`.\n        *   Analysis: `H` at C3 has vicinal neighbors `H`@C4 and `CH₂`@C2. This gives a doublet of triplets (`dt`), not a `dtq`. Incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n        *   Structure: `CH₃CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`.\n        *   Analysis: `H` at C3 has vicinal neighbors `H`@C2 and `CH₂`@C4. This gives a `dt`, not a `dtq` or `dtt`. Incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n        *   Structure: `CH₃CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-COOH`.\n        *   **`dtt` check:** The proton at C3 (`H` on `-CH(Et)-`) is adjacent to C2 and C4. It is vicinally coupled to `H`@C2 (1H, gives doublet), `CH₂`@C4 (2H, gives triplet), and the `CH₂` of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2H, gives triplet). This perfectly explains the **dtt** signal.\n        *   **`dtq` check:** The proton at C2 is coupled to `H`@C3 and the `CH₂` of the ethyl substituent on C2. This gives a `dt`. The structure lacks the environment for a `dtq`. Incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**\n        *   Let's determine the structure from the formula. It describes a chain: `CH₃ - CH(C₂H₅) - CH(C₂H₅) - CH₂ - COOH`. Finding the longest chain containing the `COOH` group gives a 6-carbon backbone (hexanoic acid) with an ethyl group at C3 and a methyl group at C4.\n        *   Structure (3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid):\n            ```\n                       CH₃ @ C4\n                       |\n            CH₃-CH₂ - CH(b) - CH(c) - CH₂ - COOH\n                               |\n                               CH₂-CH₃ @ C3\n            ```\n        *   **`dtt` check:** Let's examine proton **H(c) at C3**. Its adjacent carbons are C2, C4, and the first carbon of the ethyl substituent. It is vicinally coupled to:\n            1.  `CH₂(d)` at C2 (2H) → **triplet**\n            2.  `H(b)` at C4 (1H) → **doublet**\n            3.  `CH₂(h)` of the ethyl group (2H) → **triplet**\n            Since the two `CH₂` groups are chemically non-equivalent (diastereotopic), they split the signal separately. This environment perfectly explains the **dtt** signal.\n        *   **`dtq` check:** Let's examine proton **H(b) at C4**. Its adjacent carbons are C3, C5, and the carbon of the methyl substituent. It is vicinally coupled to:\n            1.  `H(c)` at C3 (1H) → **doublet**\n            2.  `CH₂(f)` at C5 (2H) → **triplet**\n            3.  `CH₃(a)` of the methyl group substituent (3H) → **quartet**\n            This environment perfectly explains the **dtq** signal.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nStructure B is the only candidate whose structure provides a clear origin for both the \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" signal (from the proton at C3) and the \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" signal (from the proton at C4) based on standard vicinal coupling rules.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nThe FTIR and ¹H NMR spectral data are key to distinguishing between the four possible structures.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Spectrum\n\n*   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded, as they typically form dimers.\n*   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the choices. We must use the ¹H NMR data.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Splitting Patterns\n\nThe problem states that two particularly complex signals are observed:\n1.  A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n2.  A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nThe splitting of a proton's signal is described by the **n+1 rule**, where 'n' is the number of equivalent neighboring protons. A complex splitting pattern like a `dtq` means the proton is coupled to three *different* sets of neighboring protons.\n*   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** The proton must be adjacent to:\n    *   A group with 1 proton (n=1, gives a doublet).\n    *   A group with 2 protons (n=2, gives a triplet).\n    *   A group with 3 protons (n=3, gives a quartet).\n*   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** The proton must be adjacent to:\n    *   A group with 1 proton (n=1, gives a doublet).\n    *   A group with 2 protons (n=2, gives a triplet).\n    *   *Another, chemically non-equivalent* group with 2 protons (n=2, gives another triplet).\n\n### Step 3: Examine Each Candidate Structure\n\nLet's analyze the protons in each molecule to see which one would produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal. The formulas given are condensed. Let's expand them for clarity.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    `¹COOH - ²CH(CH₃) - ³CH(CH₃) - ⁴CH₂ - ⁵CH₃`\n    Let's check the methine (CH) proton at position 3 (H₃):\n    *   It is coupled to the H at C2 (1 proton, doublet).\n    *   It is coupled to the CH₂ at C4 (2 protons, triplet).\n    *   It is coupled to the methyl group at C3 (3 protons, quartet).\n    *   This H₃ proton would indeed give a **dtq** signal. However, no other proton in this molecule gives a `dtt` signal. For example, H₂ is a `dq`. So, this molecule is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid)**\n    The formula is best interpreted as `¹COOH - ²CH₂ - ³CH(C₂H₅) - ⁴CH(C₂H₅) - ⁵CH₃`.\n    Let's analyze the two key methine (CH) protons:\n    *   **Proton at C4 (H₄):**\n        *   It is coupled to the H at C3 (1 proton, doublet).\n        *   It is coupled to the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2 protons, triplet).\n        *   It is coupled to the CH₃ at C5 (3 protons, quartet).\n        *   This H₄ proton gives a **dtq** signal.\n    *   **Proton at C3 (H₃):**\n        *   It is coupled to the H at C4 (1 proton, doublet).\n        *   It is coupled to the CH₂ at C2 (2 protons, triplet).\n        *   It is coupled to the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2 protons, triplet).\n        *   This H₃ proton gives a **dtt** signal.\n    *   This molecule contains protons that would produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal. This is our correct candidate.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    `¹COOH - ²CH₂ - ³CH(CH₃) - ⁴CH(CH₃) - ⁵CH₃`\n    Let's check the methine proton at position 3 (H₃):\n    *   It is coupled to H at C4 (1 proton, doublet).\n    *   It is coupled to the CH₂ at C2 (2 protons, triplet).\n    *   It is coupled to the methyl group at C3 (3 protons, quartet).\n    *   This H₃ proton gives a **dtq** signal. However, there is no proton that gives a `dtt` signal. So, this molecule is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    `¹COOH - ²CH(C₂H₅) - ³CH(C₂H₅) - ⁴CH₂ - ⁵CH₃`\n    Let's check the methine proton at position 3 (H₃):\n    *   It is coupled to H at C2 (1 proton, doublet).\n    *   It is coupled to the CH₂ at C4 (2 protons, triplet).\n    *   It is coupled to the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2 protons, triplet).\n    *   This H₃ proton gives a **dtt** signal. However, there is no proton that gives a `dtq` signal in this molecule. H₂ is a `dt`. So, this molecule is incorrect.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nOnly the structure corresponding to option B, `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`, has protons that would exhibit both a doublet of triplets of quartets (`dtq`) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (`dtt`) in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR (Fourier-Transform Infrared) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid. The broadening is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) double bond in a carboxylic acid.\n    *   This information confirms that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data is consistent with all of them but does not distinguish between them.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR (Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **No vinyl hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H). All four structures are saturated alkanoic acids, so this information is consistent with all options.\n    *   **Complex Splitting Patterns:** The key to identifying the correct structure lies in the detailed splitting patterns, which are determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons (`n+1` rule).\n        *   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This means a single proton is being split by three different sets of neighboring protons: one neighboring proton (n=1, causing a doublet), a set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, causing a triplet), and a set of three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3, causing a quartet). The order (dtq) depends on the magnitude of the coupling constants (J-values), but the essential information is the neighbor count: 1, 2, and 3.\n        *   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This means a single proton is being split by three different sets of neighboring protons: one neighboring proton (n=1, causing a doublet), a set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, causing a triplet), and another distinct set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, causing another triplet). The neighbor count is 1, 2, and 2.\n\n### Evaluation of Possible Structures\n\nLet's analyze the proton environments in each molecule, focusing on the protons on chiral centers (the `C(H)` parts of the chain), as they have the most complex environments.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C4 is coupled to the proton at C3 (1H), and the protons of the adjacent methyl group (3H). This would give a doublet of quartets (dq).\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C4 (1H) and the protons of the adjacent CH₂ group (2H). This would give a doublet of triplets (dt).\n    *   This structure does not produce a `dtq` or a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C4 is coupled to the proton at C3 (1H) and the protons of two adjacent methyl groups (6H). This would result in a doublet of septets.\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C4 (1H), the protons of its adjacent methyl group (3H), and the protons of the adjacent CH₂ group (2H). This would be a very complex signal (dqt - doublet of quartets of triplets).\n    *   This structure does not match the observed `dtq` and `dtt` signals.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 (`-CH(Et)COOH`) is coupled to the proton at C2 (1H, from the ethyl group attached to it), and the proton at C4 (1H). Wait, the proton at C2 is on the same carbon as the COOH. Let's re-examine the structure based on the name: `CH₃CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-COOH`.\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C2 (1H), the proton at C4 (1H) and the protons of the CH₂ group of its ethyl substituent (2H). This would be a ddt (doublet of doublets of triplets).\n    *   The proton at C2 is coupled to the proton at C3 (1H) and the protons of the CH₂ group of its ethyl substituent (2H). This gives a doublet of triplets (dt).\n    *   While this structure has a complex signal, it does not have the required combination of a `dtq` and a `dtt`.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n    Let's analyze the structure implied by this formula: `CH₃(5)-CH(Hₐ)(4)(C₂H₅)-CH(H♭)(3)(C₂H₅)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`.\n    *   **Proton H♭ (at position 3):**\n        *   It is adjacent to the two protons on C2 (n=2), which will split it into a **triplet**.\n        *   It is adjacent to the single proton Hₐ on C4 (n=1), which will split the signal further into a **doublet**.\n        *   It is also adjacent to the two protons of the CH₂ group on its own ethyl substituent (n=2), causing a further split into a **triplet**.\n        *   Therefore, the signal for H♭ is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n    *   **Proton Hₐ (at position 4):**\n        *   It is adjacent to the three protons on the terminal methyl group at C5 (n=3), which will split it into a **quartet**.\n        *   It is adjacent to the single proton H♭ on C3 (n=1), which will split the signal further into a **doublet**.\n        *   It is also adjacent to the two protons of the CH₂ group on its own ethyl substituent (n=2), causing a further split into a **triplet**.\n        *   Therefore, the signal for Hₐ is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the second observed signal.\n\nThis molecule is the only one that contains protons matching both of the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR data.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in this region (specifically 2500-3300 cm⁻¹) is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretching in a carboxylic acid that has formed a hydrogen-bonded dimer.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** A strong absorption peak between 1690-1760 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a C=O (carbonyl) group. When seen with a broad O-H peak, it confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this data confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe key to distinguishing between the four isomers lies in the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR spectrum. The \"n+1 rule\" states that a proton signal is split into n+1 peaks by n adjacent, equivalent protons. When a proton is adjacent to multiple, *non-equivalent* sets of protons, it results in more complex patterns like doublets of triplets.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds, which is consistent with all four proposed structures.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This indicates a proton is coupled to three different, non-equivalent neighboring groups:\n    *   A single proton (causes the **doublet**)\n    *   A -CH₂- group (causes the **triplet**)\n    *   A -CH₃ group (causes the **quartet**)\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This indicates a different proton is coupled to three different, non-equivalent neighboring groups:\n    *   A single proton (causes the **doublet**)\n    *   A -CH₂- group (causes the first **triplet**)\n    *   Another, different -CH₂- group (causes the second **triplet**)\n\n### 3. Evaluating Each Structure\n\nLet's analyze the proton environments for each option to see which one matches *both* described splitting patterns. The protons on the main carbon chain (methine protons, -CH-) will show the most complex splitting.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   This structure has a proton that would be split by another single proton and two different -CH₂- groups, producing a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n*   However, it lacks a proton that is adjacent to a single proton, a -CH₂- group, AND a -CH₃ group. Therefore, it cannot produce the required `dtq` signal.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\nLet's number the main chain starting from the -COOH group:\n`HOOC(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(CH₂CH₃)-C(4)H(CH₂CH₃)-C(5)H₃`\n*   **H-3:** This proton is adjacent to the -CH₂- group at C2 (2 neighbors → triplet), the proton at C4 (1 neighbor → doublet), and the -CH₂- of its own ethyl group (2 neighbors → triplet). This creates a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal described.\n*   **H-4:** This proton is adjacent to the proton at C3 (1 neighbor → doublet), the -CH₃ group at C5 (3 neighbors → quartet), and the -CH₂- of its own ethyl group (2 neighbors → triplet). This creates a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** (the order might vary depending on coupling constants, but the multiplicities are correct). This matches the first signal described.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   This structure contains a proton that would produce a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   However, it does not contain any proton that is adjacent to one proton and two different -CH₂- groups. Therefore, it cannot produce the required `dtt` signal.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   The methine protons in this molecule do not have the correct neighbors to produce either a `dtq` or a `dtt` pattern according to the n+1 rule. For example, the proton at C3 is coupled to a -CH₂- group, a -CH- group, and a -CH₃ group, which would result in a triplet of doublets of quartets.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nOnly structure B, **CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**, contains protons that perfectly match both of the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR data.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nTo identify the unknown compound, the provided spectroscopic data must be systematically compared with the expected spectra for each of the four possible structures.\n\n### Step 1: Analysis of FTIR Data\n\nThe FTIR spectrum shows two key features:\n*   **A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid. The peak is notably broad due to the strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\nAll four given options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids. Therefore, the FTIR data confirms the presence of the carboxylic acid functional group but does not help in distinguishing between the different alkyl structures.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe ¹H NMR data provides the most crucial information for determining the exact structure.\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H), confirming the compound is saturated. All four options are saturated and consistent with this observation.\n*   **A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex splitting pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton, causing a doublet (**d**) splitting.\n    *   Two neighboring protons (like a CH₂ group), causing a triplet (**t**) splitting.\n    *   Three neighboring protons (like a CH₃ group), causing a quartet (**q**) splitting.\n*   **A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern occurs when a proton is coupled to:\n    *   One neighboring proton, causing a doublet (**d**) splitting.\n    *   Two neighboring protons (a CH₂ group), causing a triplet (**t**) splitting.\n    *   Another group of two neighboring protons (a second CH₂ group), causing another triplet (**t**) splitting.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluating Each Candidate Structure\n\nLet's analyze the expected ¹H NMR splitting patterns for the single protons (methine or CH groups) in each molecule, as these are most likely to exhibit such complex splitting.\n\n**A) CH₃CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   The proton on C3 is adjacent to the CH₂ at C2 (2H, triplet), the CH at C4 (1H, doublet), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H, quartet). This would result in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   The proton on C4 is adjacent to the CH at C3 (1H, doublet), its own CH₃ group (3H, quartet), and the terminal CH₃ group (3H, quartet). This would be a doublet of quartets of quartets (dqq).\n*   This molecule has a `dtq` but lacks a `dtt`.\n\n**B) CH₃CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (Interpreted as 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid)**\nThe condensed formula for B is ambiguous. Interpreting the carbon backbone and substituent placement leads to the IUPAC name 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid:\n`CH₃(f)-CH₂(e)-CH(d)(CH₃)-CH(c)(C₂H₅)-CH₂(b)-COOH(a)`\n*   The proton on C3, H(c), is coupled to the CH on C4 (1H, doublet), the CH₂ group at C2 (2H, triplet), and the CH₂ group of its ethyl substituent (2H, triplet). This signal would be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n*   The proton on C4, H(d), is coupled to the CH on C3 (1H, doublet), the CH₂ group at C5 (2H, triplet), and the CH₃ substituent on C4 (3H, quartet). This signal would be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   This molecule is the only candidate that produces both a `dtt` and a `dtq` signal.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   The proton on C3 is adjacent to the CH₂ at C4 (2H, triplet), the CH at C2 (1H, doublet), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H, quartet). This would be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   The proton on C2 is adjacent to the CH at C3 (1H, doublet) and the CH₃ on C2 (3H, quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq).\n*   This molecule has a `dtq` but does not have a `dtt`.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)COOH (Interpreted as 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n`CH₃-CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-COOH`\n*   The proton on C3 is coupled to the CH₂ at C4 (2H, triplet), the CH at C2 (1H, doublet), and the CH₂ of its ethyl substituent (2H, triplet). This would result in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n*   The proton on C2 is coupled to the CH at C3 (1H, doublet) and the CH₂ of its ethyl substituent (2H, triplet), giving a doublet of triplets (dt).\n*   This molecule has a `dtt` but lacks a `dtq`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the ¹H NMR splitting patterns, only compound B, 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, is consistent with the observation of both a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound:\n\n**1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid that is undergoing hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not help distinguish between the structures.\n\n**2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the specific splitting patterns (multiplicity) of the proton signals.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds, which is true for all four candidate structures.\n*   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1, gives a doublet).\n    *   A set of two adjacent protons (n=2, gives a triplet).\n    *   A set of three adjacent protons (n=3, gives a quartet).\n*   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1, gives a doublet).\n    *   A set of two adjacent protons (n=2, gives a triplet).\n    *   Another, non-equivalent set of two adjacent protons (n=2, gives another triplet).\n\nNow let's examine each structure to see if it would produce these signals.

Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a characteristic feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion:** The FTIR data confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). All four possible compounds (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the class of compound but does not distinguish between the options.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe key to identifying the correct structure lies in analyzing the complex splitting patterns described. The splitting of a proton's signal is determined by the number of non-equivalent protons on adjacent carbons.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates there are no protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H), which is consistent with all four saturated structures.\n\n*   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):**\n    *   This complex splitting means a single proton is being split by three different groups of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** The proton has one proton neighbor (a CH group).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** The proton has two equivalent proton neighbors (a CH₂ group).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** The proton has three equivalent proton neighbors (a CH₃ group).\n    *   Therefore, the proton that gives this signal must be attached to a carbon that is bonded to a **CH** group, a **CH₂** group, and a **CH₃** group.\n\n*   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):**\n    *   This pattern indicates a single proton is split by three different groups of neighbors.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** The proton has one proton neighbor (a CH group).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** The proton has two equivalent proton neighbors (a CH₂ group).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** The proton has another, different set of two equivalent proton neighbors (a second CH₂ group).\n    *   Therefore, the proton responsible for this signal must be attached to a carbon that is bonded to a **CH** group, a **CH₂** group, and another, non-equivalent **CH₂** group.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Candidate Structures\n\nNow, we must find which molecule contains *both* a proton in a `dtq` environment and a *different* proton in a `dtt` environment.\n\nLet's use IUPAC names for clarity:\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH:** 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH:** 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH:** 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH:** 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid\n\n**Analysis of Structure A (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):** `CH₃CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`\n*   The proton on C3 is adjacent to the CH on C2, the CH₂ on C4, and the methyl group on C3. This environment (`CH`, `CH₂`, `CH₃`) creates a **dtq** signal.\n*   This molecule lacks a proton adjacent to a `CH` and two separate `CH₂` groups. Thus, it cannot produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n**Analysis of Structure C (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):** `CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH`\n*   The proton on C3 is adjacent to the CH on C4, the CH₂ on C2, and the methyl group on C3. This creates a **dtq** signal.\n*   This molecule also lacks the environment needed to produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n**Analysis of Structure D (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid):** `CH₃CH₂-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`\n*   The proton on C3 is adjacent to the CH on C4, the CH₂ on C2, and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C3. This environment (`CH`, `CH₂`, `CH₂`) creates a **dtt** signal.\n*   The proton on C4 is adjacent to the CH on C3, the CH₂ on C5, and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C4. This also creates a **dtt** signal.\n*   This molecule lacks a proton adjacent to a `CH`, `CH₂`, and `CH₃` group, and thus cannot produce a `dtq` signal.\n\n**Analysis of Structure B (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid):** `CH₃CH₂-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-COOH`\nLet's analyze the connectivity: `CH₃(g)CH₂(f)-C(3)H(C(e)H₂CH₃(d))-C(2)H(C(c)H₂CH₃(b))-COOH`\n*   **dtt signal:** The proton on C3 is adjacent to the CH on C2, the CH₂ on C(f) (from the main chain), and the CH₂ on C(e) (from the ethyl substituent). This environment (`CH`, `CH₂`, `CH₂`) perfectly describes the requirement for a **dtt** signal.\n*   **dtq signal:** Now we must find the proton with `CH`, `CH₂`, and `CH₃` neighbors. A careful look at the structure reveals that no single proton has this exact combination of neighboring groups. However, the question states that both signals are observed. In complex chiral molecules, protons that are chemically different (diastereotopic), like the two protons on the CH₂ of an ethyl group next to a chiral center, can have complex splitting. The proton `H(2)` is coupled to `H(3)` (1H) and the `CH₂(c)` (2H), which would produce a doublet of triplets (`dt`). It is the proton `H(3)` that is uniquely positioned to give the highly specific `dtt` pattern. The only way to also obtain a `dtq` is if another proton in the molecule, likely one of the diastereotopic methylene protons on an ethyl group, gives rise to a complex multiplet that is being described as a `dtq`. Given the definitive `dtt` signal arising from H(3), structure B is the only plausible candidate among the choices that can produce this specific pattern.\n\nSince only structure B can generate the clear doublet of triplets of triplets (`dtt`) signal from the proton at the C3 position, it is the most logical choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data:**\n*   A broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n*   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but doesn't distinguish between the choices.\n\n**2. Analysis of 1H NMR Data:**\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds, which is true for all four saturated structures.\n*   The key to solving this problem lies in the complex splitting patterns observed for two different protons in the molecule.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** For a signal to be split this way, the corresponding proton must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: one set with 1 proton (to give the doublet), one set with 2 protons (to give the triplet), and one set with 3 protons (to give the quartet).\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** This means a different proton in the same molecule must be coupled to three different sets of neighbors: one set with 1 proton (to give the doublet), one set with 2 protons (to give the first triplet), and another set with 2 protons (to give the second triplet).\n\n**3. Structural Analysis of Each Option:**\n\nWe will now examine the structure of each option to see which one possesses two protons with the specific neighboring environments required to produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt`. Let's denote methine protons (C-H) on the main chain as Hₐ, Hₑ, etc.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH:** This structure has a proton that would show a `dtq` pattern (the H on the carbon next to the CH₂COOH group), but no proton that would show a `dtt`.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH:** This structure has a proton that would show a `dtt` pattern (Hₐ, which is adjacent to Hₑ and two different CH₂ groups), but it does not have a proton environment that would produce a `dtq`.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH:** This structure has a proton that would show a `dtq` pattern (the H on the carbon attached to the ethyl group), but it lacks a proton that would show a `dtt`.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH:** Let's draw this structure and analyze its key protons.\n    ```\n          (Ethyl)   (Ethyl)\n            |         |\n       CH₃--C(Hₐ) --- C(Hₑ) --- CH₂ --- COOH\n    ```\n    *   **Analysis of Hₐ:** This proton is adjacent to:\n        1.  The `CH₃` group at the end of the chain (3 protons).\n        2.  The methine proton `Hₑ` (1 proton).\n        3.  The `CH₂` of its attached ethyl group (2 protons).\n        The neighbors for Hₐ are (1H, 2H, 3H). This environment will produce a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n\n    *   **Analysis of Hₑ:** This proton is adjacent to:\n        1.  The methine proton `Hₐ` (1 proton).\n        2.  The `CH₂` group next to the `COOH` (2 protons).\n        3.  The `CH₂` of its attached ethyl group (2 protons).\n        The neighbors for Hₑ are (1H, 2H, 2H). This environment will produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nStructure C is the only compound that has two different protons with the correct neighboring environments to produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n```python\n# Final Answer Selection\n# Based on the step-by-step analysis of the spectral data provided, we have deduced the structure of the unknown compound.\n# The FTIR data confirmed the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n# The key to identifying the specific isomer was the 1H NMR data, which showed two unique, complex signals:\n# 1.

The broadness is due to the varying strengths of these bonds.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a saturated carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four given options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this confirms the functional group present but does not yet distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data (General)**\n\n*   **\"none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens\"**: Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached to carbon atoms of a C=C double bond. Their absence confirms that the molecule is saturated (contains no C=C double bonds). All four options are saturated molecules, so this information is consistent with all of them.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data (Splitting Patterns)**\n\nThis is the most crucial part of the analysis. We need to find the structure that contains a proton with a \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" (dtq) multiplicity and another proton with a \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" (dtt) multiplicity.\n\n*   A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: one neighboring proton (n=1, gives a doublet), a set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, gives a triplet), and a set of three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3, gives a quartet).\n*   A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: one neighboring proton (n=1, gives a doublet), a set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, gives a triplet), and another different set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, gives another triplet).\n\nLet's analyze the structure of each option. The condensed formulas need careful interpretation. Let's assume they describe a main chain with substituents.\n\n**Analysis of Option A: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\n\nLet's interpret this formula as a chain: `(CH₃)(C₂H₅)CH` group connected to a `CH(C₂H₅)` group, which is connected to a `CH₂COOH` group.\nLet's draw this out:\n```\n      CH₂CH₃ (ethyl on C(a))\n      |\n  CH₃--CH(a)--CH(b)--CH₂--COOH\n                 |\n                 CH₂CH₃ (ethyl on C(b))\n```\nTo understand the splitting, we first need to identify the longest carbon chain that includes the COOH group.\nThe longest chain is: `COOH(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(b)(3)-CH(a)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\nThis makes the molecule **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**.\n\nNow let's analyze the splitting for the two methine protons, H(a) and H(b).\n*   **Proton H(b) at C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n    1.  The two protons on C2 (`-CH₂-COOH`): `n=2`, gives a **triplet**.\n    2.  The one proton on C4 (H(a)): `n=1`, gives a **doublet**.\n    3.  The two protons on its own ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`): `n=2`, gives a **triplet**.\n    Therefore, the signal for H(b) is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n\n*   **Proton H(a) at C4:** This proton is coupled to:\n    1.  The two protons on C5 (`-CH₂CH₃`): `n=2`, gives a **triplet**.\n    2.  The one proton on C3 (H(b)): `n=1`, gives a **doublet**.\n    3.  The three protons of the methyl group on C4: `n=3`, gives a **quartet**.\n    Therefore, the signal for H(a) is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the second required signal.\nSince this structure has both a `dtt` and a `dtq` signal, it is a very strong candidate.\n\n**Analysis of Option B: CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\n\nThis is 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid.\nThe two methine protons are on C3 and C4.\n*   **Proton at C3:** Coupled to H on C4 (d), CH₃ on C3 (q), and CH₂ on C2 (t). This gives a **doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**.\n*   **Proton at C4:** Coupled to H on C3 (d) and the two CH₃ groups on C4 and C5 (which are equivalent due to being part of an isopropyl group, `n=6`). This gives a **doublet of septets**.\nThis molecule has a `dqt` signal, but it does not have a `dtt` signal. So, B is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option C: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\n\nThis is 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid.\nThe two methine protons are on C2 and C3.\n*   **Proton at C2:** Coupled to H on C3 (d) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (t). This gives a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n*   **Proton at C3:** Coupled to H on C2 (d), the CH₂ of its ethyl group (t), and the CH₂ on C4 (t). This gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\nThis molecule has a `dtt` signal, but it does not have a `dtq` signal. So, C is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option D: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\n\nThis is 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid.\nThe two methine protons are on C2 and C3.\n*   **Proton at C2:** Coupled to H on C3 (d) and the CH₃ on C2 (q). This gives a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n*   **Proton at C3:** Coupled to H on C2 (d), the CH₃ on C3 (q), and the CH₂ on C4 (t). This gives a **doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**.\nThis molecule has a `dqt` signal, but it does not have a `dtt` signal. So, D is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the structure corresponding to option A, which is 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, gives rise to both a `doublet of triplets of quartets` signal and a `doublet of triplets of triplets` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### 1.

The key pieces of information from the NMR spectrum are the presence of a \"doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)\" and a \"doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)\". The FTIR data, with a broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ (O-H stretch) and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ (C=O stretch), confirm the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group, which all four candidates possess.\n\nLet's break down the expected splitting patterns for the protons on the main carbon chain of each molecule. Splitting patterns arise from the interaction of a proton with its neighboring non-equivalent protons (n), following the n+1 rule. When a proton is coupled to multiple, different groups of neighbors, we see more complex patterns like doublets of triplets.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid)**\n    *   Let's label the carbons starting from the COOH group: HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Et)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6).\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the two protons at C2 (a triplet), the single proton at C4 (a doublet), and the two protons of its ethyl group's CH₂ (another triplet). This would result in a **triplet of doublets of triplets (tdt)**.\n    *   The proton at C4 is coupled to the single proton at C3 (a doublet), the two protons at C5 (a triplet), and the two protons of its ethyl group's CH₂ (another triplet). This creates a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   This molecule perfectly matches one of the observed signals (dtt). Let's now search for a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq). A dtq requires a proton to be coupled to one proton (d), two protons (t), and three protons (q). No single proton in this molecule fits this description. For example, the CH₂ at C5 is coupled to the proton at C4 (doublet) and the methyl group at C6 (quartet), but also has geminal coupling, resulting in a complex multiplet, likely a doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq).\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Me)-CH(4)(Me)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6).\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the two protons at C2 (triplet), the one proton at C4 (doublet), and the three protons of its methyl group (quartet). This results in a **triplet of doublets of quartets (tdq)**, which can also be described as a dtq depending on coupling constants.\n    *   The proton at C4 is coupled to the one proton at C3 (doublet), the two protons at C5 (triplet), and the three protons of its methyl group (quartet). This also gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   This molecule (B) has two signals that could be described as `dtq` but lacks a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: HOOC(1)-CH(2)(Me)-CH(3)(Me)-CH₂(4)-CH₃(5).\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the one proton at C2 (doublet), the two protons at C4 (triplet), and the three protons of its methyl group (quartet). This gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   This matches one of the required signals. However, looking for a `dtt` proton reveals none. The proton at C2 is a doublet of quartets (dq). Therefore, this molecule does not match all the data.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: HOOC(1)-CH(2)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(4)-CH₃(5).\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the one proton at C2 (doublet), the two protons of its ethyl group's CH₂ (triplet), and the two protons at C4 (triplet). This gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   The proton at C2 is coupled to the one proton at C3 (doublet) and the two protons of its ethyl group's CH₂ (triplet), resulting in a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n    *   Therefore, this molecule provides the `dtt` signal but lacks the `dtq` signal.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, none of the molecules seem to possess both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal. However, let's re-examine molecule A. It was previously assigned as having a `dtt` but not a `dtq`. It's possible there's a misunderstanding in my structural assignment from the condensed formula. Let's strictly follow the written formula for A: `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`. This represents 3,4-diethylhexanoic acid.\n\nThere seems to be a contradiction in the provided data versus the expected patterns for the given options. Let's reconsider molecule **A: 3,4-diethylhexanoic acid.**\n- Proton at C4: `dtt`. Confirmed match.\n- Proton at C3: `dtt` (or more accurately, tdt). Close, but not a dtq.\n\nLet's re-examine **molecule B: 3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid.**\n- Proton at C4: `dtq`. Confirmed match.\n- Proton at C3: `dtq`. Confirmed match.\nThis molecule has two `dtq` signals. It does not have a `dtt` signal.\n\nGiven the choices, and the high complexity of these molecules, there might be an intended answer where one structure is considered the best fit despite apparent discrepancies. Let's assume there is no error in the question.\n\nIf we revisit Molecule A: 3,4-diethylhexanoic acid, we confidently identified a proton (H4) with a **dtt** pattern. Now, we must find a proton that gives a **dtq** pattern. Let's look at the methylene protons (H5) on the main chain: `...CH(H4)-CH₂(H5)-CH₃(H6)`. These two H5 protons are diastereotopic. Each will be split by H4 (one proton, giving a doublet), H6 (three protons, giving a quartet), and the other H5 proton (geminal coupling, giving a doublet). This results in a doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq), not a dtq. The same logic applies to the CH₂ groups in the ethyl substituents.\n\nLet's re-evaluate Molecule B: 3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid. We found two protons (H3 and H4) that give a **dtq** signal. We need a **dtt**. No proton in this molecule couples to two different sets of two protons.\n\nLet's reconsider all options and the possibility of a subtle interpretation. The most complex and distinct signals described are the `dtt` and `dtq`. Molecule B provides a clear origin for a `dtq` (in fact, two of them). Molecule A provides a clear origin for a `dtt`. It's highly probable the correct structure must contain the features to produce both.\n\nLet's re-read the options one more time to ensure no misinterpretation of the condensed formulas.\nA) `CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH` (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid)\nB) `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH` (3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid)\nC) `CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH` (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)\nD) `CH3-CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH` (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)\n\nMy initial analyses stand:\n- A has a `dtt`.\n- B has a `dtq`.\n- C has a `dtq`.\n- D has a `dtt`.\n\nThis implies a potential error in the problem statement or options, as no single molecule has both signals. However, in multiple-choice questions of this nature, we must select the *best* possible answer. Let's assume there is a typographical error and that one of the molecules is the intended answer. Without further information, it's impossible to be certain.\n\nHowever, let's look at the structures again. Both `dtt` and `dtq` are highly complex splitting patterns arising from a single proton having three distinct groups of neighboring protons.\n- Proton for a `dtt` signal couples to (1H), (2H), and (2H).\n- Proton for a `dtq` signal couples to (1H), (2H), and (3H).\n\nThe structure in option A, **3,4-diethylhexanoic acid**, has protons that fit this environment.\n- The proton at C4 couples to H3 (1H), the CH₂ at C5 (2H), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H). This gives the **dtt**.\n- The proton at C3 couples to H4 (1H), the CH₂ at C2 (2H), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H). This gives another **dtt** (technically a triplet of doublets of triplets).\n\nLet's carefully check the methylene protons of the ethyl group at C4: `...CH(H4)-CH₂(H_Et)-CH₃`. The two `H_Et` protons are diastereotopic. Let's analyze one of them. It is coupled to H4 (1H, doublet), its geminal partner (1H, doublet), and the methyl group (3H, quartet). This gives a **doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq)**.\n\nIt seems my initial analysis is correct and there's an inconsistency in the question. However, if forced to choose the most plausible answer, let's reconsider the possibility of overlapping signals or similar coupling constants. In molecule B, both methine protons (H3 and H4) are `dtq`. It is the only structure that produces a `dtq`. Perhaps the `dtt` signal arises from a complex multiplet that appears like a `dtt` due to specific J-coupling values. This is less likely than finding a molecule that structurally fits both descriptions. Given the clear mismatch, there is ambiguity.\n\nLet's assume there is an error in my analysis and reconsider B.\n**B: 3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid:**\n`HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Me)-CH(4)(Me)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n- H3: Coupled to H2(2H, t), H4(1H, d), C3-Me(3H, q). → `tdq` (or `dtq`). **MATCH.**\n- H4: Coupled to H3(1H, d), H5(2H, t), C4-Me(3H, q). → `dtq`. **MATCH.**\n- This molecule definitively has a `dtq` signal. It does not have a `dtt` signal.\n\nSince Molecule B, 3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid, is the only option that contains a proton environment that results in a doublet of triplets of quartets (`dtq`), this is the most likely answer, assuming there might be an error in the reporting of the second signal or it arises from a more complex, less ideal pattern.\n\nFinal Check: Let's assume B is correct. We have a clear `dtq` (from H4). We also need a `dtt`. Where could it come from? There are no protons in B that are coupled to a 1H neighbor, a 2H neighbor, and another 2H neighbor. The analysis remains inconsistent with the question.\n\nGiven the options, and the fact that a doublet of triplets of quartets (`dtq`) arises from a proton adjacent to a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group, let's analyze the skeletons:\n- A: -CH(Et)-**CH(Et)**-CH₂-\n- B: -CH(Me)-**CH(Me)**-CH₂- -> H coupled to CH, CH₂, CH₃. **This gives a dtq.**\n- C: -CH(Me)-**CH(Me)**-CH₂- -> H coupled to CH, CH₂, CH₃. **This gives a dtq.**\n- D: -CH(Et)-**CH(Et)**-CH₂-\n\nBoth B and C have a proton that will give a `dtq`. Let's analyze the `dtt` part again. This requires coupling to a CH, a CH₂, and another CH₂.\n- A: -CH(Et)-**CH(Et)**-CH₂- -> H coupled to CH, CH₂, CH₂(Et). **This gives a dtt.**\n- B: No such environment.\n- C: No such environment.\n- D: -CH(Et)-**CH(Et)**-CH₂- -> H coupled to CH, CH₂, CH₂(Et). **This gives a dtt.**\n\nSo, we have:\n- A: has `dtt`, no `dtq`\n- B: has `dtq`, no `dtt`\n- C: has `dtq`, no `dtt`\n- D: has `dtt`, no `dtq`\n\nThis is a flawed question. However, if a choice must be made, there might be a typo in one of the structures. Let's imagine structure B had one ethyl group and one methyl group: `CH3-CH2-CH(Me)-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`.\nThe proton on the carbon with the ethyl would be coupled to a CH(1H), a CH₂(2H), and another CH₂(2H), giving a `dtt`. The proton on the carbon with the methyl would be coupled to a CH(1H), a CH₂(2H), and a CH₃(3H), giving a `dtq`. This hypothetical molecule fits the data perfectly. Since this exact structure is not an option, and both A and B possess parts of the required features, a definitive answer from the provided list is problematic. Let's stick with the most unique feature. The `dtq` signal from B and C is very specific. The `dtt` from A and D is also specific. Since no molecule has both, I cannot logically conclude an answer. Assuming there is a typo in the question and only one of the signals is correct and diagnostic, this is still ambiguous.\n\nHowever, let's take a final look at B. It is 3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid. It definitively has a proton coupled to a CH, a CH2, and a CH3, yielding a `dtq`. It is the only structure with this specific combination of methyl and other groups to create this pattern. The other signal, `dtt`, does not fit. Let's assume the question meant a different complex multiplet, or there's an error. Between the choices, B is the strongest candidate for the `dtq` signal.\n\nFinal decision based on finding the required patterns. No molecule fits both. But both B and C offer a `dtq`. Both A and D offer a `dtt`. There must be an error in the question. But if forced to select, I'll review again.\n\nRe-evaluating B: `CH3-CH(Me)-CH(Me)-CH2-COOH` (3,4-dimethyl**hexanoic** acid). My previous analysis for B (`-CH(Me)-CH(Me)-CH₂-`) was incorrect.\nThe structure is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(Me)-CH(Me)-CH₂-COOH`. Let's re-analyze `3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid`.\nHOC(1)O-CH₂(2)-C(3)H(Me)-C(4)H(Me)-C(5)H₂-C(6)H₃.\nH4: coupled to H3(d), H5(t), C4-Me(q). This is a **dtq**.\nH3: coupled to H4(d), H2(t), C3-Me(q). This is also a **dtq**.\nSo B has `dtq` signals, but no `dtt`. My initial analysis was correct. Let's go with B as it's the only one providing the dtq signal. It's possible \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" was a mistake for the second `dtq` or another complex multiplet.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of the O-H stretching vibration found in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\nConclusion from FTIR: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group present but does not differentiate between the choices.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H). All four given structures are saturated alkanoic acids, consistent with this observation.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex splitting pattern arises when a single proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **doublet**.\n    *   A group of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), which splits the signal into a **triplet**.\n    *   A group of three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3), which splits the signal into a **quartet**.\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern occurs when a single proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a **doublet**.\n    *   A group of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing a **triplet**.\n    *   Another, different group of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing a second **triplet**.\n\nThe presence of both of these highly specific signals in the spectrum is the key to identifying the correct structure.\n\n### **3. Structural Analysis of the Options**\n\nWe must now examine the structure of each candidate molecule to determine if its protons would produce these specific splitting patterns. The condensed formulas provided are unconventional, so we must deduce the correct connectivity that results in a stable molecule.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C2 (1H), the CH₂ group at C4 (2H), and the methyl group at C3 (3H). This would result in a **dtq**.\n    *   However, there is no proton in this molecule that is coupled to one proton, a group of two protons, and another distinct group of two protons. Therefore, it would not produce a **dtt** signal.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH:** Interpreted as a linear chain (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid), this structure is impossible as it would require a carbon atom to have five bonds.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C4 (1H), the CH₂ group at C2 (2H), and the methyl group at C3 (3H). This would result in a **dtq**.\n    *   Similar to structure A, there is no proton environment that would lead to a **dtt** signal.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH:** The molecular formula for this compound is C₉H₁₈O₂. Although written unconventionally, this formula can represent **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**. Let's analyze its structure:\n    `HOOC-CH₂(a)-CH(b)(CH₂CH₃)-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃`\n\n    *   **Proton at C4 (Hc):** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The proton at C3 (Hb) (1H, **doublet**).\n        *   The adjacent CH₂ group of the hexanoic chain (2H, **triplet**).\n        *   The adjacent methyl (CH₃) group (3H, **quartet**).\n        *   This proton's signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n\n    *   **Proton at C3 (Hb):** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The proton at C4 (Hc) (1H, **doublet**).\n        *   The adjacent CH₂(a) group next to the COOH (2H, **triplet**).\n        *   The adjacent CH₂ group of its own ethyl substituent (2H, **triplet**).\n        *   This proton's signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second observed signal.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOnly the structure corresponding to option C, 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, possesses protons in the precise chemical environments required to produce both a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is undergoing hydrogen bonding. The broadness is a key characteristic.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group type but does not help distinguish between the specific structures.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR spectrum. We need to find the molecule whose structure can produce both of these signals.\n\nThe multiplicity of a proton's signal is determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons (n) according to the n+1 rule. For complex splitting, a proton is coupled to multiple, different sets of neighboring protons.\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   This means a single proton is being split by three different groups of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Indicates coupling to 1 adjacent proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Indicates coupling to 2 adjacent protons (n=2), typically a CH₂ group.\n    *   **Quartet (q):** Indicates coupling to 3 adjacent protons (n=3), typically a CH₃ group.\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a CH proton that is vicinally coupled to a CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group. This means the carbon atom bearing our target proton must be directly bonded to the carbons of a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group.\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   This means a different single proton is being split by three different groups of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Indicates coupling to 1 adjacent proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Indicates coupling to 2 adjacent protons (n=2).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Indicates coupling to another, different set of 2 adjacent protons (n=2).\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a CH proton that is vicinally coupled to one CH group and two different CH₂ groups.\n\n### **3. Evaluation of Candidate Structures**\n\nLet's analyze the connectivity of each proposed structure to see if they can produce these specific splitting patterns. We'll focus on the CH (methine) protons, as they are the most likely to have such complex environments. Let's assume the condensed formulas represent a linear carbon backbone with the bracketed groups as substituents.\n\n*   **A) `CH₃CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH` (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The `CH` at position 3 has neighbors: a `CH₂` (at C4) and a `CH` (at C2). This would give a doublet of triplets (dt).\n    *   The `CH` at position 2 has neighbors: a `CH` (at C3) and a `CH₃` (on C2). This would give a doublet of quartets (dq).\n    *   This structure does not produce a `dtq` or a `dtt`.\n\n*   **B) `(CH₃)₂CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH` (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The `CH` at position 4 has neighbors: a `CH` (at C3) and two `CH₃` groups on the same carbon. Only vicinal coupling to the `CH` at C3 applies. This would give a doublet.\n    *   The `CH` at position 3 has neighbors: a `CH` (at C4) and a `CH₂` (at C2). This would give a doublet of triplets (dt).\n    *   This structure does not produce a `dtq` or a `dtt`.\n\n*   **C) `CH₃-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH` (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid)**\n    Let's number the main chain: `CH₃(6)-CH(5)(Et)-CH(4)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(2)-COOH(1)`. This parsing is incorrect based on the formula.\n    Let's parse `CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH` as `CH₃-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH`. This is 3-ethyl-4-(1-ethylpropyl)-... this gets confusing.\n    Let's parse it as a chain starting from `CH₃` where C has substituents: `CH₃-C(H)(Et)-C(H)(Et)-CH₂COOH`. This structure doesn't balance valency.\n\n    Let's assume the standard representation: `CH₃` group, then `CH(C₂H₅)`, then `CH(C₂H₅)`, then `CH₂COOH` all linked linearly.\n    `CH₃-CH(a)(C₂H₅)-CH(b)(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH`\n    *   **Proton H(a):** Its carbon is bonded to a `CH₃` group, a `CH(b)` group, and a `CH₂` group (from its own ethyl substituent).\n        *   Neighbors: The `CH₃` group (3H -> **quartet**), the `CH(b)` group (1H -> **doublet**), and the ethyl `CH₂` group (2H -> **triplet**).\n        *   This proton's signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first piece of data.\n    *   **Proton H(b):** Its carbon is bonded to a `CH(a)` group, a `CH₂` group (of the main chain), and another `CH₂` group (from its own ethyl substituent).\n        *   Neighbors: The `CH(a)` group (1H -> **doublet**), the main-chain `CH₂` group (2H -> **triplet**), and the ethyl `CH₂` group (2H -> **triplet**).\n        *   This proton's signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second piece of data.\n    *   This structure perfectly explains both of the complex signals observed.\n\n*   **D) `CH₃CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-COOH` (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The `CH` at position 3 has neighbors: a `CH₂` (at C4), a `CH` (at C2), and a `CH₂` (from its ethyl group). This would give a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one signal.\n    *   The `CH` at position 2 has neighbors: a `CH` (at C3) and a `CH₂` (from its ethyl group). This would give a doublet of triplets (dt).\n    *   This structure produces a `dtt` but not a `dtq`.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly structure C, `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`, has protons in environments that would result in both a `dtq` and a `dtt` splitting pattern. Therefore, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The broadness is a key indicator.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ for the dimeric form).\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not help distinguish between them.\n\n### **2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four candidate molecules are saturated alkanoic acids, so this is consistent with all options.\n*   **Key splitting patterns:**\n    *   One signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   Another signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\nThis is the crucial information for identifying the structure. Let's break down what these splitting patterns mean. The multiplicity of a signal is determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons (the n+1 rule).\n*   **dtq (doublet of triplets of quartets):** This means a proton (let's call it H_A) is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a doublet (1+1=2).\n    *   Two neighboring protons (n=2), causing a triplet (2+1=3).\n    *   Three neighboring protons (n=3), causing a quartet (3+1=4).\n    For this pattern to be observed, H_A must be a **methine (CH)** group with its carbon atom bonded to three other carbons that carry 1, 2, and 3 protons, respectively (i.e., a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group).\n\n*   **dtt (doublet of triplets of triplets):** This means a proton (let's call it H_B) is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a doublet (1+1=2).\n    *   Two neighboring protons (n=2), causing a triplet (2+1=3).\n    *   Another, non-equivalent set of two neighboring protons (n=2), causing another triplet (2+1=3).\n    For this pattern to be observed, H_B must be a **methine (CH)** group with its carbon atom bonded to three other carbons that carry 1, 2, and 2 protons, respectively (i.e., a CH and two different CH₂ groups).\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nThe condensed formulas are written in a potentially confusing way. Let's parse them into their IUPAC names and structures, assuming they represent a linear backbone from left to right, with bracketed groups as substituents.\n\n#### **Candidate A: `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`**\nLet's assume `C(H)` is a way of writing `CH`.\nStructure: `CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH`.\nNumbering from the COOH group (C1): `COOH(1)-CH2(2)-CH(3)(C2H5)-CH(4)(C2H5)-CH3(5)`.\nThis is **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n\nLet's analyze its key protons:\n*   **Proton on C4 (H₄):** This is a methine (CH) proton. Its neighbors are:\n    *   The proton on C3 (a CH group, **1H**).\n    *   The protons on C5 (a CH₃ group, **3H**).\n    *   The protons on the ethyl group's CH₂ (a CH₂ group, **2H**).\n    This proton is coupled to 1H, 2H, and 3H neighbors. This will produce a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the data.\n\n*   **Proton on C3 (H₃):** This is a methine (CH) proton. Its neighbors are:\n    *   The proton on C4 (a CH group, **1H**).\n    *   The protons on C2 (a CH₂ group, **2H**).\n    *   The protons on the ethyl group's CH₂ (another CH₂ group, **2H**).\n    This proton is coupled to 1H, 2H, and another 2H. This will produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This also matches the data.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** This structure is the only one that exhibits both the `dtq` and `dtt` splitting patterns required by the ¹H NMR data.\n\n#### **Candidate B: `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH`**\nStructure: `CH3CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH`\nIUPAC Name: **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   Proton on C3 (H₃): Neighbors are H(C2), H₂(C4), and H₂(Et). This gives a **dtt**.\n*   Is there a `dtq`? No. There is no methine proton coupled to a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group simultaneously. Therefore, B is incorrect.\n\n#### **Candidate C: `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH`**\nStructure: `CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\nIUPAC Name: **2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   Proton on C3 (H₃): Neighbors are H(C2), H₂(C4), and H₃(Me). This gives a **dtq**.\n*   Is there a `dtt`? No. There is no methine proton coupled to a CH and two different CH₂ groups. Therefore, C is incorrect.\n\n#### **Candidate D: `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH`**\nStructure: `(CH3)2CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH`\nIUPAC Name: **3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   Proton on C3 (H₃): Neighbors are H₂(C2), H(C4), and H₃(Me). This gives a **dtq**.\n*   Is there a `dtt`? No. The other methine proton (H₄) is coupled to H(C3), and two different CH₃ groups, not two CH₂ groups. Therefore, D is incorrect.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly the structure corresponding to option A, **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**, has the specific proton environments that would generate both a `doublet of triplets of quartets` and a `doublet of triplets of triplets` in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at ~3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadening is a result of intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at ~1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, and this specific wavenumber is typical for a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The FTIR data strongly indicate that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four given options are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group is present but does not distinguish between the isomers. The definitive identification must come from the NMR data.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   The problem states there are **no signals for vinyl-hydrogens**. This confirms that the compound is saturated (contains no C=C double bonds), which is consistent with all four of the provided structures.\n    *   The most critical information for structural elucidation lies in the two complex splitting patterns observed:\n        *   Signal 1: **A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n        *   Signal 2: **A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\n3.  **Deconstruct the Splitting Patterns:**\n    Complex splitting (multiplet of multiplets) arises when a proton is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons. The splitting for each set follows the `n+1` rule, where `n` is the number of equivalent neighboring protons.\n    *   To produce a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**, a single proton must be coupled (through 3-bond, or vicinal, coupling) to:\n        *   **One** adjacent proton (n=1), which splits its signal into a **d**oublet.\n        *   **Two** adjacent protons (n=2), which splits its signal into a **t**riplet.\n        *   **Three** adjacent protons (n=3), which splits its signal into a **q**uartet.\n        This implies the proton under observation is on a `CH` group that is adjacent to another `CH` group, a `CH₂` group, and a `CH₃` group.\n    *   To produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**, a single proton must be coupled to:\n        *   **One** adjacent proton (n=1), which splits its signal into a **d**oublet.\n        *   **Two** adjacent protons (n=2), which splits its signal into a **t**riplet.\n        *   A second, chemically distinct set of **two** adjacent protons (n=2), which splits its signal into another **t**riplet.\n        This implies the proton under observation is on a `CH` group that is adjacent to another `CH` group and two non-equivalent `CH₂` groups.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Candidate Structure:**\n    We will now systematically analyze the methine (`-CH-`) protons in each molecule, as they are the only ones capable of exhibiting such high-order splitting.\n\n    *   **A) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\n        This structure is **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**. Let's draw it out and label the key protons on the main chain.\n        `HOOC¹-CH₂²-CH³(a)(C₂H₅)-CH⁴(b)(C₂H₅)-CH₃⁵`\n        *   **Proton H(b) on carbon C4:**\n            *   It is adjacent to proton H(a) on C3 (1H) → gives a **doublet (d)**.\n            *   It is adjacent to the protons on C5 (a CH₃ group, 3H) → gives a **quartet (q)**.\n            *   It is adjacent to the protons of the CH₂ group within its own ethyl substituent (2H) → gives a **triplet (t)**.\n            *   The resulting multiplicity for H(b) is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This perfectly matches one of the observed signals.\n        *   **Proton H(a) on carbon C3:**\n            *   It is adjacent to proton H(b) on C4 (1H) → gives a **doublet (d)**.\n            *   It is adjacent to the protons on C2 (a CH₂ group, 2H) → gives a **triplet (t)**.\n            *   It is adjacent to the protons of the CH₂ group within its own ethyl substituent (2H) → gives another **triplet (t)**.\n            *   The resulting multiplicity for H(a) is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This perfectly matches the second observed signal.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Structure A is the only molecule that accounts for both the `dtq` and `dtt` signals.\n\n    *   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\n        This is **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**. The proton on C3 would give a `dtt` signal, but the proton on C2 would give a `dt` signal (coupled to one H on C3 and two H on its ethyl group). This structure lacks a `dtq` signal.\n\n    *   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\n        This is **2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**. The proton on C3 would give a `dtq` signal, but the proton on C2 would give a `dq` signal (coupled to one H on C3 and three H on its methyl group). This structure lacks a `dtt` signal.\n\n    *   **D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\n        This is **3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**. The proton on C3 would give a `dtq` signal, but the proton on C4 would be a `doublet of septets` (coupled to one H on C3 and the six H's of the two methyl groups). This structure lacks a `dtt` signal.\n\n5.  **Final Decision:**\n    Based on the detailed analysis of the expected 1H NMR splitting patterns, only structure A provides protons that would generate both a `doublet of triplets of quartets` and a `doublet of triplets of triplets`.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Provided Information:**\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n        *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid that is undergoing hydrogen bonding.\n        *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, which is also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   Conclusion from FTIR: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this confirms the functional group but doesn't distinguish between the choices.\n\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n        *   \"None of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens\": This tells us the molecule is saturated, meaning it contains no C=C or C≡C bonds. All four options are saturated alkanoic acids.\n        *   \"One of the signals...is a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)\": This is a highly specific splitting pattern. For a proton to show this multiplicity, it must be coupled to three distinct sets of neighboring protons:\n            *   One single proton (which splits the signal into a **d**oublet).\n            *   A set of two equivalent protons (like a CH₂ group), which splits the signal into a **t**riplet.\n            *   A set of three equivalent protons (like a CH₃ group), which splits the signal into a **q**uartet.\n        *   \"a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)\": Similarly, this proton must be coupled to three distinct sets of neighbors:\n            *   One single proton (giving a **d**oublet).\n            *   A set of two equivalent protons (a CH₂ group, giving a **t**riplet).\n            *   Another, chemically different set of two equivalent protons (another CH₂ group, giving a second **t**riplet).\n\n2.  **Systematically Analyze Each Candidate Structure:**\n    The most effective method is to draw each structure and examine the environments of the methine (CH) protons, as they are most likely to have such complex splitting.

Analysis of FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to the dimeric hydrogen bonding characteristic of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, and its position is typical for a carboxylic acid.\n\nThe FTIR data strongly suggests that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid functional group, so this information confirms the functional group type but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe key to distinguishing between the isomers lies in the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR spectrum. We must identify the structure that can produce both of the following signals:\n\n1.  A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**: This means the proton giving this signal is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: a group of one proton (giving the doublet), a group of two equivalent protons (giving the triplet), and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet).\n2.  A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**: This means the proton for this signal is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: a group of one proton (doublet), a group of two equivalent protons (first triplet), and another group of two equivalent protons (second triplet).\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting for the protons on the main carbon chain of each candidate structure.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH:** This structure does not possess protons that would simultaneously give both a dtq and a dtt signal. For instance, the proton beta to the COOH group would be a doublet of triplets of quartets (coupled to one H, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group), but there is no proton that would result in a doublet of triplets of triplets.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH:** Let's expand the structure and label the key protons:\n    **CH₃(a)-CH(b)(CH₂CH₃)-CH(e)(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂(h)-COOH**\n\n    *   **Proton H(b):**\n        *   Coupled to one proton, H(e), resulting in a **doublet**.\n        *   Coupled to the two protons of the adjacent CH₂(h) group (from the C₂H₅ substituent), resulting in a **triplet**.\n        *   Coupled to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group, CH₃(a), resulting in a **quartet**.\n        *   Therefore, the signal for **H(b)** is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal description.\n\n    *   **Proton H(e):**\n        *   Coupled to one proton, H(b), resulting in a **doublet**.\n        *   Coupled to the two protons of its own ethyl side chain (the CH₂ group), resulting in a **triplet**.\n        *   Coupled to the two protons of the methylene group, CH₂(h), which is alpha to the carbonyl, resulting in another **triplet**.\n        *   Therefore, the signal for **H(e)** is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal description.\n    This structure accounts for both of the complex splitting patterns observed.\n\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH:** The proton beta to the COOH group would give a doublet of triplets of triplets. However, no proton in this molecule would produce a doublet of triplets of quartets.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH:** The proton beta to the COOH group would be a doublet of triplets of quartets.

All four possible options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this data confirms the functional group present but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n### **Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe key to identifying the correct structure lies in the complex splitting patterns described. A proton's signal is split into a specific pattern based on the number of non-equivalent protons on adjacent carbons. This is often referred to as spin-spin coupling.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This observation is consistent with all four proposed structures, as none contain carbon-carbon double bonds.\n*   **A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This complex splitting pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: one proton on an adjacent carbon (giving a doublet), a set of two protons on another adjacent carbon (giving a triplet), and another distinct set of two protons on a third adjacent carbon (giving a second triplet).\n*   **A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This pattern occurs when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: one proton (causing a doublet), a group of two protons (causing a triplet), and a group of three protons (causing a quartet).\n\n### **Evaluation of Proposed Structures**\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting patterns for the protons on the main chain of each candidate molecule.\n\n*   **A) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to one proton at C2 and two protons at C4, which would result in a doublet of triplets (dt).\n    *   The proton at C2 is coupled to one proton at C3, which would result in a doublet (d).\n    *   This structure does not produce the required `dtt` or `dtq` signals.\n\n*   **B) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *Let's analyze the proton `H(c)` at the C3 position: `CH3-CH(b)(Et)-CH(c)(Et)-CH2(d)-COOH`. This proton has three different adjacent carbons with protons: `CH(b)` (1 proton), `CH2(d)` (2 protons), and the `CH2` of the ethyl group attached to C3 (2 protons). This combination of neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H) will split the signal for `H(c)` into a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *Now let's analyze the proton `H(b)` at the C4 position: `CH3(a)-CH(b)(Et)-CH(c)(Et)-CH2-COOH`. This proton also has three different adjacent carbons with protons: `CH3(a)` (3 protons), `CH(c)` (1 proton), and the `CH2` of the ethyl group attached to C4 (2 protons). This combination of neighbors (3H, 1H, 2H) will split the signal for `H(b)` into a **quartet of doublets of triplets (qdt)**, which is the same multiplicity as a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *This structure is the only one that matches both complex splitting patterns described.\n\n*   **C) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 has three neighboring sets of protons: the `CH2` of the main chain (2 protons), the proton at C2 (1 proton), and the `CH2` of the ethyl group on C3 (2 protons). This would indeed produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule is adjacent to sets of 1, 2, and 3 protons. For instance, the proton at C2 is adjacent to one proton (at C3) and two protons (on its ethyl group), giving a doublet of triplets (dt).

    "Here is a systematic analysis of the problem to determine the correct compound.\n\n### Step 1: Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic spectroscopic signature of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The peak's broadness is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. Its position is consistent with a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four provided options are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not help distinguish between the isomers. The ¹H NMR data will be the deciding factor.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of ¹H NMR Data and Splitting Patterns\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds, confirming the compound is saturated. All four options are consistent with this.\n*   **The key information is the two complex splitting patterns:**\n    1.  A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    2.  A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nTo understand these patterns, we apply the `n+1` rule, where a proton's signal is split into `n+1` lines by `n` equivalent neighboring protons. For a proton coupled to multiple non-equivalent sets of protons, these splitting effects are multiplicative.\n\n*   A proton that appears as a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One single proton (giving the **d**oublet).\n    *   A set of two equivalent protons (like a CH₂ group), giving the **t**riplet.\n    *   A set of three equivalent protons (like a CH₃ group), giving the **q**uartet.\n    *   Therefore, the proton must be a methine (`CH`) group that is adjacent to another `CH` group, a `CH₂` group, and a `CH₃` group.\n\n*   A proton that appears as a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One single proton (giving the **d**oublet).\n    *   A set of two equivalent protons (a `CH₂` group), giving the first **t**riplet.\n    *   A second, chemically different set of two equivalent protons (another `CH₂` group), giving the second **t**riplet.\n    *   Therefore, the proton must be a methine (`CH`) group that is adjacent to another `CH` group and two different `CH₂` groups.\n\nOur task is to find the single structure from the options that contains protons matching *both* of these descriptions.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluation of Each Candidate Structure\n\nLet's carefully analyze the structure corresponding to each option.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\n    *   This formula corresponds to **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n    *   Let's number the main chain from the COOH group: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Et)-CH₃(5)`.\n    *   **Proton on C4:** This proton is adjacent to the proton on C3 (1H, gives a **doublet**), the CH₂ of its ethyl substituent (2H, gives a **triplet**), and the CH₃ group at C5 (3H, gives a **quartet**). The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal.\n    *   **Proton on C3:** This proton is adjacent to the proton on C4 (1H, gives a **doublet**), the CH₂ group at C2 (2H, gives a **triplet**), and the CH₂ of its ethyl substituent (2H, gives another **triplet**). The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Structure A perfectly matches both of the required ¹H NMR signals.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\n    *   This formula corresponds to **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**. The proton on C3 would give a `dtt` signal. However, the proton on C2 would only give a doublet of triplets (`dt`). This structure lacks a `dtq` signal.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\n    *   This formula corresponds to **3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**. The proton on C3 would give a `dtq` signal. However, the other methine proton (on C4) would give a doublet of septets. This structure lacks a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\n    *   This formula corresponds to **2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**. The proton on C3 would give a `dtq` signal. However, the other methine proton (on C2) would give a doublet of quartets (`dq`). This structure lacks a `dtt` signal.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on a thorough analysis of the expected splitting patterns, only structure A, **CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**, has the specific arrangement of protons required to produce both a `doublet of triplets of quartets` signal and a `doublet of triplets of triplets` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<A>>>"

Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four structures are saturated, consistent with this observation.\n*   **Key Splitting Patterns:** The spectrum shows two particularly complex and informative signals:\n    1.  A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    2.  A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nTo understand these patterns, we use the (n+1) rule, where a proton signal is split into (n+1) lines by 'n' equivalent neighboring protons. For a proton coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of neighbors, the multiplicities multiply.\n\n*   **dtq (doublet of triplets of quartets):** A proton showing this pattern must be coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons:\n    *   A group of 1 proton (n=1, gives a doublet, d)\n    *   A group of 2 equivalent protons (n=2, gives a triplet, t)\n    *   A group of 3 equivalent protons (n=3, gives a quartet, q)\n    The ideal structural environment for this is a CH proton adjacent to a CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group: **-CH(neighbor)-CH(signal)-[CH₂(neighbor)]-[CH₃(neighbor)]-**\n\n*   **dtt (doublet of triplets of triplets):** A proton showing this pattern must be coupled to:\n    *   A group of 1 proton (n=1, gives a doublet, d)\n    *   A group of 2 equivalent protons (n=2, gives a triplet, t)\n    *   Another group of 2 equivalent protons (n=2, gives another triplet, t)\n    The ideal structural environment for this is a CH proton adjacent to a CH group and two different CH₂ groups: **-CH(neighbor)-CH(signal)-[CH₂(neighbor)]-[CH₂(neighbor)]-**\n\n**3. Evaluating the Candidate Structures**\n\nLet's examine each structure to see if its protons match these required environments. Note that in molecules with chiral centers, protons on an adjacent CH₂ group are often diastereotopic (non-equivalent), which would complicate the splitting. However, for the purpose of identifying these characteristic patterns, we can assume accidental equivalence (where the coupling constants are coincidentally the same), which simplifies the observed multiplet.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton on C3 is adjacent to a CH₂ group (on the main chain), a CH group (at C2), and another CH₂ group (on the C3-ethyl substituent). This matches the environment for a **dtt**.\n    *   There is no proton in an environment that would produce a dtq.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton on C3 is adjacent to a CH group (at C4), a CH₂ group (at C2), and another CH₂ group (on the C3-ethyl substituent). This matches the environment for a **dtt**.\n    *   There is no proton in an environment that would produce a dtq.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton on C3 is adjacent to a CH group (at C4), a CH₂ group (at C2), and a CH₃ group (on C3). This matches the environment for a **dtq**.\n    *   There is no proton in an environment that would produce a dtt.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   Let's analyze the proton on C3. It is adjacent to:\n        *   A CH group at C2 (1 proton neighbor → doublet).\n        *   A CH₂ group at C4 (2 proton neighbors → triplet).\n        *   A CH₃ group attached to C3 (3 proton neighbors → quartet).\n    *   This proton is in the perfect structural environment to produce a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   Now let's look for the dtt. Consider one of the diastereotopic protons on the CH₂ group at C4. It is coupled to its geminal partner (1H, doublet), the proton at C3 (1H, doublet), and the terminal CH₃ group (3H, quartet). This would give a doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq). While complex, this is not a dtt. However, in complex molecules, it is not uncommon for a complex multiplet like a ddq to be mis-assigned or to appear as a different pattern due to overlapping signals or specific coupling constant values. Given that structure D provides a perfect and unambiguous origin for the highly specific dtq signal, it is the most likely candidate. The dtt signal likely arises from another proton in the molecule, with the pattern being the result of complex second-order effects or accidental equivalence that makes it appear as a dtt. No other structure provides a clear origin for the dtq signal.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nStructure D is the only one that contains a proton in the precise environment [-CH(neighbor)-CH(signal)-[CH₂(neighbor)]-[CH₃(neighbor)]-] required to produce the observed **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** signal. While the origin of the dtt is less clear from a simple first-order analysis, the presence of the dtq is a very strong piece of evidence pointing uniquely to structure D among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\n### Compound Identification\n\nBased on the provided spectroscopic data, the unknown compound is identified as **B) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH**.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n**1. Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy:**\n\n*   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in carboxylic acids. The significant broadness of this peak is a result of hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, which is also a key feature of carboxylic acids.\n\nAll four potential compounds are carboxylic acids, meaning the FTIR data is consistent with any of the choices. Therefore, the ¹H NMR data is crucial for distinguishing the correct structure.\n\n**2. Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n\nThe ¹H NMR data provides the most definitive clues for identifying the correct structure through the analysis of spin-spin splitting patterns. The problem states that there are no signals corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens, which is consistent with all four saturated structures. The key is the presence of two specific complex signals: a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** and a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting for the methine (CH) protons in each proposed structure:\n\n*   **A) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid):** This structure would show a proton with a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) pattern, but it lacks a proton that would produce a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq). Instead, it would have a signal with a doublet of triplets (dt) pattern.\n\n*   **B) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH (3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at carbon 3 is adjacent to one proton at carbon 4 (giving a doublet), two protons at carbon 2 (giving a triplet), and the two protons of the ethyl group at carbon 3 (giving another triplet). This results in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**, matching one of the observed signals.\n    *   The proton at carbon 4 is adjacent to one proton at carbon 3 (giving a doublet), the two protons of the ethyl group at carbon 5 (giving a triplet), and the three protons of the methyl group at carbon 4 (giving a quartet). This results in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**, matching the other key signal.\n    This structure is the only one that accounts for both observed complex splitting patterns.\n\n*   **C) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):** This molecule has a proton that would appear as a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq), but it does not have a proton that would give a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt). It would instead show a doublet of quartets (dq).\n\n*   **D) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):** This structure contains a proton that would give a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq). However, the other key methine proton would be split into a doublet of quartets of quartets (dqq), not a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly structure B, which corresponds to 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data, as it is the only option that would produce both a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to identify the correct chemical structure by systematically analyzing the provided spectroscopic data (FTIR and 1H NMR) for each of the four options.\n\n1.  **Analyze FTIR Data**: The peaks at 3000 cm⁻¹ (broad O-H) and 1700 cm⁻¹ (strong C=O) strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this confirms the functional group type but doesn't distinguish between the isomers.\n\n2.  **Analyze 1H NMR Data**: The key to solving this problem lies in the complex splitting patterns (multiplicity) described.\n    *   A signal is described as a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   Another signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   I will examine the structure of each candidate molecule to predict the splitting patterns of its methine (CH) protons, as these are most likely to exhibit such complex splitting. I will use the n+1 rule, where a proton's signal is split by its 'n' neighboring protons.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Candidate**:\n    *   **A) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH**: I will check its methine protons for `dtq` and `dtt` signals.\n    *   **B) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH**: I will check its methine protons for `dtq` and `dtt` signals.\n    *   **C) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH**: I will check its methine protons for `dtq` and `dtt` signals.\n    *   **D) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH**: I will check its methine protons for `dtq` and `dtt` signals.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: The molecule whose predicted splitting patterns match both the observed `dtq` and `dtt` signals will be the correct answer.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze the provided spectroscopic data.\n# The FTIR data (broad peak at 3000 cm-1 for O-H and strong peak at 1700 cm-1 for C=O) confirms the compound is a carboxylic acid.

For a proton to exhibit this splitting, it must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **d**oublet (n+1 = 2).\n    *   A set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), which splits the signal into a **t**riplet (n+1 = 3).\n    *   A set of three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3), which splits the signal into a **q**uartet (n+1 = 4).\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This is another complex pattern. A proton showing this splitting must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **d**oublet (n+1 = 2).\n    *   A set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), which splits the signal into a **t**riplet (n+1 = 3).\n    *   A second, non-equivalent set of two neighboring protons (n=2), which splits the signal into another **t**riplet (n+1 = 3).\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Each Candidate Structure against the NMR Data**\n\nWe need to find a structure that contains one proton in an environment that would produce a `dtq` and another proton in an environment that would produce a `dtt`. We will analyze the methine (CH) protons, as they are most likely to show such complex splitting.\n\n**A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-Dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n`HOOC-CH₂(b)-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH(d)(CH₃)-CH₃(e)`\n*   **Proton H(c):** It is coupled to H(d) (1H, gives a doublet), the CH₂(b) group (2H, gives a triplet), and the adjacent CH₃ group (3H, gives a quartet). This would result in a **dtq**. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **Proton H(d):** It is coupled to H(c) (1H, gives a doublet), the CH₃ group on the same carbon (3H, gives a quartet), and the terminal CH₃(e) group (3H, gives a quartet). This would result in a doublet of quartets of quartets (dqq). This does not match the `dtt` signal.\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure A is incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid)**\nLet's determine the structure from the formula, assuming the longest chain containing the COOH group is the parent chain: `HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(C₂H₅)-CH(4)(CH₃)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\n*   **Proton H(4) (on C4):** It is coupled to H(3) (1H, gives a doublet), the CH₃ group on C4 (3H, gives a quartet), and the CH₂ group at C5 (2H, gives a triplet). This would result in a **dtq**. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **Proton H(3) (on C3):** It is coupled to H(4) (1H, gives a doublet), the CH₂ group at C2 (2H, gives a triplet), and the CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2H, gives a triplet). This would result in a **dtt**. This matches the second signal.\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure B has protons that would produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt`. This is a perfect match.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-Dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n`HOOC-CH(d)(CH₃)-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH₂(b)-CH₃(a)`\n*   **Proton H(c):** It is coupled to H(d) (1H, gives a doublet), the CH₂(b) group (2H, gives a triplet), and the CH₃ group on C3 (3H, gives a quartet). This would result in a **dtq**. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **Proton H(d):** It is coupled to H(c) (1H, gives a doublet) and the CH₃ group on C2 (3H, gives a quartet). This would result in a doublet of quartets (dq). This does not match the `dtt` signal.\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure C is incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-Diethylpentanoic acid)**\n`HOOC-CH(d)(C₂H₅)-CH(c)(C₂H₅)-CH₂(b)-CH₃(a)`\n*   **Proton H(c):** It is coupled to H(d) (1H, gives a doublet), the CH₂(b) group (2H, gives a triplet), and the CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2H, gives a triplet). This would result in a **dtt**. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **Proton H(d):** It is coupled to H(c) (1H, gives a doublet) and the CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on C2 (2H, gives a triplet). This would result in a doublet of triplets (dt). This does not match the `dtq` signal.\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure D is incorrect.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly structure B, 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, has the specific arrangement of protons required to produce both a doublet of triplets of quartets (`dtq`) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (`dtt`) in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe user wants me to identify an unknown compound from a list of four options based on its FTIR and ¹H NMR spectra.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The problem states that there are no signals corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens, which means there are no C=C double bonds in the molecule. This is consistent with all four options.\n    *   The key to solving the problem lies in the complex splitting patterns (multiplicity) of two specific signals. We use the n+1 rule, where a proton's signal is split into n+1 peaks by 'n' adjacent, chemically equivalent protons.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct the Splitting Patterns:**\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (d of t of q)**\n        *   This describes a single proton that is coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons.\n        *   **Doublet (d):** Coupled to 1 neighboring proton (a -CH- group).\n        *   **Triplet (t):** Coupled to 2 equivalent neighboring protons (a -CH₂- group).\n        *   **Quartet (q):** Coupled to 3 equivalent neighboring protons (a -CH₃ group).\n        *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton on a carbon (let's call it H_A) that is directly bonded to a -CH- group, a -CH₂- group, and a -CH₃ group.\n\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (d of t of t)**\n        *   This describes a different single proton coupled to three different groups of neighbors.\n        *   **Doublet (d):** Coupled to 1 neighboring proton (a -CH- group).\n        *   **Triplet (t):** Coupled to 2 equivalent neighboring protons (a -CH₂- group).\n        *   **Triplet (t):** Coupled to a *second, non-equivalent* set of 2 equivalent neighboring protons (another -CH₂- group).\n        *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton on a carbon (let's call it H_B) that is directly bonded to a -CH- group and two different -CH₂- groups.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Candidate Structure:**\n    Let's number the main carbon chain starting from the carboxylic acid carbon as C1.\n\n    *   **A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n        *   `CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n        *   This molecule does not have a proton that fits the \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" pattern.

Since all four options are carboxylic acids, the FTIR data does not help distinguish between them but confirms the functional group present.\n\n### Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\nThe key to identifying the correct structure lies in the complex splitting patterns described. The n+1 rule states that a proton's signal is split into n+1 peaks by 'n' equivalent neighboring protons. When a proton is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons, more complex patterns emerge.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H).

For instance, the proton on C2 is coupled to the proton on C3 (doublet) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (triplet), resulting in a doublet of triplets (dt). Therefore, this structure is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton on C3 is coupled to the proton on C2 (doublet), the CH₃ on C3 (quartet), and the CH₂ at C4 (triplet). This gives a doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt). This does not match the observed patterns.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton on C3 is coupled to the CH₂ at C2 (triplet), the proton on C4 (doublet), and the CH₃ on C3 (quartet). This gives a triplet of doublets of quartets (tdq). This does not match the observed patterns.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   Let's label the key protons: HOOC-CH₂(a)-CH(b)(Et)-CH(c)(Et)-CH₃\n    *   **Proton H(c) at C4:** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The single proton H(b) at C3, giving a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   The two protons of the CH₂ group in its ethyl substituent, giving a **triplet (t)**.\n        *   The three protons of the terminal CH₃ group at C5, giving a **quartet (q)**.\n        *   This combination results in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**, exactly matching the first signal described.\n    *   **Proton H(b) at C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The single proton H(c) at C4, giving a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   The two protons of the CH₂(a) group at C2, giving a **triplet (t)**.\n        *   The two protons of the CH₂ group in its own ethyl substituent, giving another **triplet (t)**.\n        *   This combination results in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**, exactly matching the second signal described.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe splitting patterns observed in the ¹H NMR spectrum are uniquely consistent with the structure of 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nTo identify the unknown compound, the provided spectroscopic data must be systematically compared against the expected data for each of the four possible structures.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** The spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹. The broad peak is characteristic of the O-H bond stretch in a carboxylic acid, which is broadened due to hydrogen bonding. The strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid. Since all four options are carboxylic acids, this data confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds. All four proposed structures are saturated and consistent with this observation.\n    *   **Complex Splitting:** The key to identifying the correct structure lies in the complex splitting patterns described. These patterns arise from a proton being coupled to multiple, non-equivalent neighboring protons. The multiplicity of a signal is determined by the (n+1) rule, where 'n' is the number of equivalent neighboring protons. When a proton is coupled to multiple *sets* of non-equivalent protons, the splitting pattern becomes more complex (e.g., a doublet of triplets).\n\n### Evaluation of Candidate Structures\n\nLet's analyze the expected ¹H NMR splitting patterns for the most substituted protons (the methine, or C-H, protons) in each candidate molecule.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\n*   This molecule has two chiral centers. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the ethyl group would be split by the CH₂ of the ethyl group (triplet), the neighboring C-H (doublet), and the methyl group attached to the same carbon (quartet). This would result in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   However, the other C-H proton (alpha to the COOH group) would be split by its neighboring C-H (doublet) and the adjacent methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This structure does not account for the observed doublet of triplets of triplets.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\n*   This structure has protons on a carbon chain that would lead to different splitting patterns, such as a doublet of septets, but not the specific dtq and dtt combination observed.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\n*   The splitting patterns in this molecule would be complex, but would likely involve quintets due to coupling with CH₂ groups of the ethyl substituents. It would not produce the specific dtq and dtt signals.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\nLet's label the key protons in this structure:\n`CH₃(a)-CH(b)(CH₂CH₃)-CH(c)(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂(d)-COOH`\n\n*   **Proton (b):** This proton is coupled to three distinct sets of neighbors:\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (a) → **quartet**.\n    *   The single proton at position (c) → **doublet**.\n    *   The two protons of the ethyl's CH₂ group → **triplet**.\n    *   Combining these gives a predicted signal of a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal described.\n\n*   **Proton (c):** This proton is also coupled to three distinct sets of neighbors:\n    *   The single proton at position (b) → **doublet**.\n    *   The two protons of the ethyl's CH₂ group attached to the same carbon → **triplet**.\n    *   The two protons of the CH₂ group at position (d) → **triplet**.\n    *   Combining these gives a predicted signal of a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal described.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe splitting patterns observed in the ¹H NMR spectrum, specifically a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets, are uniquely consistent with the structure of **CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo identify the unknown compound, we must analyze the provided spectroscopic data (FTIR and 1H NMR) and match it to one of the four possible structures.\n\n### Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\nThe FTIR data confirms that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. Since all four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, the FTIR data is consistent with all of them. Therefore, we must rely on the 1H NMR data to distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### Analysis of 1H NMR Data\n\nThe key information from the 1H NMR spectrum lies in the complex splitting patterns (multiplicities) of two specific signals:\n1.  A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n2.  A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nThis means we need to find a molecule that has two different protons with these specific environments. Let's analyze the structure of each candidate. The structures provided in options B and C contain a carbon atom with five bonds, which is chemically impossible. Assuming these are typographical errors and the intended structures are the correspondingly named acids, we will proceed with the analysis. The most plausible candidates that could exhibit such complex splitting are C and D due to their multiple chiral centers and varied adjacent groups.\n\nLet's analyze the protons on the carbon backbone for candidates C and D, as these are most likely to exhibit such complex splitting.\n\n#### Candidate D: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)\n\nLet's label the key protons in the structure:\n```\n      H(a)   H(b)\n      |      |\nCH₃(d)-CH₂(c)-CH(b)-CH(a)-COOH\n             |      |\n             CH₃(f) CH₃(e)\n```\n\n*   **Analysis of H(b) at position C3:**\n    *   It is coupled to the single proton **H(a)** at C2, which splits the signal into a **doublet (d)**.\n    *   It is coupled to the two protons of the methylene group **CH₂(c)** at C4, which splits the signal into a **triplet (t)**.\n    *   It is coupled to the three protons of the methyl group **CH₃(f)** attached to C3, which splits the signal into a **quartet (q)**.\n    *   Therefore, the signal for H(b) is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one of the signals described in the problem.\n\n*   **Analysis for a `dtt` signal:**\n    *   A doublet of triplets of triplets requires a proton to be coupled to three different neighboring groups: one with a single proton, one with two protons, and a third with two protons.\n    *   Let's examine other protons in molecule D. The proton H(a) is coupled to H(b) (1H) and the methyl group CH₃(e) (3H), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq). The diastereotopic protons of the CH₂(c) group would each be split by H(b) (1H), their geminal partner (1H), and the CH₃(d) group (3H), resulting in a doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq).\n    *   Molecule D does not have a proton environment that would produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n#### Candidate C: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)\n\nLet's label the key protons in the structure:\n```\n      H(a)   H(b)\n      |      |\nCH₃(d)-CH₂(c)-CH(b)-CH(a)-COOH\n             |      |\n           Et(g)  Et(e)  (where Et is -CH₂CH₃)\n```\n\n*   **Analysis of H(b) at position C3:**\n    *   It is coupled to the single proton **H(a)** at C2, which splits the signal into a **doublet (d)**.\n    *   It is coupled to the two protons of the methylene group **CH₂(c)** at C4, which splits the signal into a **triplet (t)**.\n    *   It is coupled to the two protons of the methylene group within the ethyl substituent **Et(g)**, which splits the signal into another **triplet (t)**.\n    *   Therefore, the signal for H(b) is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the other signal described in the problem.\n\n*   **Analysis for a `dtq` signal:**\n    *   A doublet of triplets of quartets requires a proton to be coupled to a single proton, a group of two protons, and a group of three protons.\n    *   Let's examine other protons in molecule C. The proton H(a) is coupled to H(b) (1H) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group Et(e) (2H), resulting in a doublet of triplets (dt). The diastereotopic protons of the various CH₂ groups (at C4, and in each ethyl group) would result in doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq), not a `dtq`.\n    *   Molecule C does not have a proton environment that would produce a `dtq` signal.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on a detailed analysis of the expected 1H NMR splitting patterns:\n*   Molecule **D (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)** is predicted to show a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** for the proton at C3.\n*   Molecule **C (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)** is predicted to show a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** for the proton at C3.\n\nThe problem states that the spectrum of the unknown compound shows *both* of these signals. This indicates that the unknown sample is not a single pure compound but rather a mixture of compound C and compound D. However, since the question asks to identify the compound as one of the options, and each option represents a single compound, there is a flaw in the premise of the question.\n\nIf forced to choose the \"best\" answer or if there is an error in the problem statement where only one of these complex signals is truly present and correctly identified, we cannot definitively select one compound over the other as both are partially supported by the data.\n\nHowever, in multiple-choice questions of this nature, it is common for one of the options to be the intended answer despite potential ambiguities. Given that both complex splitting patterns are explicitly mentioned, and each is uniquely characteristic of one of the molecules (C and D), it is impossible to select a single correct structure from the list provided. If we assume there is a typo and only one of the splitting patterns is correct, we cannot know which one.\n\nGiven the constraints and the detailed analysis, no single option can account for all the provided data. But if we must choose the compound that gives the `dtq` and `dtt` signals, and we have found that D gives the `dtq` and C gives the `dtt`, the question is unanswerable as stated. Let's re-evaluate D as the most likely intended answer, as `dtq` is a very distinct pattern.\n\nLet's assume the question is asking to identify the compound that is **most likely** described, and there might be an error in reporting one of the signals. Both C and D are highly complex molecules that would produce multiple overlapping multiplets. The proton at C3 in molecule D gives a clear `dtq` signal, which is a very specific pattern. The proton at C3 in molecule C gives a clear `dtt` signal. Without further information or clarification, a definitive choice is not possible. However, if a single choice must be made, and acknowledging the ambiguity, we select the structure that provides the first, and arguably more complex, described signal.\n\nLet's reconsider the possibility of both signals in one molecule. The analysis holds that D gives a `dtq` and C gives a `dtt`, but neither gives both. Therefore, the question is flawed. However, in the context of a test, if a choice must be made, there might be an intended answer. Let's assume the question is valid and re-examine D.\n\n**Revisiting D: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\n- H at C3: Coupled to H at C2 (d), CH₂ at C4 (t), CH₃ at C3 (q) -> **dtq**. (Confirmed)\n- Is there any way to get a `dtt`? No proton is adjacent to one H, a CH₂, and another CH₂.\n\nLet's assume the question is about compound D.\n\nFinal consideration: The problem is fundamentally flawed as no single compound listed produces both signals. However, if a single answer must be selected, this is a guess. Let's stick to the most rigorous analysis: D provides the `dtq` and C provides the `dtt`. The question asks for a compound that has both. No such compound is listed. Let's assume the question meant to ask which compound gives a `dtq` signal, pointing towards D.\n\nGiven the options and the detailed analysis, molecule D, 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid, is the only one that produces a doublet of triplets of quartets. Molecule C is the only one that produces a doublet of triplets of triplets. Since the problem states the compound exhibits both, it implies a mixture or a flawed question. If we are forced to choose the structure that gives the most uniquely described and complex signal (`dtq`), D would be a plausible guess.\n\nLet's assume the question is correct and my analysis is wrong. Where could the error be? Perhaps long-range coupling? It's unlikely to be strong enough to create these clean, high-order multiplets. The most straightforward interpretation (1st-order rules) leads to the conclusion that D gives a `dtq` and C gives a `dtt`.\n\nLet's choose D based on the presence of the `dtq` signal.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration. The significant broadness of the peak is characteristic of the O-H group in a carboxylic acid, which participates in strong hydrogen bonding, causing the peak to broaden.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position (around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹) is consistent with the carbonyl group of a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four given options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data is consistent with all of them. We must use the NMR data to distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the complex splitting patterns described. Let's analyze what these patterns mean:\n\n*   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** A proton that shows this splitting pattern must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (giving the **d**oublet, n=1, splits into n+1=2 lines).\n    *   A group of two adjacent protons (giving the **t**riplet, n=2, splits into n+1=3 lines).\n    *   A group of three adjacent protons (giving the **q**uartet, n=3, splits into n+1=4 lines).\n*   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** A proton that shows this splitting pattern must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (giving the **d**oublet, n=1, splits into n+1=2 lines).\n    *   A group of two adjacent protons (giving the first **t**riplet, n=2, splits into n+1=3 lines).\n    *   Another, different group of two adjacent protons (giving the second **t**riplet, n=2, splits into n+1=3 lines).\n\nNow, let's examine the structure of each option to see if its protons would produce these specific splitting patterns. We will focus on the methine (CH) protons, as they are the most likely to have multiple, distinct neighbors.\n\n---\n\n#### **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\n\nLet's label the key protons: `CH₃-CH₂(b)-CH(c)(Et)-CH(d)(Et)-COOH`\n*   **Proton H(c):** It is coupled to H(d) (1H, doublet), the CH₂(b) group (2H, triplet), and the CH₂ of its ethyl substituent (2H, triplet). This gives a **dtt** pattern. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **Proton H(d):** It is coupled to H(c) (1H, doublet) and the CH₂ of its ethyl substituent (2H, triplet). This gives a **dt** pattern.\n*   **Proton H(b):** It is coupled to the CH₃ group (3H, quartet) and H(c) (1H, doublet). This gives a **qd** (quartet of doublets).\n*   **Conclusion for A:** This structure has a `dtt` signal but does not have a `dtq` signal. So, it is incorrect.\n\n---\n\n#### **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\n\nLet's label the key protons: `CH₃(a)-CH(b)(Et)-CH(c)(Et)-CH₂(d)-COOH`\n*   **Proton H(c):** It is coupled to H(b) (1H, doublet), the CH₂(d) group (2H, triplet), and the CH₂ of its ethyl substituent (2H, triplet). This gives a **dtt** (doublet of triplets of triplets) pattern. **This matches one of the required signals.**\n*   **Proton H(b):** It is coupled to H(c) (1H, doublet), the CH₂ of its ethyl substituent (2H, triplet), and the CH₃(a) group (3H, quartet). This gives a **dtq** (doublet of triplets of quartets) pattern. **This matches the other required signal.**\n*   **Conclusion for B:** This structure is predicted to have both a `dtt` signal and a `dtq` signal. This is a perfect match for the experimental data.\n\n---\n\n#### **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\n\nLet's label the key protons: `CH₃-CH₂(b)-CH(c)(Me)-CH(d)(Me)-COOH`\n*   **Proton H(c):** It is coupled to H(d) (1H, doublet), the CH₂(b) group (2H, triplet), and the CH₃ of its methyl substituent (3H, quartet). This gives a **dtq** pattern. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **Proton H(d):** It is coupled to H(c) (1H, doublet) and the CH₃ of its methyl substituent (3H, quartet). This gives a **dq** (doublet of quartets).\n*   **Conclusion for C:** This structure has a `dtq` signal but does not have a `dtt` signal. So, it is incorrect.\n\n---\n\n#### **D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\n\nLet's label the key protons: `CH₃(a)-CH(b)(Me)-CH(c)(Me)-CH₂(d)-COOH`\n*   **Proton H(c):** It is coupled to H(b) (1H, doublet), the CH₂(d) group (2H, triplet), and the CH₃ of its methyl substituent (3H, quartet). This gives a **dtq** pattern. This matches one of the signals.\n*   **Proton H(b):** It is coupled to H(c) (1H, doublet), the CH₃(a) group (3H, quartet), and the CH₃ of its methyl substituent (3H, quartet). This gives a **dqq** (doublet of quartets of quartets).\n*   **Conclusion for D:** This structure has a `dtq` signal but does not have a `dtt` signal. So, it is incorrect.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly structure **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH** is consistent with all the spectroscopic data, as it is the only molecule that would produce both a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) and a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group present but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe most discriminating information comes from the proton NMR spectrum, specifically the complex splitting patterns.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four candidate structures are saturated, consistent with this observation.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nWe need to find the structure that has protons which would give rise to *both* of these specific splitting patterns. Let's analyze the splitting for a proton (H) based on its neighbors using the n+1 rule:\n*   **Doublet (d):** 1 neighboring proton (n=1).\n*   **Triplet (t):** 2 equivalent neighboring protons (n=2).\n*   **Quartet (q):** 3 equivalent neighboring protons (n=3).\n\nTherefore:\n*   A **dtq** arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: one proton (d), a set of two equivalent protons (t), and a set of three equivalent protons (q).\n*   A **dtt** arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: one proton (d), a set of two equivalent protons (t), and a second, different set of two equivalent protons (t).\n\nNow, let's analyze the structure of each candidate molecule. The most likely protons to exhibit such complex splitting are the ones on the chiral centers (the `C(H)` groups).\n\n#### **Candidate A: CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\nThis is 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid: `(CH₃)₂CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH`\n*   **H at C3:** Is coupled to H at C4 (1H, gives a doublet), the CH₂ at C2 (2H, gives a triplet), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H, gives a quartet). This proton's signal would be a **dtq**.\n*   **H at C4:** Is coupled to H at C3 (1H, gives a doublet) and the two CH₃ groups on C4 (6H, gives a septet). This signal would be a doublet of septets.\n*   **Result:** This molecule has a `dtq` but does not have a `dtt`. It is not the correct compound.\n\n#### **Candidate B: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\nThis is 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid: `CH₃CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`\n*   **H at C3:** Is coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet), the CH₂ at C4 (2H, triplet), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H, quartet). This signal is a **dtq**.\n*   **H at C2:** Is coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and the CH₃ on C2 (3H, quartet). This signal is a doublet of quartets (dq).\n*   **Result:** This molecule has a `dtq` but does not have a `dtt`. It is not the correct compound.\n\n#### **Candidate C: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\nThis is 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid: `CH₃CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-COOH`\n*   **H at C3:** Is coupled to H at C2 (1H, doublet), the CH₂ at C4 (2H, triplet), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C3 (2H, triplet). This signal is a **dtt**.\n*   **H at C2:** Is coupled to H at C3 (1H, doublet) and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C2 (2H, triplet). This signal is a doublet of triplets (dt).\n*   **Result:** This molecule has a `dtt` but does not have a `dtq`. It is not the correct compound.\n\n#### **Candidate D: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\nThis is 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid: `CH₃-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH`\nLet's analyze the two protons on the chiral centers (C3 and C4).\n*   **H at C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n    *   The H on C4 (1 neighbor) → **doublet**\n    *   The CH₂ group at C2 (2 neighbors) → **triplet**\n    *   The CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2 neighbors) → **triplet**\n    *   The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n\n*   **H at C4:** This proton is coupled to:\n    *   The H on C3 (1 neighbor) → **doublet**\n    *   The CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on C4 (2 neighbors) → **triplet**\n    *   The terminal CH₃ group at C5 (3 neighbors) → **quartet**\n    *   The resulting signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the other required signal.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nStructure D is the only candidate that would produce both a doublet of triplets of triplets (from the proton at C3) and a doublet of triplets of quartets (from the proton at C4) in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a systematic analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the correct chemical structure from the given options.\n\n### Step 1: Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a characteristic signal for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.

All four options are saturated alkanoic acids, so this is consistent with all of them.\n*   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** For a proton's signal to be split into a `dtq`, it must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **d**oublet.\n    *   A set of two equivalent adjacent protons (like a CH₂ group, n=2), which splits the signal into a **t**riplet.\n    *   A set of three equivalent adjacent protons (like a CH₃ group, n=3), which splits the signal into a **q**uartet.\n*   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** For a proton's signal to be split into a `dtt`, it must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), causing a **d**oublet split.\n    *   A set of two equivalent adjacent protons (a CH₂ group, n=2), causing a **t**riplet split.\n    *   Another, chemically non-equivalent set of two adjacent protons (another CH₂ group, n=2), causing a second **t**riplet split.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Candidate Structure\n\nWe will now examine each structure to see if it contains protons that would produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **Option D: CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton on C4 is coupled to the proton on C3 (1H, doublet), the CH₂ group at C2 (2H, triplet), and the CH₃ group on C4 (3H, quartet). This gives a **dtq** signal.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule gives a `dtt` signal. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton on C3 is coupled to the CH₂ group at C4 (2H, triplet), the proton on C2 (1H, doublet), and the CH₃ group on C3 (3H, quartet). This gives a **dtq** (or tdq) signal.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule gives a `dtt` signal. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton on C3 is coupled to the proton on C2 (1H, doublet), the CH₂ group at C4 (2H, triplet), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C3 (2H, triplet). This gives a **dtt** signal.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule gives a `dtq` signal. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\n    By elimination, this must be the correct option. The condensed formula is ambiguous, but it corresponds to a molecular formula of C₉H₁₈O₂. The isomer that fits the NMR data is **4-ethyl-3-methylhexanoic acid**. Let's analyze its structure:\n    ```\n          CH₃   CH₂CH₃\n          |     |\n    CH₃CH₂-CH - CH - CH₂ - COOH\n          (4)   (3)   (2)\n    ```\n    *   **Proton on C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n        1.

The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is characteristic of a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four given options are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group is present in all candidates but does not help us differentiate between them.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in interpreting the complex splitting patterns described. A splitting pattern like \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" means a single proton is being split by three different, non-equivalent groups of neighboring protons. We will use the n+1 rule for each coupling.\n\n*   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This signal arises from a proton that is coupled to:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), causing a **doublet** (1+1=2 lines).\n    *   A group of two adjacent protons (n=2), causing a **triplet** (2+1=3 lines).\n    *   A group of three adjacent protons (n=3), causing a **quartet** (3+1=4 lines).\n*   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This signal arises from a proton that is coupled to:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), causing a **doublet** (1+1=2 lines).\n    *   A group of two adjacent protons (n=2), causing a **triplet** (2+1=3 lines).\n    *   Another, different group of two adjacent protons (n=2), causing another **triplet** (2+1=3 lines).\n\n### Step 3: Evaluating the Candidate Structures\n\nLet's examine the protons on the chiral centers (the C-H groups) of each molecule to see if they can produce the observed splitting patterns.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH:** This is 3,4-diethyl-5-methylhexanoic acid. This structure is overly complex and does not fit the pattern of the other options. We can likely disregard it.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    ```\n          H_c  H_b\n          |    |\n    CH₃-CH₂-CH - CH - COOH\n               |    |\n               CH₃  CH₃\n    ```\n    Let's analyze proton **H_c** (on carbon 3):\n    *   It is adjacent to **H_b** on C2 (1 proton) -> **doublet (d)**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the **CH₂** of the ethyl group (2 protons) -> **triplet (t)**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the **CH₃** group on C3 (3 protons) -> **quartet (q)**.\n    *   Combining these, the signal for **H_c** is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This perfectly matches one of the signals described in the problem.\n    *   Now, let's look for the `dtt`. The CH₂ protons of the ethyl group are diastereotopic (because they are adjacent to the C3 chiral center). They split each other (geminal coupling, a doublet) and are split by H_c (a doublet) and the terminal CH₃ (a quartet). This would result in a doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq). A complex 16-line `ddq` can be easily misidentified as an 18-line `dtt` in a real spectrum, especially with overlapping lines or similar coupling constants. This is a very plausible explanation for the observed `dtt`.\n\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    ```\n          H_c      H_b\n          |        |\n    CH₃-CH₂-CH - CH - COOH\n               |    |\n               C₂H₅ C₂H₅\n    ```\n    Let's analyze proton **H_c** (on carbon 3):\n    *   It is adjacent to **H_b** on C2 (1 proton) -> **doublet (d)**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the **CH₂** of the terminal ethyl group (2 protons) -> **triplet (t)**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the **CH₂** of the ethyl group on C3 (2 protons) -> **triplet (t)**.\n    *   Combining these, the signal for **H_c** is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the other signal. However, this molecule has no proton that could produce a `dtq`, as there is no proton coupled simultaneously to groups of 1, 2, and 3 protons.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    ```\n          H_d  H_c\n          |    |\n    CH₃ - CH - CH - CH₂ - COOH\n          |    |\n          CH₃  CH₃\n    ```\n    Let's analyze proton **H_c** (on carbon 3):\n    *   It is adjacent to **H_d** on C4 (1 proton) -> **doublet (d)**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the **CH₂** next to the COOH group (2 protons) -> **triplet (t)**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the **CH₃** group on C3 (3 protons) -> **quartet (q)**.\n    *   This gives a **dtq**. However, this molecule cannot produce a `dtt`. The other chiral proton, H_d, would be a doublet of quartets of quartets (dqq).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nStructure **B** is the only candidate that can definitively produce a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** for one of its protons (H_c). It also contains another complex signal (a `ddq` from the diastereotopic CH₂ protons) that could plausibly be misinterpreted as the reported **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. The other structures can produce one of the signals at best, but not both. Therefore, structure B is the correct identification.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectroscopy**: The presence of a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic indicator of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) group of a carboxylic acid. These two pieces of information strongly suggest the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy**: The ¹H NMR data is crucial for determining the carbon skeleton of the molecule. The absence of signals for vinyl hydrogens confirms that there are no carbon-carbon double bonds, which is consistent with all four proposed structures. The key to solving this problem lies in analyzing the complex splitting patterns.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**: This pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: a single proton (n=1, giving a doublet), a set of two equivalent protons (n=2, giving a triplet), and a set of three equivalent protons (n=3, giving a quartet). The total number of neighboring protons is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**: This pattern occurs when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: a single proton (n=1, giving a doublet), a set of two equivalent protons (n=2, giving a triplet), and another, different set of two equivalent protons (n=2, giving another triplet). The total number of neighboring protons is 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n\n### Evaluation of Potential Structures\n\nLet's analyze the proton environments in each of the candidate molecules to see which one would produce both of these specific splitting patterns. We will label the backbone carbons starting with the carboxyl carbon as C1.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**:\n    *   The proton on C3 is adjacent to the proton on C2 (1H), the CH₂ group at C4 (2H), and its own methyl group (3H). This environment (neighbors of 1H, 2H, and 3H) would produce a **dtq** signal.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule has neighbors consisting of one proton, a group of two protons, and another group of two protons. Thus, it cannot produce a **dtt** signal.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**:\n    *   The proton on C3 is adjacent to the CH₂ group at C2 (2H), the proton on C4 (1H), and its own methyl group (3H). This environment would produce a **dtq** signal.\n    *   Similar to structure B, there is no proton environment that would lead to a **dtt** signal.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**:\n    *   The proton on C3 is adjacent to the proton on C2 (1H), the CH₂ group at C4 (2H), and the CH₂ group of its own ethyl substituent (2H). This environment (neighbors of 1H, 2H, and 2H) would produce a **dtt** signal.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule has the correct set of neighbors (1H, 2H, and 3H) to produce a **dtq** signal.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid)**:\n    *   Let's analyze the protons on the main chain: `CH₃(C6)-CH(C5)(C₂H₅)-CH(C4)(C₂H₅)-CH(C3)₂-COOH(C1)`\n    *   **Proton on C4**: This proton is adjacent to the proton on C5 (1H), the CH₂ group at C3 (2H), and the CH₂ group of its own ethyl substituent (2H). This set of neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H) would result in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   **Proton on C5**: This proton is adjacent to the proton on C4 (1H), the CH₂ group of its own ethyl substituent (2H), and the terminal CH₃ group at C6 (3H). This set of neighbors (1H, 2H, 3H) would result in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly structure A, 3,4-diethylhexanoic acid, has protons in two different locations that perfectly match the described complex splitting patterns of both a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) and a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound:\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid that is undergoing hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n\nBoth pieces of FTIR data strongly indicate that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe key to identifying the correct structure lies in the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR spectrum. We need to find a molecule that contains protons with the following specific environments:\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**: This means the proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   A set of 1 proton (giving the **d**oublet, n=1)\n    *   A set of 2 protons (giving the **t**riplet, n=2)\n    *   A set of 3 protons (giving the **q**uartet, n=3)\n    *(Note: The order of the splitting, like qtd or tqd, depends on the relative size of the coupling constants, but the set of multiplicities is the key feature).*\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**: This means the proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   A set of 1 proton (giving the **d**oublet, n=1)\n    *   A set of 2 protons (giving one **t**riplet, n=2)\n    *   Another, different set of 2 protons (giving the second **t**riplet, n=2)\n\nNow, let's analyze the structure of each option to see which one would produce both of these signals.\n\n---\n\n**A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-Dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n`COOH-CH₂(e)-CH(d)(CH₃c)-CH(b)(CH₃a)₂`\n*   The proton `Hd` is coupled to `Hc` (3H), `Hb` (1H), and `He` (2H). This would result in a quartet of doublets of triplets (qdt), which matches the multiplicities of a `dtq`.\n*   However, there is no proton in this molecule coupled to one proton and two different sets of two protons. Thus, it cannot produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n**B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (3,4-Diethylhexanoic acid)**\n`COOH-CH₂(i)-CH(h)(C₂H₅g)-CH(f)(C₂H₅d,e)-CH₂(b)CH₃(a)`\n*   The proton `Hh` is coupled to `Hf` (1H), its ethyl `CH₂` `Hg` (2H), and the backbone `CH₂` `Hi` (2H). This would result in a **dtt** signal.\n*   There is no proton in this molecule coupled to a set of 1H, 2H, and 3H neighbors. Thus, it cannot produce a `dtq` signal.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-Dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n`COOH-CH(f)(CH₃g)-CH(d)(CH₃e)-CH₂(b)CH₃(a)`\n*   The proton `Hd` is coupled to `Hf` (1H), `He` (3H), and `Hb` (2H). This would result in a doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt), which matches the multiplicities of a `dtq`.\n*   There is no proton in this molecule that can produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-Diethylpentanoic acid)**\nLet's draw the structure and label the key protons:\n`COOH-CH₂(h)-CH(g)(CH₂f-CH₃e)-CH(b)(CH₂c-CH₃d)-CH₃(a)`\n\n*   **Analysis of proton `Hg` (at position 4):**\n    *   It is adjacent to proton `Hb` (1H), which will split it into a **doublet**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the `CH₂` of its own ethyl group, `Hf` (2H), which will split it into a **triplet**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the `CH₂` group in the main chain, `Hh` (2H), which will split it into another **triplet**.\n    *   Therefore, the signal for `Hg` is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n\n*   **Analysis of proton `Hb` (at position 3):**\n    *   It is adjacent to proton `Hg` (1H), which will split it into a **doublet**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the `CH₂` of its own ethyl group, `Hc` (2H), which will split it into a **triplet**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the terminal methyl group, `Ha` (3H), which will split it into a **quartet**.\n    *   Therefore, the signal for `Hb` is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** (or qtd/tqd depending on J-values). This matches the other required signal.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCompound D, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, is the only structure that contains a proton environment that gives a doublet of triplets of triplets (`dtt`) and a different proton environment that gives a doublet of triplets of quartets (`dtq`).\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe problem asks to identify an unknown compound from four possible structures based on its FTIR and 1H NMR spectra.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum**:\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H bond stretching in a carboxylic acid that is undergoing hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) bond stretching in a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The FTIR data strongly indicate that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the choices.\n\n2.  **1H NMR Spectrum**:\n    *   **No vinyl-hydrogens**: This indicates the absence of protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H). All four proposed structures are saturated and lack C=C bonds, which is consistent with this information.\n    *   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**: This complex splitting pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   A \"doublet\" implies coupling to **one** adjacent proton (n=1, n+1=2).\n        *   A \"triplet\" implies coupling to **two** equivalent adjacent protons (n=2, n+1=3).\n        *   A \"quartet\" implies coupling to **three** equivalent adjacent protons (n=3, n+1=4).\n    *   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**: This pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n        *   A \"doublet\" implies coupling to **one** adjacent proton (n=1, n+1=2).\n        *   A \"triplet\" implies coupling to **two** equivalent adjacent protons (n=2, n+1=3).\n        *   Another \"triplet\" implies coupling to another set of **two** non-equivalent adjacent protons (n=2, n+1=3).\n\n### Analysis of the Candidate Structures\n\nLet's analyze the proton environments in each proposed structure to see if they can produce the observed splitting patterns. We will focus on the methine (C-H) protons on the chiral centers, as they are most likely to exhibit such complex splitting.\n\n*   **B) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Let's analyze the proton on carbon 3 (C3-H): `CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)COOH`.\n    *   This proton is adjacent to:\n        1.  The `CH2` group of the ethyl chain (2 protons) -> would cause a **triplet**.\n        2.  The `CH` proton on carbon 2 (1 proton) -> would cause a **doublet**.\n        3.  The `CH3` group attached to carbon 3 (3 protons) -> would cause a **quartet**.\n    *   Therefore, the C3-H proton would show a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one of the signals. However, there is no proton in this molecule that is adjacent to one proton and two different CH2 groups, so a `dtt` signal is not possible.\n\n*   **C) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Let's analyze the proton on carbon 3 (C3-H): `CH3CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2COOH`.\n    *   This proton is adjacent to:\n        1.  The `CH` proton on carbon 4 (1 proton) -> would cause a **doublet**.\n        2.  The `CH3` group attached to carbon 3 (3 protons) -> would cause a **quartet**.\n        3.  The `CH2` group adjacent to the carboxyl group (2 protons) -> would cause a **triplet**.\n    *   Therefore, the C3-H proton would show a **doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**. This also matches the first signal. Similar to structure B, there is no proton environment that would produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **D) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Let's analyze the proton on carbon 3 (C3-H): `CH3CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)COOH`.\n    *   This proton is adjacent to:\n        1.  The `CH` proton on carbon 2 (1 proton) -> would cause a **doublet**.\n        2.  The `CH2` group of the main chain's ethyl group (2 protons) -> would cause a **triplet**.\n        3.  The `CH2` group of the ethyl substituent on carbon 3 (2 protons) -> would cause another **triplet**.\n    *   Therefore, the C3-H proton would show a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal described.\n    *   Now let's check for a `dtq`. A `dtq` requires a proton to be adjacent to a CH, a CH2, and a CH3 group. No such proton exists in this molecule. The other complex signals would be from the diastereotopic CH2 protons, which would likely appear as quartets of doublets of doublets (`qdd`), not a `dtq`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThere appears to be a contradiction in the problem statement, as none of the single structures (B, C, or D) can produce *both* a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal.\n*   Structures B and C can produce a `dtq` but not a `dtt`.\n*   Structure D can produce a `dtt` but not a `dtq`.\n\nHowever, in a forced-choice scenario, we must select the best possible answer. Structure D is the only one capable of producing the highly specific and less common \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" pattern. The other signal, a \"doublet of triplets of quartets,\" might be a misinterpretation of another complex multiplet present in structure D, such as a \"quartet of doublets of doublets\" (`qdd`), which arises from the diastereotopic methylene protons in the ethyl groups. Given that the `dtt` is unambiguously produced by structure D and only structure D, it is the most plausible intended answer, assuming an error in the description of the second signal. The structure for option A is ambiguous and its molecular formula (C10H20O2) is inconsistent with a logical interpretation of its condensed notation (C9H18O2).\n\nTherefore, based on the presence of the unique `dtt` signal, structure D is the most likely candidate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound.\n\n### 1. Analyze the FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules. This peak typically spans from about 2500 to 3300 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. For a carboxylic acid, this peak usually appears between 1700 and 1725 cm⁻¹.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the choices.\n\n### 2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated alkanoic acids, which is consistent with this observation.\n*   **A signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This is a complex splitting pattern. For a proton to show this pattern, it must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), giving a doublet (n+1=2).\n    *   Two adjacent protons (n=2), giving a triplet (n+1=3).\n    *   Three adjacent protons (n=3), giving a quartet (n+1=4).\n    The set of neighboring protons is {1H, 2H, 3H}.\n*   **A different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** For a proton to show this pattern, it must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One adjacent proton (n=1), giving a doublet (n+1=2).\n    *   Two adjacent protons (n=2), giving a triplet (n+1=3).\n    *   Another group of two adjacent protons (n=2), giving another triplet (n+1=3).\n    The set of neighboring protons is {1H, 2H, 2H}.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Candidate Structure\n\nWe need to find the structure that has one proton with {1H, 2H, 3H} neighbors AND another proton with {1H, 2H, 2H} neighbors. Let's analyze the protons on the carbon backbone for each option, as these are the most likely to have such complex splitting.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`HOOC-CH(b)(Et)-CH(c)(Et)-CH₂(f)-CH₃(g)`\n*   Proton **H(c)** is coupled to H(b) (1H), the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H), and the CH₂(f) of the pentanoic chain (2H). Neighbors = {1H, 2H, 2H}. This gives a **dtt** signal.\n*   No proton in this molecule has a {1H, 2H, 3H} neighbor set. For example, H(b) has neighbors {1H, 2H}. Thus, there is no `dtq` signal.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`HOOC-CH₂(b)-CH(c)(Me)-CH(d)(Me)-CH₃(e)`\n*   Proton **H(c)** is coupled to CH₂(b) (2H), H(d) (1H), and the methyl group CH₃ (3H). Neighbors = {1H, 2H, 3H}. This gives a **dtq** (or tdq) signal.\n*   No proton in this molecule has a {1H, 2H, 2H} neighbor set. For example, H(d) has neighbors {1H, 3H, 3H}. Thus, there is no `dtt` signal.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid**\n`HOOC-CH₂(b)-CH(c)(Me)-CH(d)(Me)-CH₂(e)-CH₃(f)`\n*   Proton **H(d)** is coupled to H(c) (1H), CH₂(e) (2H), and its methyl group (3H). Neighbors = {1H, 2H, 3H}. This gives a **dtq** signal.\n*   Proton **H(c)** is also coupled to H(d) (1H), CH₂(b) (2H), and its methyl group (3H). Neighbors = {1H, 2H, 3H}. This gives another **dtq** signal.\n*   There is no proton with a {1H, 2H, 2H} neighbor set. Thus, there is no `dtt` signal.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\nStructure:\n```\n           Et(f)          Et(h)\n           |              |\n(a)CH₃ -- CH(b) -- CH(c) -- CH₂(d) -- COOH\n```\n*   Let's analyze proton **H(b)** (on C4):\n    *   It is adjacent to **CH₃(a)** (3 protons) → gives a quartet.\n    *   It is adjacent to **H(c)** (1 proton) → gives a doublet.\n    *   It is adjacent to the **CH₂** of its ethyl group **Et(h)** (2 protons) → gives a triplet.\n    *   The neighbors of H(b) are {1H, 2H, 3H}. This proton will show a **dtq** (doublet of triplets of quartets) signal. This matches the data.\n\n*   Now let's analyze proton **H(c)** (on C3):\n    *   It is adjacent to **H(b)** (1 proton) → gives a doublet.\n    *   It is adjacent to the **CH₂(d)** group (2 protons) → gives a triplet.\n    *   It is adjacent to the **CH₂** of its ethyl group **Et(f)** (2 protons) → gives another triplet.\n    *   The neighbors of H(c) are {1H, 2H, 2H}. This proton will show a **dtt** (doublet of triplets of triplets) signal. This also matches the data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMolecule D, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, is the only structure that contains a proton (H_b) that would produce a `dtq` signal and a different proton (H_c) that would produce a `dtt` signal. Therefore, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nAfter a thorough analysis of the provided spectroscopic data and the candidate structures, the correct compound can be identified.\n\n### Spectroscopic Analysis\n\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy**: The presence of a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carboxylic acid functional group (COOH). The broadness of the 3000 cm⁻¹ peak is due to the hydrogen bonding of the O-H group, and the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch. All four possible compounds are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy**: The problem states that there are no signals corresponding to vinyl hydrogens, which is consistent with all four structures as they are all saturated alkanoic acids. The key to identifying the correct structure lies in the complex splitting patterns observed. A signal is described as a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**, and another as a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\n### Analysis of Candidate Structures\n\nTo produce a specific splitting pattern, a proton must be coupled to a precise number of neighboring non-equivalent protons.\n*   A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** means a proton is coupled to one proton (giving the doublet), a group of two equivalent protons (giving the triplet), and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet). This proton has a total of 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 neighboring protons.\n*   A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** implies a proton is coupled to one proton (doublet), a group of two equivalent protons (first triplet), and another distinct group of two equivalent protons (second triplet). This proton has a total of 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 neighboring protons.\n\nLet's analyze the structures based on these requirements:\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**: The proton at the C3 position is coupled to the proton at C2 (1H, doublet), the two protons of the ethyl's CH₂ group (2H, triplet), and the three protons of the methyl group on C3 (3H, quartet). This proton would indeed show a **dtq** signal. However, this molecule lacks a proton with the required five neighbors (split into groups of 1, 2, and 2) to produce a dtt signal.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**: The proton at the C3 position is coupled to the proton at C4 (1H, doublet), the two protons of the CH₂ group at C2 (2H, triplet), and the three protons of the methyl group at C3 (3H, quartet). This would also produce a **dtq** signal. Similar to option B, this molecule does not have a proton environment that would lead to a dtt signal.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**: The proton at the C3 position is coupled to the proton at C2 (1H, doublet), the two protons of the CH₂ group at C4 (2H, triplet), and the two protons of the CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent at C3 (2H, triplet). This proton's signal would be a **dtt**. However, this molecule does not possess a proton with the six required neighbors (1, 2, and 3) to generate a dtq signal. The other methine proton (H-2) and the various diastereotopic methylene protons would lead to other complex signals like doublet of triplets (dt) or doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq), but not a dtq.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid)**: Let's analyze the protons on the main chain.\n    *   The proton at the C4 position is coupled to the proton at C3 (1H, doublet), the two protons of the CH₂ group at C5 (2H, triplet), and the two protons of the CH₂ of the ethyl group attached to C4 (2H, triplet). This creates a **dtt** signal.\n    *   Now, let's examine the protons on the CH₂ group at position 5 (`-CH₂-CH₃`). These two protons are diastereotopic (chemically non-equivalent) due to the adjacent chiral center at C4. Let's consider one of them. It is coupled to its geminal partner (1H, doublet), the proton at C4 (1H, doublet), and the three protons of the terminal methyl group (3H, quartet). This would result in a doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq), not a dtq.\n\nThere appears to be a contradiction, as no single structure seems to produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` based on a standard first-order analysis. However, in complex molecules, predicting exact splitting patterns can be difficult. It's possible that in one of the molecules, a combination of chiral centers leads to unexpected equivalences or long-range couplings that produce the observed patterns.\n\nRevisiting the most complex structures, A and D, they are the only ones with enough methylene groups to plausibly generate a dtt signal. Between the options that can generate a `dtq` (B and C) and those that can generate a `dtt` (A and D), there must be a correct choice. Given the complexity, let's reconsider the structure from option A. The problem lists two signals, a `dtq` and a `dtt`. It is the only structure that is complex enough to potentially exhibit both through more subtle effects, and it definitively has a proton environment (`dtt`) that is impossible in B and C. If we are forced to choose the best fit, **A** is the only one that contains the necessary structural elements for both complex patterns, even if the dtq is not immediately obvious from a simple analysis. The combination of multiple chiral centers and flexible ethyl chains in compound A makes it the most likely candidate to exhibit such complex and varied splitting patterns.\n\nUpon re-evaluating C: `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH`, H-3 is coupled to H-4 (1H), the C2-`CH2` (2H), and the C3-`CH3` (3H). This is a clean **dtq**. Let's reconsider H-4. It is coupled to H-3 (1H), the C4-`CH3` (3H), and the C5-`CH3` (3H). This would be a doublet of quartets of quartets (dqq), not a dtt. Therefore, based on the clear presence of a `dtq` and the lack of a clear `dtt` in other molecules, and the presence of a clear `dtt` in molecule A, there might be an error in the problem description or one of the provided structures. However, among the choices, `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH` provides the clearest example of a proton with a `dtq` splitting pattern.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the question and only one of the splitting patterns is the key identifier.\n- If the key is the `dtq`, the answer could be B or C.\n- If the key is the `dtt`, the answer could be A or D.\n\nLet's assume the question is correct and both patterns exist. We must find the molecule that can support both. As argued above, H-3 in molecule C (`CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH`) is a clear `dtq`. While a `dtt` is not immediately apparent, this structure is less complex than A or D. A definitive assignment without ambiguity is difficult. However, let's re-examine the splitting pattern description. A \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" is less common than a \"doublet of triplets of quartets\". It is possible that the \"dtt\" is a misinterpretation of a more complex multiplet. The `dtq` in structure C is textbook. No other structure presents such a clear `dtq` while also being plausible.\n\nLet's choose the structure with the most certain match.\nStructure C, `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH`, has a proton at C-3 which is coupled to H-4 (1H, gives a doublet), the CH2 group at C-2 (2H, gives a triplet), and the methyl group on C-3 (3H, gives a quartet). This proton signal is unambiguously a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq). While the origin of the dtt signal is not obvious in this structure, the presence of the dtq is certain. None of the other molecules provide such a clear origin for both described signals.\n\nFinal decision leans towards the most unambiguous assignment. The H-3 proton in molecule C perfectly matches the `dtq` description.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is my step-by-step thinking process to identify the correct compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but doesn't distinguish between the isomers.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   The problem states there are no vinyl-hydrogens, which means no C=C double bonds. This is consistent with all four saturated structures.\n    *   The key information lies in the splitting patterns (multiplicity) of two specific signals:\n        *   Signal 1: A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This means a single proton is coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons: one group with 1 proton (giving the doublet), one group with 2 protons (giving the triplet), and one group with 3 protons (giving the quartet).\n        *   Signal 2: A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This means a single proton is coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons: one group with 1 proton (giving the doublet), one group with 2 protons (giving a triplet), and another different group with 2 protons (giving the second triplet).\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Candidate Structure:**\n    I will now analyze the protons on the carbon backbone of each molecule to see if they can produce these specific splitting patterns. I will focus on the methine (CH) protons, as they are most likely to have multiple different neighbors.\n\n    *   **A) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid):**\n        Let's label the key protons: `CH3-CH2-CH(c)(C2H5)-CH(f)(C2H5)-COOH`\n        *   Proton H(f): Coupled to H(c) (1H, doublet) and the adjacent CH2 of its ethyl group (2H, triplet). This gives a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n        *   Proton H(c): Coupled to H(f) (1H, doublet), the adjacent CH2 on the main chain (2H, triplet), and the adjacent CH2 of its ethyl group (2H, triplet). This gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n        *   This molecule has a `dtt` but does not have any proton with neighbors (1H, 2H, and 3H) that would create a `dtq`. So, A is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n        Let's label the key protons: `CH3(a)-CH(b)(C2H5)-CH(e)(C2H5)-CH2(h)-COOH`\n        *   Proton H(b): Coupled to the terminal CH3(a) group (3H, quartet), the adjacent H(e) proton (1H, doublet), and the adjacent CH2 of its ethyl group (2H, triplet). The neighbors are [3H, 1H, 2H]. This gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal.\n        *   Proton H(e): Coupled to the adjacent H(b) proton (1H, doublet), the adjacent CH2(h) group (2H, triplet), and the adjacent CH2 of its ethyl group (2H, triplet). The neighbors are [1H, 2H, 2H]. This gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal.\n        *   Since this molecule has protons that produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt`, it is a perfect match for the data.\n\n    *   **C) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n        Let's label the key protons: `CH3CH2-CH(c)(CH3)-CH(e)(CH3)-COOH`\n        *   Proton H(c): Coupled to H(e) (1H, doublet), the adjacent CH2 on the main chain (2H, triplet), and the adjacent CH3 group (3H, quartet). This gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n        *   However, there is no proton in this molecule that is coupled to [1H, 2H, 2H] to form a `dtt`. For example, H(e) is coupled to H(c) (1H) and a CH3 group (3H), giving a doublet of quartets. So, C is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n        Let's label the key protons: `CH3-CH(b)(CH3)-CH(d)(CH3)-CH2-COOH`\n        *   Proton H(d): Coupled to H(b) (1H, doublet), the adjacent CH2 group (2H, triplet), and the adjacent CH3 group (3H, quartet). This gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n        *   Similar to molecule C, there is no proton that can produce a `dtt`. H(b) is coupled to H(d) (1H) and two different CH3 groups (3H each), giving a doublet of quartets of quartets. So, D is incorrect.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:** Only molecule B has protons that would exhibit both a `dtq` and a `dtt` splitting pattern in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes candidate molecules to find one matching the given 1H NMR splitting patterns.\n\n    The problem requires identifying a compound that shows both:\n    1.

The significant broadening is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group is correct but does not help distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Data\n\nThe most crucial information for distinguishing between the isomers lies in the proton NMR splitting patterns. We are given two specific, complex splitting patterns for two different protons in the molecule.\n\n*   **No vinyl hydrogens:** This confirms the compound is saturated (contains no C=C double bonds), which is consistent with all four options.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a **doublet** (n+1 = 2).\n    *   Two neighboring protons (n=2), causing a **triplet** (n+1 = 3).\n    *   Three neighboring protons (n=3), causing a **quartet** (n+1 = 4).\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This means a different proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a **doublet** (n+1 = 2).\n    *   Two neighboring protons (n=2), causing a **triplet** (n+1 = 3).\n    *   Another, different set of two neighboring protons (n=2), causing a second **triplet** (n+1 = 3).\n\nOur task is to find the single structure among the options that contains protons matching both of these complex splitting patterns. We will analyze the methine protons (CH groups) on the main carbon chain, as they are most likely to exhibit such complex splitting.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Proposed Structure\n\nLet's draw each structure and analyze the expected splitting for its key protons. We will number the carbon chain starting from the COOH group as C1.\n\n**A) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH -> 3,4-Dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH3(5)-CH(4)(CH3)-CH(3)(CH3)-CH2(2)-COOH(1)`\n*   **Proton at C3 (H-3):** Coupled to H-2 (2 protons, triplet), H-4 (1 proton, doublet), and the C3-methyl (3 protons, quartet).

This structure has one of the required signals.\n*   **Proton at C4 (H-4):** Coupled to H-3 (1 proton, doublet) and the two methyl groups attached to it (6 protons total, likely a septet). This would be a doublet of septets.\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure A has a `dtq` but not a `dtt`.\n\n**B) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH -> 2,3-Dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH3(5)-CH2(4)-CH(3)(CH3)-CH(2)(CH3)-COOH(1)`\n*   **Proton at C3 (H-3):** Coupled to H-2 (1 proton, doublet), H-4 (2 protons, triplet), and the C3-methyl (3 protons, quartet). This gives a **dtq**. This structure has one of the required signals.\n*   **Proton at C2 (H-2):** Coupled to H-3 (1 proton, doublet) and the C2-methyl (3 protons, quartet). This gives a doublet of quartets (`dq`).\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure B has a `dtq` but not a `dtt`.\n\n**D) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH -> 3,4-Diethylhexanoic acid**\n`CH3(6)-CH2(5)-CH(4)(C2H5)-CH(3)(C2H5)-COOH(1)`\n*   **Proton at C4 (H-4):** Coupled to H-3 (1 proton, doublet), H-5 (2 protons, triplet), and the CH2 of its ethyl group (2 protons, triplet). This gives a **dtt**. This structure has one of the required signals.\n*   **Proton at C3 (H-3):** Coupled to H-4 (1 proton, doublet) and the CH2 of its ethyl group (2 protons, triplet). This gives a doublet of triplets (`dt`).\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure D has a `dtt` but not a `dtq`.\n\n**C) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH -> 3,4-Diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH3(5)-CH(4)(C2H5)-CH(3)(C2H5)-CH2(2)-COOH(1)`\n\nLet's analyze the two key methine protons, H-3 and H-4.\n\n*   **Proton at C4 (H-4):**\n    *   It is adjacent to the methine proton at C3 (1 proton) -> gives a **doublet**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the CH3 group at C5 (3 protons) -> gives a **quartet**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the CH2 group of the ethyl substituent on C4 (2 protons) -> gives a **triplet**.\n    *   Combining these, the signal for H-4 will be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first required signal.\n\n*   **Proton at C3 (H-3):**\n    *   It is adjacent to the methine proton at C4 (1 proton) -> gives a **doublet**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the CH2 group at C2 (2 protons) -> gives a **triplet**.\n    *   It is adjacent to the CH2 group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2 protons) -> gives another **triplet**.\n    *   Combining these, the signal for H-3 will be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second required signal.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure C is the only candidate that contains a proton (H-4) that produces a `dtq` signal AND a different proton (H-3) that produces a `dtt` signal.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nThe FTIR data confirms a carboxylic acid. The 1H NMR splitting patterns are the deciding factor. Only structure C, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, has two different methine protons whose neighboring environments perfectly match the requirements to produce one `doublet of triplets of quartets` signal and one `doublet of triplets of triplets` signal.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.

Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in analyzing the complex splitting patterns (multiplicities) described. We need to find the structure that would produce both a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** and a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\nLet's break down what these multiplicities mean according to the n+1 rule:\n*   **Doublet (d):** The proton is coupled to 1 neighboring proton.\n*   **Triplet (t):** The proton is coupled to 2 equivalent neighboring protons (like a CH₂ group).\n*   **Quartet (q):** The proton is coupled to 3 equivalent neighboring protons (like a CH₃ group).\n*   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** The proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: one proton (giving the doublet), a CH₂ group (giving the triplet), and a CH₃ group (giving the quartet).\n*   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** The proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: one proton (giving the doublet), a CH₂ group (giving a triplet), and a second, different CH₂ group (giving another triplet).\n\nNow, let's analyze the expected splitting patterns for the methine (CH) protons in each candidate molecule. We will number the carbon chain starting from the COOH group as carbon 1.\n\n---\n\n#### **Candidate A: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\nThis structure is **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n```\n         Et      Et\n         |       |\nCH₃(5)CH₂(4)-C(H)₃-C(H)₂-COOH(1)\n```\n*   **H₃:** Is coupled to H₂ (1H, doublet), H₄ (2H, triplet), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, triplet).

This signal would be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   **Result:** This structure provides a `dtq` but also a `dqq`, not the required `dtt`. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n---\n\n#### **Candidate D: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\nThis structure is **2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n```\n         Me      Me\n         |       |\nCH₃(5)CH₂(4)-C(H)₃-C(H)₂-COOH(1)\n```\n*   **H₃:** Is coupled to H₂ (1H, doublet), the CH₂ group at C4 (2H, triplet), and the methyl group on C3 (3H, quartet).

We are looking for a molecule that shows two specific complex splitting patterns for two different proton signals.\n\n1.  **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    This complex splitting, also called a multiplet, arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Indicates coupling to one adjacent proton (-CH).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Indicates coupling to two adjacent, equivalent protons (-CH₂).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** Indicates coupling to three adjacent, equivalent protons (-CH₃).\n\n2.  **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    This pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Indicates coupling to one adjacent proton (-CH).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Indicates coupling to two adjacent, equivalent protons (-CH₂).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Indicates coupling to another, different set of two adjacent, equivalent protons (-CH₂).\n\n### **Evaluating the Candidate Structures**\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting for the key protons (the ones on the main carbon chain) in each molecule.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   This structure contains a proton that is coupled to one methine (-CH) and two different methylene (-CH₂) groups. This would produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**, matching the second signal.\n    *   However, there is no proton in this molecule that is adjacent to a methyl (-CH₃), a methylene (-CH₂), and a methine (-CH) group simultaneously. Therefore, it cannot produce a doublet of triplets of quartets.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   This structure has a proton (at C3) that is adjacent to a methine (-CH), a methylene (-CH₂), and a methyl (-CH₃) group. This would result in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**, matching the first signal.\n    *   However, it does not have any proton that is adjacent to one methine and two different methylene groups. Therefore, it cannot produce a doublet of triplets of triplets.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   **Proton at C4**: This proton is adjacent to a methine (H at C3), a methyl group (at C5), and the methylene group of the ethyl substituent at C4. This environment leads to coupling with one proton (doublet), three protons (quartet), and two protons (triplet). This perfectly matches the **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** signal.\n    *   **Proton at C3**: This proton is adjacent to a methine (H at C4), the methylene group in the main chain (at C2), and the methylene group of the ethyl substituent at C3. This environment leads to coupling with one proton (doublet), two protons (triplet), and another set of two protons (triplet). This perfectly matches the **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** signal.\n    *   This molecule is the only candidate that satisfies both ¹H NMR signal descriptions.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   This structure has a proton (at C3) that would give a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   However, the proton at C4 is coupled to a methine and two methyl groups, which would result in a doublet of quartets of quartets, not a doublet of triplets of triplets.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of both FTIR and ¹H NMR data, only compound C, CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH, is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nThe problem asks to identify an unknown compound from four possible structures based on its FTIR and 1H NMR spectra.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Data\n\n*   **A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The broadness is a key characteristic.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\nConclusion from FTIR: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Data\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H). All four given structures are saturated, consistent with this information.\n*   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex splitting pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** The proton is coupled to one adjacent proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** The proton is coupled to two adjacent protons (a CH₂ group, n=2).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** The proton is coupled to three adjacent protons (a CH₃ group, n=3).\n    Therefore, the proton giving the `dtq` signal must be bonded to a carbon that is adjacent to a CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group.\n*   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern arises from a proton coupled to three different sets of neighbors:\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Coupled to one adjacent proton (a CH group, n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Coupled to two adjacent protons (a CH₂ group, n=2).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Coupled to another, different set of two adjacent protons (another CH₂ group, n=2).\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Structures\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting for the key protons (the methine, -CH-, protons) in each structure.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is adjacent to the C4-H (1H), the C2-CH₂ (2H), and the C3-CH₃ (3H). This would result in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   However, there is no proton in this molecule that is adjacent to one CH group and two separate CH₂ groups, so a `dtt` signal is not possible.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid):**\n    *   Let's analyze the proton at C4: `Et-CH(at C4)(Et)-CH(at C3)(Et)-COOH`. This proton is adjacent to the C3-H (1H), the CH₂ of the main-chain ethyl group (2H), and the CH₂ of the ethyl substituent on C4 (2H). This proton would show a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches Signal 2.\n    *   However, for a `dtq` signal, a proton needs to be adjacent to a methyl group. None of the methine (CH) protons in this molecule are adjacent to a methyl group. The methylene (CH₂) protons are adjacent to methyl groups, but their splitting pattern would be a doublet of doublets of quartets (`ddq`), not a `dtq`.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH:** The chemical formula for this structure is C₁₀H₂₀O₂, but the written structure is ambiguous and does not easily conform to standard valency rules. It is likely an erroneous representation.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   Let's label the key protons: `CH₃-CH₂-CHᵃ(CH₃)-CHᵇ(CH₃)-COOH`.\n    *   **Proton Hᵃ (at C3):** This proton is adjacent to the C2 proton Hᵇ (1H), the CH₂ group of the ethyl chain (2H), and the methyl group at C3 (3H). According to the n+1 rule for complex splitting, its signal would be a **doublet** (from Hᵇ), a **triplet** (from the CH₂), and a **quartet** (from the CH₃). This gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**, a perfect match for Signal 1.\n    *   **Proton Hᵇ (at C2):** This proton is adjacent to the C3 proton Hᵃ (1H), the methyl group at C2 (3H), and the carboxylic acid proton (1H). Coupling to the COOH proton is often suppressed, but if it occurs, the signal would be a doublet of quartets of doublets (`dqd`). If it does not occur, it would be a doublet of quartets (`dq`). Neither of these patterns is a `dtt`. There is no proton in this molecule that could produce a `dtt` signal as it lacks a proton neighbored by two different CH₂ groups.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThere is a contradiction in the provided spectral data, as no single molecule from the options perfectly explains both the `dtq` and the `dtt` signals based on standard first-order splitting rules.\n*   Molecule **D** provides a perfect explanation for the **dtq** signal.\n*   Molecule **B** provides a perfect explanation for the **dtt** signal.\n\nHowever, we must select the best possible answer. The `dtq` signal explicitly requires coupling to a methyl group (to produce the quartet). Molecule D has methyl groups appropriately positioned on the chiral carbons (C2 and C3). Molecule B lacks methyl groups on the relevant methine carbons. Therefore, molecule D is the only one of the plausible structures that can produce the `dtq` signal as described. It is most likely that the second signal (`dtt`) is a misinterpretation of a different complex multiplet present in molecule D (like a `dqd`), which can occur in molecules with multiple chiral centers. Given the unambiguous origin of the `dtq` signal in molecule D, it stands as the most plausible candidate.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic spectroscopic feature for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is typical for the carbonyl group within a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group present but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n### **2. Analysis of 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four given structures are saturated alkanoic acids, which is consistent with this observation.\n*   **Key Splitting Patterns:** The most distinctive information comes from the complex splitting patterns (multiplets) described:\n    *   One signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   A different signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\nTo understand these patterns, let's break down what they mean in terms of neighboring protons according to the n+1 rule:\n*   **Doublet (d):** The proton is coupled to 1 adjacent proton (a CH group).\n*   **Triplet (t):** The proton is coupled to 2 equivalent adjacent protons (a CH₂ group).\n*   **Quartet (q):** The proton is coupled to 3 equivalent adjacent protons (a CH₃ group).\n\nTherefore:\n*   A proton that appears as a **dtq** must be a single proton (a CH methine group) that has three distinct neighboring groups: another CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group.\n*   A proton that appears as a **dtt** must be a single proton (a CH methine group) that has three distinct neighboring groups: another CH group and two different CH₂ groups.\n\n### **3. Analysis of Each Proposed Structure**\n\nNow, let's examine each of the four possible structures to see if its protons would produce these specific splitting patterns. We will use IUPAC names for clarity.\n\n**A) `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`**\nThis condensed formula represents **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\nLet's draw and label the structure for analysis (numbering from the COOH group):\n```\n        CH₂-CH₃ (from C4-ethyl)\n        |\n(5)CH₃-CH(4)-CH(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)\n             |\n             CH₂-CH₃ (from C3-ethyl)\n```\n*   **Proton on C3 (H-3):** This proton is on a chiral center. Its neighbors are:\n    *   The CH₂ group at C2 (2 protons → gives a **triplet**).\n    *   The CH group at C4 (1 proton → gives a **doublet**).\n    *   The CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2 protons → gives a **triplet**).\n    Therefore, the signal for H-3 will be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n\n*   **Proton on C4 (H-4):** This proton is also on a chiral center. Its neighbors are:\n    *   The CH group at C3 (1 proton → gives a **doublet**).\n    *   The CH₃ group at C5 (3 protons → gives a **quartet**).\n    *   The CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent on C4 (2 protons → gives a **triplet**).\n    Therefore, the signal for H-4 will be a **doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**. This is a permutation of `dtq` and arises from the same set of neighbors (CH, CH₂, CH₃). The order of the letters (d, q, t) depends on the relative magnitudes of the coupling constants (J-values), but the multiplicity and the neighbors are correct. This matches the other observed signal.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** Structure A is consistent with having both a `dtt` signal and a `dtq`-type signal.\n\n**B) `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH`**\nThis is **2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   **H-3:** Neighbors are H-2 (CH), H-4 (CH₂), and the C3-methyl (CH₃). This gives a **dtq** signal.\n*   **H-2:** Neighbors are H-3 (CH) and the C2-methyl (CH₃). This gives a doublet of quartets (dq).\nThis structure has a `dtq` signal but lacks a `dtt` signal.\n\n**C) `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH`**\nThis is **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   **H-3:** Neighbors are H-2 (CH), H-4 (CH₂), and the C3-ethyl (CH₂). This gives a **dtt** signal.\n*   **H-2:** Neighbors are H-3 (CH) and the C2-ethyl (CH₂). This gives a doublet of triplets (dt).\nThis structure has a `dtt` signal but lacks a `dtq` signal.\n\n**D) `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH`**\nThis is **3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   **H-3:** Neighbors are H-2 (CH₂), H-4 (CH), and the C3-methyl (CH₃). This gives a **tdq** (or `dtq`-type) signal.\n*   **H-4:** Neighbors are H-3 (CH) and the two C4-methyl groups (6 protons). This gives a doublet of septets (ds).\nThis structure has a `dtq`-type signal but lacks a `dtt` signal.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly structure **A (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)** has two different methine (CH) protons that match the described NMR splitting patterns: one proton (H-3) gives a `dtt` signal, and another proton (H-4) gives a `dqt` (or `dtq`) signal. Therefore, the unknown compound is the one represented by formula A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the region of 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretching in a carboxylic acid that is undergoing hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** A strong, sharp peak around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) bond stretching, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible options (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH), so this information confirms the functional group but does not help differentiate between the choices.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\nThe key to solving this problem lies in analyzing the complex splitting patterns described. The multiplicity of a signal is determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons according to the n+1 rule. When a proton is coupled to multiple, different sets of neighboring protons, it results in complex splitting (a multiplet of multiplets).\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   This means the proton giving rise to this signal is coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Coupled to **one** neighboring proton (1+1=2).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Coupled to **two** neighboring protons (2+1=3).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** Coupled to **three** neighboring protons (3+1=4).\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton (let's call it Hx) with the following neighbors: a CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group. `(CH)-CHx-(CH₂)-(CH₃)`\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   This means a different proton in the molecule is also coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Coupled to **one** neighboring proton.\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Coupled to **two** neighboring protons.\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Coupled to another, different set of **two** neighboring protons.\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a proton (let's call it Hy) with the following neighbors: a CH group and two different CH₂ groups. `(CH)-CHy-(CH₂)-(CH₂)`\n\n**3. Evaluating the Candidate Structures**\n\nLet's examine the protons on the chiral centers (the `C(H)` carbons) for each molecule, as they will have the most complex splitting.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH:**\n    *   Proton at C3 (`-CH(CH₃)-CH₂COOH`): Coupled to H at C4 (d), CH₂ at C2 (t), and its own CH₃ (q). This gives a **dtq**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   Proton at C4 (`-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-`): Coupled to H at C3 (d) and two different CH₃ groups (q and q). This does not give a dtt.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH:**\n    Let's draw the main chain and label the key protons Ha and Hb.\n    ```\n          Ha    Hb\n          |     |\n    CH₃ - C  -  C  - CH₂(c) - COOH\n          |     |\n        C₂H₅(d) C₂H₅(e)\n    ```\n    *   **Proton Ha:**\n        *   Coupled to **Hb** (1H) → doublet (d)\n        *   Coupled to the adjacent **CH₃** group (3H) → quartet (q)\n        *   Coupled to the **CH₂** of its ethyl group (C₂H₅(d)) (2H) → triplet (t)\n        *   The resulting signal for Ha is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   **Proton Hb:**\n        *   Coupled to **Ha** (1H) → doublet (d)\n        *   Coupled to the adjacent **CH₂(c)** group (2H) → triplet (t)\n        *   Coupled to the **CH₂** of its ethyl group (C₂H₅(e)) (2H) → triplet (t)\n        *   The resulting signal for Hb is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches Signal 2.\n    *   **This molecule exhibits both required splitting patterns.**\n\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH:**\n    *   Proton at C3 (`-CH₂(b)-CHa(C₂H₅)-`): Coupled to Hb (d), CH₂ at C4 (t), and CH₂ of its ethyl group (t). This gives a **dtt**. This matches Signal 2.\n    *   Proton at C2 (`-CHb(C₂H₅)-COOH`): Coupled to Ha (d) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (t). This gives a doublet of triplets. It does not give a dtq.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH:**\n    *   Proton at C3 (`-CH₂(b)-CHa(CH₃)-`): Coupled to Hb (d), CH₂(b) (t), and its own CH₃ (q). This gives a **dtq**. This matches Signal 1.\n    *   Proton at C2 (`-CHb(CH₃)-COOH`): Coupled to Ha (d) and its own CH₃ (q). This gives a doublet of quartets. It does not give a dtt.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nOnly structure B, `CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH`, contains protons that would produce both a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to identify the correct compound.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Spectroscopy Data\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded system. The significant broadening is characteristic of carboxylic acids, which form dimers through hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. A frequency of 1700 cm⁻¹ is typical for the carbonyl group in a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The data strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. All four provided options are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirm the functional group type but do not help distinguish between the isomers.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in analyzing the splitting patterns (multiplicity) of the signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **No Vinyl Hydrogens:** This tells us the molecule is saturated and contains no C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated, which is consistent with this finding.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex splitting means there is a proton in the molecule that is coupled to three different, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   A single proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **d**oublet (n+1 = 2).\n    *   A group of two protons (n=2), which splits the signal into a **t**riplet (n+1 = 3).\n    *   A group of three protons (n=3), which splits the signal into a **q**uartet (n+1 = 4).\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This means a different proton in the molecule is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   A single proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **d**oublet (n+1 = 2).\n    *   A group of two protons (n=2), which splits the signal into a **t**riplet (n+1 = 3).\n    *   Another, chemically distinct group of two protons (n=2), which splits the signal into another **t**riplet (n+1 = 3).\n\n### 3. Evaluation of Each Candidate Structure\n\nWe must now analyze the protons on the main carbon chain (the methine, or CH, protons) for each option to see if they can produce these specific splitting patterns.\n\n**A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   The proton at C3 is coupled to the CH₂ at C2 (2H), the CH at C4 (1H), and the C3-methyl group (3H). This would produce a **dtq** signal.\n*   However, no proton in this molecule is coupled to one proton, a group of two protons, and another group of two protons.

This would produce a **dtt** signal.\n*   However, no proton in this molecule is coupled to a group of one, two, and three protons. Therefore, it cannot produce the **dtq** signal.\n*   *Conclusion: Incorrect.*\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (This is 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid)**\nLet's analyze the two central methine (CH) protons in this structure.\nLet's label the key protons Hc and Hd:\n`      CH₃`\n`      |`\n`CH₃-CH(c)-CH(d)-(CH₂)-COOH`\n`          |`\n`          CH₂CH₃`\n\n*   **Proton Hc:** This proton is coupled to:\n    1.  The `CH₃` group above it (3H) → gives a **quartet**.\n    2.  The `CH` proton next to it (Hd, 1H) → gives a **doublet**.\n    3.  The `CH₂` of the ethyl group on the same carbon (2H) → gives a **triplet**.\n    The resulting signal for Hc is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This perfectly matches the first signal described.\n\n*   **Proton Hd:** This proton is coupled to:\n    1.  The `CH` proton next to it (Hc, 1H) → gives a **doublet**.\n    2.  The `CH₂` group in the chain towards the acid (2H) → gives a **triplet**.\n    3.

The broadness is due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This signal is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. The position is consistent with the carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group is present in all candidates but doesn't help distinguish between them.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data\n\nThe key to identifying the correct isomer lies in the complex splitting patterns (multiplicity) of the proton signals. The multiplicity is described by the \"n+1\" rule, where 'n' is the number of equivalent neighboring protons. When a proton is coupled to multiple *different* sets of neighboring protons, the splitting pattern becomes more complex (e.g., a doublet of triplets).\n\nThe problem states there are two particularly complex signals:\n\n1.  **A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This means a single proton is being split by three different, non-equivalent groups of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** implies coupling to 1 neighboring proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** implies coupling to 2 neighboring protons (n=2, typically a -CH₂- group).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** implies coupling to 3 neighboring protons (n=3, typically a -CH₃ group).\n    *   Therefore, the proton that gives this signal must be a methine (-CH-) proton adjacent to a -CH- group, a -CH₂- group, and a -CH₃ group. The set of neighboring protons is **{1H, 2H, 3H}**.\n\n2.  **A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This means another, different proton is also being split by three non-equivalent groups of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** implies coupling to 1 neighboring proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** implies coupling to 2 neighboring protons (n=2).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** implies coupling to another, non-equivalent group of 2 neighboring protons (n=2).\n    *   Therefore, the proton that gives this signal must be a methine (-CH-) proton adjacent to a -CH- group and two different -CH₂- groups. The set of neighboring protons is **{1H, 2H, 2H}**.\n\n**The task is to find the structure that has one methine proton with a {1H, 2H, 3H} neighborhood and another methine proton with a {1H, 2H, 2H} neighborhood.**\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Candidate Structure\n\nThe code output confirms the manual analysis of the neighboring protons for the methine (CH) groups in each structure.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Let's draw and number the main chain:\n        `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **Proton at C3 (H³):** Its neighbors are H⁴ (1H), the two H's at C2 (2H), and the two H's on the ethyl group's CH₂ (2H). The neighbor set is **{1H, 2H, 2H}**. This will produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   **Proton at C4 (H⁴):** Its neighbors are H³ (1H), the three H's at C5 (3H), and the two H's on the ethyl group's CH₂ (2H). The neighbor set is **{1H, 2H, 3H}**. This will produce a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This structure perfectly matches the ¹H NMR data.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(Me)-CH(2)(Me)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **Proton at C2:** Neighbors are H³ (1H) and the C2-methyl group (3H). Neighbor set is {1H, 3H} -> **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n    *   **Proton at C3:** Neighbors are H² (1H), C4-H's (2H), and the C3-methyl group (3H). Neighbor set is {1H, 2H, 3H} -> **dtq**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This structure has a `dtq` but not a `dtt`. It is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   `CH₃(5)-CH(4)(Me)-CH(3)(Me)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **Proton at C3:** Neighbors are H⁴ (1H), C2-H's (2H), and the C3-methyl group (3H). Neighbor set is {1H, 2H, 3H} -> **dtq**.\n    *   **Proton at C4:** Neighbors are H³ (1H), C5-H's (3H), and the C4-methyl group (3H). Neighbor set is {1H, 3H, 3H} -> **doublet of quartets of quartets (dqq)**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This structure has a `dtq` but not a `dtt`. It is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(2)(Et)-COOH(1)`\n    *   **Proton at C2:** Neighbors are H³ (1H) and the C2-ethyl group's CH₂ (2H). Neighbor set is {1H, 2H} -> **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n    *   **Proton at C3:** Neighbors are H² (1H), C4-H's (2H), and the C3-ethyl group's CH₂ (2H). Neighbor set is {1H, 2H, 2H} -> **dtt**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This structure has a `dtt` but not a `dtq`. It is incorrect.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nOnly structure A, **CH₃CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**, possesses the two required methine proton environments to produce both a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nTo identify the unknown compound, we must analyze the provided spectral data and compare it to the structures of the four possible options.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) bond in a carboxylic acid.\n    *   This information confirms the compound is a carboxylic acid.

The splitting of a signal can be predicted using the n+1 rule, where n is the number of equivalent adjacent protons. For complex cases, these effects are multiplicative.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C2 (doublet), the CH₂ group at C4 (triplet), and the CH₃ group on C3 (quartet). This would result in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   However, no other proton in this molecule would produce a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt). Therefore, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C2 (doublet), the CH₂ group of the ethyl substituent at C3 (triplet), and the CH₂ group at C4 (triplet). This would result in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   No proton in this molecule would produce a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq). Therefore, B is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C4 (doublet), the CH₂ group at C2 (triplet), and the CH₃ group at C3 (quartet). This would give a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   No proton in this molecule would produce a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt). Therefore, C is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid):**\n    Let's analyze the structure `CH₃-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`.\n    *   **Proton at C4:** This proton (H-C4) is coupled to the CH₃ group at C5 (quartet), the proton at C3 (doublet), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group attached to C4 (triplet). This matches the **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** signal.\n    *   **Proton at C3:** This proton (H-C3) is coupled to the proton at C4 (doublet), the CH₂ group at C2 (triplet), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group attached to C3 (triplet). This matches the **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** signal.\n\nSince molecule D is the only structure that contains protons corresponding to both of the observed complex splitting patterns, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nThe user wants me to identify an unknown compound from a list of four options based on its FTIR and 1H NMR spectral data.\n\n**1.

All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this data confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n**2. Analysis of 1H NMR Data:**\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated molecules, which is consistent with this information.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex splitting pattern arises from a single proton being coupled to three different, neighboring groups of protons.\n    *   The **doublet (d)** component means it is coupled to one adjacent proton (a -CH group).\n    *   The **triplet (t)** component means it is coupled to two adjacent, equivalent protons (a -CH₂- group).\n    *   The **quartet (q)** component means it is coupled to three adjacent, equivalent protons (a -CH₃ group).\n    *   Therefore, the proton responsible for this signal must be a methine (-CH) proton that is adjacent to another -CH group, a -CH₂- group, and a -CH₃ group.\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This splitting pattern arises from a proton being coupled to three different neighboring groups.\n    *   The **doublet (d)** component means it is coupled to one adjacent proton (a -CH group).\n    *   The first **triplet (t)** component means it is coupled to two adjacent, equivalent protons (a -CH₂- group).\n    *   The second **triplet (t)** component means it is coupled to another set of two adjacent, equivalent protons (a different -CH₂- group).\n    *   Therefore, the proton responsible for this signal must be a methine (-CH) proton that is adjacent to another -CH group and two non-equivalent -CH₂- groups.\n\n**3. Evaluation of the Candidate Structures:**\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH:**\n    *   Let's analyze the methine (C**H**) protons.\n    *   The CH next to the COOH is coupled to one CH and one CH₃.

This would be a doublet of triplets.\n    *   The other CH is coupled to one CH and two different CH₂ groups (one from the ethyl group on the same carbon, and one from the ethyl group on the adjacent carbon). This would produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   This molecule does not have a proton environment that would produce a `dtq` signal.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH:**\n    *   Let's analyze the two different methine (C**H**) protons in the main chain.\n    *   **Proton 1 (the CH attached to a CH₃ and an ethyl group):** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The neighboring CH proton (1H) -> **doublet**.\n        *   The adjacent CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H) -> **triplet**.\n        *   The adjacent CH₃ group (3H) -> **quartet**.\n        *   This proton's signal would be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal.\n    *   **Proton 2 (the CH attached to the CH₂COOH and an ethyl group):** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The neighboring CH proton (1H) -> **doublet**.\n        *   The adjacent CH₂ of the CH₂COOH group (2H) -> **triplet**.\n        *   The adjacent CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H) -> **triplet**.\n        *   This proton's signal would be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.

The broadening is a key characteristic.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. For a carboxylic acid, this peak typically appears between 1700 and 1725 cm⁻¹.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the class of compound but doesn't distinguish between the options.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates that there are no C=C double bonds in the molecule. All four options are saturated alkanoic acids, which is consistent with this observation.\n*   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex splitting pattern means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   **d** (doublet): one neighboring proton (1H).\n    *   **t** (triplet): two neighboring protons (2H).\n    *   **q** (quartet): three neighboring protons (3H).\n*   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   **d** (doublet): one neighboring proton (1H).\n    *   **t** (triplet): two neighboring protons (2H).\n    *   **t** (triplet): another set of two neighboring protons (2H).\n\nThe key to solving the problem is to find the structure that contains protons with these exact neighboring environments.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Proposed Structure\n\nLet's examine the protons on the main carbon chain for each option, as these are the most likely to exhibit such complex splitting.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n\n```\n      CH₃(g)  CH₃(h)\n      |       |\n(f)H₃(e)H₂C - C(Hb) - C(Ha) - COOH\n```\n*   **Ha (proton on C2):** It is coupled to Hb (1H) giving a doublet, and the methyl group (h) (3H) giving a quartet. **Signal: doublet of quartets (dq).**\n*   **Hb (proton on C3):** It is coupled to Ha (1H, doublet), its own methyl group (g) (3H, quartet), and the adjacent methylene group (e) (2H, triplet). **Signal: doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**, which is equivalent to a **dtq**.\n*   **Conclusion for D:** This structure has a **dtq** signal (from Hb), but it does not have any proton that would produce a **dtt** signal. Therefore, D is incorrect.\n\n**C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n\n```\n      (d)CH₃\n      |\n(e)H₃C - C(Hb) - C(Ha)(CH₃f) - CH₂(c) - COOH\n```\n*   **Ha (proton on C3):** It is coupled to Hb (1H, doublet), its methyl group (f) (3H, quartet), and the methylene group (c) (2H, triplet). **Signal: doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**, which is a **dtq**.\n*   **Hb (proton on C4):** It is coupled to Ha (1H, doublet) and the two methyl groups (d, e) on its carbon (a total of 6H). This gives a septet. **Signal: doublet of septets (d-sept).**\n*   **Conclusion for C:** This structure has a **dtq** signal, but the other complex signal is a d-sept, not a dtt. Therefore, C is incorrect.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid)**\n\n```\n      C₂H₅(g)  C₂H₅(h)\n      |        |\n(f)H₃(e)H₂C - C(Hb) - C(Ha) - COOH\n```\nLet's break down the ethyl groups (C₂H₅ = -CH₂CH₃).\n*   **Hb (proton on C4):** This proton is coupled to Ha (1H, doublet), the CH₂ of the terminal ethyl group (e) (2H, triplet), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group substituent (g) (2H, triplet). **Signal: doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** This matches one of the required signals.\n*   **Ha (proton on C3):** This proton is coupled to Hb (1H, doublet) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group substituent (h) (2H, triplet). This would normally give a doublet of triplets (dt). However, 4-bond (long-range) coupling can sometimes be observed. If Ha also couples to the terminal CH₃ of its ethyl group (h) (3H), the signal would become a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This is a plausible explanation for the second observed signal.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** This structure definitively contains a proton (Hb) that gives a **dtt** signal. It also contains a proton (Ha) that could plausibly give the **dtq** signal if a 4-bond coupling is observed. Compared to the other options which definitively lack one of the signals, this is the most viable candidate.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\nThis formula is ambiguous, but it corresponds to a C₉H₁₈O₂ isomer like structure A. While an isomer of C₉H₁₈O₂ exists that perfectly fits both NMR signals (3-methyl-4-ethylhexanoic acid), it does not match the written condensed formula of any of the options. Given the choices, we must evaluate the structures as presented.\n\n### Final Decision\n\n*   Structure A definitively exhibits a **dtt** signal from standard couplings and can plausibly exhibit a **dtq** signal through a common long-range coupling effect.\n*   Structures C and D exhibit a **dtq** signal but definitively cannot exhibit a **dtt** signal.\n*   Structure A is the only one that can account for both observed complex multiplets.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid, where the peak is significantly broadened due to hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\nThis information confirms that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible structures are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the candidates.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of hydrogen atoms attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H). All four candidate molecules are saturated, consistent with this information.\n*   **Key Splitting Patterns:** The identification relies on matching the complex splitting patterns to one of the structures.\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This means a single proton is magnetically coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: one single proton (giving a doublet, n=1), a group of two equivalent protons (giving a triplet, n=2), and a group of three equivalent protons (giving a quartet, n=3).\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This means a different single proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: one single proton (giving a doublet, n=1), a group of two equivalent protons (giving a triplet, n=2), and another different group of two equivalent protons (giving another triplet, n=2).\n\n### 3. Structural Analysis of the Candidates\n\nLet's analyze the structure of each candidate to see if its protons could produce the observed splitting patterns. We will assume the condensed formulas represent a continuous chain unless brackets indicate a branch.\n\n*   **A) `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH` -> 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH3CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH`\n    The proton at C2 is coupled to one proton at C3 (doublet) and the two `CH₂` protons of the ethyl group at C2 (triplet). This would result in a doublet of triplets (`dt`), which is not what is observed.\n\n*   **B) `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH` -> 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\n    The proton at C2 is coupled to one proton at C3 (doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group at C2 (quartet). This results in a doublet of quartets (`dq`). This does not match the observed patterns.\n\n*   **C) `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH` -> 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH`\n    The protons in the `CH₂` group at C2 are adjacent to the chiral center at C3, making them diastereotopic. Each would be split by the other (a doublet) and by the proton at C3 (a doublet), resulting in a doublet of doublets (`dd`). This does not match.\n\n*   **D) `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH` -> 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    `CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH`\n    Let's draw this structure and number the main carbon chain:\n    <pre>\n          Et(A)     Et(B)\n          |         |\n    HOOC¹-CH₂²-CH³-CH⁴-CH₃⁵\n    </pre>\n    This molecule has two chiral centers (C3 and C4). Let's analyze the signals for the protons on the main chain:\n\n    *   **Proton at C3 (H3):** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The proton at C4 (H4) -> gives a **doublet**.\n        *   The two protons of the `CH₂` group at C2 -> gives a **triplet**.\n        *   The two protons of the `CH₂` group of the ethyl substituent at C3 (Et_A) -> gives a **triplet**.\n        Therefore, the signal for H3 is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n\n    *   **Proton at C4 (H4):** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The proton at C3 (H3) -> gives a **doublet**.\n        *   The two protons of the `CH₂` group of the ethyl substituent at C4 (Et_B) -> gives a **triplet**.\n        *   The three protons of the methyl group at C5 -> gives a **quartet**.\n        Therefore, the signal for H4 is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the second observed signal.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe proton NMR splitting patterns described in the problem, a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) and a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq), are perfectly explained by the structure of 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid. This corresponds to the formula given in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a thinking process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The goal is to identify a specific chemical compound from four choices using given spectroscopic data (FTIR and 1H NMR).\n\n2.  **Analyze the FTIR Data:**\n    *   **\"very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers (cm⁻¹)\"**: This is a classic signature for an O-H stretch in a hydrogen-bonded environment, specifically a carboxylic acid (R-COOH). The O-H stretch of an alcohol is also in this region but the O-H of a carboxylic acid is typically much broader.\n    *   **\"strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers (cm⁻¹)\"**: This is the characteristic region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. For a carboxylic acid, this peak typically appears around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR**: The presence of both a very broad O-H and a strong C=O peak strongly indicates the compound is a carboxylic acid. I'll check the options: A, B, C, and D all contain a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). So, the FTIR data confirms the class of compound but doesn't distinguish between the choices. The deciding factor must be the 1H NMR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **\"none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens\"**: This tells us there are no hydrogens attached to C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated alkanoic acids, so this information is consistent with all choices and doesn't help differentiate.\n    *   **The Key Information: Splitting Patterns**. The problem states there are two specific, complex signals:\n        1.  **A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n        2.  **A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   **Understand Splitting (n+1 rule)**: A signal for a proton (or a group of equivalent protons) is split into (n+1) lines by 'n' equivalent neighboring protons.\n        *   Doublet (d): 1 neighbor (n=1)\n        *   Triplet (t): 2 neighbors (n=2)\n        *   Quartet (q): 3 neighbors (n=3)\n    *   **Deconstruct the Complex Patterns**: For a signal to be a \"multiplet of multiplets,\" the proton must be coupled to multiple *non-equivalent* groups of protons.\n        *   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**: A proton must have three sets of non-equivalent neighbors: one single proton (gives doublet), one group of 2 protons (gives triplet), and one group of 3 protons (gives quartet).\n        *   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**: A proton must have three sets of non-equivalent neighbors: one single proton (gives doublet), one group of 2 protons (gives triplet), and *another, different* group of 2 protons (gives the second triplet).\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Candidate Molecule:** I will now systematically examine the structure of each option to see if any of its protons would produce these specific splitting patterns. I will focus on the methine (C-H) protons, as they are bonded to the most other carbons and are most likely to have complex splitting.\n\n    *   **A) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH**\n        *   Let's label the key protons: `CH3CH2-CH(c)(CH3)-CH(f)(CH3)-COOH`\n        *   Look at proton `H(c)`: It's bonded to `CH2` (2 neighbors -> t), `CH(f)` (1 neighbor -> d), and `CH3` (3 neighbors -> q). This gives a **dtq**. This matches one of the signals!\n        *   Look at proton `H(f)`: It's bonded to `CH(c)` (1 neighbor -> d) and `CH3` (3 neighbors -> q). This gives a doublet of quartets (dq). This is not a dtt.\n        *   *Conclusion for A*: Has a `dtq`, but not a `dtt`. So, it's incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH**\n        *   Let's label the key protons: `CH3-CH(c)(CH3)-CH(e)(CH3)-CH2-COOH`\n        *   Look at proton `H(e)`: It's bonded to `CH(c)` (1 neighbor -> d), `CH2` (2 neighbors -> t), and `CH3` (3 neighbors -> q). This gives a **dtq**. This also matches one of the signals.\n        *   Look at proton `H(c)`: It's bonded to `CH(e)` (1 neighbor -> d) and two different `CH3` groups (each 3 neighbors -> q). This gives a doublet of quartets of quartets (dqq). Not a dtt.\n        *   *Conclusion for B*: Has a `dtq`, but not a `dtt`. So, it's incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH** (Note: C2H5 is -CH2CH3)\n        *   Structure: `CH3CH2-CH(c)(CH2CH3)-CH(d)(CH2CH3)-COOH`\n        *   Look at proton `H(c)`: It's bonded to `CH(d)` (1 neighbor -> d), the `CH2` of the attached ethyl group (2 neighbors -> t), and the `CH2` of the main chain (2 neighbors -> t). This gives a **dtt**. This matches the other signal!\n        *   Look at proton `H(d)`: It's bonded to `CH(c)` (1 neighbor -> d) and the `CH2` of its attached ethyl group (2 neighbors -> t). This gives a doublet of triplets (dt). This is not a dtq.\n        *   *Conclusion for C*: Has a `dtt`, but not a `dtq`. So, it's incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH**\n        *   Structure: `CH3-CH(b)(CH2CH3)-CH(d)(CH2CH3)-CH2-COOH`\n        *   Look at proton `H(b)`: It's bonded to `CH(d)` (1 neighbor -> d), the attached `CH3` group (3 neighbors -> q), and the `CH2` of the attached ethyl group (2 neighbors -> t). This gives a **dtq**. This matches the first signal!\n        *   Look at proton `H(d)`: It's bonded to `CH(b)` (1 neighbor -> d), the `CH2` of the attached ethyl group (2 neighbors -> t), and the `CH2` of the main chain next to the COOH (2 neighbors -> t). This gives a **dtt**. This matches the second signal!\n        *   *Conclusion for D*: This molecule has a proton that produces a `dtq` signal AND a different proton that produces a `dtt` signal. This perfectly matches all the 1H NMR data.\n\n5.  **Final Synthesis and Code Generation:**\n    *   The FTIR data identified a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The 1H NMR data provided two unique splitting patterns (`dtq` and `dtt`).\n    *   By analyzing each structure, only structure D contains protons that would result in both of these specific splitting patterns.\n    *   The Python code will present this logic clearly and print the final choice.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef identify_compound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies a compound based on FTIR and 1H NMR data by analyzing splitting patterns.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Options provided to the user\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH\",\n        \"B\": \"CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH\",\n        \"C\": \"CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH\",\n        \"D\": \"CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH\"\n    }\n\n    # Explanation of the reasoning process\n    analysis_steps = [\n        \"1.

The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) bond stretch. The position (~1700-1725 cm⁻¹) is typical for a carbonyl in a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the candidates.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates that there are no protons attached to C=C double bonds in the molecule. All four options are saturated alkanoic acids, so this is consistent with all candidates.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This is a very specific and complex splitting pattern. It means a single proton is being split by three different groups of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a **doublet** (1+1=2).\n    *   Two neighboring protons (n=2), causing a **triplet** (2+1=3).\n    *   Three neighboring protons (n=3), causing a **quartet** (3+1=4).\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a methine (CH) proton that is adjacent to another methine (CH), a methylene (CH₂), and a methyl (CH₃) group.\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This is another highly specific pattern.

This matches the first required signal.\n*   **Analysis of Proton (b):** This is a methine proton on carbon 3. Its neighbors are:\n    *   Proton (a) on C4 (1H) → doublet\n    *   Protons (c) on C2 (2H) → triplet\n    *   Protons (i) on the ethyl group's CH₂ (2H) → triplet\n    *   This proton's signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.

This gives a **dtt**.\n    *   Proton at C2: Neighbors are 1H (at C3) and 2H (on its ethyl group). This gives a **dt**.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule does not have a `dtq` signal.

All four options are carboxylic acids, so this data confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the choices.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds, which is consistent with all four saturated structures.\n    *   **\"doublet of triplets of quartets\" (dtq):** This complex splitting pattern tells us about the neighbors of a specific proton. According to the n+1 rule, a proton showing a `dtq` signal must be coupled to:\n        *   One adjacent proton (for the **d**oublet).\n        *   A group of two equivalent adjacent protons (for the **t**riplet).\n        *   A group of three equivalent adjacent protons (for the **q**uartet).\n        Therefore, we are searching for a methine proton (`CH`) that is adjacent to a `CH` group, a `CH₂` group, and a `CH₃` group.\n    *   **\"doublet of triplets of triplets\" (dtt):** Similarly, a proton showing a `dtt` signal must be coupled to:\n        *   One adjacent proton (for the **d**oublet).\n        *   A group of two equivalent adjacent protons (for the first **t**riplet).\n        *   A second, non-equivalent group of two equivalent adjacent protons (for the second **t**riplet).\n        Therefore, we are searching for a methine proton (`CH`) that is adjacent to a `CH` group and two non-equivalent `CH₂` groups.\n    *   **Key Requirement:** The correct structure must contain *both* a proton that produces a `dtq` signal and a different proton that produces a `dtt` signal.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Candidate Molecules:**\n\n    *   **A) `CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH` (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):** This molecule has a proton that would give a `dtq` signal, but it lacks a proton environment that would produce a `dtt` signal.\n    *   **B) `CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH` (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid):** This molecule has a proton that would give a `dtt` signal, but it lacks a proton environment that would produce a `dtq` signal.\n    *   **C) `CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH` (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):** This molecule has a proton that would give a `dtq` signal, but it lacks a proton environment that would produce a `dtt` signal.\n    *   **D) `CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH`:** Let's determine the structure and analyze its protons.

This matches one of the required signals.\n        *   **Proton at C4:** This `CH` is adjacent to the `CH` group at C3 (1 neighbor), the `CH₃` group at C5 (3 neighbors), and the `CH₂` group of its own ethyl substituent (2 neighbors). The signal would be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the second required signal.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nStructure D is the only option that contains both a proton that would exhibit `dtt` splitting and another proton that would exhibit `dtq` splitting. It is therefore the only structure that is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n\nThe provided code output correctly identifies that a molecule with the name `3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid` would also fit the NMR criteria. While this is true, that molecule's structure is different from the one described by the condensed formula in option D (`3,4-diethylpentanoic acid`). Since my task is to choose the correct option from the list, and the formula in option D corresponds to a molecule (`3,4-diethylpentanoic acid`) that perfectly matches the spectral data, D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nBased on the provided spectroscopic data, the unknown compound is identified by analyzing the information from both FTIR and ¹H NMR.\n\n### **Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\nThe FTIR spectrum provides information about the functional groups present in the molecule.\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness of the peak is a result of hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also a key feature of a carboxylic acid.\n\nBoth of these signals strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). All four possible compounds (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid group, so the FTIR data confirms this class of compound but does not differentiate between the specific structures.\n\n### **Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe ¹H NMR data, particularly the complex splitting patterns, is crucial for determining the exact structure of the carbon skeleton. The simple \"n+1 rule\" is used for protons with equivalent neighbors, but when a proton is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of protons, more complex patterns like \"doublet of triplets\" emerge.\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting patterns for the most complex signals in each proposed structure:\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH:** The proton at C3 would be a doublet of triplets, and the proton at C2 would be a doublet of quartets. This does not match the observed doublet of triplets of triplets and doublet of triplets of quartets.\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH:** The proton at C3 would be a doublet of quartets of triplets. This does not match the described signals.\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH:** The protons in this structure would lead to very complex multiplets, but it is unlikely to produce the specific combination of a doublet of triplets of triplets and a doublet of triplets of quartets. The proton at C3 could be a doublet of triplet of triplets, but there is no proton that would result in a doublet of triplets of quartets.\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH:** Let's examine the structure `CH₃(a)-CH(b)(CH₂(c)CH₃(d))-CH(e)(CH₂(f)CH₃(g))-CH₂(h)-COOH`.\n    *   **Proton H(b):** This proton is coupled to three distinct groups of neighboring protons:\n        *   The single proton H(e), which splits the signal into a **doublet**.\n        *   The two protons of the CH₂(c) group, which split each line of the doublet into a **triplet**.\n        *   The three protons of the CH₃(a) group, which split each line of the doublet of triplets into a **quartet**.\n        *   This results in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**, which perfectly matches one of the described signals.\n    *   **Proton H(e):** This proton is also coupled to three distinct groups of neighboring protons:\n        *   The single proton H(b), which splits the signal into a **doublet**.\n        *   The two protons of the CH₂(f) group, which split each line of the doublet into a **triplet**.\n        *   The two protons of the CH₂(h) group, which split each line of the doublet of triplets into another **triplet**.\n        *   This results in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**, matching the other complex signal described.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe FTIR data confirms the compound is a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR splitting patterns are unique to the arrangement of protons in the molecule. Only structure **D** can account for both the observed **doublet of triplets of quartets** and the **doublet of triplets of triplets**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nTo identify the unknown compound, a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data is necessary.\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad Absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The broadness is due to the formation of dimers.\n*   **Strong Absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also characteristic of a carboxylic acid. The position around 1700 cm⁻¹ is typical for a saturated, dimeric carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The data strongly indicate that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group present but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe ¹H NMR spectrum provides detailed information about the carbon-hydrogen framework of the molecule. The key to solving this problem lies in deciphering the complex splitting patterns reported.\n\n*   **No Vinyl-Hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H), which is consistent with all four structures being saturated alkanoic acids.\n*   **Complex Splitting:** When a proton is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons, its signal is split sequentially by each set. The resulting pattern is named based on these successive splittings (e.g., doublet of triplets).\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This pattern arises when a single proton has three sets of non-equivalent neighbors on adjacent carbons: one neighboring proton (giving the doublet), a group of two equivalent protons (giving the triplet), and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet).\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern arises when a single proton has three sets of non-equivalent neighbors on adjacent carbons: one neighboring proton (giving the doublet), a group of two equivalent protons (giving the first triplet), and another distinct group of two equivalent protons (giving the second triplet).\n\n### 3. Structural Evaluation\n\nLet's analyze the structure that would produce both of the described splitting patterns.\n\n*   **Structure C: `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`**\n\n    Let's first interpret this condensed formula. Assuming the atoms are listed sequentially, the structure is `CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH`. The longest carbon chain containing the `COOH` group determines the parent name. This results in the IUPAC name **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n\n    Let's number the carbon chain starting from the carboxyl carbon as C1:\n    `CH3(5)-CH(4)(CH2CH3)-CH(3)(CH2CH3)-CH2(2)-COOH(1)`\n\n    Now, let's analyze the splitting for the key protons on the chiral centers (C3 and C4):\n\n    1.  **Proton on C4 (H4):** This proton is on a carbon adjacent to C3, C5, and the CH₂ of its ethyl group.\n        *   It is coupled to **H3** (1 proton), which splits its signal into a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   It is coupled to the **CH₃ group at C5** (3 protons), which splits its signal into a **quartet (q)**.\n        *   It is coupled to the **CH₂ of the ethyl group on C4** (2 protons), which splits its signal into a **triplet (t)**.\n        *   The resulting pattern for H4 is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This perfectly matches the first signal described.\n\n    2.  **Proton on C3 (H3):** This proton is on a carbon adjacent to C2, C4, and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group.\n        *   It is coupled to **H4** (1 proton), which splits its signal into a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   It is coupled to the **CH₂ group at C2** (2 protons), which splits its signal into a **triplet (t)**.\n        *   It is coupled to the **CH₂ of the ethyl group on C3** (2 protons), which splits its signal into another **triplet (t)**.\n        *   The resulting pattern for H3 is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This perfectly matches the second signal described.\n\nSince the structure corresponding to 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid exhibits both of the complex splitting patterns observed in the ¹H NMR spectrum, it is the correct compound. The formula provided in option C, interpreted as `CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH`, correctly represents this molecule. A similar analysis of options A, B, and D does not yield both of these specific complex splitting patterns.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 38:\nBased on the detailed analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the unknown compound is identified by interpreting its key features in the FTIR and ¹H NMR spectra.\n\n### Spectroscopic Analysis\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** The presence of a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic indicator of the O-H bond stretching in a carboxylic acid, with the broadness resulting from hydrogen bonding. The strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) bond stretching, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid. This confirms the functional group present in the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid, which is consistent with all four possible structures.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The ¹H NMR data provides the specific details needed to distinguish between the isomers. The absence of vinyl-protons indicates that there are no carbon-carbon double bonds in the molecule, which is true for all options. The crucial information lies in two complex splitting patterns observed for two different signals:\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This splitting pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: a single proton (causing the doublet), a set of two equivalent protons (causing the triplet), and a set of three equivalent protons (causing the quartet).\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern occurs when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: a single proton (causing the doublet), a set of two equivalent protons (causing the first triplet), and another, different set of two equivalent protons (causing the second triplet).\n\n### Structural Elucidation\n\nBy examining the four possible structures, we can predict the expected splitting patterns for their protons:\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid):** This molecule has a proton that would exhibit a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) signal. However, it lacks a proton environment that would produce a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid):** This structure has a proton that would result in a dtq signal but does not have one that would produce a dtt signal.\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):** Similar to option B, a proton in this molecule would show a dtq signal, but none would produce a dtt signal.\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (interpreted as 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid):** Although the condensed structural formula is written in a non-standard way, it corresponds to the molecular formula C₉H₁₈O₂. The isomer that fits this formula and the NMR data is 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid:\n    ```\n       CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-COOH\n    ```\n    In this structure:\n    *   The proton on carbon-3, `–CH(CH₂CH₃)–`, is coupled to the proton on carbon-4 (1H, doublet), the adjacent methylene group in the ethyl substituent (2H, triplet), and the methylene group at carbon-2 (2H, triplet). This creates a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   The proton on carbon-4, `–CH(CH₃)–`, is coupled to the proton on carbon-3 (1H, doublet), the adjacent methylene group on the main chain (2H, triplet), and the adjacent methyl group (3H, quartet). This creates a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n\nSince the structure corresponding to option D is the only one that can produce both of the described complex ¹H NMR signals, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n*   **FTIR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group present but does not differentiate between the options.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   \"None of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens\" indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four structures are saturated alkanoic acids, which is consistent with this information.\n    *   The crucial pieces of information are the complex splitting patterns (multiplicities):\n        1.  One signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n        2.  A different signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\n### **2. Understand the Splitting Patterns**\n\nTo predict these complex patterns, we use the (n+1) rule for each group of non-equivalent neighboring protons.\n*   **dtq (doublet of triplets of quartets):** This pattern arises when a proton (or a group of equivalent protons) is coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons:\n    *   A group of **one** proton (n=1, split into a doublet).\n    *   A group of **two** equivalent protons (n=2, split into a triplet).\n    *   A group of **three** equivalent protons (n=3, split into a quartet).\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a `CH` proton that is adjacent to another `CH`, a `CH₂` group, and a `CH₃` group.\n\n*   **dtt (doublet of triplets of triplets):** This pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons:\n    *   A group of **one** proton (n=1, split into a doublet).\n    *   A group of **two** equivalent protons (n=2, split into a triplet).\n    *   Another, different group of **two** equivalent protons (n=2, split into another triplet).\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a `CH` proton that is adjacent to another `CH` group and two different `CH₂` groups.\n\n### **3. Analyze the Structure of Each Option**\n\nLet's analyze each candidate molecule to see if its structure can produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal. The condensed formulas can be ambiguous, so we must carefully deduce the structure.\n\n**A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n```\n          CH₃\n          |\n(CH₃)₂CH(4)-CH(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)\n```\n*   **H at C3:** Neighbors are H at C4 (1H), the C3-methyl (3H), and the CH₂ at C2 (2H). This proton would indeed be a **dtq**.\n*   **H at C4:** Neighbors are H at C3 (1H) and the two C4-methyl groups (6H). This proton would be a doublet of septets (ds).\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule has a `dtq` but no `dtt`. So, A is incorrect.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n```\n           CH₃     CH₃\n           |       |\nCH₃CH₂(4)-CH(3)-CH(2)-COOH(1)\n```\n*   **H at C3:** Neighbors are H at C2 (1H), the C3-methyl (3H), and the CH₂ at C4 (2H). This proton is a **dtq**.\n*   **H at C2:** Neighbors are H at C3 (1H) and the C2-methyl (3H). This is a doublet of quartets (dq).\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule has a `dtq` but no `dtt`. So, C is incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n```\n           CH₂CH₃     CH₂CH₃\n           |           |\nCH₃CH₂(4)-CH(3)----CH(2)----COOH(1)\n```\n*   **H at C3:** Neighbors are H at C2 (1H), the CH₂ at C4 (2H), and the CH₂ of the C3-ethyl group (2H). This proton is a **dtt**.\n*   **H at C2:** Neighbors are H at C3 (1H) and the CH₂ of the C2-ethyl group (2H). This is a doublet of triplets (dt).\n*   **Methylene protons:** The protons on the various CH₂ groups are diastereotopic and would give complex `ddq` signals, not a `dtq`.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule has a `dtt` but no `dtq`. So, D is incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\nThis is the most plausible structure from the formula. The backbone is a pentanoic acid chain starting from the terminal CH₃.\n```\n           CH₂(e)CH₃(f)   <-- C4-ethyl\n           |\nCH₃(h)-CH(g)----CH(b)----CH₂(a)----COOH(1)\n           |\n           CH₂(c)CH₃(d)   <-- C3-ethyl\n```\nLet's analyze the key methine (`CH`) protons:\n*   **Proton H(b) at C3:**\n    *   Neighbors: The CH₂ group at C2 (2H, `triplet`), the CH group at C4 (1H, `doublet`), and the CH₂ group of the C3-ethyl sidechain (2H, `triplet`).\n    *   Predicted splitting: **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n*   **Proton H(g) at C4:**\n    *   Neighbors: The CH group at C3 (1H, `doublet`), the CH₂ group of the C4-ethyl sidechain (2H, `triplet`), and the terminal CH₃ group at C5 (3H, `quartet`).\n    *   Predicted splitting: **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the second required signal.\n\n### **4. Final Conclusion**\n\nStructure B, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, is the only compound among the choices that has a proton environment that would produce a `dtt` signal (the proton at C3) and another distinct proton environment that would produce a `dtq` signal (the proton at C4). Therefore, this is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\n**1.

All four options are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group present but does not distinguish between the choices.\n\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated molecules, consistent with this data.\n    *   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** This means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons:\n        *   A set of 1 proton (n=1, gives n+1 = 2 lines, a doublet)\n        *   A set of 2 protons (n=2, gives n+1 = 3 lines, a triplet)\n        *   A set of 3 protons (n=3, gives n+1 = 4 lines, a quartet)\n    *   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** This means a different proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons:\n        *   A set of 1 proton (n=1, gives n+1 = 2 lines, a doublet)\n        *   A set of 2 protons (n=2, gives n+1 = 3 lines, a triplet)\n        *   Another set of 2 protons (n=2, gives n+1 = 3 lines, a triplet)\n\n**2. Analyze the Candidate Structures**\n\nWe need to find the structure that would produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal in its 1H NMR spectrum. Let's analyze each option.\n\n*   **Option D: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    ```\n          CH3   CH3\n          |     |\n    CH3 - CH(e)- CH(d)- CH2 - COOH\n    ```\n    *   **H(d):** Coupled to H(e) (1H) and the CH2 group (2H). This would be a doublet of triplets (`dt`).\n    *   **H(e):** Coupled to H(d) (1H), the terminal CH3 group (3H), and its own attached CH3 group (3H). This would be a complex multiplet, likely a doublet of quartets of quartets (`dqq`).\n    *   This structure does not have both a `dtt` and `dtq`.\n\n*   **Option C: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    ```\n          CH3   CH3\n          |     |\n    CH3CH2 - CH(d)- CH(c)- COOH\n    ```\n    *   **H(c):** Coupled to H(d) (1H). It would be a doublet (ignoring coupling to COOH).\n    *   **H(d):** Coupled to H(c) (1H) and the CH2 of the ethyl group (2H). This would be a doublet of triplets (`dt`).\n    *   This structure does not have both a `dtt` and `dtq`.\n\n*   **Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    ```\n             Et    Et\n             |     |\n    CH3CH2 - CH(e)- CH(d)- COOH\n    ```\n    *   **H(e):** Coupled to H(d) (1H), the CH2 of its own ethyl group (2H), and the CH2 of the terminal ethyl group (2H). This signal would be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n    *   Let's check for a `dtq`. A `dtq` requires coupling to sets of 1, 2, and 3 protons. There is no proton in this molecule that fits this description. For example, the methylene (`CH2`) protons of the ethyl groups are coupled to a methine (`CH`, 1H) and a methyl (`CH3`, 3H). This would result in a doublet of quartets (`dq`), complicated by diastereotopicity (which would add another doublet coupling, making it a `ddq`).\n    *   This structure has a `dtt` but lacks a `dtq`.\n\n*   **Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    ```\n          Et    Et\n          |     |\n    CH3 - CH(e)- CH(d)- CH2 - COOH\n    ```\n    Let's analyze the key methine protons, H(d) and H(e).\n    *   **Proton H(d):** This proton is on carbon-3.\n        *   It is adjacent to H(e) on carbon-4 (1 proton) -> gives a **doublet**.\n        *   It is adjacent to the CH2 group on carbon-2 (2 protons) -> gives a **triplet**.\n        *   It is adjacent to the CH2 of its attached ethyl group (2 protons) -> gives a **triplet**.\n        *   The combined signal for H(d) is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.

This matches the other required signal.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly structure A, 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, has a proton environment that would produce a doublet of triplets of triplets (`dtt`) and another proton environment that would produce a doublet of triplets of quartets (`dtq`). Therefore, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze FTIR Data**\n    *   A \"very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers (cm⁻¹)\" is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is forming hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen bonding causes the peak to become very broad.\n    *   A \"strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹\" is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for a carboxylic acid carbonyl.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group.

Splitting (multiplicity) in ¹H NMR is described by the \"n+1\" rule, where 'n' is the number of equivalent vicinal protons (protons on adjacent carbons, separated by 3 bonds). When a proton is coupled to multiple *different* sets of vicinal neighbors, its signal is split sequentially by each set.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct the Splitting Patterns**\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This indicates a single proton is being coupled by three different sets of neighboring protons through 3-bond (vicinal) coupling.\n        *   **Doublet (d):** Coupling to **1** vicinal proton (`n=1`). This neighbor is likely another methine (`-CH-`) proton.\n        *   **Triplet (t):** Coupling to **2** vicinal protons (`n=2`). This neighbor is likely a methylene (`-CH₂-`) group.\n        *   **Quartet (q):** Coupling to **3** vicinal protons (`n=3`). This neighbor is likely a methyl (`-CH₃-`) group.\n        *   **Summary for `dtq`:** We are looking for a methine proton (`-CH-`) that has one `CH` group, one `CH₂` group, and one `CH₃` group on its adjacent carbons.\n\n    *   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This indicates a different, single proton is being coupled by three different sets of vicinal neighbors.\n        *   **Doublet (d):** Coupling to **1** vicinal proton (`n=1`). This neighbor is likely another methine (`-CH-`) proton.\n        *   **Triplet (t):** Coupling to **2** vicinal protons (`n=2`). This is likely a methylene (`-CH₂-`) group.\n        *   **Another Triplet (t):** Coupling to another, non-equivalent set of **2** vicinal protons (`n=2`). This is likely a second, distinct methylene (`-CH₂-`) group.\n        *   **Summary for `dtt`:** We are looking for a methine proton (`-CH-`) that has one `CH` group and two different `CH₂` groups on its adjacent carbons.\n\n4.  **Analyze Each Candidate Structure**\n\n    *   First, we must correctly interpret the condensed structural formulas. We will determine the IUPAC name for each to be unambiguous.\n\n    *   **A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid**\n        *   Structure: `CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH`.\n        *   Analysis: `H` at C3 has vicinal neighbors `H`@C4 and `CH₂`@C2. This gives a doublet of triplets (`dt`), not a `dtq`. Incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n        *   Structure: `CH₃CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`.\n        *   Analysis: `H` at C3 has vicinal neighbors `H`@C2 and `CH₂`@C4. This gives a `dt`, not a `dtq` or `dtt`. Incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n        *   Structure: `CH₃CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-COOH`.\n        *   **`dtt` check:** The proton at C3 (`H` on `-CH(Et)-`) is adjacent to C2 and C4. It is vicinally coupled to `H`@C2 (1H, gives doublet), `CH₂`@C4 (2H, gives triplet), and the `CH₂` of the ethyl substituent on C3 (2H, gives triplet). This perfectly explains the **dtt** signal.\n        *   **`dtq` check:** The proton at C2 is coupled to `H`@C3 and the `CH₂` of the ethyl substituent on C2. This gives a `dt`. The structure lacks the environment for a `dtq`. Incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**\n        *   Let's determine the structure from the formula. It describes a chain: `CH₃ - CH(C₂H₅) - CH(C₂H₅) - CH₂ - COOH`. Finding the longest chain containing the `COOH` group gives a 6-carbon backbone (hexanoic acid) with an ethyl group at C3 and a methyl group at C4.\n        *   Structure (3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid):\n            ```\n                       CH₃ @ C4\n                       |\n            CH₃-CH₂ - CH(b) - CH(c) - CH₂ - COOH\n                               |\n                               CH₂-CH₃ @ C3\n            ```\n        *   **`dtt` check:** Let's examine proton **H(c) at C3**. Its adjacent carbons are C2, C4, and the first carbon of the ethyl substituent. It is vicinally coupled to:\n            1.  `CH₂(d)` at C2 (2H) → **triplet**\n            2.  `H(b)` at C4 (1H) → **doublet**\n            3.  `CH₂(h)` of the ethyl group (2H) → **triplet**\n            Since the two `CH₂` groups are chemically non-equivalent (diastereotopic), they split the signal separately. This environment perfectly explains the **dtt** signal.\n        *   **`dtq` check:** Let's examine proton **H(b) at C4**. Its adjacent carbons are C3, C5, and the carbon of the methyl substituent. It is vicinally coupled to:\n            1.  `H(c)` at C3 (1H) → **doublet**\n            2.  `CH₂(f)` at C5 (2H) → **triplet**\n            3.  `CH₃(a)` of the methyl group substituent (3H) → **quartet**\n            This environment perfectly explains the **dtq** signal.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nStructure B is the only candidate whose structure provides a clear origin for both the \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" signal (from the proton at C3) and the \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" signal (from the proton at C4) based on standard vicinal coupling rules.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 42:\nThe FTIR and ¹H NMR spectral data are key to distinguishing between the four possible structures.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the FTIR Spectrum\n\n*   **Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded, as they typically form dimers.\n*   **Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the choices. We must use the ¹H NMR data.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Splitting Patterns\n\nThe problem states that two particularly complex signals are observed:\n1.  A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n2.  A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\nThe splitting of a proton's signal is described by the **n+1 rule**, where 'n' is the number of equivalent neighboring protons. A complex splitting pattern like a `dtq` means the proton is coupled to three *different* sets of neighboring protons.\n*   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** The proton must be adjacent to:\n    *   A group with 1 proton (n=1, gives a doublet).\n    *   A group with 2 protons (n=2, gives a triplet).\n    *   A group with 3 protons (n=3, gives a quartet).\n*   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** The proton must be adjacent to:\n    *   A group with 1 proton (n=1, gives a doublet).\n    *   A group with 2 protons (n=2, gives a triplet).\n    *   *Another, chemically non-equivalent* group with 2 protons (n=2, gives another triplet).\n\n### Step 3: Examine Each Candidate Structure\n\nLet's analyze the protons in each molecule to see which one would produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal. The formulas given are condensed. Let's expand them for clarity.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    `¹COOH - ²CH(CH₃) - ³CH(CH₃) - ⁴CH₂ - ⁵CH₃`\n    Let's check the methine (CH) proton at position 3 (H₃):\n    *   It is coupled to the H at C2 (1 proton, doublet).\n    *   It is coupled to the CH₂ at C4 (2 protons, triplet).\n    *   It is coupled to the methyl group at C3 (3 protons, quartet).\n    *   This H₃ proton would indeed give a **dtq** signal. However, no other proton in this molecule gives a `dtt` signal. For example, H₂ is a `dq`. So, this molecule is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid)**\n    The formula is best interpreted as `¹COOH - ²CH₂ - ³CH(C₂H₅) - ⁴CH(C₂H₅) - ⁵CH₃`.\n    Let's analyze the two key methine (CH) protons:\n    *   **Proton at C4 (H₄):**\n        *   It is coupled to the H at C3 (1 proton, doublet).\n        *   It is coupled to the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2 protons, triplet).\n        *   It is coupled to the CH₃ at C5 (3 protons, quartet).\n        *   This H₄ proton gives a **dtq** signal.\n    *   **Proton at C3 (H₃):**\n        *   It is coupled to the H at C4 (1 proton, doublet).\n        *   It is coupled to the CH₂ at C2 (2 protons, triplet).\n        *   It is coupled to the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2 protons, triplet).\n        *   This H₃ proton gives a **dtt** signal.\n    *   This molecule contains protons that would produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal. This is our correct candidate.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    `¹COOH - ²CH₂ - ³CH(CH₃) - ⁴CH(CH₃) - ⁵CH₃`\n    Let's check the methine proton at position 3 (H₃):\n    *   It is coupled to H at C4 (1 proton, doublet).\n    *   It is coupled to the CH₂ at C2 (2 protons, triplet).\n    *   It is coupled to the methyl group at C3 (3 protons, quartet).\n    *   This H₃ proton gives a **dtq** signal. However, there is no proton that gives a `dtt` signal. So, this molecule is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    `¹COOH - ²CH(C₂H₅) - ³CH(C₂H₅) - ⁴CH₂ - ⁵CH₃`\n    Let's check the methine proton at position 3 (H₃):\n    *   It is coupled to H at C2 (1 proton, doublet).\n    *   It is coupled to the CH₂ at C4 (2 protons, triplet).\n    *   It is coupled to the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2 protons, triplet).\n    *   This H₃ proton gives a **dtt** signal. However, there is no proton that gives a `dtq` signal in this molecule. H₂ is a `dt`. So, this molecule is incorrect.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nOnly the structure corresponding to option B, `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`, has protons that would exhibit both a doublet of triplets of quartets (`dtq`) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (`dtt`) in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 43:\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR (Fourier-Transform Infrared) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid. The broadening is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) double bond in a carboxylic acid.\n    *   This information confirms that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data is consistent with all of them but does not distinguish between them.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR (Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **No vinyl hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H). All four structures are saturated alkanoic acids, so this information is consistent with all options.\n    *   **Complex Splitting Patterns:** The key to identifying the correct structure lies in the detailed splitting patterns, which are determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons (`n+1` rule).\n        *   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This means a single proton is being split by three different sets of neighboring protons: one neighboring proton (n=1, causing a doublet), a set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, causing a triplet), and a set of three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3, causing a quartet). The order (dtq) depends on the magnitude of the coupling constants (J-values), but the essential information is the neighbor count: 1, 2, and 3.\n        *   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This means a single proton is being split by three different sets of neighboring protons: one neighboring proton (n=1, causing a doublet), a set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, causing a triplet), and another distinct set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, causing another triplet). The neighbor count is 1, 2, and 2.\n\n### Evaluation of Possible Structures\n\nLet's analyze the proton environments in each molecule, focusing on the protons on chiral centers (the `C(H)` parts of the chain), as they have the most complex environments.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C4 is coupled to the proton at C3 (1H), and the protons of the adjacent methyl group (3H). This would give a doublet of quartets (dq).\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C4 (1H) and the protons of the adjacent CH₂ group (2H). This would give a doublet of triplets (dt).\n    *   This structure does not produce a `dtq` or a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C4 is coupled to the proton at C3 (1H) and the protons of two adjacent methyl groups (6H). This would result in a doublet of septets.\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C4 (1H), the protons of its adjacent methyl group (3H), and the protons of the adjacent CH₂ group (2H). This would be a very complex signal (dqt - doublet of quartets of triplets).\n    *   This structure does not match the observed `dtq` and `dtt` signals.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 (`-CH(Et)COOH`) is coupled to the proton at C2 (1H, from the ethyl group attached to it), and the proton at C4 (1H). Wait, the proton at C2 is on the same carbon as the COOH. Let's re-examine the structure based on the name: `CH₃CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-COOH`.\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C2 (1H), the proton at C4 (1H) and the protons of the CH₂ group of its ethyl substituent (2H). This would be a ddt (doublet of doublets of triplets).\n    *   The proton at C2 is coupled to the proton at C3 (1H) and the protons of the CH₂ group of its ethyl substituent (2H). This gives a doublet of triplets (dt).\n    *   While this structure has a complex signal, it does not have the required combination of a `dtq` and a `dtt`.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n    Let's analyze the structure implied by this formula: `CH₃(5)-CH(Hₐ)(4)(C₂H₅)-CH(H♭)(3)(C₂H₅)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`.\n    *   **Proton H♭ (at position 3):**\n        *   It is adjacent to the two protons on C2 (n=2), which will split it into a **triplet**.\n        *   It is adjacent to the single proton Hₐ on C4 (n=1), which will split the signal further into a **doublet**.\n        *   It is also adjacent to the two protons of the CH₂ group on its own ethyl substituent (n=2), causing a further split into a **triplet**.\n        *   Therefore, the signal for H♭ is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n    *   **Proton Hₐ (at position 4):**\n        *   It is adjacent to the three protons on the terminal methyl group at C5 (n=3), which will split it into a **quartet**.\n        *   It is adjacent to the single proton H♭ on C3 (n=1), which will split the signal further into a **doublet**.\n        *   It is also adjacent to the two protons of the CH₂ group on its own ethyl substituent (n=2), causing a further split into a **triplet**.\n        *   Therefore, the signal for Hₐ is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the second observed signal.\n\nThis molecule is the only one that contains protons matching both of the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR data.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in this region (specifically 2500-3300 cm⁻¹) is highly characteristic of the O-H bond stretching in a carboxylic acid that has formed a hydrogen-bonded dimer.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** A strong absorption peak between 1690-1760 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a C=O (carbonyl) group. When seen with a broad O-H peak, it confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this data confirms the functional group but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe key to distinguishing between the four isomers lies in the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR spectrum. The \"n+1 rule\" states that a proton signal is split into n+1 peaks by n adjacent, equivalent protons. When a proton is adjacent to multiple, *non-equivalent* sets of protons, it results in more complex patterns like doublets of triplets.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds, which is consistent with all four proposed structures.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This indicates a proton is coupled to three different, non-equivalent neighboring groups:\n    *   A single proton (causes the **doublet**)\n    *   A -CH₂- group (causes the **triplet**)\n    *   A -CH₃ group (causes the **quartet**)\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This indicates a different proton is coupled to three different, non-equivalent neighboring groups:\n    *   A single proton (causes the **doublet**)\n    *   A -CH₂- group (causes the first **triplet**)\n    *   Another, different -CH₂- group (causes the second **triplet**)\n\n### 3. Evaluating Each Structure\n\nLet's analyze the proton environments for each option to see which one matches *both* described splitting patterns. The protons on the main carbon chain (methine protons, -CH-) will show the most complex splitting.\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   This structure has a proton that would be split by another single proton and two different -CH₂- groups, producing a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n*   However, it lacks a proton that is adjacent to a single proton, a -CH₂- group, AND a -CH₃ group. Therefore, it cannot produce the required `dtq` signal.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\nLet's number the main chain starting from the -COOH group:\n`HOOC(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(CH₂CH₃)-C(4)H(CH₂CH₃)-C(5)H₃`\n*   **H-3:** This proton is adjacent to the -CH₂- group at C2 (2 neighbors → triplet), the proton at C4 (1 neighbor → doublet), and the -CH₂- of its own ethyl group (2 neighbors → triplet). This creates a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal described.\n*   **H-4:** This proton is adjacent to the proton at C3 (1 neighbor → doublet), the -CH₃ group at C5 (3 neighbors → quartet), and the -CH₂- of its own ethyl group (2 neighbors → triplet). This creates a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** (the order might vary depending on coupling constants, but the multiplicities are correct). This matches the first signal described.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   This structure contains a proton that would produce a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   However, it does not contain any proton that is adjacent to one proton and two different -CH₂- groups. Therefore, it cannot produce the required `dtt` signal.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   The methine protons in this molecule do not have the correct neighbors to produce either a `dtq` or a `dtt` pattern according to the n+1 rule. For example, the proton at C3 is coupled to a -CH₂- group, a -CH- group, and a -CH₃ group, which would result in a triplet of doublets of quartets.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nOnly structure B, **CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**, contains protons that perfectly match both of the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR data.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nTo identify the unknown compound, the provided spectroscopic data must be systematically compared with the expected spectra for each of the four possible structures.\n\n### Step 1: Analysis of FTIR Data\n\nThe FTIR spectrum shows two key features:\n*   **A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid. The peak is notably broad due to the strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\nAll four given options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids. Therefore, the FTIR data confirms the presence of the carboxylic acid functional group but does not help in distinguishing between the different alkyl structures.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe ¹H NMR data provides the most crucial information for determining the exact structure.\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H), confirming the compound is saturated. All four options are saturated and consistent with this observation.\n*   **A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex splitting pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton, causing a doublet (**d**) splitting.\n    *   Two neighboring protons (like a CH₂ group), causing a triplet (**t**) splitting.\n    *   Three neighboring protons (like a CH₃ group), causing a quartet (**q**) splitting.\n*   **A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern occurs when a proton is coupled to:\n    *   One neighboring proton, causing a doublet (**d**) splitting.\n    *   Two neighboring protons (a CH₂ group), causing a triplet (**t**) splitting.\n    *   Another group of two neighboring protons (a second CH₂ group), causing another triplet (**t**) splitting.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluating Each Candidate Structure\n\nLet's analyze the expected ¹H NMR splitting patterns for the single protons (methine or CH groups) in each molecule, as these are most likely to exhibit such complex splitting.\n\n**A) CH₃CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   The proton on C3 is adjacent to the CH₂ at C2 (2H, triplet), the CH at C4 (1H, doublet), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H, quartet). This would result in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   The proton on C4 is adjacent to the CH at C3 (1H, doublet), its own CH₃ group (3H, quartet), and the terminal CH₃ group (3H, quartet). This would be a doublet of quartets of quartets (dqq).\n*   This molecule has a `dtq` but lacks a `dtt`.\n\n**B) CH₃CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (Interpreted as 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid)**\nThe condensed formula for B is ambiguous. Interpreting the carbon backbone and substituent placement leads to the IUPAC name 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid:\n`CH₃(f)-CH₂(e)-CH(d)(CH₃)-CH(c)(C₂H₅)-CH₂(b)-COOH(a)`\n*   The proton on C3, H(c), is coupled to the CH on C4 (1H, doublet), the CH₂ group at C2 (2H, triplet), and the CH₂ group of its ethyl substituent (2H, triplet). This signal would be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n*   The proton on C4, H(d), is coupled to the CH on C3 (1H, doublet), the CH₂ group at C5 (2H, triplet), and the CH₃ substituent on C4 (3H, quartet). This signal would be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   This molecule is the only candidate that produces both a `dtt` and a `dtq` signal.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n*   The proton on C3 is adjacent to the CH₂ at C4 (2H, triplet), the CH at C2 (1H, doublet), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H, quartet). This would be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   The proton on C2 is adjacent to the CH at C3 (1H, doublet) and the CH₃ on C2 (3H, quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets (dq).\n*   This molecule has a `dtq` but does not have a `dtt`.\n\n**D) CH₃CH₂CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)COOH (Interpreted as 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n`CH₃-CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-COOH`\n*   The proton on C3 is coupled to the CH₂ at C4 (2H, triplet), the CH at C2 (1H, doublet), and the CH₂ of its ethyl substituent (2H, triplet). This would result in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n*   The proton on C2 is coupled to the CH at C3 (1H, doublet) and the CH₂ of its ethyl substituent (2H, triplet), giving a doublet of triplets (dt).\n*   This molecule has a `dtt` but lacks a `dtq`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the ¹H NMR splitting patterns, only compound B, 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, is consistent with the observation of both a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound:\n\n**1.

Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a characteristic feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion:** The FTIR data confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). All four possible compounds (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the class of compound but does not distinguish between the options.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\nThe key to identifying the correct structure lies in analyzing the complex splitting patterns described. The splitting of a proton's signal is determined by the number of non-equivalent protons on adjacent carbons.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates there are no protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H), which is consistent with all four saturated structures.\n\n*   **Signal 1: A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):**\n    *   This complex splitting means a single proton is being split by three different groups of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** The proton has one proton neighbor (a CH group).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** The proton has two equivalent proton neighbors (a CH₂ group).\n    *   **Quartet (q):** The proton has three equivalent proton neighbors (a CH₃ group).\n    *   Therefore, the proton that gives this signal must be attached to a carbon that is bonded to a **CH** group, a **CH₂** group, and a **CH₃** group.\n\n*   **Signal 2: A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):**\n    *   This pattern indicates a single proton is split by three different groups of neighbors.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** The proton has one proton neighbor (a CH group).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** The proton has two equivalent proton neighbors (a CH₂ group).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** The proton has another, different set of two equivalent proton neighbors (a second CH₂ group).\n    *   Therefore, the proton responsible for this signal must be attached to a carbon that is bonded to a **CH** group, a **CH₂** group, and another, non-equivalent **CH₂** group.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Candidate Structures\n\nNow, we must find which molecule contains *both* a proton in a `dtq` environment and a *different* proton in a `dtt` environment.\n\nLet's use IUPAC names for clarity:\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH:** 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH:** 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH:** 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH:** 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid\n\n**Analysis of Structure A (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):** `CH₃CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`\n*   The proton on C3 is adjacent to the CH on C2, the CH₂ on C4, and the methyl group on C3. This environment (`CH`, `CH₂`, `CH₃`) creates a **dtq** signal.\n*   This molecule lacks a proton adjacent to a `CH` and two separate `CH₂` groups. Thus, it cannot produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n**Analysis of Structure C (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):** `CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH`\n*   The proton on C3 is adjacent to the CH on C4, the CH₂ on C2, and the methyl group on C3. This creates a **dtq** signal.\n*   This molecule also lacks the environment needed to produce a `dtt` signal.\n\n**Analysis of Structure D (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid):** `CH₃CH₂-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`\n*   The proton on C3 is adjacent to the CH on C4, the CH₂ on C2, and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C3. This environment (`CH`, `CH₂`, `CH₂`) creates a **dtt** signal.\n*   The proton on C4 is adjacent to the CH on C3, the CH₂ on C5, and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C4. This also creates a **dtt** signal.\n*   This molecule lacks a proton adjacent to a `CH`, `CH₂`, and `CH₃` group, and thus cannot produce a `dtq` signal.\n\n**Analysis of Structure B (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid):** `CH₃CH₂-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-COOH`\nLet's analyze the connectivity: `CH₃(g)CH₂(f)-C(3)H(C(e)H₂CH₃(d))-C(2)H(C(c)H₂CH₃(b))-COOH`\n*   **dtt signal:** The proton on C3 is adjacent to the CH on C2, the CH₂ on C(f) (from the main chain), and the CH₂ on C(e) (from the ethyl substituent). This environment (`CH`, `CH₂`, `CH₂`) perfectly describes the requirement for a **dtt** signal.\n*   **dtq signal:** Now we must find the proton with `CH`, `CH₂`, and `CH₃` neighbors. A careful look at the structure reveals that no single proton has this exact combination of neighboring groups. However, the question states that both signals are observed. In complex chiral molecules, protons that are chemically different (diastereotopic), like the two protons on the CH₂ of an ethyl group next to a chiral center, can have complex splitting. The proton `H(2)` is coupled to `H(3)` (1H) and the `CH₂(c)` (2H), which would produce a doublet of triplets (`dt`). It is the proton `H(3)` that is uniquely positioned to give the highly specific `dtt` pattern. The only way to also obtain a `dtq` is if another proton in the molecule, likely one of the diastereotopic methylene protons on an ethyl group, gives rise to a complex multiplet that is being described as a `dtq`. Given the definitive `dtt` signal arising from H(3), structure B is the only plausible candidate among the choices that can produce this specific pattern.\n\nSince only structure B can generate the clear doublet of triplets of triplets (`dtt`) signal from the proton at the C3 position, it is the most logical choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 48:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data:**\n*   A broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid, broadened by hydrogen bonding.\n*   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but doesn't distinguish between the choices.\n\n**2. Analysis of 1H NMR Data:**\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This confirms the absence of C=C double bonds, which is true for all four saturated structures.\n*   The key to solving this problem lies in the complex splitting patterns observed for two different protons in the molecule.\n    *   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq).** For a signal to be split this way, the corresponding proton must be coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: one set with 1 proton (to give the doublet), one set with 2 protons (to give the triplet), and one set with 3 protons (to give the quartet).\n    *   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).** This means a different proton in the same molecule must be coupled to three different sets of neighbors: one set with 1 proton (to give the doublet), one set with 2 protons (to give the first triplet), and another set with 2 protons (to give the second triplet).\n\n**3. Structural Analysis of Each Option:**\n\nWe will now examine the structure of each option to see which one possesses two protons with the specific neighboring environments required to produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt`. Let's denote methine protons (C-H) on the main chain as Hₐ, Hₑ, etc.\n\n*   **A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH:** This structure has a proton that would show a `dtq` pattern (the H on the carbon next to the CH₂COOH group), but no proton that would show a `dtt`.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH:** This structure has a proton that would show a `dtt` pattern (Hₐ, which is adjacent to Hₑ and two different CH₂ groups), but it does not have a proton environment that would produce a `dtq`.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH:** This structure has a proton that would show a `dtq` pattern (the H on the carbon attached to the ethyl group), but it lacks a proton that would show a `dtt`.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH:** Let's draw this structure and analyze its key protons.\n    ```\n          (Ethyl)   (Ethyl)\n            |         |\n       CH₃--C(Hₐ) --- C(Hₑ) --- CH₂ --- COOH\n    ```\n    *   **Analysis of Hₐ:** This proton is adjacent to:\n        1.  The `CH₃` group at the end of the chain (3 protons).\n        2.  The methine proton `Hₑ` (1 proton).\n        3.  The `CH₂` of its attached ethyl group (2 protons).\n        The neighbors for Hₐ are (1H, 2H, 3H). This environment will produce a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n\n    *   **Analysis of Hₑ:** This proton is adjacent to:\n        1.  The methine proton `Hₐ` (1 proton).\n        2.  The `CH₂` group next to the `COOH` (2 protons).\n        3.  The `CH₂` of its attached ethyl group (2 protons).\n        The neighbors for Hₑ are (1H, 2H, 2H). This environment will produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nStructure C is the only compound that has two different protons with the correct neighboring environments to produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n```python\n# Final Answer Selection\n# Based on the step-by-step analysis of the spectral data provided, we have deduced the structure of the unknown compound.\n# The FTIR data confirmed the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n# The key to identifying the specific isomer was the 1H NMR data, which showed two unique, complex signals:\n# 1.

The broadness is due to the varying strengths of these bonds.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a saturated carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four given options (A, B, C, D) are carboxylic acids, so this confirms the functional group present but does not yet distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data (General)**\n\n*   **\"none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens\"**: Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached to carbon atoms of a C=C double bond. Their absence confirms that the molecule is saturated (contains no C=C double bonds). All four options are saturated molecules, so this information is consistent with all of them.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data (Splitting Patterns)**\n\nThis is the most crucial part of the analysis. We need to find the structure that contains a proton with a \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" (dtq) multiplicity and another proton with a \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" (dtt) multiplicity.\n\n*   A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: one neighboring proton (n=1, gives a doublet), a set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, gives a triplet), and a set of three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3, gives a quartet).\n*   A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** means a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: one neighboring proton (n=1, gives a doublet), a set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, gives a triplet), and another different set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2, gives another triplet).\n\nLet's analyze the structure of each option. The condensed formulas need careful interpretation. Let's assume they describe a main chain with substituents.\n\n**Analysis of Option A: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\n\nLet's interpret this formula as a chain: `(CH₃)(C₂H₅)CH` group connected to a `CH(C₂H₅)` group, which is connected to a `CH₂COOH` group.\nLet's draw this out:\n```\n      CH₂CH₃ (ethyl on C(a))\n      |\n  CH₃--CH(a)--CH(b)--CH₂--COOH\n                 |\n                 CH₂CH₃ (ethyl on C(b))\n```\nTo understand the splitting, we first need to identify the longest carbon chain that includes the COOH group.\nThe longest chain is: `COOH(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(b)(3)-CH(a)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`.\nThis makes the molecule **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**.\n\nNow let's analyze the splitting for the two methine protons, H(a) and H(b).\n*   **Proton H(b) at C3:** This proton is coupled to:\n    1.  The two protons on C2 (`-CH₂-COOH`): `n=2`, gives a **triplet**.\n    2.  The one proton on C4 (H(a)): `n=1`, gives a **doublet**.\n    3.  The two protons on its own ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`): `n=2`, gives a **triplet**.\n    Therefore, the signal for H(b) is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the required signals.\n\n*   **Proton H(a) at C4:** This proton is coupled to:\n    1.  The two protons on C5 (`-CH₂CH₃`): `n=2`, gives a **triplet**.\n    2.  The one proton on C3 (H(b)): `n=1`, gives a **doublet**.\n    3.  The three protons of the methyl group on C4: `n=3`, gives a **quartet**.\n    Therefore, the signal for H(a) is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the second required signal.\nSince this structure has both a `dtt` and a `dtq` signal, it is a very strong candidate.\n\n**Analysis of Option B: CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\n\nThis is 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid.\nThe two methine protons are on C3 and C4.\n*   **Proton at C3:** Coupled to H on C4 (d), CH₃ on C3 (q), and CH₂ on C2 (t). This gives a **doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**.\n*   **Proton at C4:** Coupled to H on C3 (d) and the two CH₃ groups on C4 and C5 (which are equivalent due to being part of an isopropyl group, `n=6`). This gives a **doublet of septets**.\nThis molecule has a `dqt` signal, but it does not have a `dtt` signal. So, B is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option C: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\n\nThis is 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid.\nThe two methine protons are on C2 and C3.\n*   **Proton at C2:** Coupled to H on C3 (d) and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (t). This gives a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n*   **Proton at C3:** Coupled to H on C2 (d), the CH₂ of its ethyl group (t), and the CH₂ on C4 (t). This gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\nThis molecule has a `dtt` signal, but it does not have a `dtq` signal. So, C is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option D: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\n\nThis is 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid.\nThe two methine protons are on C2 and C3.\n*   **Proton at C2:** Coupled to H on C3 (d) and the CH₃ on C2 (q). This gives a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n*   **Proton at C3:** Coupled to H on C2 (d), the CH₃ on C3 (q), and the CH₂ on C4 (t). This gives a **doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**.\nThis molecule has a `dqt` signal, but it does not have a `dtt` signal. So, D is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the structure corresponding to option A, which is 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, gives rise to both a `doublet of triplets of quartets` signal and a `doublet of triplets of triplets` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Data\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The broadness is a key indicator of this functional group.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position is typical for the carbonyl group within a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible structures (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data is consistent with all options but does not distinguish between them.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data\n\nThis is the critical data for differentiating between the isomers.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four structures are saturated alkanoic acids, so this information is also consistent with all of them.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** According to the n+1 rule, a proton showing this splitting pattern must be coupled to three distinct sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing the **doublet (d)**.\n    *   A set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing the **triplet (t)**.\n    *   A set of three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3), causing the **quartet (q)**.\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** A proton showing this splitting pattern must be coupled to three distinct sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing the **doublet (d)**.\n    *   A set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing the first **triplet (t)**.\n    *   A different set of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing the second **triplet (t)**.\n\nNow, we must analyze the structure of each candidate to see which one has protons matching these complex splitting patterns. We will number the carbon chain starting with the carboxyl carbon as C1.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Therefore, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 51:\nTo solve this, a detailed analysis of the expected proton (¹H) NMR splitting patterns for each of the four possible compounds is required. The key pieces of information from the NMR spectrum are the presence of a \"doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)\" and a \"doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)\". The FTIR data, with a broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ (O-H stretch) and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ (C=O stretch), confirm the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group, which all four candidates possess.\n\nLet's break down the expected splitting patterns for the protons on the main carbon chain of each molecule. Splitting patterns arise from the interaction of a proton with its neighboring non-equivalent protons (n), following the n+1 rule. When a proton is coupled to multiple, different groups of neighbors, we see more complex patterns like doublets of triplets.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid)**\n    *   Let's label the carbons starting from the COOH group: HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Et)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6).\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the two protons at C2 (a triplet), the single proton at C4 (a doublet), and the two protons of its ethyl group's CH₂ (another triplet). This would result in a **triplet of doublets of triplets (tdt)**.\n    *   The proton at C4 is coupled to the single proton at C3 (a doublet), the two protons at C5 (a triplet), and the two protons of its ethyl group's CH₂ (another triplet). This creates a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   This molecule perfectly matches one of the observed signals (dtt). Let's now search for a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq). A dtq requires a proton to be coupled to one proton (d), two protons (t), and three protons (q). No single proton in this molecule fits this description. For example, the CH₂ at C5 is coupled to the proton at C4 (doublet) and the methyl group at C6 (quartet), but also has geminal coupling, resulting in a complex multiplet, likely a doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq).\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Me)-CH(4)(Me)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6).\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the two protons at C2 (triplet), the one proton at C4 (doublet), and the three protons of its methyl group (quartet). This results in a **triplet of doublets of quartets (tdq)**, which can also be described as a dtq depending on coupling constants.\n    *   The proton at C4 is coupled to the one proton at C3 (doublet), the two protons at C5 (triplet), and the three protons of its methyl group (quartet). This also gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   This molecule (B) has two signals that could be described as `dtq` but lacks a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: HOOC(1)-CH(2)(Me)-CH(3)(Me)-CH₂(4)-CH₃(5).\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the one proton at C2 (doublet), the two protons at C4 (triplet), and the three protons of its methyl group (quartet). This gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   This matches one of the required signals. However, looking for a `dtt` proton reveals none. The proton at C2 is a doublet of quartets (dq). Therefore, this molecule does not match all the data.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   Structure: HOOC(1)-CH(2)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(4)-CH₃(5).\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the one proton at C2 (doublet), the two protons of its ethyl group's CH₂ (triplet), and the two protons at C4 (triplet). This gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   The proton at C2 is coupled to the one proton at C3 (doublet) and the two protons of its ethyl group's CH₂ (triplet), resulting in a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n    *   Therefore, this molecule provides the `dtt` signal but lacks the `dtq` signal.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, none of the molecules seem to possess both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal. However, let's re-examine molecule A. It was previously assigned as having a `dtt` but not a `dtq`. It's possible there's a misunderstanding in my structural assignment from the condensed formula. Let's strictly follow the written formula for A: `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`. This represents 3,4-diethylhexanoic acid.\n\nThere seems to be a contradiction in the provided data versus the expected patterns for the given options. Let's reconsider molecule **A: 3,4-diethylhexanoic acid.**\n- Proton at C4: `dtt`. Confirmed match.\n- Proton at C3: `dtt` (or more accurately, tdt). Close, but not a dtq.\n\nLet's re-examine **molecule B: 3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid.**\n- Proton at C4: `dtq`. Confirmed match.\n- Proton at C3: `dtq`. Confirmed match.\nThis molecule has two `dtq` signals. It does not have a `dtt` signal.\n\nGiven the choices, and the high complexity of these molecules, there might be an intended answer where one structure is considered the best fit despite apparent discrepancies. Let's assume there is no error in the question.\n\nIf we revisit Molecule A: 3,4-diethylhexanoic acid, we confidently identified a proton (H4) with a **dtt** pattern. Now, we must find a proton that gives a **dtq** pattern. Let's look at the methylene protons (H5) on the main chain: `...CH(H4)-CH₂(H5)-CH₃(H6)`. These two H5 protons are diastereotopic. Each will be split by H4 (one proton, giving a doublet), H6 (three protons, giving a quartet), and the other H5 proton (geminal coupling, giving a doublet). This results in a doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq), not a dtq. The same logic applies to the CH₂ groups in the ethyl substituents.\n\nLet's re-evaluate Molecule B: 3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid. We found two protons (H3 and H4) that give a **dtq** signal. We need a **dtt**. No proton in this molecule couples to two different sets of two protons.\n\nLet's reconsider all options and the possibility of a subtle interpretation. The most complex and distinct signals described are the `dtt` and `dtq`. Molecule B provides a clear origin for a `dtq` (in fact, two of them). Molecule A provides a clear origin for a `dtt`. It's highly probable the correct structure must contain the features to produce both.\n\nLet's re-read the options one more time to ensure no misinterpretation of the condensed formulas.\nA) `CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH` (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid)\nB) `CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH` (3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid)\nC) `CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH` (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)\nD) `CH3-CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH` (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)\n\nMy initial analyses stand:\n- A has a `dtt`.\n- B has a `dtq`.\n- C has a `dtq`.\n- D has a `dtt`.\n\nThis implies a potential error in the problem statement or options, as no single molecule has both signals. However, in multiple-choice questions of this nature, we must select the *best* possible answer. Let's assume there is a typographical error and that one of the molecules is the intended answer. Without further information, it's impossible to be certain.\n\nHowever, let's look at the structures again. Both `dtt` and `dtq` are highly complex splitting patterns arising from a single proton having three distinct groups of neighboring protons.\n- Proton for a `dtt` signal couples to (1H), (2H), and (2H).\n- Proton for a `dtq` signal couples to (1H), (2H), and (3H).\n\nThe structure in option A, **3,4-diethylhexanoic acid**, has protons that fit this environment.\n- The proton at C4 couples to H3 (1H), the CH₂ at C5 (2H), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H). This gives the **dtt**.\n- The proton at C3 couples to H4 (1H), the CH₂ at C2 (2H), and the CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H). This gives another **dtt** (technically a triplet of doublets of triplets).\n\nLet's carefully check the methylene protons of the ethyl group at C4: `...CH(H4)-CH₂(H_Et)-CH₃`. The two `H_Et` protons are diastereotopic. Let's analyze one of them. It is coupled to H4 (1H, doublet), its geminal partner (1H, doublet), and the methyl group (3H, quartet). This gives a **doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq)**.\n\nIt seems my initial analysis is correct and there's an inconsistency in the question. However, if forced to choose the most plausible answer, let's reconsider the possibility of overlapping signals or similar coupling constants. In molecule B, both methine protons (H3 and H4) are `dtq`. It is the only structure that produces a `dtq`. Perhaps the `dtt` signal arises from a complex multiplet that appears like a `dtt` due to specific J-coupling values. This is less likely than finding a molecule that structurally fits both descriptions. Given the clear mismatch, there is ambiguity.\n\nLet's assume there is an error in my analysis and reconsider B.\n**B: 3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid:**\n`HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Me)-CH(4)(Me)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n- H3: Coupled to H2(2H, t), H4(1H, d), C3-Me(3H, q). → `tdq` (or `dtq`). **MATCH.**\n- H4: Coupled to H3(1H, d), H5(2H, t), C4-Me(3H, q). → `dtq`. **MATCH.**\n- This molecule definitively has a `dtq` signal. It does not have a `dtt` signal.\n\nSince Molecule B, 3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid, is the only option that contains a proton environment that results in a doublet of triplets of quartets (`dtq`), this is the most likely answer, assuming there might be an error in the reporting of the second signal or it arises from a more complex, less ideal pattern.\n\nFinal Check: Let's assume B is correct. We have a clear `dtq` (from H4). We also need a `dtt`. Where could it come from? There are no protons in B that are coupled to a 1H neighbor, a 2H neighbor, and another 2H neighbor. The analysis remains inconsistent with the question.\n\nGiven the options, and the fact that a doublet of triplets of quartets (`dtq`) arises from a proton adjacent to a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group, let's analyze the skeletons:\n- A: -CH(Et)-**CH(Et)**-CH₂-\n- B: -CH(Me)-**CH(Me)**-CH₂- -> H coupled to CH, CH₂, CH₃. **This gives a dtq.**\n- C: -CH(Me)-**CH(Me)**-CH₂- -> H coupled to CH, CH₂, CH₃. **This gives a dtq.**\n- D: -CH(Et)-**CH(Et)**-CH₂-\n\nBoth B and C have a proton that will give a `dtq`. Let's analyze the `dtt` part again. This requires coupling to a CH, a CH₂, and another CH₂.\n- A: -CH(Et)-**CH(Et)**-CH₂- -> H coupled to CH, CH₂, CH₂(Et). **This gives a dtt.**\n- B: No such environment.\n- C: No such environment.\n- D: -CH(Et)-**CH(Et)**-CH₂- -> H coupled to CH, CH₂, CH₂(Et). **This gives a dtt.**\n\nSo, we have:\n- A: has `dtt`, no `dtq`\n- B: has `dtq`, no `dtt`\n- C: has `dtq`, no `dtt`\n- D: has `dtt`, no `dtq`\n\nThis is a flawed question. However, if a choice must be made, there might be a typo in one of the structures. Let's imagine structure B had one ethyl group and one methyl group: `CH3-CH2-CH(Me)-CH(Et)-CH2-COOH`.\nThe proton on the carbon with the ethyl would be coupled to a CH(1H), a CH₂(2H), and another CH₂(2H), giving a `dtt`. The proton on the carbon with the methyl would be coupled to a CH(1H), a CH₂(2H), and a CH₃(3H), giving a `dtq`. This hypothetical molecule fits the data perfectly. Since this exact structure is not an option, and both A and B possess parts of the required features, a definitive answer from the provided list is problematic. Let's stick with the most unique feature. The `dtq` signal from B and C is very specific. The `dtt` from A and D is also specific. Since no molecule has both, I cannot logically conclude an answer. Assuming there is a typo in the question and only one of the signals is correct and diagnostic, this is still ambiguous.\n\nHowever, let's take a final look at B. It is 3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid. It definitively has a proton coupled to a CH, a CH2, and a CH3, yielding a `dtq`. It is the only structure with this specific combination of methyl and other groups to create this pattern. The other signal, `dtt`, does not fit. Let's assume the question meant a different complex multiplet, or there's an error. Between the choices, B is the strongest candidate for the `dtq` signal.\n\nFinal decision based on finding the required patterns. No molecule fits both. But both B and C offer a `dtq`. Both A and D offer a `dtt`. There must be an error in the question. But if forced to select, I'll review again.\n\nRe-evaluating B: `CH3-CH(Me)-CH(Me)-CH2-COOH` (3,4-dimethyl**hexanoic** acid). My previous analysis for B (`-CH(Me)-CH(Me)-CH₂-`) was incorrect.\nThe structure is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(Me)-CH(Me)-CH₂-COOH`. Let's re-analyze `3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid`.\nHOC(1)O-CH₂(2)-C(3)H(Me)-C(4)H(Me)-C(5)H₂-C(6)H₃.\nH4: coupled to H3(d), H5(t), C4-Me(q). This is a **dtq**.\nH3: coupled to H4(d), H2(t), C3-Me(q). This is also a **dtq**.\nSo B has `dtq` signals, but no `dtt`. My initial analysis was correct. Let's go with B as it's the only one providing the dtq signal. It's possible \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" was a mistake for the second `dtq` or another complex multiplet.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic indicator of the O-H stretching vibration found in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n\nConclusion from FTIR: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group present but does not differentiate between the choices.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C-H). All four given structures are saturated alkanoic acids, consistent with this observation.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex splitting pattern arises when a single proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **doublet**.\n    *   A group of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), which splits the signal into a **triplet**.\n    *   A group of three equivalent neighboring protons (n=3), which splits the signal into a **quartet**.\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern occurs when a single proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a **doublet**.\n    *   A group of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing a **triplet**.\n    *   Another, different group of two equivalent neighboring protons (n=2), causing a second **triplet**.\n\nThe presence of both of these highly specific signals in the spectrum is the key to identifying the correct structure.\n\n### **3. Structural Analysis of the Options**\n\nWe must now examine the structure of each candidate molecule to determine if its protons would produce these specific splitting patterns. The condensed formulas provided are unconventional, so we must deduce the correct connectivity that results in a stable molecule.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C2 (1H), the CH₂ group at C4 (2H), and the methyl group at C3 (3H). This would result in a **dtq**.\n    *   However, there is no proton in this molecule that is coupled to one proton, a group of two protons, and another distinct group of two protons. Therefore, it would not produce a **dtt** signal.\n\n*   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH:** Interpreted as a linear chain (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid), this structure is impossible as it would require a carbon atom to have five bonds.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C4 (1H), the CH₂ group at C2 (2H), and the methyl group at C3 (3H). This would result in a **dtq**.\n    *   Similar to structure A, there is no proton environment that would lead to a **dtt** signal.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH:** The molecular formula for this compound is C₉H₁₈O₂. Although written unconventionally, this formula can represent **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**. Let's analyze its structure:\n    `HOOC-CH₂(a)-CH(b)(CH₂CH₃)-CH(c)(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃`\n\n    *   **Proton at C4 (Hc):** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The proton at C3 (Hb) (1H, **doublet**).\n        *   The adjacent CH₂ group of the hexanoic chain (2H, **triplet**).\n        *   The adjacent methyl (CH₃) group (3H, **quartet**).\n        *   This proton's signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n\n    *   **Proton at C3 (Hb):** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The proton at C4 (Hc) (1H, **doublet**).\n        *   The adjacent CH₂(a) group next to the COOH (2H, **triplet**).\n        *   The adjacent CH₂ group of its own ethyl substituent (2H, **triplet**).\n        *   This proton's signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second observed signal.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nOnly the structure corresponding to option C, 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, possesses protons in the precise chemical environments required to produce both a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt) in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is undergoing hydrogen bonding. The broadness is a key characteristic.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also characteristic of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the functional group type but does not help distinguish between the specific structures.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR spectrum. We need to find the molecule whose structure can produce both of these signals.\n\nThe multiplicity of a proton's signal is determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons (n) according to the n+1 rule. For complex splitting, a proton is coupled to multiple, different sets of neighboring protons.\n\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    *   This means a single proton is being split by three different groups of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Indicates coupling to 1 adjacent proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Indicates coupling to 2 adjacent protons (n=2), typically a CH₂ group.\n    *   **Quartet (q):** Indicates coupling to 3 adjacent protons (n=3), typically a CH₃ group.\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a CH proton that is vicinally coupled to a CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group. This means the carbon atom bearing our target proton must be directly bonded to the carbons of a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group.\n\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    *   This means a different single proton is being split by three different groups of neighboring protons.\n    *   **Doublet (d):** Indicates coupling to 1 adjacent proton (n=1).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Indicates coupling to 2 adjacent protons (n=2).\n    *   **Triplet (t):** Indicates coupling to another, different set of 2 adjacent protons (n=2).\n    *   Therefore, we are looking for a CH proton that is vicinally coupled to one CH group and two different CH₂ groups.\n\n### **3. Evaluation of Candidate Structures**\n\nLet's analyze the connectivity of each proposed structure to see if they can produce these specific splitting patterns. We'll focus on the CH (methine) protons, as they are the most likely to have such complex environments. Let's assume the condensed formulas represent a linear carbon backbone with the bracketed groups as substituents.\n\n*   **A) `CH₃CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH` (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The `CH` at position 3 has neighbors: a `CH₂` (at C4) and a `CH` (at C2). This would give a doublet of triplets (dt).\n    *   The `CH` at position 2 has neighbors: a `CH` (at C3) and a `CH₃` (on C2). This would give a doublet of quartets (dq).\n    *   This structure does not produce a `dtq` or a `dtt`.\n\n*   **B) `(CH₃)₂CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-COOH` (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The `CH` at position 4 has neighbors: a `CH` (at C3) and two `CH₃` groups on the same carbon. Only vicinal coupling to the `CH` at C3 applies. This would give a doublet.\n    *   The `CH` at position 3 has neighbors: a `CH` (at C4) and a `CH₂` (at C2). This would give a doublet of triplets (dt).\n    *   This structure does not produce a `dtq` or a `dtt`.\n\n*   **C) `CH₃-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH` (3,4-diethylhexanoic acid)**\n    Let's number the main chain: `CH₃(6)-CH(5)(Et)-CH(4)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(2)-COOH(1)`. This parsing is incorrect based on the formula.\n    Let's parse `CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH` as `CH₃-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH`. This is 3-ethyl-4-(1-ethylpropyl)-... this gets confusing.\n    Let's parse it as a chain starting from `CH₃` where C has substituents: `CH₃-C(H)(Et)-C(H)(Et)-CH₂COOH`. This structure doesn't balance valency.\n\n    Let's assume the standard representation: `CH₃` group, then `CH(C₂H₅)`, then `CH(C₂H₅)`, then `CH₂COOH` all linked linearly.\n    `CH₃-CH(a)(C₂H₅)-CH(b)(C₂H₅)-CH₂-COOH`\n    *   **Proton H(a):** Its carbon is bonded to a `CH₃` group, a `CH(b)` group, and a `CH₂` group (from its own ethyl substituent).\n        *   Neighbors: The `CH₃` group (3H -> **quartet**), the `CH(b)` group (1H -> **doublet**), and the ethyl `CH₂` group (2H -> **triplet**).\n        *   This proton's signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first piece of data.\n    *   **Proton H(b):** Its carbon is bonded to a `CH(a)` group, a `CH₂` group (of the main chain), and another `CH₂` group (from its own ethyl substituent).\n        *   Neighbors: The `CH(a)` group (1H -> **doublet**), the main-chain `CH₂` group (2H -> **triplet**), and the ethyl `CH₂` group (2H -> **triplet**).\n        *   This proton's signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.

This would give a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one signal.\n    *   The `CH` at position 2 has neighbors: a `CH` (at C3) and a `CH₂` (from its ethyl group). This would give a doublet of triplets (dt).\n    *   This structure produces a `dtt` but not a `dtq`.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly structure C, `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`, has protons in environments that would result in both a `dtq` and a `dtt` splitting pattern. Therefore, it is the correct identification for the unknown compound.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The broadness is a key indicator.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also characteristic of a carboxylic acid (typically 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ for the dimeric form).\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not help distinguish between them.\n\n### **2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four candidate molecules are saturated alkanoic acids, so this is consistent with all options.\n*   **Key splitting patterns:**\n    *   One signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   Another signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\nThis is the crucial information for identifying the structure. Let's break down what these splitting patterns mean. The multiplicity of a signal is determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons (the n+1 rule).\n*   **dtq (doublet of triplets of quartets):** This means a proton (let's call it H_A) is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a doublet (1+1=2).\n    *   Two neighboring protons (n=2), causing a triplet (2+1=3).\n    *   Three neighboring protons (n=3), causing a quartet (3+1=4).\n    For this pattern to be observed, H_A must be a **methine (CH)** group with its carbon atom bonded to three other carbons that carry 1, 2, and 3 protons, respectively (i.e., a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group).\n\n*   **dtt (doublet of triplets of triplets):** This means a proton (let's call it H_B) is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), causing a doublet (1+1=2).\n    *   Two neighboring protons (n=2), causing a triplet (2+1=3).\n    *   Another, non-equivalent set of two neighboring protons (n=2), causing another triplet (2+1=3).\n    For this pattern to be observed, H_B must be a **methine (CH)** group with its carbon atom bonded to three other carbons that carry 1, 2, and 2 protons, respectively (i.e., a CH and two different CH₂ groups).\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nThe condensed formulas are written in a potentially confusing way. Let's parse them into their IUPAC names and structures, assuming they represent a linear backbone from left to right, with bracketed groups as substituents.\n\n#### **Candidate A: `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`**\nLet's assume `C(H)` is a way of writing `CH`.\nStructure: `CH3-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-CH2-COOH`.\nNumbering from the COOH group (C1): `COOH(1)-CH2(2)-CH(3)(C2H5)-CH(4)(C2H5)-CH3(5)`.\nThis is **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n\nLet's analyze its key protons:\n*   **Proton on C4 (H₄):** This is a methine (CH) proton. Its neighbors are:\n    *   The proton on C3 (a CH group, **1H**).\n    *   The protons on C5 (a CH₃ group, **3H**).\n    *   The protons on the ethyl group's CH₂ (a CH₂ group, **2H**).\n    This proton is coupled to 1H, 2H, and 3H neighbors. This will produce a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the data.\n\n*   **Proton on C3 (H₃):** This is a methine (CH) proton. Its neighbors are:\n    *   The proton on C4 (a CH group, **1H**).\n    *   The protons on C2 (a CH₂ group, **2H**).\n    *   The protons on the ethyl group's CH₂ (another CH₂ group, **2H**).\n    This proton is coupled to 1H, 2H, and another 2H. This will produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This also matches the data.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** This structure is the only one that exhibits both the `dtq` and `dtt` splitting patterns required by the ¹H NMR data.\n\n#### **Candidate B: `CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH`**\nStructure: `CH3CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH`\nIUPAC Name: **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   Proton on C3 (H₃): Neighbors are H(C2), H₂(C4), and H₂(Et). This gives a **dtt**.\n*   Is there a `dtq`? No. There is no methine proton coupled to a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group simultaneously. Therefore, B is incorrect.\n\n#### **Candidate C: `CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH`**\nStructure: `CH3CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`\nIUPAC Name: **2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   Proton on C3 (H₃): Neighbors are H(C2), H₂(C4), and H₃(Me). This gives a **dtq**.\n*   Is there a `dtt`? No. There is no methine proton coupled to a CH and two different CH₂ groups. Therefore, C is incorrect.\n\n#### **Candidate D: `CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH`**\nStructure: `(CH3)2CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH`\nIUPAC Name: **3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   Proton on C3 (H₃): Neighbors are H₂(C2), H(C4), and H₃(Me). This gives a **dtq**.\n*   Is there a `dtt`? No. The other methine proton (H₄) is coupled to H(C3), and two different CH₃ groups, not two CH₂ groups. Therefore, D is incorrect.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly the structure corresponding to option A, **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**, has the specific proton environments that would generate both a `doublet of triplets of quartets` and a `doublet of triplets of triplets` in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at ~3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadening is a result of intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at ~1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, and this specific wavenumber is typical for a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The FTIR data strongly indicate that the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four given options are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group is present but does not distinguish between the isomers. The definitive identification must come from the NMR data.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   The problem states there are **no signals for vinyl-hydrogens**. This confirms that the compound is saturated (contains no C=C double bonds), which is consistent with all four of the provided structures.\n    *   The most critical information for structural elucidation lies in the two complex splitting patterns observed:\n        *   Signal 1: **A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n        *   Signal 2: **A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n\n3.  **Deconstruct the Splitting Patterns:**\n    Complex splitting (multiplet of multiplets) arises when a proton is coupled to multiple, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons. The splitting for each set follows the `n+1` rule, where `n` is the number of equivalent neighboring protons.\n    *   To produce a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**, a single proton must be coupled (through 3-bond, or vicinal, coupling) to:\n        *   **One** adjacent proton (n=1), which splits its signal into a **d**oublet.\n        *   **Two** adjacent protons (n=2), which splits its signal into a **t**riplet.\n        *   **Three** adjacent protons (n=3), which splits its signal into a **q**uartet.\n        This implies the proton under observation is on a `CH` group that is adjacent to another `CH` group, a `CH₂` group, and a `CH₃` group.\n    *   To produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**, a single proton must be coupled to:\n        *   **One** adjacent proton (n=1), which splits its signal into a **d**oublet.\n        *   **Two** adjacent protons (n=2), which splits its signal into a **t**riplet.\n        *   A second, chemically distinct set of **two** adjacent protons (n=2), which splits its signal into another **t**riplet.\n        This implies the proton under observation is on a `CH` group that is adjacent to another `CH` group and two non-equivalent `CH₂` groups.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Candidate Structure:**\n    We will now systematically analyze the methine (`-CH-`) protons in each molecule, as they are the only ones capable of exhibiting such high-order splitting.\n\n    *   **A) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\n        This structure is **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**. Let's draw it out and label the key protons on the main chain.\n        `HOOC¹-CH₂²-CH³(a)(C₂H₅)-CH⁴(b)(C₂H₅)-CH₃⁵`\n        *   **Proton H(b) on carbon C4:**\n            *   It is adjacent to proton H(a) on C3 (1H) → gives a **doublet (d)**.\n            *   It is adjacent to the protons on C5 (a CH₃ group, 3H) → gives a **quartet (q)**.\n            *   It is adjacent to the protons of the CH₂ group within its own ethyl substituent (2H) → gives a **triplet (t)**.\n            *   The resulting multiplicity for H(b) is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This perfectly matches one of the observed signals.\n        *   **Proton H(a) on carbon C3:**\n            *   It is adjacent to proton H(b) on C4 (1H) → gives a **doublet (d)**.\n            *   It is adjacent to the protons on C2 (a CH₂ group, 2H) → gives a **triplet (t)**.\n            *   It is adjacent to the protons of the CH₂ group within its own ethyl substituent (2H) → gives another **triplet (t)**.\n            *   The resulting multiplicity for H(a) is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This perfectly matches the second observed signal.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Structure A is the only molecule that accounts for both the `dtq` and `dtt` signals.\n\n    *   **B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**\n        This is **2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**. The proton on C3 would give a `dtt` signal, but the proton on C2 would give a `dt` signal (coupled to one H on C3 and two H on its ethyl group). This structure lacks a `dtq` signal.\n\n    *   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**\n        This is **2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**. The proton on C3 would give a `dtq` signal, but the proton on C2 would give a `dq` signal (coupled to one H on C3 and three H on its methyl group). This structure lacks a `dtt` signal.\n\n    *   **D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**\n        This is **3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**. The proton on C3 would give a `dtq` signal, but the proton on C4 would be a `doublet of septets` (coupled to one H on C3 and the six H's of the two methyl groups). This structure lacks a `dtt` signal.\n\n5.  **Final Decision:**\n    Based on the detailed analysis of the expected 1H NMR splitting patterns, only structure A provides protons that would generate both a `doublet of triplets of quartets` and a `doublet of triplets of triplets`.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\n**Reasoning and Thinking Process**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Provided Information:**\n    *   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n        *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is a classic sign of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid that is undergoing hydrogen bonding.\n        *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch, which is also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n        *   Conclusion from FTIR: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options are carboxylic acids, so this confirms the functional group but doesn't distinguish between the choices.\n\n    *   **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n        *   \"None of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens\": This tells us the molecule is saturated, meaning it contains no C=C or C≡C bonds. All four options are saturated alkanoic acids.\n        *   \"One of the signals...is a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)\": This is a highly specific splitting pattern. For a proton to show this multiplicity, it must be coupled to three distinct sets of neighboring protons:\n            *   One single proton (which splits the signal into a **d**oublet).\n            *   A set of two equivalent protons (like a CH₂ group), which splits the signal into a **t**riplet.\n            *   A set of three equivalent protons (like a CH₃ group), which splits the signal into a **q**uartet.\n        *   \"a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)\": Similarly, this proton must be coupled to three distinct sets of neighbors:\n            *   One single proton (giving a **d**oublet).\n            *   A set of two equivalent protons (a CH₂ group, giving a **t**riplet).\n            *   Another, chemically different set of two equivalent protons (another CH₂ group, giving a second **t**riplet).\n\n2.  **Systematically Analyze Each Candidate Structure:**\n    The most effective method is to draw each structure and examine the environments of the methine (CH) protons, as they are most likely to have such complex splitting.

All four options (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid functional group, so this information confirms the functional group type but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n### **2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe key to distinguishing between the isomers lies in the complex splitting patterns described in the ¹H NMR spectrum. We must identify the structure that can produce both of the following signals:\n\n1.  A **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**: This means the proton giving this signal is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: a group of one proton (giving the doublet), a group of two equivalent protons (giving the triplet), and a group of three equivalent protons (giving the quartet).\n2.  A **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**: This means the proton for this signal is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: a group of one proton (doublet), a group of two equivalent protons (first triplet), and another group of two equivalent protons (second triplet).\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting for the protons on the main carbon chain of each candidate structure.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH:** This structure does not possess protons that would simultaneously give both a dtq and a dtt signal. For instance, the proton beta to the COOH group would be a doublet of triplets of quartets (coupled to one H, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group), but there is no proton that would result in a doublet of triplets of triplets.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH:** Let's expand the structure and label the key protons:\n    **CH₃(a)-CH(b)(CH₂CH₃)-CH(e)(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂(h)-COOH**\n\n    *   **Proton H(b):**\n        *   Coupled to one proton, H(e), resulting in a **doublet**.\n        *   Coupled to the two protons of the adjacent CH₂(h) group (from the C₂H₅ substituent), resulting in a **triplet**.\n        *   Coupled to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group, CH₃(a), resulting in a **quartet**.\n        *   Therefore, the signal for **H(b)** is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.

All four possible options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this data confirms the functional group present but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n### **Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe key to identifying the correct structure lies in the complex splitting patterns described. A proton's signal is split into a specific pattern based on the number of non-equivalent protons on adjacent carbons. This is often referred to as spin-spin coupling.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This observation is consistent with all four proposed structures, as none contain carbon-carbon double bonds.\n*   **A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This complex splitting pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: one proton on an adjacent carbon (giving a doublet), a set of two protons on another adjacent carbon (giving a triplet), and another distinct set of two protons on a third adjacent carbon (giving a second triplet).\n*   **A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This pattern occurs when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: one proton (causing a doublet), a group of two protons (causing a triplet), and a group of three protons (causing a quartet).\n\n### **Evaluation of Proposed Structures**\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting patterns for the protons on the main chain of each candidate molecule.\n\n*   **A) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to one proton at C2 and two protons at C4, which would result in a doublet of triplets (dt).\n    *   The proton at C2 is coupled to one proton at C3, which would result in a doublet (d).\n    *   This structure does not produce the required `dtt` or `dtq` signals.\n\n*   **B) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *Let's analyze the proton `H(c)` at the C3 position: `CH3-CH(b)(Et)-CH(c)(Et)-CH2(d)-COOH`. This proton has three different adjacent carbons with protons: `CH(b)` (1 proton), `CH2(d)` (2 protons), and the `CH2` of the ethyl group attached to C3 (2 protons). This combination of neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H) will split the signal for `H(c)` into a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *Now let's analyze the proton `H(b)` at the C4 position: `CH3(a)-CH(b)(Et)-CH(c)(Et)-CH2-COOH`. This proton also has three different adjacent carbons with protons: `CH3(a)` (3 protons), `CH(c)` (1 proton), and the `CH2` of the ethyl group attached to C4 (2 protons). This combination of neighbors (3H, 1H, 2H) will split the signal for `H(b)` into a **quartet of doublets of triplets (qdt)**, which is the same multiplicity as a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *This structure is the only one that matches both complex splitting patterns described.\n\n*   **C) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 has three neighboring sets of protons: the `CH2` of the main chain (2 protons), the proton at C2 (1 proton), and the `CH2` of the ethyl group on C3 (2 protons). This would indeed produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule is adjacent to sets of 1, 2, and 3 protons. For instance, the proton at C2 is adjacent to one proton (at C3) and two protons (on its ethyl group), giving a doublet of triplets (dt). Therefore, this structure lacks the required `dtq` signal.\n\n*   **D) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is coupled to the proton at C4 (1H) and the `CH2` group at C2 (2H), which would give a doublet of triplets (dt).\n    *   The proton at C4 is coupled to the proton at C3 (1H) and the `CH3` group at C5 (3H), which would give a doublet of quartets (dq).\n    *   This structure does not produce the required `dtt` or `dtq` signals.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, only structure B is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 59:\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\nTo identify the unknown compound, the provided FTIR and 1H NMR data are analyzed and compared against the four possible structures.\n\n**FTIR Spectroscopy**\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration found in carboxylic acids. The significant broadness is a result of hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is indicative of a C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also a key feature of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\nAll four given options are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the correct functional group is present but does not help to distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**1H NMR Spectroscopy**\n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in the complex splitting patterns reported in the 1H NMR spectrum. Signal splitting arises from the interaction of a proton's magnetic field with the magnetic fields of non-equivalent protons on adjacent atoms (spin-spin coupling).\n\nThe two crucial signals are:\n1.  **A doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This pattern indicates a proton is being split by three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons.\n    *   The **doublet (d)** component arises from coupling to a single neighboring proton (a CH group).\n    *   The **triplet (t)** component arises from coupling to a set of two equivalent neighboring protons (a CH₂ group).\n    *   The **quartet (q)** component arises from coupling to a set of three equivalent neighboring protons (a CH₃ group).\n2.  **A doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern indicates a proton is coupled to:\n    *   The **doublet (d)** component from a single neighboring proton (a CH group).\n    *   One **triplet (t)** from a set of two equivalent neighboring protons (a CH₂ group).\n    *   A second **triplet (t)** from another, non-equivalent set of two neighboring protons (a different CH₂ group).\n\n### Evaluating the Candidate Structures\n\nEach structure is analyzed to determine if it contains protons with the necessary neighboring environments to produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):** This structure contains a proton that is adjacent to a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group, which could produce a `dtq`. However, it lacks a proton that is adjacent to a CH and two distinct CH₂ groups, so it cannot produce a `dtt`.\n\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid):** This structure has a proton adjacent to a CH and two different CH₂ groups, making it a candidate for the `dtt` signal. However, no proton in this molecule has the correct set of neighbors (1H, 2H, and 3H) to produce a `dtq`.\n\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):** This molecule contains a proton that could give a `dtq` signal. However, like structure A, it does not have a proton environment that would lead to a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid):** Let's examine the structure: `COOH-CH₂(α)-CH(a)(Et)-CH(d)(Et)-CH₃(g)`.\n    *   The proton labeled **H(d)** on carbon-4 is adjacent to the proton **H(a)** on carbon-3 (1H, creating a doublet), the **CH₂** of its ethyl group (2H, creating a triplet), and the terminal **CH₃** group (3H, creating a quartet). This combination of neighbors (1H, 2H, 3H) makes **H(d)** a perfect candidate for the **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)** signal.\n    *   The proton labeled **H(a)** on carbon-3 is adjacent to the proton **H(d)** on carbon-4 (1H, creating a doublet), the **CH₂(α)** group (2H, creating a triplet), and the **CH₂** of its own ethyl group (2H, creating another triplet). This set of neighbors (1H, 2H, 2H) makes **H(a)** a candidate for the **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)** signal.\n\nOnly structure B contains protons in environments that can account for both of the complex splitting patterns observed in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
