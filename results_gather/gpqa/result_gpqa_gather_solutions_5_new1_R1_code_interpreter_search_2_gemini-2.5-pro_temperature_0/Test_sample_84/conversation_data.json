Understand the Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates away. For a planet in a circular orbit, this is given by the formula:\n\n$T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $T_{eff}$ is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   $R_*$ is the radius of the star.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   $A$ is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\n**2. Set up the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 ($T_{eq,1}$) and Planet2 ($T_{eq,2}$):\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_1}} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a_2}} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nThe problem states that the star's properties ($T_{eff}$, $R_*$) are the same for both planets, and the planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, these terms cancel out:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n**3. Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity Data**\n\nThe semi-major axis ($a$) can be determined from the radial velocity (RV) data. The semi-amplitude of the RV curve ($K$) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $M_p$ is the planet's mass.\n*   $M_*$ is the star's mass.\n*   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n*   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit.\n\nSince the planets were detected using the transit method, their orbits must be nearly edge-on to our line of sight, meaning the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The formula simplifies to:\n\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_*}{a}}$\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n\n$K^2 = \\left(\\frac{M_p}{M_*}\\right)^2 \\frac{G M_*}{a} = \\frac{G M_p^2}{a M_*}$\n$a = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\n\nNow we can find the ratio $a_2/a_1$:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)}$\n\nThe terms $G$ and $M_*$ cancel out:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**5. Substitute the Given Values**\n\n*   **Ratio of Masses:**\n    $M_{p1} = 7 M_{Earth}$\n    $M_{p2} = 5 M_{Earth}$\n    $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n*   **Ratio of RV Semi-Amplitudes (K):**\n    The RV semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ ($K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$). Therefore, the ratio of the K values is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts.\n    $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n    $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nNow, substitute these ratios back into the equation for $a_2/a_1$:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio**\n\nFinally, substitute the ratio of the semi-major axes back into the temperature ratio equation:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}}$\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we can follow a step-by-step calculation based on the provided data and fundamental principles of astrophysics.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its host star and its orbital distance. The formula for equilibrium temperature is proportional to the inverse square root of the semi-major axis of its orbit (a), represented as T_eq ∝ 1/√a. All other factors, such as the star's temperature and radius, and the planets' albedos (which are stated to be the same), cancel out when taking the ratio.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets is:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\nThe semi-major axis (a) is not given directly, but it can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV method measures the \"wobble\" of a star caused by an orbiting planet's gravitational pull. This wobble induces a Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines.\n\nThe key steps are as follows:\n\n1.  **Relate Doppler Shift to Radial Velocity:** The observed Doppler shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity amplitude (K).\n    K = c * (Δλ / λ₀), where 'c' is the speed of light and λ₀ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity amplitude (K) is related to the planet's mass (M_p) and the semi-major axis (a) by the formula:\n    K ∝ M_p / √a\n\n3.  **Derive the Semi-Major Axis Ratio:** By rearranging the formula, we find that the semi-major axis is proportional to the square of the planet's mass divided by the square of the radial velocity amplitude:\n    a ∝ (M_p / K)²\n\n    From this, we can establish the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n4.  **Substitute Doppler Shift for Radial Velocity:** Since K is proportional to Δλ, the ratio K₁/K₂ is equal to the ratio Δλ₁/Δλ₂.\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²\n\n5.  **Calculate the Temperature Ratio:** Substituting this back into the temperature ratio equation:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √[(M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²]\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n*   Mass of Planet1 (M_p₁) = 7 M_earth\n*   Mass of Planet2 (M_p₂) = 5 M_earth\n*   Doppler shift for Planet1 (Δλ₁) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet2 (Δλ₂) = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio:** The equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet is given by the formula `T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2*a)) * (1 - Albedo)^(1/4)`, where `T_star` and `R_star` are the star's temperature and radius, `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and `Albedo` is the planet's albedo. When we take the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 and Planet2 (`T_eq1 / T_eq2`), the terms for the star's properties and the albedo (which is the same for both planets) cancel out, leaving us with: `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`.\n\n2.  **Relating Doppler Shift to Orbital Parameters:** The maximum Doppler shift (`Δλ`) is proportional to the star's maximum radial velocity (`K`), given by `K = c * Δλ / λ_0`. Therefore, the ratio of the radial velocities is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts: `K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2`.\n\n3.  **Finding the Semi-Major Axis Ratio:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` is related to the planet's mass (`M_p`) and semi-major axis (`a`) by the formula `K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`. (We assume an inclination `i` of 90 degrees, so `sin(i) ≈ 1`, which is a reasonable assumption since the planets were detected via the transit method).\n    By rearranging this formula to solve for `a`, we find that `a` is proportional to `(M_p / K)^2`.\n    Therefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes is `a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / K2)^2 / (M_p1 / K1)^2`, which simplifies to `a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:** By substituting `K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2` into the equation from step 3, we get `a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2`.\n    Now, we substitute this into the temperature ratio equation from step 1:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2)`\n    This simplifies to the final formula: `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)`.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation:** The Python code will define the given masses and Doppler shifts, calculate the ratios, and then compute the final temperature ratio using the derived formula.\n\n```python\n# Define the given values for the planets\n# Mass of Planet 1 in Earth masses\nM_p1 = 7.0\n# Mass of Planet 2 in Earth masses\nM_p2 = 5.0\n# Doppler shift induced by Planet 1 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda_1 = 0.03\n# Doppler shift induced by Planet 2 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda_2 = 0.04\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) can be derived as:\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2)\n# This is because T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a) and a is proportional to (M_p / K)^2,\n# where K (radial velocity) is proportional to delta_lambda.\n\n# Calculate the mass ratio (M_p2 / M_p1)\nmass_ratio = M_p2 / M_p1\n\n# Calculate the Doppler shift ratio (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2)\nshift_ratio = delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2\n\n# Calculate the final equilibrium temperature ratio\ntemp_ratio = mass_ratio * shift_ratio\n\n# Print the final calculated ratio and the choices\nprint(f\"The calculated ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (Planet1/Planet2) is: {temp_ratio:.4f}\")\nprint(\"\\nWhich of the following options is the closest?\")\nprint(f\"A) ~ 0.98\")\nprint(f\"B) ~ 1.30\")\nprint(f\"C) ~ 1.05\")\nprint(f\"D) ~ 0.53\")\n```\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The calculated ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (Planet1/Planet2) is: 0.5357\n\nWhich of the following options is the closest?\nA) ~ 0.98\nB) ~ 1.30\nC) ~ 1.05\nD) ~ 0.53\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and Identify Key Formulas\nThe primary goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\nThe formula for the equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\nwhere:\n*   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   A is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n*   R_star is the radius of the star.\n*   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nThe problem requires us to find the semi-major axis 'a' for each planet. This can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) data. The maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) is related to the star's radial velocity amplitude (K) by:\nK = c * (Δλ / λ_0)\nwhere:\n*   c is the speed of light.\n*   λ_0 is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity amplitude (K) is given by:\nK ≈ (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * v_p\nwhere v_p is the planet's orbital velocity, v_p = sqrt(G * M_star / a).\nCombining these gives:\nK ≈ (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = (M_p * sin(i) * sqrt(G)) / (sqrt(M_star) * sqrt(a))\n\n### Step 2: List Careful Points and Assumptions\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio:** Since both planets orbit the same star (same T_star and R_star) and have the same albedo (A), these terms will cancel out when we take the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures.\n*   **Orbital Inclination (i):** The problem states that the planets were detected using *both* the transit and RV methods. A transit can only be observed if the orbit is nearly edge-on to our line of sight (inclination i ≈ 90°). Therefore, it is a safe assumption that sin(i) ≈ 1 for both planets.\n*   **Planet Mass vs. Star Mass:** The masses of the planets (7 and 5 Earth masses) are negligible compared to the star's mass (1.5 Solar masses). This justifies the approximations used in the RV formulas.\n*   **Unnecessary Information:** The absolute values of the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii, are not needed to calculate the final ratio. They are provided for context but will cancel out in the derivation.\n\n### Step 3: Derive the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures\n1.  **Formulate the temperature ratio:**\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1-A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2*a1))] / [T_star * (1-A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2*a2))]\n    Simplifying this by canceling common terms gives:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\n2.  **Relate the semi-major axis 'a' to the given parameters:**\n    From the RV amplitude formula, K ≈ (M_p * sqrt(G)) / (sqrt(M_star) * sqrt(a)) (assuming sin(i)=1).\n    Let's rearrange to solve for 'a':\n    sqrt(a) ≈ (M_p * sqrt(G)) / (K * sqrt(M_star))\n    a ≈ G * M_p^2 / (K^2 * M_star)\n\n3.  **Calculate the ratio a2 / a1:**\n    a2 / a1 = [G * M_p2^2 / (K2^2 * M_star)] / [G * M_p1^2 / (K1^2 * M_star)]\n    The terms G and M_star cancel out:\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) * (K1^2 / M_p1^2) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n\n4.  **Relate the RV amplitude ratio (K1/K2) to the Doppler shift ratio (Δλ1/Δλ2):**\n    K1 = c * (Δλ1 / λ_0)\n    K2 = c * (Δλ2 / λ_0)\n    K1 / K2 = (c * Δλ1 / λ_0) / (c * Δλ2 / λ_0) = Δλ1 / Δλ2\n\n5.  **Substitute this back into the expression for a2 / a1:**\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2\n\n6.  **Finally, substitute this into the temperature ratio expression:**\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2 )\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n*   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n*   Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe final calculation from the Python script gives the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures as approximately 0.5357.\n\nLet's review the steps:\n1.  The ratio of equilibrium temperatures, assuming the same star and same albedo, simplifies to $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$.\n2.  The ratio of the semi-major axes was derived from the radial velocity formula as $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$.\n3.  The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes ($K$) is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$).\n4.

Calculating the final temperature ratio:\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.536 matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we can follow a step-by-step calculation based on the principles of planetary science.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its host star and the energy it radiates back into space. The formula for the equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2a))\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   R_star is the radius of the star.\n*   A is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n*   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 (T_eq1) and Planet2 (T_eq2), we can set up the following equation:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2a₂))]\n\nAccording to the problem description, both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are constant. It is also stated that both planets have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\nThis means the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\nThe next step is to determine the semi-major axes. The problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method. For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is related to the planet's mass (M_p) and its semi-major axis (a) by the formula:\n\nK ≈ M_p * √(G / (M_star * a))\n\nHere, G is the gravitational constant and M_star is the mass of the star. We can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis 'a':\n\na ≈ G * M_p² / (M_star * K²)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\n\na₂ / a₁ = [G * M_p2² / (M_star * K₂²)] / [G * M_p1² / (M_star * K₁²)]\n\nThe terms G and M_star cancel out, leaving:\n\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ), as K = c * (Δλ / λ), where c is the speed of light and λ is the rest wavelength. Therefore, the ratio of the RV amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   Mass of Planet1 (M_p1) = 7 M_earth\n*   Mass of Planet2 (M_p2) = 5 M_earth\n*   Doppler shift for Planet1 (Δλ₁) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet2 (Δλ₂) = 0.04 Å\n\nFirst, we calculate the ratios:\n*   M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n*   K₁ / K₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nNext, we substitute these ratios into the equation for a₂ / a₁:\n\na₂ / a₁ = (5/7)² * (3/4)² = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784\n\nFinally, we calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁) = √(225 / 784) = 15 / 28\n\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives:\n\n15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures.\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\nWe want to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2*a₁))^(1/2) * (1 - A₁)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2*a₂))^(1/2) * (1 - A₂)^(1/4)]\n\nGiven that T_star, R_star, and the albedo (A₁ = A₂) are the same for both planets, these terms cancel out:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (1/a₁)^(1/2) / (1/a₂)^(1/2)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a₂ / a₁)^(1/2)\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we first need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a₂ / a₁).\n\n### 2. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the planet's mass (M_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the semi-major axis (a) by:\n\nK = (M_p / M_star) * v_p\n\nWhere v_p is the planet's orbital velocity, given by v_p = (G * M_star / a)^(1/2). The problem states the planets are detected by the transit method, which implies an orbital inclination `i` ≈ 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1.\n\nSubstituting v_p into the equation for K:\n\nK = (M_p / M_star) * (G * M_star / a)^(1/2)\nK = (M_p * G^(1/2)) / (M_star^(1/2) * a^(1/2))\n\nNow, we solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\n\nK² = (M_p² * G) / (M_star * a)\na = (G * M_p²) / (K² * M_star)\n\n### 3. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\n\nNow we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\n\na₂ / a₁ = [(G * M_p₂²) / (K₂² * M_star)] / [(G * M_p₁²) / (K₁² * M_star)]\n\nThe gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) cancel out:\n\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) / (M_p₁² / K₁²)\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n### 4. Plugging in the Values\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ), since K = c * (Δλ / λ₀). Therefore, the ratio K₁ / K₂ is equal to the ratio Δλ₁ / Δλ₂.\n\nGiven values:\n*   M_p₁ = 7 M_earth\n*   M_p₂ = 5 M_earth\n*   Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n\nNow, we calculate the ratios:\n*   M_p₂ / M_p₁ = 5 / 7\n*   K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nSubstitute these into the equation for a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\na₂ / a₁ = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na₂ / a₁ = 225 / 784\n\n### 5. Final Calculation of Temperature Ratio\n\nFinally, substitute the value of a₂ / a₁ back into the temperature ratio equation:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a₂ / a₁)^(1/2)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (225 / 784)^(1/2)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √225 / √784\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we can follow a step-by-step derivation using fundamental principles of exoplanet characterization.\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is the theoretical temperature it would have if it were a perfect blackbody heated only by its parent star. It is determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from the star and the energy radiated back into space. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * √(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n*   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n\n### 2. Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * √(R_star / (2 * a₁)) * (1 - A₁)^(1/4)] / [T_star * √(R_star / (2 * a₂)) * (1 - A₂)^(1/4)]\n\nGiven that both planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are constant. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (`A₁ = A₂`). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\n### 3. Relating Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters\nThe problem provides the Doppler shifts caused by the planets, which is information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The maximum radial velocity of the star induced by a planet (the semi-amplitude, K) is related to the planet's mass and orbit. For a circular orbit, and assuming the planet's mass (`M_p`) is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_star`), the formula is:\n\nK = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\n\nWhere `i` is the orbital inclination and `G` is the gravitational constant. Since the planets were detected by both transit and RV methods, we can assume the orbits are edge-on, meaning `i` ≈ 90° and `sin(i)` ≈ 1. The formula simplifies to:\n\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\n\n### 4. Deriving the Semi-Major Axis\nWe can rearrange the RV formula to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n\nK² ≈ (M_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a)\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n### 5. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\nNow we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁. The terms `G` and `M_star` are the same for both planets and will cancel out:\n\na₂ / a₁ = [(G * M_p₂²) / (M_star * K₂²)] / [(G * M_p₁²) / (M_star * K₁²)]\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p₁²)\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n### 6. Connecting Doppler Shift to Radial Velocity\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ`. The relationship is `K = c * (Δλ / λ₀)`, where `c` is the speed of light and `λ₀` is the rest wavelength. Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n### 7. Final Calculation\nSubstitute this back into the equation for `a₂ / a₁`:\n\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²\n\nNow, substitute this entire expression into the simplified temperature ratio equation:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √[(M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²]\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\nFinally, plug in the given values:\n*   M_p₁ = 7 M_earth\n*   M_p₂ = 5 M_earth\n*   Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet (T_eq) is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\nwhere T_star is the star's temperature, R_star is the star's radius, 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and A is the planet's albedo.\n\nWe want to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2. Since both planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are constant. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (A). Therefore, the formula for the ratio simplifies to:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [(1/a_1)^(1/2)] / [(1/a_2)^(1/2)] = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2)\n\nNow we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a_2 / a_1). We can use the information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\nK = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * (G * M_star / a)^(1/2)\nwhere M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, 'i' is the orbital inclination, and G is the gravitational constant.\n\nSince the planets were detected by the transit method, we can assume their orbits are edge-on, so the inclination i ≈ 90° and sin(i) ≈ 1. The formula simplifies to:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * (G * M_star / a)^(1/2)\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude (K) is related to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) by the formula:\nK = c * (Δλ / λ_0)\nwhere c is the speed of light and λ_0 is the rest wavelength of the spectral line. This means K is directly proportional to Δλ (K ∝ Δλ).\n\nLet's rearrange the simplified RV formula to solve for a^(1/2):\nK ∝ M_p / a^(1/2)\na^(1/2) ∝ M_p / K\nSince K ∝ Δλ, we have:\na^(1/2) ∝ M_p / Δλ\n\nNow we can write the ratio for the semi-major axes:\n(a_2 / a_1)^(1/2) = [a_2^(1/2)] / [a_1^(1/2)] = (M_p2 / Δλ_2) / (M_p1 / Δλ_1)\n(a_2 / a_1)^(1/2) = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)\n\nWe already established that T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2). Therefore:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n*   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n*   Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n    *   A is the planet's Bond albedo.\n    *   R_star is the radius of the star.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2. Let's write out the expressions for each planet:\n    T_eq1 = T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))\n    T_eq2 = T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\n\n    Now, we divide the first equation by the second. The problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are the same) and have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, these terms cancel out:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (R_star / (2 * a1)) * ((2 * a2) / R_star) )\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\n    This is a key simplification. The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n4.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data:** The semi-major axes (`a`) are not given directly. However, we have radial velocity (RV) data in the form of Doppler shifts (Δλ). We can use the formula for the RV amplitude (K) to find a relationship.\n\n5.  **Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):** The RV amplitude for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    K = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n    where:\n    *   M_p is the planet's mass.\n    *   M_star is the star's mass.\n    *   `i` is the orbital inclination (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n    The problem states that the planets were detected using the **transit method**. This is crucial because transits are only observable when the orbit is nearly edge-on to our line of sight, which means the inclination `i` is approximately 90°. For i ≈ 90°, sin(i) ≈ 1. The formula simplifies to:\n    K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\n6.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We need to rearrange the formula to express `a` in terms of the other variables.\n    K^2 = (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)\n    K^2 = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * a)\n    a = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1):** Now we can find the ratio `a2 / a1` by dividing the expression for a2 by the expression for a1.\n    a2 / a1 = [ (G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K2^2) ] / [ (G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K1^2) ]\n\n    The gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) cancel out:\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) * (K1^2 / M_p1^2)\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n\n8.  **Combine Ratios for the Final Formula:** Substitute the expression for `a2 / a1` back into our temperature ratio formula from step 3:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2 )\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K1 / K2)\n\n9.  **Calculate the Component Ratios from Given Data:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio (M_p2 / M_p1):**\n        M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n        M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n        M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n    *   **RV Amplitude Ratio (K1 / K2):** The RV amplitude K is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift Δλ (since K = c * Δλ / λ_0). Therefore, the ratio of the amplitudes is the same as the ratio of the shifts.\n        Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n        Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n        K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n10. **Final Calculation:** Substitute these ratios into the formula from step 8.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n    To find the numerical value, we can use a simple calculation.\n```python\n# Calculate the final ratio of the equilibrium temperatures\nratio = 15 / 28\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536.

The problem states that they have the same albedo (`A1 = A2`). Therefore, most terms cancel out, leaving:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (1/a1)^(1/4) / (1/a2)^(1/4)` -> This is incorrect. The exponent is 1/2.\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (1/a1)^(1/2) / (1/a2)^(1/2) = (a2 / a1)^(1/2)`\n\n3.  **Radial Velocity (RV) and Doppler Shift:** The maximum radial velocity of the star (the semi-amplitude, K) is related to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) by:\n    `K = c * (Δλ / λ_0)`\n    where `c` is the speed of light and `λ_0` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n    The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes for the two planets is:\n    `K1 / K2 = (c * Δλ1 / λ_0) / (c * Δλ2 / λ_0) = Δλ1 / Δλ2`\n    `K1 / K2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4`\n\n4.  **Relating RV to Orbital Parameters:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude (K) is given by:\n    `K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * v_p`\n    where `M_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, and `v_p` is the planet's orbital velocity. The planet's orbital velocity is `v_p = (G * M_star / a)^(1/2)`.\n    Substituting `v_p` into the equation for K:\n    `K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * (G * M_star / a)^(1/2) = (M_p * G^(1/2)) / (M_star^(1/2) * a^(1/2))`\n    *Note: This assumes the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass and that the orbital inclination is ~90° (sin(i)≈1), which is a valid assumption for a transiting planet.*\n\n5.  **Solving for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We can rearrange the formula to solve for `a`:\n    `a^(1/2) ≈ (M_p * G^(1/2)) / (K * M_star^(1/2))`\n    `a ≈ (M_p^2 * G) / (K^2 * M_star)`\n\n6.  **Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1):**\n    `a2 / a1 = [(M_p2^2 * G) / (K2^2 * M_star)] / [(M_p1^2 * G) / (K1^2 * M_star)]`\n    The terms `G` and `M_star` cancel out:\n    `a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) * (K1^2 / M_p1^2) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`\n\n7.  **Substituting the Known Ratios:**\n    *   Mass ratio: `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 M_earth / 7 M_earth = 5 / 7`\n    *   RV ratio: `K1 / K2 = 3 / 4`\n    Now, substitute these into the equation for `a2 / a1`:\n    `a2 / a1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16) = 225 / 784`\n\n8.  **Final Calculation of Temperature Ratio:**\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2) = (225 / 784)^(1/2)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n**1.

Relating Doppler Shift to Radial Velocity**\n\nThe Doppler shift (Δλ) in the star's spectral lines is caused by the star's motion (radial velocity, v_r) induced by the orbiting planet. The relationship is:\n\nv_r = c * (Δλ / λ₀)\n\nWhere `c` is the speed of light and λ₀ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line. The maximum radial velocity, or semi-amplitude (K), corresponds to the maximum observed Doppler shift.

The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2a))\n\nwhere:\n*   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   A is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n*   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n**2. Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A_p1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2*a_1))] / [T_star * (1 - A_p2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2*a_2))]\n\nThe problem states that the planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are the same) and have the same albedo (A_p1 = A_p2). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we first need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n**3. Relating Doppler Shift to Semi-Major Axis**\n\nThe periodic Doppler shift (Δλ) in the star's spectrum is caused by the star's \"wobble\" as the planet orbits it. This allows us to determine the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K_star).\n\nThe relationship between the maximum Doppler shift and the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:\n\nK_star = c * (Δλ / λ_0)\n\nwhere `c` is the speed of light and λ_0 is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nThe ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes for the two planets is:\n\nK_star1 / K_star2 = (c * Δλ_1 / λ_0) / (c * Δλ_2 / λ_0) = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2\nK_star1 / K_star2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K_star) is related to the planet's mass (M_p) and the semi-major axis (a). Since the planets were detected by the transit method, we can assume their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on (inclination i ≈ 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1). The formula is:\n\nK_star ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant and M_star is the mass of the star.\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K_star²)\n\n**4. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\n\nNow we can find the ratio a_2 / a_1:\n\na_2 / a_1 = [(G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K_star2²)] / [(G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K_star1²)]\n\nThe terms G and M_star cancel out:\n\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2² / K_star2²) / (M_p1² / K_star1²)\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K_star1 / K_star2)²\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n*   M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n*   Ratio K_star1 / K_star2 = 3/4\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation:\n\na_2 / a_1 = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\na_2 / a_1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na_2 / a_1 = 225 / 784\n\n**5.

Understand the Formula for Equilibrium Temperature**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet depends on the star's temperature ($T_*$), the star's radius ($R_*$), the planet's semi-major axis ($a$), and the planet's albedo ($A$). The formula is:\n\n$T_{eq} = T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A)^{1/4}$\n\n**2. Set up the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n\nWe need to find the ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$. Let's write the expression for the ratio using the formula above:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_1)^{1/4}}{T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1-A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nSeveral terms are common to both planets or given as equal:\n*   The star's temperature ($T_*$) and radius ($R_*$) are the same for both planets.\n*   The problem states that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$).\n\nCanceling these common terms, the equation simplifies to:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we first need to find the ratio of their semi-major axes ($a_2 / a_1$).\n\n**3. Relate Semi-major Axis to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude ($K_*$) of a star, induced by a planet in a circular orbit, can be expressed as:\n\n$K_* \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{GM_*}{a}}$\n\n(This assumes the planet's mass $M_p$ is much smaller than the star's mass $M_*$, and the inclination is close to 90°, which is a reasonable assumption since the planets were also detected via transit).\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n\n$a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K_*^2}$\n\n**4.

For two planets orbiting the same star, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures can be expressed in terms of their semi-major axes (`a`) and albedos (`A`). The formula for equilibrium temperature is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nWhere T_star is the star's temperature and R_star is its radius.\n\nSince the problem states that both planets have the same albedo (A1 = A2) and orbit the same star (T_star and R_star are constant), the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 simplifies to:\n\n**T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)**\n\nOur goal is to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, a2 / a1.\n\n### Step 2: Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters\nThe problem provides the Doppler shift (Δλ) for each planet, which is used to determine the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K). The relationship between the observed Doppler shift and radial velocity is given by the Doppler formula. The maximum radial velocity (K) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ):\n\nK = c * (Δλ / λ₀)\n\nWhere `c` is the speed of light and λ₀ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line (6300 Å).\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the planet's mass (M_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the semi-major axis (`a`) by the following equation:\n\n**K = M_p * sqrt(G / (a * M_star))**\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes\nWe can rearrange the formula from Step 2 to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n\na = (G * M_p²) / (K² * M_star)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio a2 / a1:\n\na2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2²) / (K2² * M_star)] / [(G * M_p1²) / (K1² * M_star)]\n\nThe constants G and M_star cancel out, leaving:\n\n**a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²**\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Ratios of Masses and Radial Velocities\nFrom the problem statement:\n*   Mass of Planet 1 (M_p1) = 7 M_earth\n*   Mass of Planet 2 (M_p2) = 5 M_earth\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 1 (Δλ_1) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 2 (Δλ_2) = 0.04 Å\n\nThe ratio of the masses is:\nM_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\nSince K is directly proportional to Δλ, the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes is:\nK1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio\nSubstitute the results from Step 3 and Step 4 into the equation from Step 1:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)² )\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K1 / K2)\n\nNow, plug in the numerical ratios:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n**T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357**\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula `T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`, where `T_star` is the star's effective temperature, `A` is the planet's albedo, `R_star` is the star's radius, and `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. To find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (`T_eq1 / T_eq2`), we can divide their respective formulas. Since the star's properties (`T_star`, `R_star`) and the albedo (`A`) are the same for both planets, these terms cancel out, leaving the simplified relation:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`.\n\n2.  **Semi-Major Axis from Radial Velocity:** The semi-major axis (`a`) is not directly given, but we can determine it from the radial velocity (RV) data. The maximum RV shift of the star, known as the RV semi-amplitude `K`, is related to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ` by `K = c * Δλ / λ0`. For a planet in a circular orbit detected by both transit and RV methods (implying an edge-on view, so `sin(i) ≈ 1`), the RV semi-amplitude is also given by:\n    `K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`, where `M_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, and `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Derive the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** We can rearrange the formula for `K` to solve for `a`:\n    `a ≈ (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)`.\n    Now we can find the ratio `a2 / a1`:\n    `a2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K1^2)]`\n    The constants `G` and `M_star` cancel out, leaving:\n    `a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`.\n\n4.  **Substitute Doppler Shifts:** The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes `K1 / K2` is equal to the ratio of their corresponding Doppler shifts `Δλ1 / Δλ2`. Substituting this into the equation for `a2 / a1` gives:\n    `a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2`.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the expression for `a2 / a1` back into the temperature ratio formula from Step 1:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2 )`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)`.\n    We will now use Python to plug in the given values and compute the final ratio.\n\n```python\n# Given values for the planets\n# Mass of Planet1 in Earth masses\nM_p1 = 7.0\n# Mass of Planet2 in Earth masses\nM_p2 = 5.0\n\n# Doppler shift induced by Planet1 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03\n# Doppler shift induced by Planet2 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the planet masses (M_p2 / M_p1)\nmass_ratio = M_p2 / M_p1\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the Doppler shifts (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\nlambda_ratio = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is the product of the mass ratio and the lambda ratio\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\ntemp_ratio = mass_ratio * lambda_ratio\n\n# Print the result and the available choices\nprint(f\"The calculated ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) is: {temp_ratio:.2f}\")\nprint(\"The choices are:\")\nprint(\"A) ~ 1.05\")\nprint(\"B) ~ 0.53\")\nprint(\"C) ~ 1.30\")\nprint(\"D) ~ 0.98\")\n```\n<<<B>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The calculated ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) is: 0.54\nThe choices are:\nA) ~ 1.05\nB) ~ 0.53\nC) ~ 1.30\nD) ~ 0.98\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet1 to that of Planet2, which can be written as `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n\n**2. The Formula for Equilibrium Temperature**\nThe equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet orbiting a star is determined by the energy it receives from the star and its own properties. The formula is:\n`T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\nwhere:\n*   `T_star` is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (which is the orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n*   `A` is the planet's Bond albedo (the fraction of power reflected).\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio of Temperatures**\nWe need to calculate the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`. Let's write out the full expression for the ratio:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]`\n\n*   **Careful Point:** We must identify which terms are constant for both planets and will cancel out.\n*   The star is the same for both planets, so `T_star` and `R_star` are constant.\n*   The problem states that both planets have the same albedo, so `A_1 = A_2`.\n*   The factor of `2` is a constant.\n\nAfter canceling these terms, the formula simplifies significantly:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a_1) / sqrt(1 / a_2)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)`\n\nThis means the problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the orbital distances, `a_2 / a_1`.\n\n**4. Relate Orbital Distance to Observational Data**\nThe problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method: the maximum Doppler shifts (`Δλ`) caused by each planet. This information can be used to find the semi-major axis `a`.\n\n**5. From Doppler Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K)**\nThe maximum Doppler shift `Δλ_max` is related to the star's maximum radial velocity `K` (the amplitude of the RV curve) by the non-relativistic Doppler formula:\n`K / c = Δλ_max / λ_0`  =>  `K = c * (Δλ_max / λ_0)`\nwhere `c` is the speed of light and `λ_0` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nLet's find the ratio of the RV amplitudes `K_1 / K_2`:\n`K_1 / K_2 = [c * (Δλ_1 / λ_0)] / [c * (Δλ_2 / λ_0)]`\nThe terms `c` and `λ_0` cancel out.\n`K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4`\n\n**6. From Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Distance (a)**\nThe RV amplitude `K` induced by a planet of mass `m_p` on a star of mass `M_star` in a circular orbit is given by:\n`K = (m_p / M_star) * v_orb * sin(i)`\nwhere `v_orb` is the planet's orbital velocity and `i` is the inclination of the orbit.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The problem states that the planets were also detected by the transit method. This implies that the orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, so the inclination `i ≈ 90°` and `sin(i) ≈ 1`. We can assume this for both planets.\n\nThe planet's orbital velocity is given by Kepler's laws:\n`v_orb = sqrt(G * (M_star + m_p) / a)`\nSince the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (`m_p << M_star`), we can approximate this as:\n`v_orb ≈ sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\n\nSubstituting this into the formula for `K`:\n`K ≈ (m_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = (m_p / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a)`\n\n**7. Derive the Ratio of Orbital Distances (a_2 / a_1)**\nFrom the relationship `K ∝ m_p / sqrt(a)`, we can solve for `sqrt(a)`:\n`sqrt(a) ∝ m_p / K`\nSquaring both sides gives the relationship for `a`:\n`a ∝ (m_p / K)^2`\n\nNow we can write the ratio `a_2 / a_1`:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (m_p2 / K_2)^2 / (m_p1 / K_1)^2 = (m_p2 / m_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2`\n\n**8. Calculate the Numerical Value of the Ratios**\nWe have the following information from the problem:\n*   `m_p1 = 7 M_earth`\n*   `m_p2 = 5 M_earth`\n*   The ratio of RV amplitudes `K_1 / K_2 = 3/4` (from step 5).\n\nNow, let's calculate the required ratios:\n*   `m_p2 / m_p1 = 5 / 7`\n*   `K_1 / K_2 = 3 / 4`\n\nSubstitute these into the expression for `a_2 / a_1`:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16) = 225 / 784`\n\n**9. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio**\nNow we return to the simplified temperature ratio formula from step 3:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)`\n\nSubstitute the value we just found for `a_2 / a_1`:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)`\n\n*   **Careful Point:** These numbers are perfect squares. `sqrt(225) = 15` and `sqrt(784) = 28`.\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n\nFinally, compute the decimal value:\n`15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\n**10. Compare with Options**\nThe calculated value `~0.536` is closest to option D. The extra information given in the problem (star's mass, radius, temperature, and planets' radii) was not needed for the final ratio calculation, which is common in such physics problems.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere $T_*$ is the star's effective temperature, $R_*$ is the star's radius, $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 and Planet2, $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}}$. Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_*$ and $R_*$ are constant) and have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$), these terms will cancel out in the ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\nThe problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method. For a planet in a circular orbit detected via the RV method, the amplitude of the star's velocity variation ($K_*$) is given by:\n$K_* = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G(M_* + M_p)}{a}}$\nSince the planets are much less massive than the star ($M_p \\ll M_*$), we can approximate $M_* + M_p \\approx M_*$. Also, since the planets were also detected by the transit method, their orbital inclination $i$ is close to 90°, so $\\sin i \\approx 1$. The formula simplifies to:\n$K_* \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{GM_*}{a}} = \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{M_*}}$\n\nThe radial velocity amplitude $K_*$ is related to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$ by the formula $K_* = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$, where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength. This means $K_* \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n\nFrom the simplified formula for $K_*$, we can express $\\sqrt{a}$ in terms of the other parameters:\n$\\sqrt{a} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{K_*} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}$\nNow we can write the ratio $\\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{a_2}}{\\sqrt{a_1}}$:\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{a_2}}{\\sqrt{a_1}} = \\frac{M_2 / \\Delta\\lambda_2}{M_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   $M_1 = 7 M_{Earth}$\n*   $M_2 = 5 M_{Earth}$\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nTo determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we can follow a step-by-step derivation based on the information provided.\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is the theoretical temperature it would have if it were a black body heated only by its parent star. It is determined by the star's effective temperature (T_star), the star's radius (R_star), and the planet's semi-major axis (a). The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * √(R_star / (2a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nwhere A is the planet's albedo.\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 (T_eq1) and Planet2 (T_eq2), we can set up the following equation:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * √(R_star / (2 * a1)) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * √(R_star / (2 * a2)) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are identical for both. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, these terms cancel out, and the formula simplifies to:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a2 / a1)\n\nThis shows that the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n### 2. Semi-Major Axis Ratio from Radial Velocity Data\n\nThe problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method, which can be used to determine the semi-major axes. The maximum periodic Doppler shift corresponds to the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) of the star. For a planet in a circular orbit, this is given by:\n\nK ≈ M_p * √(G / (M_star * a))\n\nHere, M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, G is the gravitational constant, and `a` is the semi-major axis. This formula is a good approximation when the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (M_p << M_star). The detection of the planets via the transit method implies that their orbital inclination is close to 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n\na ≈ (M_p² * G) / (K² * M_star)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a1):\n\na2 / a1 = [(M_p2² * G) / (K2² * M_star)] / [(M_p1² * G) / (K1² * M_star)]\n\nThe terms for the star's mass (M_star) and the gravitational constant (G) cancel out, leaving:\n\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n\n### 3. Calculating the Ratios\n\nFirst, we determine the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K1 / K2). The Doppler shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the radial velocity. Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is the same as the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts:\n\nK1 / K2 = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 0.75\n\nNext, we find the ratio of the planetary masses:\n\nM_p2 / M_p1 = 5 Earth masses / 7 Earth masses = 5/7\n\nNow we can calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n\na2 / a1 = (5/7)² * (0.75)² = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784\n\n### 4. Final Temperature Ratio Calculation\n\nFinally, we substitute the value of a2 / a1 back into the simplified equilibrium temperature ratio equation:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a2 / a1) = √(225 / 784)\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ 1.30\nB) ~ 0.53\nC) ~ 1.05\nD) ~ 0.98\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n**1. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates into space. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo (the fraction of light it reflects).\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe want to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same) and have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, most terms cancel out:\n\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt( (R_star / (2 * a1)) * (2 * a2 / R_star) )\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nThe problem now reduces to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets.\n\n**2. Relating Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters**\n\nThe periodic Doppler shift (Δλ) in the star's spectrum is caused by the star's motion as it's pulled by the orbiting planet. The magnitude of this shift is related to the star's maximum radial velocity (K) by:\n\nK = c * (Δλ / λ₀)\n\nwhere `c` is the speed of light and `λ₀` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's maximum radial velocity (K), assuming we are viewing the system edge-on (inclination i ≈ 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1), is given by:\n\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * v_p\n\nwhere `M_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, and `v_p` is the planet's orbital velocity. The planet's orbital velocity is `v_p = sqrt(G * M_star / a)`. Substituting this in gives:\n\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\nThe detection of the planets via the transit method confirms that the orbits are nearly edge-on, making the sin(i) ≈ 1 assumption valid.\n\n**3. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\n\nWe can rearrange the formula for K to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n\nK² ≈ M_p² * (G / (M_star * a))\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\nNow we can find the ratio a2 / a1:\n\n(a2 / a1) = [ (G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K2²) ] / [ (G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K1²) ]\n\nThe terms for the gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) cancel out:\n\n(a2 / a1) = (M_p2² / K2²) * (K1² / M_p1²)\n(a2 / a1) = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n\nThe ratio of the radial velocities (K1 / K2) is directly proportional to the ratio of their Doppler shifts (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂):\n\n(K1 / K2) = (c * Δλ₁ / λ₀) / (c * Δλ₂ / λ₀) = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4\n\nWe are given the planet masses: M_p1 = 7 M_earth and M_p2 = 5 M_earth.\n\n(M_p2 / M_p1) = 5 / 7\n\nNow, substitute these ratios back into the equation for a2 / a1:\n\n(a2 / a1) = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\n(a2 / a1) = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n(a2 / a1) = 225 / 784\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\nFinally, we substitute the ratio of the semi-major axes back into our temperature ratio equation:\n\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(225 / 784)\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = 15 / 28\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nTo determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we can follow a step-by-step derivation using the provided information.\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is the theoretical temperature it would have if it were a perfect blackbody heated only by its parent star. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n*   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2. Since both planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are identical for both. The problem states that we should assume both planets have the same albedo (`A1` = `A2`). Therefore, when we take the ratio, these terms cancel out:\n\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nThis shows that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures depends only on the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n### 2. Semi-Major Axis and Radial Velocity\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines, caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's maximum radial velocity (K) is related to the planet's mass (`M_p`), the star's mass (`M_star`), and the semi-major axis (`a`) by the following equation:\n\nK = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\nWhere `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nBy rearranging this formula to solve for the semi-major axis `a`, we get:\n\na = (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n### 3. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\n\nWe can now find the ratio `a2 / a1` using the formula from the previous step:\n\na2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K2²)] / [(G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K1²)]\n\nThe terms for the gravitational constant (`G`) and the star's mass (`M_star`) cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n\n### 4. Relating Radial Velocity to Doppler Shift\n\nThe observed Doppler shift (`Δλ`) is directly proportional to the radial velocity (`K`). The relationship is given by `K = c * (Δλ / λ₀)`, where `c` is the speed of light and `λ₀` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the radial velocities is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n\nK1 / K2 = (c * Δλ1 / λ₀) / (c * Δλ2 / λ₀) = Δλ1 / Δλ2\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\n\nSubstituting this result back into the equation for the ratio of the semi-major axes, we get:\n\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)²\n\nNow, we can find the final ratio for the equilibrium temperatures:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n*   Mass of Planet1 (M_p1) = 7 M_earth\n*   Mass of Planet2 (M_p2) = 5 M_earth\n*   Doppler shift for Planet1 (Δλ1) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet2 (Δλ2) = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:\n`T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n(Assuming a heat redistribution factor `f=2` for simplicity, though this factor cancels out in the ratio).\n\nWhere:\n- `T_star` is the effective temperature of the star.\n- `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n- `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n- `A` is the albedo of the planet.\n\nWe need to find the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]`\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are the same and cancel out. The problem states that both planets have the same albedo (`A1 = A2`), so the `(1 - A)` term also cancels out. The equation simplifies to:\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (1 / a1)^(1/2) / (1 / a2)^(1/2) = (a2 / a1)^(1/2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)`\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, `a2 / a1`. We can do this using the information from the radial velocity method.\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` of a star due to an orbiting planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n`K = (2 * pi * G / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3))`\nwhere `m_p` is the planet mass, `M_star` is the star mass, `P` is the orbital period, `G` is the gravitational constant, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\nFrom Kepler's Third Law: `P^2 = (4 * pi^2 / (G * M_star)) * a^3`.\nSolving for `a`: `a = (G * M_star * P^2 / (4 * pi^2))^(1/3)`\n\nLet's find a more direct relationship between `a` and the given quantities.\nThe star's maximum radial velocity `K_star` is related to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ` by:\n`K_star = c * (Δλ / λ₀)`\nwhere `c` is the speed of light and `λ₀` is the rest wavelength.\n\nFor a circular orbit, the star's velocity `K_star` (assuming `sin(i) = 1` as is common in these problems unless stated otherwise) is related to the planet's mass `m_p` and semi-major axis `a` by the conservation of momentum:\n`M_star * v_star = m_p * v_p`\n`M_star * K_star = m_p * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`  (since `v_p = sqrt(G*M_star/a)` for a low-mass planet)\n\nSolving for `K_star`:\n`K_star = (m_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = m_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))`\n\nNow, let's solve for `a`:\n`K_star^2 = m_p^2 * G / (M_star * a)`\n`a = (G * m_p^2) / (M_star * K_star^2)`\n\nNow we can form the ratio `a2 / a1`:\n`a2 / a1 = [ (G * m_p2^2) / (M_star * K_star2^2) ] / [ (G * m_p1^2) / (M_star * K_star1^2) ]`\n\nThe terms `G` and `M_star` cancel out:\n`a2 / a1 = (m_p2^2 / K_star2^2) * (K_star1^2 / m_p1^2) = (m_p2 / m_p1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2`\n\nThe ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes `K_star1 / K_star2` is equal to the ratio of their observed Doppler shifts `Δλ1 / Δλ2`:\n`K_star1 / K_star2 = (c * Δλ1 / λ₀) / (c * Δλ2 / λ₀) = Δλ1 / Δλ2`\n\nSo, `a2 / a1 = (m_p2 / m_p1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2`\n\nNow, let's plug in the given values:\n- `m_p1 = 7` Earth masses\n- `m_p2 = 5` Earth masses\n- `Δλ1 = 0.03 Å`\n- `Δλ2 = 0.04 Å`\n\n`m_p2 / m_p1 = 5 / 7`\n`Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4`\n\n`a2 / a1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16) = 225 / 784`\n\nFinally, we calculate the temperature ratio:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt(225 / 784) = 15 / 28`\n\n`15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 25:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 26:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Primary Goal:** The objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 to Planet 2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2a))\n    Where `T_star` is the star's temperature, `A` is the planet's albedo, `R_star` is the star's radius, and `a` is the planet's semi-major axis.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Temperature Ratio:** When we create the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2, the terms for the star (T_star, R_star) and the albedo (A, which is stated to be the same for both planets) cancel out:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(R_star / (2a₁)) / √(R_star / (2a₂))\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\n    This shows the temperature ratio depends only on the ratio of the planets' orbital distances.\n\n4.  **Recall the Radial Velocity (RV) Formula:** The RV semi-amplitude (K) induced by a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    K ∝ M_p / √a\n    Where M_p is the planet's mass.

Rearranging this for `a` shows that `a` is proportional to (m_p / K_star)².\n\nSo, the ratio of the semi-major axes is:\n\na2 / a1 = (m2 / K_star2)² / (m1 / K_star1)² = (m2/m1)² * (K_star1/K_star2)²\n\nNow we can substitute this back into the temperature ratio equation:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √[(m2/m1)² * (K_star1/K_star2)²]\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (m2 / m1) * (K_star1 / K_star2)\n\nThe ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K_star1 / K_star2) is equal to the ratio of the observed Doppler shifts (Δλ1 / Δλ2).\n\nWe are given:\n*   m1 = 7 M_earth\n*   m2 = 5 M_earth\n*   Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n\nNow, plug in the values:\n*   Mass ratio (m2 / m1) = 5 / 7\n*   Doppler shift ratio (K_star1 / K_star2) = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 28:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    `T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n    where `T_star` is the star's temperature, `R_star` is the star's radius, `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\n    We want to find the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2*a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2*a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]`\n\n    Since both planets orbit the same star (`T_star` and `R_star` are constant) and have the same albedo (`A1 = A2`), the formula simplifies to:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (1/a1)^(1/2) / (1/a2)^(1/2) = (a2 / a1)^(1/2)`\n\n2.  **Relating Doppler Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K)**\n    The maximum Doppler shift `Δλ` is related to the star's maximum radial velocity `K` (the semi-amplitude of the RV curve) by:\n    `K = c * (Δλ / λ)`\n    where `c` is the speed of light and `λ` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\n    The ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes for the two planets is:\n    `K1 / K2 = (c * Δλ1 / λ) / (c * Δλ2 / λ) = Δλ1 / Δλ2`\n    Given `Δλ1 = 0.03 Å` and `Δλ2 = 0.04 Å`:\n    `K1 / K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4`\n\n3.  **Relating Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters**\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` is given by:\n    `K = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * v_p`\n    where `M_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, `i` is the orbital inclination, and `v_p` is the planet's orbital velocity.\n    The planet's orbital velocity `v_p` is given by `sqrt(G * M_star / a)`.\n\n    Substituting `v_p` into the equation for `K`:\n    `K = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = (M_p * sin(i) / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G/a)`\n\n    Since both planets were detected by the transit method, we can assume their orbits are edge-on, meaning the inclination `i ≈ 90°` and `sin(i) ≈ 1`.\n    So, `K ≈ (M_p / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G/a)`.\n\n4.  **Finding the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1)**\n    From the formula above, we can see that `K` is proportional to `M_p / sqrt(a)`.\n    `K ∝ M_p / a^(1/2)`\n    Rearranging for `a`:\n    `a^(1/2) ∝ M_p / K`\n    `a ∝ (M_p / K)²`\n\n    Now we can find the ratio `a2 / a1`:\n    `a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / K2)² / (M_p1 / K1)² = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²`\n\n    We are given the masses `M_p1 = 7 M_earth` and `M_p2 = 5 M_earth`, so `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7`.\n    We previously calculated `K1 / K2 = 3 / 4`.\n\n    Substitute these values into the equation for `a2 / a1`:\n    `a2 / a1 = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)² = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16) = 225 / 784`\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**\n    Now, substitute the value of `a2 / a1` back into the temperature ratio equation:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2) = (225 / 784)^(1/2)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225) / sqrt(784) = 15 / 28`\n\n    Converting the fraction to a decimal:\n    `15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 29:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates.

Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is the temperature it would have if it were a perfect blackbody heated only by its star. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_eff_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_eff_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n*   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 (T_eq1) and Planet2 (T_eq2), we can set up the following equation:\n\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [T_eff_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_eff_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\nGiven that both planets orbit the same star, `T_eff_star` and `R_star` are constant. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n\n**(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)**\n\nThis shows that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n### 2. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity\n\nThe problem provides the Doppler shifts caused by each planet, which allows us to determine the star's radial velocity (RV) amplitude, K. The RV amplitude is related to the planet's mass (M_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the semi-major axis (a). For a circular orbit, this relationship is:\n\nK = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nWhere `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n\na = (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n### 3. Calculating the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes\n\nNow we can find the ratio `a₂ / a₁`:\n\n(a₂ / a₁) = [(G * M_p₂²) / (M_star * K₂²)] / [(G * M_p₁²) / (M_star * K₁²)]\n\nThe terms for the gravitational constant `G` and the star's mass `M_star` cancel out, leaving:\n\n**(a₂ / a₁) = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²**\n\nThe radial velocity amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift `Δλ` (K = c * Δλ / λ, where c and λ are constant). Therefore, the ratio `K₁ / K₂` is equal to the ratio `Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`.\n\n### 4.

The semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K_star) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\nK_star = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\nWhere:\n*   `M_p` is the mass of the planet.\n*   `M_star` is the mass of the star.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis.\n*(This formula assumes the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's and the orbit is viewed edge-on (sin(i) ≈ 1), which is a valid assumption for a transiting planet).*\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\n\na = G * M_p² / (M_star * K_star²)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio `a2 / a1`:\n\na2 / a1 = [G * M2² / (M_star * K_star2²)] / [G * M1² / (M_star * K_star1²)]\n\nThe terms `G` and `M_star` cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n\na2 / a1 = (M2 / M1)² * (K_star1 / K_star2)²\n\n**3. Calculate the Ratios of Mass and RV Semi-Amplitude**\n\n*   **Mass Ratio (M2 / M1):**\n    *   M1 = 7 M_earth\n    *   M2 = 5 M_earth\n    *   M2 / M1 = 5 / 7\n\n*   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio (K_star1 / K_star2):**\n    The semi-amplitude `K_star` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) it causes.\n    K_star = c * (Δλ / λ_0)\n    So, the ratio `K_star1 / K_star2` is equal to the ratio `Δλ1 / Δλ2`.\n    *   Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n    *   Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n    *   K_star1 / K_star2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\n\nNow, substitute the calculated ratios back into the equation for `a2 / a1`:\n\na2 / a1 = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\na2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n**5.

Therefore, most terms cancel out:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we need to determine the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n### 2. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity\n\nThe problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method, which measures the Doppler shift of the star's light caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * v_p\n\nwhere M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, and v_p is the planet's orbital velocity. The planet's orbital velocity is:\n\nv_p ≈ sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nSubstituting v_p into the equation for K:\n\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\nK ≈ (M_p / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a)\n\nNow, we solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\n\nsqrt(a) ≈ (M_p / (K * sqrt(M_star))) * sqrt(G)\na ≈ G/M_star * (M_p / K)²\n\n### 3. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\n\nWe can now find the ratio a2 / a1:\n\na2 / a1 = [G/M_star * (M_p2 / K2)²] / [G/M_star * (M_p1 / K1)²]\n\nThe terms G and M_star cancel out, leaving:\n\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / K2)² / (M_p1 / K1)²\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n\n### 4.

Therefore, the ratio K1 / K2 is equal to the ratio Δλ1 / Δλ2.\n\n-   Ratio of masses: M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n-   Ratio of radial velocity amplitudes: K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nNow, we substitute these ratios into the equation for a2 / a1:\n\na2 / a1 = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\na2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n### 5.

We are given the planet masses and the Doppler shifts they induce on the star. The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) of a star due to a planet in a circular orbit is related to the planet's mass (m_p) and orbital distance (a) by:\n    `K ∝ m_p / sqrt(a)`\n    This means `sqrt(a) ∝ m_p / K`, and therefore `a ∝ (m_p / K)^2`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Orbital Distance Ratio (a2 / a1):**\n    `a2 / a1 = (m2 / K2)^2 / (m1 / K1)^2 = (m2 / m1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`\n\n6.  **Relate Radial Velocity (K) to Doppler Shift (Δλ):** The Doppler shift formula is `Δλ / λ = v_r / c`. The maximum radial velocity is K, so `K = c * (Δλ / λ)`. The ratio of the radial velocities is therefore equal to the ratio of their Doppler shifts:\n    `K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2`\n\n7.  **Combine the Formulas:** Substitute the Doppler shift ratio back into the orbital distance ratio equation:\n    `a2 / a1 = (m2 / m1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2`\n    Now substitute this into our simplified temperature ratio formula:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((m2 / m1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (m2 / m1) * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)`\n\n8.  **Execute the Calculation:** Plug in the given values for the masses (`m1 = 7`, `m2 = 5`) and Doppler shifts (`Δλ1 = 0.03`, `Δλ2 = 0.04`) to find the final ratio.\n\n```python\n# Planetary and Doppler shift data\n# Mass of Planet1 in Earth masses\nm1 = 7.0\n# Mass of Planet2 in Earth masses\nm2 = 5.0\n\n# Doppler shift induced by Planet1 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03\n# Doppler shift induced by Planet2 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 can be derived as:\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n# And the orbital distance 'a' is related to planet mass 'm' and RV semi-amplitude 'K' by:\n# a is proportional to (m / K)^2\n# The RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to the Doppler shift delta_lambda.\n# So, T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(((m2/K2)^2) / ((m1/K1)^2))\n# This simplifies to T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (m2/m1) * (K1/K2) = (m2/m1) * (delta_lambda1/delta_lambda2)\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the masses (m2 / m1)\nmass_ratio = m2 / m1\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the Doppler shifts (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\ndoppler_ratio = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2\n\n# Calculate the final ratio of the equilibrium temperatures\ntemp_ratio = mass_ratio * doppler_ratio\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(f\"The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) is: {temp_ratio:.2f}\")\n\n# Print the options for comparison\nprint(\"A) ~ 0.53\")\nprint(\"B) ~ 0.98\")\nprint(\"C) ~ 1.30\")\nprint(\"D) ~ 1.05\")\n```\n<<<A>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) is: 0.54\nA) ~ 0.53\nB) ~ 0.98\nC) ~ 1.30\nD) ~ 1.05\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and Key Formulas\n\nThe main goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is:\nT_eq = T_eff_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\nWhere:\n*   T_eff_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   A is the planet's Bond albedo.\n*   R_star is the radius of the star.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWhen we take the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 and Planet2, many terms will cancel out.\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_eff_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_eff_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n\nWe are given that:\n*   The star's properties (T_eff_star, R_star) are the same for both planets.\n*   The albedos are the same (A1 = A2).\n\nTherefore, the formula simplifies to:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((R_star / (2 * a1)) * ((2 * a2) / R_star))\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nThe problem now reduces to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets, a2 / a1.\n\n### Step 2: Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observable Quantities\n\nWe can find the semi-major axis (`a`) by relating it to the information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV method measures the wobble of the star, and the maximum velocity of this wobble is the RV amplitude, K_star.\n\nThe Doppler shift formula gives us K_star:\nΔλ / λ_0 = v / c => K_star = c * (Δλ_max / λ_0)\nThis means K_star is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift, Δλ_max. So, K_star1 / K_star2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2.\n\nFor a circular orbit (as given) and assuming the planet's mass (M_p) is much smaller than the star's mass (M_star), the RV amplitude of the star can be related to the planet's orbital velocity (V_p) through conservation of momentum:\nM_star * K_star ≈ M_p * V_p\n\nThe orbital velocity of the planet is given by:\nV_p = sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nSubstituting V_p into the momentum equation:\nM_star * K_star ≈ M_p * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nSolving for K_star:\nK_star ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\nNow, we solve this equation for the semi-major axis `a`:\nK_star^2 = M_p^2 * (G / (M_star * a))\na = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K_star^2)\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1)\n\nUsing the formula for `a` derived above, we can find the ratio a2 / a1. The terms G and M_star are constant for both planets and will cancel out.\na ∝ M_p^2 / K_star^2\n\nSo, the ratio is:\na2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K_star2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K_star1^2)\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2\n\nNow, let's plug in the values from the problem:\n*   Ratio of planet masses: M_p2 / M_p1 = (5 M_earth) / (7 M_earth) = 5/7\n*   Ratio of RV amplitudes (which is the ratio of Doppler shifts): K_star1 / K_star2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4\n\nSubstitute these ratios into the equation for a2 / a1:\na2 / a1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2\na2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures\n\nNow we can use the result from Step 1 and the value from Step 3:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\n\nCalculate the square root:\nsqrt(225) = 15\nsqrt(784) = 28\nSo, T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a decimal:\n15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   The problem provides extra information (star's mass, radius, and temperature; planets' radii) that is not needed for calculating the *ratio* of the temperatures. This is a common feature in physics problems to test understanding of which variables are relevant.\n*   The assumption that the inclination angle `i` is ~90° (sin(i) ≈ 1) is justified because the planets were detected by the transit method, which requires an almost edge-on view.\n*   The assumption that M_p << M_star is valid and simplifies Kepler's Third Law and the momentum balance.\n*   The key simplification is that for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures, only the ratio of the semi-major axes matters, provided the star and planetary albedos are the same.\n\nThe final calculated ratio of ~0.53 matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A_p)^(1/4)\n    Where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   A_p is the planet's bond albedo.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We can write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for the two planets as:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A_p1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A_p2)^(1/4)]\n\n    Since both planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are the same. The problem states that both planets have the same albedo (A_p1 = A_p2). Therefore, most terms cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a1)^(-1/2) / (a2)^(-1/2) = (a2 / a1)^(1/2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\n4.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Given Parameters:** We need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a1). The problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the Doppler shift (Δλ), which relates to the star's RV semi-amplitude (K). For a planet in a circular orbit (and assuming the planet's mass M_p is much less than the star's mass M_star), the star's RV semi-amplitude is:\n    K = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * v_p\n    where v_p = sqrt(G * M_star / a) is the planet's orbital velocity.\n    Since the planets are detected by the transit method, their orbital inclination `i` is close to 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1.\n    Substituting v_p into the equation for K:\n    K = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = (M_p / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a)\n\n5.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We can rearrange the formula to solve for `a`:\n    K² = (M_p² / M_star) * (G / a)\n    a = (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1):** Now we can find the ratio a2 / a1. The gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) are the same for both planets and will cancel out:\n    a2 / a1 = [ (G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K2²) ] / [ (G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K1²) ]\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2² / K2²) * (K1² / M_p1²)\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n\n7.  **Calculate the Necessary Ratios:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio (M_p2 / M_p1):**\n        M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n        M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n        M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n    *   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio (K1 / K2):** The RV semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the Doppler shift Δλ (K = c * Δλ / λ). Therefore, the ratio K1 / K2 is equal to the ratio Δλ1 / Δλ2.\n        Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n        Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n        K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n8.  **Substitute Ratios to find a2 / a1:**\n    a2 / a1 = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\n    a2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    a2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nThe web search results confirm the key physical principles and formulas used in the initial reasoning.\n\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the star's properties (luminosity/temperature and radius) and the planet's semi-major axis and albedo. The formula derived in the thought process, `T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`, is standard. For a fixed star and the same albedo for both planets, the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2` simplifies to `sqrt(a2 / a1)`.\n*   **Doppler Shift and Radial Velocity:** The radial velocity (v_r) is directly proportional to the Doppler shift (Δλ) via the formula v_r = c * (Δλ / λ_0), where λ_0 is the rest wavelength. This confirms that the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K) is equal to the ratio of the observed Doppler shifts: `K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2`.\n*   **Radial Velocity Semi-amplitude (K):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the masses of the star (M_star) and planet (M_p), and the semi-major axis (a). The formula, assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's (`M_p << M_star`) and the orbit is viewed edge-on (`sin(i)≈1`), is `K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`. This is the same relationship used in the initial analysis.\n\nThe plan remains the same, as the physics and formulas have been verified.\n\n**1. Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1):**\nFrom the radial velocity formula `K ≈ (M_p / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a)`, we can solve for 'a':\n`a ≈ G * M_p^2 / (K^2 * M_star)`\nThe ratio of the semi-major axes is then:\n`a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K1^2) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`\n\n**2. Substitute the known values:**\n*   Mass ratio: `M_p2 / M_p1 = (5 M_earth) / (7 M_earth) = 5 / 7`\n*   Radial velocity ratio from Doppler shifts: `K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4`\n\nNow, calculate `a2 / a1`:\n`a2 / a1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2`\n`a2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)`\n`a2 / a1 = 225 / 784`\n\n**3. Calculate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2):**\nThe ratio is `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`.\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n\n**4. Final Calculation:**\n`15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.

Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star and its own properties. The formula is:\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n*   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 (T_eq1) and Planet2 (T_eq2), we can set up the following equation:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a₁))^(1/2) * (1 - A₁)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a₂))^(1/2) * (1 - A₂)^(1/4)]\n\nGiven that both planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are identical for both. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, most terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (1 / a₁)^(1/2) / (1 / a₂)^(1/2) = (a₂ / a₁)^(1/2)\n\nThe problem now is to determine the ratio of the semi-major axes (a₂ / a₁).\n\n### 2. Relating Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters\nThe periodic Doppler shift (Δλ) in the star's light is caused by its \"wobble\" as the planets orbit it. This shift is related to the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) by the formula:\nK = c * (Δλ / λ₀)\nwhere `c` is the speed of light and `λ₀` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * (G * M_star / a)^(1/2)\n\nWhere:\n*   `M_p` is the planet's mass.\n*   `M_star` is the star's mass.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\nWe can rearrange the formula for K to solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\na ≈ G * M_p² / (K² * M_star)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = [G * M_p₂² / (K₂² * M_star)] / [G * M_p₁² / (K₁² * M_star)]\n\nThe terms for `G` and `M_star` cancel out, leaving:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / M_p₁²) * (K₁² / K₂²) = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\nThe ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K₁ / K₂) can be found directly from the ratio of their Doppler shifts (Δλ):\nK₁ / K₂ = [c * (Δλ₁ / λ₀)] / [c * (Δλ₂ / λ₀)] = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n### 4. Plugging in the Values\nLet's substitute the given values into the equations:\n\n*   **Mass ratio (M_p₂ / M_p₁):**\n    M_p₂ / M_p₁ = (5 Earth masses) / (7 Earth masses) = 5 / 7\n\n*   **Doppler shift ratio (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂):**\n    Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4\n    Therefore, K₁ / K₂ = 3 / 4\n\n*   **Ratio of semi-major axes (a₂ / a₁):**\n    a₂ / a₁ = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)² = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16) = 225 / 784\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\nFinally, we can calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a₂ / a₁)^(1/2) = (225 / 784)^(1/2) = 15 / 28\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nThis problem requires us to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets.\n\n**1. Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\nwhere `T_star` is the star's temperature, `R_star` is the star's radius, `a` is the orbital semi-major axis, and `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\nTo find the ratio for Planet1 and Planet2, we have:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both.

Therefore, most terms cancel out, leaving:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (1 / a1)^(1/2) / (1 / a2)^(1/2) = (a2 / a1)^(1/2)\n\nOur goal is now to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, `a2 / a1`.\n\n**2. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit causing a radial velocity (RV) variation in its star, the RV semi-amplitude (K) is given by:\nK ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (a * M_star))\n(Assuming the planet's mass `M_p` is much less than the star's mass `M_star`).\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\nK² ≈ M_p² * G / (a * M_star)\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (K² * M_star)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio `a2 / a1`:\na2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2²) / (K₂² * M_star)] / [(G * M_p1²) / (K₁² * M_star)]\n\nThe gravitational constant `G` and the star's mass `M_star` cancel out:\na2 / a1 = (M_p2² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p1²)\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**3. Relate RV Amplitude to Doppler Shift**\n\nThe Doppler shift `Δλ` is directly proportional to the radial velocity `v`, and therefore the RV semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift.\nK = c * (Δλ / λ₀)\nSo, the ratio of the amplitudes `K₁ / K₂` is equal to the ratio of their observed maximum Doppler shifts `Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`.\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n**4. Combine and Calculate**\n\nSubstitute the Doppler shift ratio into the equation for `a2 / a1`:\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²\n\nNow, we can substitute this entire expression back into our temperature ratio formula from Step 1:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [ (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)² ]^(1/2)\n\nThe square root cancels the squares:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\n**5.

It also states that they have the same albedo, so $A_1 = A_2$. We can cancel these terms from the equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we first need to determine the ratio of the semi-major axes, $a_2 / a_1$. We can find this using the information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The semi-amplitude of the radial velocity ($K$) is related to the planet mass ($M_p$), star mass ($M_*$), and semi-major axis ($a$). For a circular orbit ($e=0$) and assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's ($M_p \\ll M_*$), the formula is:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{M_* a}} \\sqrt{G}$\nwhere $i$ is the orbital inclination. Since both planets were detected via the transit method, their orbits must be nearly edge-on, so we can assume $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The formula simplifies to:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{\\sqrt{M_* a}}$\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for $a$:\n$\\sqrt{a} \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{K \\sqrt{M_*}} \\implies a \\approx \\frac{M_p^2 G}{K^2 M_*}$\n\nNow we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p,2}^2 G / (K_2^2 M_*)}{M_{p,1}^2 G / (K_1^2 M_*)}$\nThe gravitational constant $G$ and the star's mass $M_*$ cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the observed Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ ($K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$).

The formula is:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    Where `T_star` is the star's temperature, `A` is the planet's albedo, `R_star` is the star's radius, and `a` is the planet's semi-major axis.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Temperature Ratio:** We can write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for the two planets as:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem provides several conditions that allow for simplification:\n    *   Both planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both and cancel out.\n    *   Both planets are stated to have the same albedo, so `A₁ = A₂`, and the `(1 - A)^(1/4)` term cancels out.\n    *   The constant `2` also cancels from the square root.\n    After simplification, the ratio becomes:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a₁) / sqrt(1 / a₂) = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n    This means the problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n5.  **Connect Observations to Physical Properties:** The problem provides Doppler shifts (`Δλ`) and planet masses (`M_p`). We need to relate these to the semi-major axis (`a`). The Doppler shift is caused by the star's radial velocity (`v_r`), which is induced by the orbiting planet. The maximum radial velocity is the semi-amplitude, K.\n    The formula relating `K` to the planet's properties, for a circular orbit and a planet much less massive than the star, is:\n    K ≈ (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n    where `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n6.  **Incorporate Transit Information:** The problem states the planets were detected by both transit and RV methods. A transit is only seen if the system is edge-on, meaning the inclination `i` ≈ 90°. For this inclination, `sin(i)` ≈ 1. The formula simplifies to:\n    K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = (M_p / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a)\n\n7.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We can rearrange the equation to solve for `a`:\n    K² ≈ (M_p² * G) / (M_star * a)\n    a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n8.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a₂/a₁):**\n    a₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\n    The constants `G` and `M_star` cancel out, leaving:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2² / K₂²) / (M_p1² / K₁²) = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n9.  **Relate RV Semi-Amplitude (K) to Doppler Shift (Δλ):** The Doppler formula states `Δλ / λ₀ = v_r / c`. The maximum shift `Δλ_max` corresponds to `K`.\n    Therefore, `K` is directly proportional to `Δλ_max`. The ratio of the semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts:\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n10. **Combine Ratios:** Substitute the result from step 9 into the equation from step 8:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²\n    Now substitute this back into our simplified temperature ratio from step 4:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁) = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)² )\n    Taking the square root gives the final, simple relationship:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\n11. **Final Calculation:** Plug the given values into this final formula.\n    *   M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n    *   M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n    *   Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n    *   Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n\n```python\n# Ratio of planet masses (M_p2 / M_p1)\nmass_ratio = 5.0 / 7.0\n\n# Ratio of Doppler shifts (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\nshift_ratio = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is the product of these two ratios.\nequilibrium_temp_ratio = mass_ratio * shift_ratio\n\nprint(equilibrium_temp_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation shows that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is approximately 0.536.

Given that the star's properties and the planets' albedos are the same, the ratio simplifies to:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a2 / a1)\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** The square of a planet's orbital period (*P*) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (*a*). This can be expressed as a² ∝ P^(2/3). Therefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes is:\n    a2 / a1 = (P2 / P1)^(2/3)\n\n3.  **Radial Velocity (RV) Amplitude (K):** The maximum radial velocity of the star induced by a planet is given by the Doppler shift in its spectral lines. The RV amplitude (*K*) is related to the planet's mass (M_p) and orbital period (*P*). For a circular orbit, the relationship is:\n    K ∝ M_p / P^(1/3)\n    Rearranging for the period gives: P ∝ (M_p / K)³\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1.  **Find the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes (K1 / K2):**\n    The radial velocity *K* is directly proportional to the observed Doppler shift (Δλ).\n    *   Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n    *   Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n    *   K1 / K2 = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n2.  **Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods (P2 / P1):**\n    Using the relationship P ∝ (M_p / K)³, we can find the ratio of the periods.\n    *   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n    *   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n    *   P2 / P1 = (M_p2 / K2)³ / (M_p1 / K1)³ = (M_p2 / M_p1)³ * (K1 / K2)³\n    *   P2 / P1 = (5 / 7)³ * (3 / 4)³ = (15 / 28)³\n\n3.  **Determine the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a1):**\n    Using Kepler's Third Law relationship, a2 / a1 = (P2 / P1)^(2/3).\n    *   a2 / a1 = [ (15 / 28)³ ]^(2/3) = (15 / 28)²\n\n4.  **Calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2):**\n    Finally, we use the equilibrium temperature ratio formula, T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a2 / a1).\n    *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √[ (15 / 28)² ] = 15 / 28\n    *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 44:\n### Calculation of the Temperature Ratio Between Two Exoplanets\n\n**To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet 1 and Planet 2, we can follow a step-by-step derivation based on fundamental principles of astrophysics. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is dependent on its star's temperature and the distance of the planet from that star. This distance, the semi-major axis, can be inferred from radial velocity measurements.**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is calculated by balancing the energy absorbed from its star with the energy it radiates away. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_eff * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nWhere:\n*   T_eff is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   A is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n*   R_star is the radius of the star.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 (T_eq1) and Planet 2 (T_eq2), we can divide their respective equations. Given that both planets orbit the same star (constant T_eff and R_star) and have the same albedo (A), these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\nThe next step is to determine the semi-major axes (`a_1` and `a_2`) using the provided radial velocity (RV) data. The maximum radial velocity (K) of a star, induced by an orbiting planet in a circular orbit, is given by:\n\nK ≈ sqrt(G / a) * (M_p / sqrt(M_star))\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M_p is the planet's mass, and M_star is the star's mass. The Doppler shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to this radial velocity (K = c * Δλ / λ_0). We can rearrange the formula to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n\na ∝ (M_p / K)^2\n\nSince K is proportional to the Doppler shift Δλ, we can write:\n\na ∝ (M_p / Δλ)^2\n\nNow, we can establish the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / Δλ_2)^2 / (M_p1 / Δλ_1)^2 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2\n\nUsing the given values:\n*   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n*   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n*   Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n\nWe can calculate the ratios:\n*   M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n*   Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for a_2 / a_1:\n\na_2 / a_1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2 = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784\n\nFinally, we can find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1) = sqrt(225 / 784) = 15 / 28\n\nCalculating the decimal value:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis result is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is the step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n### 1.

Here's a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy balance between the radiation it receives from its star and the energy it radiates back into space. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_eff * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2a))\n\nwhere:\n*   T_eff is the star's effective temperature.\n*   A is the planet's albedo.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet 1 and Planet 2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_eff * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2a₁))] / [T_eff * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2a₂))]\n\nAccording to the problem description, both planets orbit the same star (so T_eff and R_star are the same) and possess the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we first need to determine the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n### 2. Relating Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters\n\nThe problem provides the periodic Doppler shifts (Δλ) caused by each planet. The Doppler shift is related to the star's maximum radial velocity (the semi-amplitude, K) by the formula:\n\nΔλ / λ₀ = K / c\n\nwhere c is the speed of light and λ₀ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line (6300 Å). The ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes is therefore equal to the ratio of their Doppler shifts:\n\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass (M_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the semi-major axis (a) by the following approximation (assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass, and the orbit is viewed edge-on, which is a reasonable assumption for a transiting planet):\n\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nThis can be simplified to:\n\nK ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\n### 3. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\n\nWe can express the relationship for each planet:\n\nK₁ ≈ M_p1 * sqrt(G / (M_star * a₁))\nK₂ ≈ M_p2 * sqrt(G / (M_star * a₂))\n\nNow, let's find the ratio K₁ / K₂ from these expressions:\n\nK₁ / K₂ = [M_p1 * sqrt(G / (M_star * a₁))] / [M_p2 * sqrt(G / (M_star * a₂))]\nK₁ / K₂ = (M_p1 / M_p2) * sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n\nWe want to find sqrt(a₂ / a₁), which is our temperature ratio. We can rearrange the equation:\n\nsqrt(a₂ / a₁) = (K₁ / K₂) * (M_p2 / M_p1)\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\n\nNow, we substitute the known values into the equation:\n\n*   The ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes: K₁ / K₂ = 3/4\n*   The ratio of the planetary masses: M_p2 / M_p1 = (5 Earth masses) / (7 Earth masses) = 5/7\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁) = (3/4) * (5/7)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.53.

We must derive them from the provided radial velocity (RV) data.\n    *   The maximum radial velocity of the star (the RV semi-amplitude, K) is proportional to the Doppler shift (Δλ): K = c * (Δλ / λ₀). Therefore, the ratio K1/K2 is equal to the ratio Δλ1/Δλ2.\n    *   For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by: K = M_planet * sqrt(G / (a * M_star)).\n    *   By rearranging this formula for 'a', we get: a = G * M_planet² / (K² * M_star).\n    *   Now, we can find the ratio a2/a1:\n        a2 / a1 = [G * M_p2² / (K2² * M_star)] / [G * M_p1² / (K1² * M_star)]\n    *   The gravitational constant G and the star's mass M_star cancel out, leaving:\n        a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n    *   Since K1/K2 = Δλ1/Δλ2, the final expression for the semi-major axis ratio is:\n        a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)²\n\n6.  **Calculate and Conclude:** Substitute the given values for planet masses and Doppler shifts into the equation to find a2/a1, then take the square root to find the temperature ratio and match it to the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Data ---\n# Planet 1\nm_p1 = 7.0  # Earth masses\nd_lambda1 = 0.03  # Angstroms\n\n# Planet 2\nm_p2 = 5.0  # Earth masses\nd_lambda2 = 0.04  # Angstroms\n\n# --- Step-by-step Calculation ---\n\n# 1.

The formula is:\n    `T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\n    where:\n    *   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   `A` is the planet's bond albedo.\n\n3.  **Form the Ratio of Temperatures:** We can write the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2` as:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]`\n    The problem states that the star's properties (`T_star`, `R_star`) are the same for both planets and that the albedos are the same (`A_1 = A_2`). Therefore, these terms cancel out, leaving a simplified ratio:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)`\n\n4.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Given Data:** The semi-major axes (`a_1`, `a_2`) are not given directly. We must derive them from the radial velocity (RV) data.\n    The maximum Doppler shift (`Δλ_max`) is related to the star's radial velocity amplitude (`K`) by:\n    `K = c * (Δλ_max / λ_0)` where `c` is the speed of light and `λ_0` is the rest wavelength.\n    The radial velocity amplitude (`K`) for a star orbited by a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    `K = (M_p / M_star) * v_p * sin(i)` where `M_p` is planet mass, `M_star` is star mass, `v_p` is planet's orbital speed, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n    Since the planets are detected by both transit and RV methods, we can assume an edge-on orbit, so `sin(i) ≈ 1`.\n    The planet's orbital speed `v_p` is given by `v_p = sqrt(G * (M_star + M_p) / a)`. Since `M_p << M_star`, this simplifies to `v_p ≈ sqrt(G * M_star / a)`.\n    Substituting `v_p` into the equation for `K`:\n    `K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\n    Solving for the semi-major axis `a`:\n    `K^2 = (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a) = (M_p^2 * G) / (M_star * a)`\n    `a = (M_p^2 * G) / (M_star * K^2)`\n\n5.  **Form the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Now we can find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [(M_p2^2 * G) / (M_star * K_2^2)] / [(M_p1^2 * G) / (M_star * K_1^2)]`\n    The constants `G` and `M_star` cancel out:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_2^2) * (K_1^2 / M_p1^2) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2`\n    Since `K` is directly proportional to `Δλ_max`, we have `K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`. Substituting this in:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:** Substitute the expression for `a_2 / a_1` back into the temperature ratio equation from step 3:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2 )`\n    The square root and the squares cancel, leaving:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)`\n\n**Careful Points**\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides several pieces of information that are not needed to calculate the final ratio, such as the star's mass, radius, and temperature, and the planets' radii. This is a common feature in physics problems to test the understanding of the underlying principles.\n*   **Assumptions:** The solution relies on several justified assumptions:\n    *   Circular orbits (stated in the problem).\n    *   Same albedo for both planets (stated in the problem).\n    *   `sin(i) ≈ 1` (justified because transits are observed).\n    *   Planet mass is much smaller than the star mass (`M_p << M_star`), which is true for Earth-mass planets around a Sun-like star.\n*   **Proportionality:** The key is to recognize that the final ratio depends on the ratios of the input variables, allowing many constants and shared parameters to cancel out.\n\n**Final Calculation**\n\n1.  **Identify relevant values:**\n    *   Mass of Planet1 (`M_p1`) = 7 Earth masses\n    *   Mass of Planet2 (`M_p2`) = 5 Earth masses\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet1 (`Δλ_1`) = 0.03 Å\n    *   Doppler shift for Planet2 (`Δλ_2`) = 0.04 Å\n\n2.  **Calculate the mass ratio:**\n    `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Doppler shift ratio:**\n    `Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4`\n\n4.  **Multiply the ratios to get the final answer:**\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4) = 15 / 28`\n\n5.  **Convert the fraction to a decimal:**\n    `15 ÷ 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nComparing this result to the options provided, `~0.53` is the closest match.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 50:\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536.

This is confirmed by multiple sources. Therefore, the ratio of radial velocity semi-amplitudes `K1 / K2` is indeed equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts `Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature `T_eq` is proportional to `1 / sqrt(a)`, where `a` is the semi-major axis. This confirms that the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2` is equal to `sqrt(a2 / a1)`.\n\n3.  **Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude (K):** For a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0) and assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_p << M_star`), the semi-amplitude `K` is given by formulas that simplify to `K` being proportional to `M_p / sqrt(a)`.\n    Source provides the relevant formulas for a circular orbit:\n    *   `v_star = (M_p / (M_star + M_p)) * v_K`\n    *   `v_K = sqrt(G * (M_star + M_p) / a)`\n    *   The observed radial velocity is `K = v_star * sin(i)`.\n    Combining and simplifying these (assuming `M_p << M_star` and `sin(i) ≈ 1`):\n    `K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\n    `K ≈ (M_p * sqrt(G)) / (sqrt(M_star) * sqrt(a))`\n    This confirms the proportionality `K ∝ M_p / sqrt(a)`.\n\nThe derivation remains solid.\n\n*   **Goal:** Find `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n*   **From formula:** `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`.\n*   **Derivation:**\n    *   From the radial velocity formula, `K ∝ M_p / sqrt(a)`.\n    *   Therefore, `K1 / K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * sqrt(a2 / a1)`.\n    *   From the Doppler shift formula, `K1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`.\n    *   Combining these: `Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * sqrt(a2 / a1)`.\n*   **Solve for the temperature ratio:**\n    *   `sqrt(a2 / a1) = (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2) * (M_p2 / M_p1)`.\n    *   `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2) * (M_p2 / M_p1)`.\n*   **Plug in values:**\n    *   `Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 0.75`.\n    *   `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7`.\n    *   `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 0.75 * (5 / 7) = (3/4) * (5/7) = 15 / 28`.\n*   **Calculate:**\n    *   `15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`.\n\nThis result matches option C.

Identify the Goal\nThe objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets (Planet1 and Planet2), denoted as T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n### 2. Recall Key Formulas\nThe solution requires two main physical principles:\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):** The temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from its star and the energy it radiates away. For a given star, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis, `a`).\n    *   T_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n*   **Radial Velocity (RV) Method:** A planet's gravitational pull causes its host star to \"wobble,\" inducing a periodic Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines. For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is directly proportional to the planet's mass (M_p) and inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis (`a`).\n    *   K ∝ M_p / √a\n\n### 3. Formulate the Ratios\n\n*   **Temperature Ratio:** Based on the T_eq formula, the ratio of the two planets' equilibrium temperatures is:\n    *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (1 / √a1) / (1 / √a2) = √ (a2 / a1)\n*   **Radial Velocity Ratio:** Based on the RV formula, the ratio of the star's wobble induced by each planet is:\n    *   K1 / K2 = (M_p1 / √a1) / (M_p2 / √a2) = (M_p1 / M_p2) * √ (a2 / a1)\n\n### 4. Connect the Formulas\nNotice that the term `√(a2 / a1)` is present in both ratio equations. This allows us to connect them. We can substitute the temperature ratio into the radial velocity ratio equation:\n*   K1 / K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * (T_eq1 / T_eq2)\n\n### 5. Incorporate Given Data\nThe problem provides the Doppler shift (`Δλ`) for each planet, which is directly proportional to the radial velocity semi-amplitude (`K`).\n*   K ∝ Δλ  => K1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2\n\nNow, substitute this into the combined equation:\n*   Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * (T_eq1 / T_eq2)\n\n### 6. Solve for the Unknown\nThe goal is to find T_eq1 / T_eq2. Rearranging the equation:\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2) * (M_p2 / M_p1)\n\n### 7. Substitute Values and Calculate\nPlug in the given values:\n*   `Δλ_1` = 0.03 Å\n*   `Δλ_2` = 0.04 Å\n*   `M_p1` = 7 Earth masses\n*   `M_p2` = 5 Earth masses\n\nCalculation:\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (0.03 / 0.04) * (5 / 7)\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (3 / 4) * (5 / 7)\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\n### 8. Final Conclusion\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.53, which corresponds to option C. The information regarding the star's properties (mass, radius, temperature) and the planets' radii was not needed for this specific ratio calculation as these terms cancel out.\n\nThe calculation is finalized and ready to be presented.\n\nFinal Answer is C.\n\nFinal Check. No issues found. The reasoning is sound and calculations are straightforward. All necessary information was used, and unnecessary information was correctly identified as such.\n\n<<<C>>>\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 can be determined by using the principles of planetary equilibrium temperature and the radial velocity method. Here is a step-by-step derivation:\n\n**1. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n\nA planet's equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) depends on its star's temperature and radius, and the planet's distance from the star (semi-major axis, `a`). The relationship is given by `T_eq ∝ 1/√a`. Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 and Planet2 is:\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a2 / a1)`\n\nTo solve this, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, `a2 / a1`.\n\n**2. Radial Velocity and Doppler Shift**\n\nThe problem provides the periodic Doppler shifts (`Δλ`) in a spectral line caused by each planet. This shift is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (`K`).\n\n`K ∝ Δλ`\n\nSo, the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes is:\n\n`K1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 0.75`\n\n**3. Relating Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the radial velocity semi-amplitude (`K`) it induces on its star is proportional to the planet's mass (`M_p`) and inversely proportional to the square root of its semi-major axis (`a`).\n\n`K ∝ M_p / √a`\n\nTherefore, the ratio `K1 / K2` can also be expressed as:\n\n`K1 / K2 = (M_p1 / √a1) / (M_p2 / √a2) = (M_p1 / M_p2) * √(a2 / a1)`\n\n**4. Combining the Equations**\n\nWe now have two expressions for `K1 / K2`. We can set them equal to each other and substitute the temperature ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a2 / a1)`:\n\n`(M_p1 / M_p2) * (T_eq1 / T_eq2) = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`\n\n**5. Solving for the Temperature Ratio**\n\nWe can now rearrange the formula to solve for the desired temperature ratio:\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2) * (M_p2 / M_p1)`\n\n**6. Calculation**\n\nSubstitute the given values into the equation:\n*   `Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.75`\n*   `M_p1 = 7` Earth masses\n*   `M_p2 = 5` Earth masses\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 0.75 * (5 / 7) = (3/4) * (5/7) = 15 / 28`\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   A is the planet's albedo.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n2.  **Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n    We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\n    Since both planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are the same. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, most terms cancel out, leaving:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n\n3.  **Finding the Semi-Major Axis (a)**\n    The semi-major axis `a` can be determined from the radial velocity (RV) data. For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by:\n    K = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\n    Because the planets are detected by both transit and RV methods, the orbital inclination `i` is close to 90°, so we can assume sin(i) ≈ 1.\n    K = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\n    Rearranging the formula to solve for `a`:\n    K² = (M_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a)\n    K² = (G * M_p²) / (a * M_star)\n    a = (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n4.  **Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\n    Now we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\n    a₂ / a₁ = [(G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K₂²)] / [(G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K₁²)]\n\n    The gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) cancel out:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p1²)\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n5.  **Ratio of the RV Semi-Amplitudes (K)**\n    The RV semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ), since K = c * (Δλ / λ), where c and λ are constants. Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of their Doppler shifts:\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n6.  **Combining and Calculating**\n    Substitute the ratio of K back into the equation for a₂ / a₁:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²\n\n    Now, substitute this result into the temperature ratio equation:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)² )\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\n    Finally, plug in the given values:\n    *   M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n    *   M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n    *   Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n    *   Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet 1 and Planet 2.\n\n**1.

Using Radial Velocity Data to Find the Semi-Major Axis Ratio**\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method measures the \"wobble\" of the star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The amplitude of the stellar radial velocity (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nWhere:\n*   M_p is the planet's mass.\n*   M_star is the star's mass.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis.\n(This assumes the orbital inclination is close to 90°, which is a valid assumption since the planets were also detected via the transit method).\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for `a`:\n\nsqrt(a) ≈ (M_p / K) * sqrt(G / M_star)\na ≈ (M_p / K)² * (G / M_star)\n\nNow we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\n\na₂ / a₁ = [(M_p2 / K₂)² * (G / M_star)] / [(M_p1 / K₁)² * (G / M_star)]\n\nThe terms (G / M_star) cancel out, leaving:\n\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / K₂)² / (M_p1 / K₁)²\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\nThe Doppler shift in wavelength (Δλ) is directly proportional to the radial velocity amplitude (K), so the ratio K₁ / K₂ is the same as the ratio Δλ₁ / Δλ₂.\n\n**4.

Thus, these terms cancel out:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (1/a1) / (1/a2) ) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital distances (a2 / a1), we use the information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\nK ≈ (M_p * sin(i) / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G/a)\nwhere M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, `i` is the orbital inclination, and `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nSince both planets were detected using the transit method, their orbits are viewed edge-on, so we can assume the inclination i ≈ 90° and sin(i) ≈ 1 for both.\nRearranging for `a`:\nsqrt(a) ≈ (M_p / K) * (sin(i) * sqrt(G) / sqrt(M_star))\nSince all terms in the second parenthesis are constant for this system, we have the proportionality:\nsqrt(a) ∝ M_p / K\n\nWe can now form a ratio:\nsqrt(a2) / sqrt(a1) = (M_p2 / K2) / (M_p1 / K1) = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K1 / K2)\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift Δλ (since K = c * Δλ / λ₀, where c and λ₀ are constants). Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\nK1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for the semi-major axes:\nsqrt(a2 / a1) = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)\n\nWe know that T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1), so:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   M_p1 = 7 M_Earth\n*   M_p2 = 5 M_Earth\n*   Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2, denoted as T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula that balances the energy it absorbs from its star with the energy it radiates:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a))\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   A is the planet's bond albedo.\n    *   a is the planet's orbital semi-major axis.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We create the ratio of T_eq1 to T_eq2:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** Several terms cancel out based on the problem statement:\n    *   Both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are the same for both and cancel.\n    *   The problem states \"both planets possess the same albedo,\" so A₁ = A₂. This causes the (1 - A)^(1/4) term to cancel.\n    *   The constant '2' in the denominator under the square root also cancels.\n    *   This leaves a greatly simplified expression:\n        T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(1 / a₁) / √(1 / a₂) = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\n5.  **Connect to Observational Data:** The problem now hinges on finding the ratio a₂ / a₁.

The semi-amplitude of the radial velocity signal (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\n    where M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, and G is the gravitational constant.\n\n6.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We rearrange the formula to isolate 'a':\n    K² ≈ (M_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a)\n    K² ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * a)\n    a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n7.  **Formulate the Ratio a₂ / a₁:**\n    a₂ / a₁ = [(G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K₂²)] / [(G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K_1²)]\n    *   The constants G and M_star are the same for both calculations and cancel out.\n    *   The ratio simplifies to:\n        a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2² / K₂²) / (M_p1² / K_1²)\n        a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K_1 / K_2)²\n\n8.  **Calculate Component Ratios from Given Values:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio (M_p2 / M_p1):**\n        M_p1 = 7 M_Earth, M_p2 = 5 M_Earth\n        => M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n    *   **RV Amplitude Ratio (K_1 / K_2):** The RV amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ). Therefore, their ratio is the same.\n        Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å, Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n        => K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n9.  **Calculate a₂ / a₁:** Substitute the component ratios into the formula from step 7.\n    a₂ / a₁ = (5/7)² * (3/4)² = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784\n\n10. **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:** Substitute the result for a₂ / a₁ into the formula from step 4.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁) = √(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n11. **Compute the Numerical Result:** To compare with the multiple-choice options, we perform the division.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is given by sqrt(a2/a1)\n# The ratio a2/a1 is given by (Mp2/Mp1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\n\n# Values from the problem\nmass_planet1 = 7\nmass_planet2 = 5\ndoppler_shift1 = 0.03\ndoppler_shift2 = 0.04\n\n# Ratio of masses (Mp2/Mp1)\nmass_ratio = mass_planet2 / mass_planet1\n\n# Ratio of RV amplitudes (K1/K2) is the same as the ratio of Doppler shifts\nrv_ratio = doppler_shift1 / doppler_shift2\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2/a1)\naxis_ratio = (mass_ratio)**2 * (rv_ratio)**2\n\n# Calculate the final temperature ratio\ntemperature_ratio = math.sqrt(axis_ratio)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n\nThe computed value is approximately 0.5357, which matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: 0.5357142857142857\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} (1 - A)^{1/4} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}}$\nwhere $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature, A is the planet's albedo, $R_{star}$ is the star's radius, and 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2 ($T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$).\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} (1 - A_1)^{1/4} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1}}}{T_{star} (1 - A_2)^{1/4} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}}}$\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Core Physics\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets, $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}}$.\n\n**Equilibrium Temperature:**\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) is:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot (1 - A)^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}}$\nwhere $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature, $R_{star}$ is its radius, $A$ is the planet's albedo, and $a$ is the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis).\n\nWhen taking the ratio for two planets orbiting the same star and having the same albedo (as stated in the problem), the terms $T_{star}$, $R_{star}$, and $(1-A)$ cancel out. The formula for the ratio simplifies significantly:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1/a_1}}{\\sqrt{1/a_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nThis is a critical first step. The problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the orbital distances, $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$.\n\n**Radial Velocity:**\nThe orbital distances can be found using the provided radial velocity (RV) data (the Doppler shifts). For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude ($K$) induced on the star is given by:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{GM_*}{a}}$\n(This approximation is valid because the planets are detected by transit, meaning their orbits are edge-on so inclination $i \\approx 90°$ and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. Also, the planet masses are much smaller than the star's mass).\n\nRearranging this formula to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n$K^2 \\approx \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_* a} \\implies a \\approx \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_* K^2}$\n\nNow, we can find the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2 / (M_* K_2^2)}{G M_{p1}^2 / (M_* K_1^2)}$\n\nThe terms for the gravitational constant ($G$) and the star's mass ($M_*$) cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n### 2. Combine the Physics and Simplify\n\nNow we substitute the expression for $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$ back into our temperature ratio equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2}$\n\nTaking the square root simplifies the expression to the final working formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)$\n\n### 3. Calculation\n\n*   The RV semi-amplitude, $K$, is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift, $\\Delta\\lambda$. Therefore, the ratio of the K values is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts.\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n*   The ratio of the planet masses is given.\n    $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\ M_{Earth}}{7 \\ M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n*   Now, plug these ratios into our final formula:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n*   Convert the fraction to a decimal:\n    $\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\n### 4.

Understand the Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates away. For a planet in a circular orbit, this is given by the formula:\n\n$T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $T_{eff}$ is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   $R_*$ is the radius of the star.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   $A$ is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\n**2.

The formula for equilibrium temperature is proportional to the inverse square root of the semi-major axis of its orbit (a), represented as T_eq ∝ 1/√a. All other factors, such as the star's temperature and radius, and the planets' albedos (which are stated to be the same), cancel out when taking the ratio.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets is:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\nThe semi-major axis (a) is not given directly, but it can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV method measures the \"wobble\" of a star caused by an orbiting planet's gravitational pull. This wobble induces a Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines.\n\nThe key steps are as follows:\n\n1.  **Relate Doppler Shift to Radial Velocity:** The observed Doppler shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity amplitude (K).\n    K = c * (Δλ / λ₀), where 'c' is the speed of light and λ₀ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity amplitude (K) is related to the planet's mass (M_p) and the semi-major axis (a) by the formula:\n    K ∝ M_p / √a\n\n3.  **Derive the Semi-Major Axis Ratio:** By rearranging the formula, we find that the semi-major axis is proportional to the square of the planet's mass divided by the square of the radial velocity amplitude:\n    a ∝ (M_p / K)²\n\n    From this, we can establish the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n4.  **Substitute Doppler Shift for Radial Velocity:** Since K is proportional to Δλ, the ratio K₁/K₂ is equal to the ratio Δλ₁/Δλ₂.\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²\n\n5.  **Calculate the Temperature Ratio:** Substituting this back into the temperature ratio equation:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √[(M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²]\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n*   Mass of Planet1 (M_p₁) = 7 M_earth\n*   Mass of Planet2 (M_p₂) = 5 M_earth\n*   Doppler shift for Planet1 (Δλ₁) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet2 (Δλ₂) = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio:** The equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet is given by the formula `T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2*a)) * (1 - Albedo)^(1/4)`, where `T_star` and `R_star` are the star's temperature and radius, `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and `Albedo` is the planet's albedo. When we take the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 and Planet2 (`T_eq1 / T_eq2`), the terms for the star's properties and the albedo (which is the same for both planets) cancel out, leaving us with: `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`.\n\n2.  **Relating Doppler Shift to Orbital Parameters:** The maximum Doppler shift (`Δλ`) is proportional to the star's maximum radial velocity (`K`), given by `K = c * Δλ / λ_0`. Therefore, the ratio of the radial velocities is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts: `K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2`.\n\n3.  **Finding the Semi-Major Axis Ratio:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` is related to the planet's mass (`M_p`) and semi-major axis (`a`) by the formula `K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`. (We assume an inclination `i` of 90 degrees, so `sin(i) ≈ 1`, which is a reasonable assumption since the planets were detected via the transit method).\n    By rearranging this formula to solve for `a`, we find that `a` is proportional to `(M_p / K)^2`.\n    Therefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes is `a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / K2)^2 / (M_p1 / K1)^2`, which simplifies to `a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:** By substituting `K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2` into the equation from step 3, we get `a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2`.\n    Now, we substitute this into the temperature ratio equation from step 1:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2)`\n    This simplifies to the final formula: `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)`.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation:** The Python code will define the given masses and Doppler shifts, calculate the ratios, and then compute the final temperature ratio using the derived formula.\n\n```python\n# Define the given values for the planets\n# Mass of Planet 1 in Earth masses\nM_p1 = 7.0\n# Mass of Planet 2 in Earth masses\nM_p2 = 5.0\n# Doppler shift induced by Planet 1 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda_1 = 0.03\n# Doppler shift induced by Planet 2 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda_2 = 0.04\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) can be derived as:\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2)\n# This is because T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a) and a is proportional to (M_p / K)^2,\n# where K (radial velocity) is proportional to delta_lambda.\n\n# Calculate the mass ratio (M_p2 / M_p1)\nmass_ratio = M_p2 / M_p1\n\n# Calculate the Doppler shift ratio (delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2)\nshift_ratio = delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2\n\n# Calculate the final equilibrium temperature ratio\ntemp_ratio = mass_ratio * shift_ratio\n\n# Print the final calculated ratio and the choices\nprint(f\"The calculated ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (Planet1/Planet2) is: {temp_ratio:.4f}\")\nprint(\"\\nWhich of the following options is the closest?\")\nprint(f\"A) ~ 0.98\")\nprint(f\"B) ~ 1.30\")\nprint(f\"C) ~ 1.05\")\nprint(f\"D) ~ 0.53\")\n```\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The calculated ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (Planet1/Planet2) is: 0.5357\n\nWhich of the following options is the closest?\nA) ~ 0.98\nB) ~ 1.30\nC) ~ 1.05\nD) ~ 0.53\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and Identify Key Formulas\nThe primary goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\nThe formula for the equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\nwhere:\n*   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   A is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n*   R_star is the radius of the star.\n*   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nThe problem requires us to find the semi-major axis 'a' for each planet. This can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) data. The maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) is related to the star's radial velocity amplitude (K) by:\nK = c * (Δλ / λ_0)\nwhere:\n*   c is the speed of light.\n*   λ_0 is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity amplitude (K) is given by:\nK ≈ (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * v_p\nwhere v_p is the planet's orbital velocity, v_p = sqrt(G * M_star / a).\nCombining these gives:\nK ≈ (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = (M_p * sin(i) * sqrt(G)) / (sqrt(M_star) * sqrt(a))\n\n### Step 2: List Careful Points and Assumptions\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio:** Since both planets orbit the same star (same T_star and R_star) and have the same albedo (A), these terms will cancel out when we take the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures.\n*   **Orbital Inclination (i):** The problem states that the planets were detected using *both* the transit and RV methods. A transit can only be observed if the orbit is nearly edge-on to our line of sight (inclination i ≈ 90°). Therefore, it is a safe assumption that sin(i) ≈ 1 for both planets.\n*   **Planet Mass vs. Star Mass:** The masses of the planets (7 and 5 Earth masses) are negligible compared to the star's mass (1.5 Solar masses). This justifies the approximations used in the RV formulas.\n*   **Unnecessary Information:** The absolute values of the star's mass, radius, and temperature, as well as the planets' radii, are not needed to calculate the final ratio. They are provided for context but will cancel out in the derivation.\n\n### Step 3: Derive the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures\n1.  **Formulate the temperature ratio:**\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1-A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2*a1))] / [T_star * (1-A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2*a2))]\n    Simplifying this by canceling common terms gives:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\n2.  **Relate the semi-major axis 'a' to the given parameters:**\n    From the RV amplitude formula, K ≈ (M_p * sqrt(G)) / (sqrt(M_star) * sqrt(a)) (assuming sin(i)=1).\n    Let's rearrange to solve for 'a':\n    sqrt(a) ≈ (M_p * sqrt(G)) / (K * sqrt(M_star))\n    a ≈ G * M_p^2 / (K^2 * M_star)\n\n3.  **Calculate the ratio a2 / a1:**\n    a2 / a1 = [G * M_p2^2 / (K2^2 * M_star)] / [G * M_p1^2 / (K1^2 * M_star)]\n    The terms G and M_star cancel out:\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) * (K1^2 / M_p1^2) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n\n4.  **Relate the RV amplitude ratio (K1/K2) to the Doppler shift ratio (Δλ1/Δλ2):**\n    K1 = c * (Δλ1 / λ_0)\n    K2 = c * (Δλ2 / λ_0)\n    K1 / K2 = (c * Δλ1 / λ_0) / (c * Δλ2 / λ_0) = Δλ1 / Δλ2\n\n5.  **Substitute this back into the expression for a2 / a1:**\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2\n\n6.  **Finally, substitute this into the temperature ratio expression:**\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2 )\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n*   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n*   Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe final calculation from the Python script gives the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures as approximately 0.5357.\n\nLet's review the steps:\n1.  The ratio of equilibrium temperatures, assuming the same star and same albedo, simplifies to $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$.\n2.  The ratio of the semi-major axes was derived from the radial velocity formula as $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$.\n3.  The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes ($K$) is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$).\n4.  Plugging in the given values:\n    *   $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n    *   $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n5.  Calculating the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    *   $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n6.  Calculating the final temperature ratio:\n    *   $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.536 matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we can follow a step-by-step calculation based on the principles of planetary science.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its host star and the energy it radiates back into space. The formula for the equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2a))\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   R_star is the radius of the star.\n*   A is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n*   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 (T_eq1) and Planet2 (T_eq2), we can set up the following equation:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2a₂))]\n\nAccording to the problem description, both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are constant. It is also stated that both planets have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\nThis means the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\nThe next step is to determine the semi-major axes. The problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method. For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is related to the planet's mass (M_p) and its semi-major axis (a) by the formula:\n\nK ≈ M_p * √(G / (M_star * a))\n\nHere, G is the gravitational constant and M_star is the mass of the star. We can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis 'a':\n\na ≈ G * M_p² / (M_star * K²)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\n\na₂ / a₁ = [G * M_p2² / (M_star * K₂²)] / [G * M_p1² / (M_star * K₁²)]\n\nThe terms G and M_star cancel out, leaving:\n\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ), as K = c * (Δλ / λ), where c is the speed of light and λ is the rest wavelength. Therefore, the ratio of the RV amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   Mass of Planet1 (M_p1) = 7 M_earth\n*   Mass of Planet2 (M_p2) = 5 M_earth\n*   Doppler shift for Planet1 (Δλ₁) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet2 (Δλ₂) = 0.04 Å\n\nFirst, we calculate the ratios:\n*   M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n*   K₁ / K₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nNext, we substitute these ratios into the equation for a₂ / a₁:\n\na₂ / a₁ = (5/7)² * (3/4)² = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784\n\nFinally, we calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁) = √(225 / 784) = 15 / 28\n\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives:\n\n15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures.\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\nWe want to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2*a₁))^(1/2) * (1 - A₁)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2*a₂))^(1/2) * (1 - A₂)^(1/4)]\n\nGiven that T_star, R_star, and the albedo (A₁ = A₂) are the same for both planets, these terms cancel out:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (1/a₁)^(1/2) / (1/a₂)^(1/2)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a₂ / a₁)^(1/2)\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we first need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a₂ / a₁).\n\n### 2. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the planet's mass (M_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the semi-major axis (a) by:\n\nK = (M_p / M_star) * v_p\n\nWhere v_p is the planet's orbital velocity, given by v_p = (G * M_star / a)^(1/2). The problem states the planets are detected by the transit method, which implies an orbital inclination `i` ≈ 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1.\n\nSubstituting v_p into the equation for K:\n\nK = (M_p / M_star) * (G * M_star / a)^(1/2)\nK = (M_p * G^(1/2)) / (M_star^(1/2) * a^(1/2))\n\nNow, we solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\n\nK² = (M_p² * G) / (M_star * a)\na = (G * M_p²) / (K² * M_star)\n\n### 3. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\n\nNow we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\n\na₂ / a₁ = [(G * M_p₂²) / (K₂² * M_star)] / [(G * M_p₁²) / (K₁² * M_star)]\n\nThe gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) cancel out:\n\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) / (M_p₁² / K₁²)\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n### 4. Plugging in the Values\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ), since K = c * (Δλ / λ₀). Therefore, the ratio K₁ / K₂ is equal to the ratio Δλ₁ / Δλ₂.\n\nGiven values:\n*   M_p₁ = 7 M_earth\n*   M_p₂ = 5 M_earth\n*   Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n\nNow, we calculate the ratios:\n*   M_p₂ / M_p₁ = 5 / 7\n*   K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nSubstitute these into the equation for a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\na₂ / a₁ = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na₂ / a₁ = 225 / 784\n\n### 5. Final Calculation of Temperature Ratio\n\nFinally, substitute the value of a₂ / a₁ back into the temperature ratio equation:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a₂ / a₁)^(1/2)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (225 / 784)^(1/2)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √225 / √784\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we can follow a step-by-step derivation using fundamental principles of exoplanet characterization.\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is the theoretical temperature it would have if it were a perfect blackbody heated only by its parent star. It is determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from the star and the energy radiated back into space. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * √(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n*   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n\n### 2. Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * √(R_star / (2 * a₁)) * (1 - A₁)^(1/4)] / [T_star * √(R_star / (2 * a₂)) * (1 - A₂)^(1/4)]\n\nGiven that both planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are constant. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (`A₁ = A₂`). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\n### 3. Relating Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters\nThe problem provides the Doppler shifts caused by the planets, which is information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The maximum radial velocity of the star induced by a planet (the semi-amplitude, K) is related to the planet's mass and orbit. For a circular orbit, and assuming the planet's mass (`M_p`) is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_star`), the formula is:\n\nK = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\n\nWhere `i` is the orbital inclination and `G` is the gravitational constant. Since the planets were detected by both transit and RV methods, we can assume the orbits are edge-on, meaning `i` ≈ 90° and `sin(i)` ≈ 1. The formula simplifies to:\n\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\n\n### 4. Deriving the Semi-Major Axis\nWe can rearrange the RV formula to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n\nK² ≈ (M_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a)\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n### 5. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\nNow we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁. The terms `G` and `M_star` are the same for both planets and will cancel out:\n\na₂ / a₁ = [(G * M_p₂²) / (M_star * K₂²)] / [(G * M_p₁²) / (M_star * K₁²)]\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p₁²)\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n### 6. Connecting Doppler Shift to Radial Velocity\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ`. The relationship is `K = c * (Δλ / λ₀)`, where `c` is the speed of light and `λ₀` is the rest wavelength. Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n### 7. Final Calculation\nSubstitute this back into the equation for `a₂ / a₁`:\n\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²\n\nNow, substitute this entire expression into the simplified temperature ratio equation:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √[(M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²]\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p₂ / M_p₁) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\nFinally, plug in the given values:\n*   M_p₁ = 7 M_earth\n*   M_p₂ = 5 M_earth\n*   Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet (T_eq) is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\nwhere T_star is the star's temperature, R_star is the star's radius, 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and A is the planet's albedo.\n\nWe want to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2. Since both planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are constant. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (A). Therefore, the formula for the ratio simplifies to:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [(1/a_1)^(1/2)] / [(1/a_2)^(1/2)] = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2)\n\nNow we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a_2 / a_1). We can use the information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\nK = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * (G * M_star / a)^(1/2)\nwhere M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, 'i' is the orbital inclination, and G is the gravitational constant.\n\nSince the planets were detected by the transit method, we can assume their orbits are edge-on, so the inclination i ≈ 90° and sin(i) ≈ 1. The formula simplifies to:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * (G * M_star / a)^(1/2)\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude (K) is related to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) by the formula:\nK = c * (Δλ / λ_0)\nwhere c is the speed of light and λ_0 is the rest wavelength of the spectral line. This means K is directly proportional to Δλ (K ∝ Δλ).\n\nLet's rearrange the simplified RV formula to solve for a^(1/2):\nK ∝ M_p / a^(1/2)\na^(1/2) ∝ M_p / K\nSince K ∝ Δλ, we have:\na^(1/2) ∝ M_p / Δλ\n\nNow we can write the ratio for the semi-major axes:\n(a_2 / a_1)^(1/2) = [a_2^(1/2)] / [a_1^(1/2)] = (M_p2 / Δλ_2) / (M_p1 / Δλ_1)\n(a_2 / a_1)^(1/2) = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)\n\nWe already established that T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2). Therefore:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n*   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n*   Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n    *   A is the planet's Bond albedo.\n    *   R_star is the radius of the star.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2. Let's write out the expressions for each planet:\n    T_eq1 = T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))\n    T_eq2 = T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\n\n    Now, we divide the first equation by the second. The problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are the same) and have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, these terms cancel out:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (R_star / (2 * a1)) * ((2 * a2) / R_star) )\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\n    This is a key simplification. The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n4.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observational Data:** The semi-major axes (`a`) are not given directly. However, we have radial velocity (RV) data in the form of Doppler shifts (Δλ). We can use the formula for the RV amplitude (K) to find a relationship.\n\n5.  **Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):** The RV amplitude for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    K = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n    where:\n    *   M_p is the planet's mass.\n    *   M_star is the star's mass.\n    *   `i` is the orbital inclination (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n    The problem states that the planets were detected using the **transit method**. This is crucial because transits are only observable when the orbit is nearly edge-on to our line of sight, which means the inclination `i` is approximately 90°. For i ≈ 90°, sin(i) ≈ 1. The formula simplifies to:\n    K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\n6.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We need to rearrange the formula to express `a` in terms of the other variables.\n    K^2 = (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)\n    K^2 = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * a)\n    a = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1):** Now we can find the ratio `a2 / a1` by dividing the expression for a2 by the expression for a1.\n    a2 / a1 = [ (G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K2^2) ] / [ (G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K1^2) ]\n\n    The gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) cancel out:\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) * (K1^2 / M_p1^2)\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n\n8.  **Combine Ratios for the Final Formula:** Substitute the expression for `a2 / a1` back into our temperature ratio formula from step 3:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2 )\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K1 / K2)\n\n9.  **Calculate the Component Ratios from Given Data:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio (M_p2 / M_p1):**\n        M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n        M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n        M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n    *   **RV Amplitude Ratio (K1 / K2):** The RV amplitude K is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift Δλ (since K = c * Δλ / λ_0). Therefore, the ratio of the amplitudes is the same as the ratio of the shifts.\n        Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n        Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n        K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n10. **Final Calculation:** Substitute these ratios into the formula from step 8.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n    To find the numerical value, we can use a simple calculation.\n```python\n# Calculate the final ratio of the equilibrium temperatures\nratio = 15 / 28\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536.

The problem states that they have the same albedo (`A1 = A2`). Therefore, most terms cancel out, leaving:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (1/a1)^(1/4) / (1/a2)^(1/4)` -> This is incorrect. The exponent is 1/2.\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (1/a1)^(1/2) / (1/a2)^(1/2) = (a2 / a1)^(1/2)`\n\n3.  **Radial Velocity (RV) and Doppler Shift:** The maximum radial velocity of the star (the semi-amplitude, K) is related to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) by:\n    `K = c * (Δλ / λ_0)`\n    where `c` is the speed of light and `λ_0` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n    The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes for the two planets is:\n    `K1 / K2 = (c * Δλ1 / λ_0) / (c * Δλ2 / λ_0) = Δλ1 / Δλ2`\n    `K1 / K2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4`\n\n4.  **Relating RV to Orbital Parameters:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude (K) is given by:\n    `K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * v_p`\n    where `M_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, and `v_p` is the planet's orbital velocity. The planet's orbital velocity is `v_p = (G * M_star / a)^(1/2)`.\n    Substituting `v_p` into the equation for K:\n    `K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * (G * M_star / a)^(1/2) = (M_p * G^(1/2)) / (M_star^(1/2) * a^(1/2))`\n    *Note: This assumes the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass and that the orbital inclination is ~90° (sin(i)≈1), which is a valid assumption for a transiting planet.*\n\n5.  **Solving for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We can rearrange the formula to solve for `a`:\n    `a^(1/2) ≈ (M_p * G^(1/2)) / (K * M_star^(1/2))`\n    `a ≈ (M_p^2 * G) / (K^2 * M_star)`\n\n6.  **Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1):**\n    `a2 / a1 = [(M_p2^2 * G) / (K2^2 * M_star)] / [(M_p1^2 * G) / (K1^2 * M_star)]`\n    The terms `G` and `M_star` cancel out:\n    `a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) * (K1^2 / M_p1^2) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`\n\n7.  **Substituting the Known Ratios:**\n    *   Mass ratio: `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 M_earth / 7 M_earth = 5 / 7`\n    *   RV ratio: `K1 / K2 = 3 / 4`\n    Now, substitute these into the equation for `a2 / a1`:\n    `a2 / a1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16) = 225 / 784`\n\n8.  **Final Calculation of Temperature Ratio:**\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2) = (225 / 784)^(1/2)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n**1.

The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a₂ / a₁)^(1/2)\n\n**2. Relating Doppler Shift to Radial Velocity**\n\nThe Doppler shift (Δλ) in the star's spectral lines is caused by the star's motion (radial velocity, v_r) induced by the orbiting planet. The relationship is:\n\nv_r = c * (Δλ / λ₀)\n\nWhere `c` is the speed of light and λ₀ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line. The maximum radial velocity, or semi-amplitude (K), corresponds to the maximum observed Doppler shift.

The maximum radial velocity (K) is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ):\n\nK = c * (Δλ / λ₀)\n\nWhere `c` is the speed of light and λ₀ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line (6300 Å).\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the planet's mass (M_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the semi-major axis (`a`) by the following equation:\n\n**K = M_p * sqrt(G / (a * M_star))**\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes\nWe can rearrange the formula from Step 2 to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n\na = (G * M_p²) / (K² * M_star)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio a2 / a1:\n\na2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2²) / (K2² * M_star)] / [(G * M_p1²) / (K1² * M_star)]\n\nThe constants G and M_star cancel out, leaving:\n\n**a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²**\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Ratios of Masses and Radial Velocities\nFrom the problem statement:\n*   Mass of Planet 1 (M_p1) = 7 M_earth\n*   Mass of Planet 2 (M_p2) = 5 M_earth\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 1 (Δλ_1) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet 2 (Δλ_2) = 0.04 Å\n\nThe ratio of the masses is:\nM_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\nSince K is directly proportional to Δλ, the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes is:\nK1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio\nSubstitute the results from Step 3 and Step 4 into the equation from Step 1:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)² )\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K1 / K2)\n\nNow, plug in the numerical ratios:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n**T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357**\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 18:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula `T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`, where `T_star` is the star's effective temperature, `A` is the planet's albedo, `R_star` is the star's radius, and `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. To find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (`T_eq1 / T_eq2`), we can divide their respective formulas. Since the star's properties (`T_star`, `R_star`) and the albedo (`A`) are the same for both planets, these terms cancel out, leaving the simplified relation:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`.\n\n2.  **Semi-Major Axis from Radial Velocity:** The semi-major axis (`a`) is not directly given, but we can determine it from the radial velocity (RV) data. The maximum RV shift of the star, known as the RV semi-amplitude `K`, is related to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ` by `K = c * Δλ / λ0`. For a planet in a circular orbit detected by both transit and RV methods (implying an edge-on view, so `sin(i) ≈ 1`), the RV semi-amplitude is also given by:\n    `K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`, where `M_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, and `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Derive the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** We can rearrange the formula for `K` to solve for `a`:\n    `a ≈ (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)`.\n    Now we can find the ratio `a2 / a1`:\n    `a2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K1^2)]`\n    The constants `G` and `M_star` cancel out, leaving:\n    `a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`.\n\n4.  **Substitute Doppler Shifts:** The ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes `K1 / K2` is equal to the ratio of their corresponding Doppler shifts `Δλ1 / Δλ2`. Substituting this into the equation for `a2 / a1` gives:\n    `a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2`.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the expression for `a2 / a1` back into the temperature ratio formula from Step 1:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2 )`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)`.\n    We will now use Python to plug in the given values and compute the final ratio.\n\n```python\n# Given values for the planets\n# Mass of Planet1 in Earth masses\nM_p1 = 7.0\n# Mass of Planet2 in Earth masses\nM_p2 = 5.0\n\n# Doppler shift induced by Planet1 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03\n# Doppler shift induced by Planet2 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the planet masses (M_p2 / M_p1)\nmass_ratio = M_p2 / M_p1\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the Doppler shifts (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\nlambda_ratio = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is the product of the mass ratio and the lambda ratio\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\ntemp_ratio = mass_ratio * lambda_ratio\n\n# Print the result and the available choices\nprint(f\"The calculated ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) is: {temp_ratio:.2f}\")\nprint(\"The choices are:\")\nprint(\"A) ~ 1.05\")\nprint(\"B) ~ 0.53\")\nprint(\"C) ~ 1.30\")\nprint(\"D) ~ 0.98\")\n```\n<<<B>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The calculated ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) is: 0.54\nThe choices are:\nA) ~ 1.05\nB) ~ 0.53\nC) ~ 1.30\nD) ~ 0.98\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 19:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet1 to that of Planet2, which can be written as `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n\n**2. The Formula for Equilibrium Temperature**\nThe equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) of a planet orbiting a star is determined by the energy it receives from the star and its own properties. The formula is:\n`T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\nwhere:\n*   `T_star` is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (which is the orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n*   `A` is the planet's Bond albedo (the fraction of power reflected).\n\n**3. Formulate the Ratio of Temperatures**\nWe need to calculate the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`. Let's write out the full expression for the ratio:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]`\n\n*   **Careful Point:** We must identify which terms are constant for both planets and will cancel out.\n*   The star is the same for both planets, so `T_star` and `R_star` are constant.\n*   The problem states that both planets have the same albedo, so `A_1 = A_2`.\n*   The factor of `2` is a constant.\n\nAfter canceling these terms, the formula simplifies significantly:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a_1) / sqrt(1 / a_2)`\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)`\n\nThis means the problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the orbital distances, `a_2 / a_1`.\n\n**4. Relate Orbital Distance to Observational Data**\nThe problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method: the maximum Doppler shifts (`Δλ`) caused by each planet. This information can be used to find the semi-major axis `a`.\n\n**5. From Doppler Shift to Radial Velocity Amplitude (K)**\nThe maximum Doppler shift `Δλ_max` is related to the star's maximum radial velocity `K` (the amplitude of the RV curve) by the non-relativistic Doppler formula:\n`K / c = Δλ_max / λ_0`  =>  `K = c * (Δλ_max / λ_0)`\nwhere `c` is the speed of light and `λ_0` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nLet's find the ratio of the RV amplitudes `K_1 / K_2`:\n`K_1 / K_2 = [c * (Δλ_1 / λ_0)] / [c * (Δλ_2 / λ_0)]`\nThe terms `c` and `λ_0` cancel out.\n`K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4`\n\n**6. From Radial Velocity Amplitude (K) to Orbital Distance (a)**\nThe RV amplitude `K` induced by a planet of mass `m_p` on a star of mass `M_star` in a circular orbit is given by:\n`K = (m_p / M_star) * v_orb * sin(i)`\nwhere `v_orb` is the planet's orbital velocity and `i` is the inclination of the orbit.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The problem states that the planets were also detected by the transit method. This implies that the orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, so the inclination `i ≈ 90°` and `sin(i) ≈ 1`. We can assume this for both planets.\n\nThe planet's orbital velocity is given by Kepler's laws:\n`v_orb = sqrt(G * (M_star + m_p) / a)`\nSince the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (`m_p << M_star`), we can approximate this as:\n`v_orb ≈ sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\n\nSubstituting this into the formula for `K`:\n`K ≈ (m_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = (m_p / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a)`\n\n**7. Derive the Ratio of Orbital Distances (a_2 / a_1)**\nFrom the relationship `K ∝ m_p / sqrt(a)`, we can solve for `sqrt(a)`:\n`sqrt(a) ∝ m_p / K`\nSquaring both sides gives the relationship for `a`:\n`a ∝ (m_p / K)^2`\n\nNow we can write the ratio `a_2 / a_1`:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (m_p2 / K_2)^2 / (m_p1 / K_1)^2 = (m_p2 / m_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2`\n\n**8. Calculate the Numerical Value of the Ratios**\nWe have the following information from the problem:\n*   `m_p1 = 7 M_earth`\n*   `m_p2 = 5 M_earth`\n*   The ratio of RV amplitudes `K_1 / K_2 = 3/4` (from step 5).\n\nNow, let's calculate the required ratios:\n*   `m_p2 / m_p1 = 5 / 7`\n*   `K_1 / K_2 = 3 / 4`\n\nSubstitute these into the expression for `a_2 / a_1`:\n`a_2 / a_1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16) = 225 / 784`\n\n**9. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio**\nNow we return to the simplified temperature ratio formula from step 3:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)`\n\nSubstitute the value we just found for `a_2 / a_1`:\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)`\n\n*   **Careful Point:** These numbers are perfect squares. `sqrt(225) = 15` and `sqrt(784) = 28`.\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n\nFinally, compute the decimal value:\n`15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`\n\n**10. Compare with Options**\nThe calculated value `~0.536` is closest to option D. The extra information given in the problem (star's mass, radius, temperature, and planets' radii) was not needed for the final ratio calculation, which is common in such physics problems.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere $T_*$ is the star's effective temperature, $R_*$ is the star's radius, $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, and $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 and Planet2, $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}}$. Since both planets orbit the same star ($T_*$ and $R_*$ are constant) and have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$), these terms will cancel out in the ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_* \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\nThe problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method. For a planet in a circular orbit detected via the RV method, the amplitude of the star's velocity variation ($K_*$) is given by:\n$K_* = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{G(M_* + M_p)}{a}}$\nSince the planets are much less massive than the star ($M_p \\ll M_*$), we can approximate $M_* + M_p \\approx M_*$. Also, since the planets were also detected by the transit method, their orbital inclination $i$ is close to 90°, so $\\sin i \\approx 1$. The formula simplifies to:\n$K_* \\approx \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{\\frac{GM_*}{a}} = \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{M_*}}$\n\nThe radial velocity amplitude $K_*$ is related to the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$ by the formula $K_* = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$, where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength. This means $K_* \\propto \\Delta\\lambda_{max}$.\n\nFrom the simplified formula for $K_*$, we can express $\\sqrt{a}$ in terms of the other parameters:\n$\\sqrt{a} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{K_*} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}$\nNow we can write the ratio $\\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{a_2}}{\\sqrt{a_1}}$:\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{a_2}}{\\sqrt{a_1}} = \\frac{M_2 / \\Delta\\lambda_2}{M_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}\\right)$\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   $M_1 = 7 M_{Earth}$\n*   $M_2 = 5 M_{Earth}$\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n*   $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right) \\left(\\frac{0.03}{0.04}\\right) = \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nTo determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we can follow a step-by-step derivation based on the information provided.\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is the theoretical temperature it would have if it were a black body heated only by its parent star. It is determined by the star's effective temperature (T_star), the star's radius (R_star), and the planet's semi-major axis (a). The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * √(R_star / (2a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nwhere A is the planet's albedo.\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 (T_eq1) and Planet2 (T_eq2), we can set up the following equation:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * √(R_star / (2 * a1)) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * √(R_star / (2 * a2)) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are identical for both. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, these terms cancel out, and the formula simplifies to:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a2 / a1)\n\nThis shows that the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n### 2. Semi-Major Axis Ratio from Radial Velocity Data\n\nThe problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method, which can be used to determine the semi-major axes. The maximum periodic Doppler shift corresponds to the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) of the star. For a planet in a circular orbit, this is given by:\n\nK ≈ M_p * √(G / (M_star * a))\n\nHere, M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, G is the gravitational constant, and `a` is the semi-major axis. This formula is a good approximation when the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (M_p << M_star). The detection of the planets via the transit method implies that their orbital inclination is close to 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n\na ≈ (M_p² * G) / (K² * M_star)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a1):\n\na2 / a1 = [(M_p2² * G) / (K2² * M_star)] / [(M_p1² * G) / (K1² * M_star)]\n\nThe terms for the star's mass (M_star) and the gravitational constant (G) cancel out, leaving:\n\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n\n### 3. Calculating the Ratios\n\nFirst, we determine the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K1 / K2). The Doppler shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the radial velocity. Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is the same as the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts:\n\nK1 / K2 = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 0.75\n\nNext, we find the ratio of the planetary masses:\n\nM_p2 / M_p1 = 5 Earth masses / 7 Earth masses = 5/7\n\nNow we can calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n\na2 / a1 = (5/7)² * (0.75)² = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784\n\n### 4. Final Temperature Ratio Calculation\n\nFinally, we substitute the value of a2 / a1 back into the simplified equilibrium temperature ratio equation:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a2 / a1) = √(225 / 784)\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ 1.30\nB) ~ 0.53\nC) ~ 1.05\nD) ~ 0.98\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n**1. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates into space. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo (the fraction of light it reflects).\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe want to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same) and have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, most terms cancel out:\n\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt( (R_star / (2 * a1)) * (2 * a2 / R_star) )\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nThe problem now reduces to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets.\n\n**2. Relating Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters**\n\nThe periodic Doppler shift (Δλ) in the star's spectrum is caused by the star's motion as it's pulled by the orbiting planet. The magnitude of this shift is related to the star's maximum radial velocity (K) by:\n\nK = c * (Δλ / λ₀)\n\nwhere `c` is the speed of light and `λ₀` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's maximum radial velocity (K), assuming we are viewing the system edge-on (inclination i ≈ 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1), is given by:\n\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * v_p\n\nwhere `M_p` is the planet's mass, `M_star` is the star's mass, and `v_p` is the planet's orbital velocity. The planet's orbital velocity is `v_p = sqrt(G * M_star / a)`. Substituting this in gives:\n\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\nThe detection of the planets via the transit method confirms that the orbits are nearly edge-on, making the sin(i) ≈ 1 assumption valid.\n\n**3. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes**\n\nWe can rearrange the formula for K to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n\nK² ≈ M_p² * (G / (M_star * a))\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\nNow we can find the ratio a2 / a1:\n\n(a2 / a1) = [ (G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K2²) ] / [ (G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K1²) ]\n\nThe terms for the gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) cancel out:\n\n(a2 / a1) = (M_p2² / K2²) * (K1² / M_p1²)\n(a2 / a1) = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n\nThe ratio of the radial velocities (K1 / K2) is directly proportional to the ratio of their Doppler shifts (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂):\n\n(K1 / K2) = (c * Δλ₁ / λ₀) / (c * Δλ₂ / λ₀) = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4\n\nWe are given the planet masses: M_p1 = 7 M_earth and M_p2 = 5 M_earth.\n\n(M_p2 / M_p1) = 5 / 7\n\nNow, substitute these ratios back into the equation for a2 / a1:\n\n(a2 / a1) = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\n(a2 / a1) = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n(a2 / a1) = 225 / 784\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\nFinally, we substitute the ratio of the semi-major axes back into our temperature ratio equation:\n\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(225 / 784)\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = 15 / 28\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 23:\nTo determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we can follow a step-by-step derivation using the provided information.\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is the theoretical temperature it would have if it were a perfect blackbody heated only by its parent star. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n*   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2. Since both planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are identical for both. The problem states that we should assume both planets have the same albedo (`A1` = `A2`). Therefore, when we take the ratio, these terms cancel out:\n\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nThis shows that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures depends only on the ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n### 2. Semi-Major Axis and Radial Velocity\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines, caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's maximum radial velocity (K) is related to the planet's mass (`M_p`), the star's mass (`M_star`), and the semi-major axis (`a`) by the following equation:\n\nK = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\nWhere `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nBy rearranging this formula to solve for the semi-major axis `a`, we get:\n\na = (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n### 3. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\n\nWe can now find the ratio `a2 / a1` using the formula from the previous step:\n\na2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K2²)] / [(G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K1²)]\n\nThe terms for the gravitational constant (`G`) and the star's mass (`M_star`) cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n\n### 4. Relating Radial Velocity to Doppler Shift\n\nThe observed Doppler shift (`Δλ`) is directly proportional to the radial velocity (`K`). The relationship is given by `K = c * (Δλ / λ₀)`, where `c` is the speed of light and `λ₀` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the radial velocities is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n\nK1 / K2 = (c * Δλ1 / λ₀) / (c * Δλ2 / λ₀) = Δλ1 / Δλ2\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\n\nSubstituting this result back into the equation for the ratio of the semi-major axes, we get:\n\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)²\n\nNow, we can find the final ratio for the equilibrium temperatures:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n*   Mass of Planet1 (M_p1) = 7 M_earth\n*   Mass of Planet2 (M_p2) = 5 M_earth\n*   Doppler shift for Planet1 (Δλ1) = 0.03 Å\n*   Doppler shift for Planet2 (Δλ2) = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 24:\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:\n`T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n(Assuming a heat redistribution factor `f=2` for simplicity, though this factor cancels out in the ratio).\n\nWhere:\n- `T_star` is the effective temperature of the star.\n- `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n- `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n- `A` is the albedo of the planet.\n\nWe need to find the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]`\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are the same and cancel out. The problem states that both planets have the same albedo (`A1 = A2`), so the `(1 - A)` term also cancels out.

The equilibrium temperature T_eq is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis `a`:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1/√a\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the temperatures is:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a2 / a1)\n\nThe semi-major axis `a` can be related to the planet's mass (m_p) and the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K_star) it induces.

Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is the temperature it would have if it were a perfect blackbody heated only by its star. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_eff_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_eff_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n*   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 (T_eq1) and Planet2 (T_eq2), we can set up the following equation:\n\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [T_eff_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_eff_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\nGiven that both planets orbit the same star, `T_eff_star` and `R_star` are constant. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n\n**(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)**\n\nThis shows that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n### 2. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity\n\nThe problem provides the Doppler shifts caused by each planet, which allows us to determine the star's radial velocity (RV) amplitude, K. The RV amplitude is related to the planet's mass (M_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the semi-major axis (a). For a circular orbit, this relationship is:\n\nK = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nWhere `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n\na = (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n### 3. Calculating the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes\n\nNow we can find the ratio `a₂ / a₁`:\n\n(a₂ / a₁) = [(G * M_p₂²) / (M_star * K₂²)] / [(G * M_p₁²) / (M_star * K₁²)]\n\nThe terms for the gravitational constant `G` and the star's mass `M_star` cancel out, leaving:\n\n**(a₂ / a₁) = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²**\n\nThe radial velocity amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift `Δλ` (K = c * Δλ / λ, where c and λ are constant).

The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * [ (1 - A) * R_star² / (4 * a²) ]^(1/4)\n\nThis can be simplified to:\n\nT_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2)) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, most terms cancel out, leaving a simple relationship:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we first need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes of their orbits.\n\n**2. Relate the Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data**\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method measures the \"wobble\" of a star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K_star) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\nK_star = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\nWhere:\n*   `M_p` is the mass of the planet.\n*   `M_star` is the mass of the star.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis.\n*(This formula assumes the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's and the orbit is viewed edge-on (sin(i) ≈ 1), which is a valid assumption for a transiting planet).*\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\n\na = G * M_p² / (M_star * K_star²)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio `a2 / a1`:\n\na2 / a1 = [G * M2² / (M_star * K_star2²)] / [G * M1² / (M_star * K_star1²)]\n\nThe terms `G` and `M_star` cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n\na2 / a1 = (M2 / M1)² * (K_star1 / K_star2)²\n\n**3. Calculate the Ratios of Mass and RV Semi-Amplitude**\n\n*   **Mass Ratio (M2 / M1):**\n    *   M1 = 7 M_earth\n    *   M2 = 5 M_earth\n    *   M2 / M1 = 5 / 7\n\n*   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio (K_star1 / K_star2):**\n    The semi-amplitude `K_star` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) it causes.\n    K_star = c * (Δλ / λ_0)\n    So, the ratio `K_star1 / K_star2` is equal to the ratio `Δλ1 / Δλ2`.\n    *   Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n    *   Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n    *   K_star1 / K_star2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\n\nNow, substitute the calculated ratios back into the equation for `a2 / a1`:\n\na2 / a1 = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\na2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio**\n\nFinally, use the ratio of the semi-major axes to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 32:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nWhere:\n-   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n-   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n-   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n-   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n\nThe problem states that the star's properties (T_star, R_star) are the same for both planets and that the planets have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, most terms cancel out:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we need to determine the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n### 2. Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity\n\nThe problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method, which measures the Doppler shift of the star's light caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * v_p\n\nwhere M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, and v_p is the planet's orbital velocity. The planet's orbital velocity is:\n\nv_p ≈ sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nSubstituting v_p into the equation for K:\n\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\nK ≈ (M_p / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a)\n\nNow, we solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\n\nsqrt(a) ≈ (M_p / (K * sqrt(M_star))) * sqrt(G)\na ≈ G/M_star * (M_p / K)²\n\n### 3. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\n\nWe can now find the ratio a2 / a1:\n\na2 / a1 = [G/M_star * (M_p2 / K2)²] / [G/M_star * (M_p1 / K1)²]\n\nThe terms G and M_star cancel out, leaving:\n\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / K2)² / (M_p1 / K1)²\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n\n### 4. Plugging in the Given Values\n\nThe problem provides the following:\n-   Planet1 mass (M_p1) = 7 M_earth\n-   Planet2 mass (M_p2) = 5 M_earth\n-   Planet1 induced Doppler shift (Δλ1) = 0.03 Å\n-   Planet2 induced Doppler shift (Δλ2) = 0.04 Å\n\nThe radial velocity amplitude K is directly proportional to the Doppler shift Δλ (since K = c * Δλ / λ). Therefore, the ratio K1 / K2 is equal to the ratio Δλ1 / Δλ2.\n\n-   Ratio of masses: M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n-   Ratio of radial velocity amplitudes: K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nNow, we substitute these ratios into the equation for a2 / a1:\n\na2 / a1 = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\na2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n### 5. Calculating the Final Temperature Ratio\n\nFinally, we use the ratio of the semi-major axes to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.98\nB) ~ 1.05\nC) ~ 1.30\nD) ~ 0.53\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\n    `T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\n    where `T_star` is the star's temperature, `A` is the planet's albedo, `R_star` is the star's radius, and `a` is the orbital distance (semi-major axis).\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** To find T_eq1 / T_eq2, we divide the formula for Planet1 by the formula for Planet2:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]`\n    Since `T_star`, `R_star`, and the albedo (`A1 = A2`) are the same for both, they cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`\n\n4.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Given Quantities:** We need to find the ratio `a2 / a1`. We are given the planet masses and the Doppler shifts they induce on the star. The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) of a star due to a planet in a circular orbit is related to the planet's mass (m_p) and orbital distance (a) by:\n    `K ∝ m_p / sqrt(a)`\n    This means `sqrt(a) ∝ m_p / K`, and therefore `a ∝ (m_p / K)^2`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Orbital Distance Ratio (a2 / a1):**\n    `a2 / a1 = (m2 / K2)^2 / (m1 / K1)^2 = (m2 / m1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`\n\n6.  **Relate Radial Velocity (K) to Doppler Shift (Δλ):** The Doppler shift formula is `Δλ / λ = v_r / c`. The maximum radial velocity is K, so `K = c * (Δλ / λ)`. The ratio of the radial velocities is therefore equal to the ratio of their Doppler shifts:\n    `K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2`\n\n7.  **Combine the Formulas:** Substitute the Doppler shift ratio back into the orbital distance ratio equation:\n    `a2 / a1 = (m2 / m1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2`\n    Now substitute this into our simplified temperature ratio formula:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((m2 / m1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (m2 / m1) * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)`\n\n8.  **Execute the Calculation:** Plug in the given values for the masses (`m1 = 7`, `m2 = 5`) and Doppler shifts (`Δλ1 = 0.03`, `Δλ2 = 0.04`) to find the final ratio.\n\n```python\n# Planetary and Doppler shift data\n# Mass of Planet1 in Earth masses\nm1 = 7.0\n# Mass of Planet2 in Earth masses\nm2 = 5.0\n\n# Doppler shift induced by Planet1 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda1 = 0.03\n# Doppler shift induced by Planet2 in Angstroms\ndelta_lambda2 = 0.04\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 can be derived as:\n# T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n# And the orbital distance 'a' is related to planet mass 'm' and RV semi-amplitude 'K' by:\n# a is proportional to (m / K)^2\n# The RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to the Doppler shift delta_lambda.\n# So, T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(((m2/K2)^2) / ((m1/K1)^2))\n# This simplifies to T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (m2/m1) * (K1/K2) = (m2/m1) * (delta_lambda1/delta_lambda2)\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the masses (m2 / m1)\nmass_ratio = m2 / m1\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the Doppler shifts (delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2)\ndoppler_ratio = delta_lambda1 / delta_lambda2\n\n# Calculate the final ratio of the equilibrium temperatures\ntemp_ratio = mass_ratio * doppler_ratio\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(f\"The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) is: {temp_ratio:.2f}\")\n\n# Print the options for comparison\nprint(\"A) ~ 0.53\")\nprint(\"B) ~ 0.98\")\nprint(\"C) ~ 1.30\")\nprint(\"D) ~ 1.05\")\n```\n<<<A>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) is: 0.54\nA) ~ 0.53\nB) ~ 0.98\nC) ~ 1.30\nD) ~ 1.05\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 34:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and Key Formulas\n\nThe main goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\nThe formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is:\nT_eq = T_eff_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\nWhere:\n*   T_eff_star is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   A is the planet's Bond albedo.\n*   R_star is the radius of the star.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWhen we take the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 and Planet2, many terms will cancel out.\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_eff_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_eff_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n\nWe are given that:\n*   The star's properties (T_eff_star, R_star) are the same for both planets.\n*   The albedos are the same (A1 = A2).\n\nTherefore, the formula simplifies to:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1)) / sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((R_star / (2 * a1)) * ((2 * a2) / R_star))\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nThe problem now reduces to finding the ratio of the semi-major axes of the two planets, a2 / a1.\n\n### Step 2: Relate Semi-Major Axis to Observable Quantities\n\nWe can find the semi-major axis (`a`) by relating it to the information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV method measures the wobble of the star, and the maximum velocity of this wobble is the RV amplitude, K_star.\n\nThe Doppler shift formula gives us K_star:\nΔλ / λ_0 = v / c => K_star = c * (Δλ_max / λ_0)\nThis means K_star is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift, Δλ_max. So, K_star1 / K_star2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2.\n\nFor a circular orbit (as given) and assuming the planet's mass (M_p) is much smaller than the star's mass (M_star), the RV amplitude of the star can be related to the planet's orbital velocity (V_p) through conservation of momentum:\nM_star * K_star ≈ M_p * V_p\n\nThe orbital velocity of the planet is given by:\nV_p = sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nSubstituting V_p into the momentum equation:\nM_star * K_star ≈ M_p * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nSolving for K_star:\nK_star ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\nNow, we solve this equation for the semi-major axis `a`:\nK_star^2 = M_p^2 * (G / (M_star * a))\na = (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K_star^2)\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1)\n\nUsing the formula for `a` derived above, we can find the ratio a2 / a1. The terms G and M_star are constant for both planets and will cancel out.\na ∝ M_p^2 / K_star^2\n\nSo, the ratio is:\na2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K_star2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K_star1^2)\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_star1 / K_star2)^2\n\nNow, let's plug in the values from the problem:\n*   Ratio of planet masses: M_p2 / M_p1 = (5 M_earth) / (7 M_earth) = 5/7\n*   Ratio of RV amplitudes (which is the ratio of Doppler shifts): K_star1 / K_star2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4\n\nSubstitute these ratios into the equation for a2 / a1:\na2 / a1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2\na2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures\n\nNow we can use the result from Step 1 and the value from Step 3:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\n\nCalculate the square root:\nsqrt(225) = 15\nsqrt(784) = 28\nSo, T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\nFinally, convert the fraction to a decimal:\n15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   The problem provides extra information (star's mass, radius, and temperature; planets' radii) that is not needed for calculating the *ratio* of the temperatures. This is a common feature in physics problems to test understanding of which variables are relevant.\n*   The assumption that the inclination angle `i` is ~90° (sin(i) ≈ 1) is justified because the planets were detected by the transit method, which requires an almost edge-on view.\n*   The assumption that M_p << M_star is valid and simplifies Kepler's Third Law and the momentum balance.\n*   The key simplification is that for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures, only the ratio of the semi-major axes matters, provided the star and planetary albedos are the same.\n\nThe final calculated ratio of ~0.53 matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 35:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A_p)^(1/4)\n    Where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   A_p is the planet's bond albedo.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We can write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for the two planets as:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A_p1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A_p2)^(1/4)]\n\n    Since both planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are the same. The problem states that both planets have the same albedo (A_p1 = A_p2). Therefore, most terms cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a1)^(-1/2) / (a2)^(-1/2) = (a2 / a1)^(1/2) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\n4.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Given Parameters:** We need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a1). The problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method, specifically the Doppler shift (Δλ), which relates to the star's RV semi-amplitude (K). For a planet in a circular orbit (and assuming the planet's mass M_p is much less than the star's mass M_star), the star's RV semi-amplitude is:\n    K = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * v_p\n    where v_p = sqrt(G * M_star / a) is the planet's orbital velocity.\n    Since the planets are detected by the transit method, their orbital inclination `i` is close to 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1.\n    Substituting v_p into the equation for K:\n    K = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = (M_p / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a)\n\n5.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We can rearrange the formula to solve for `a`:\n    K² = (M_p² / M_star) * (G / a)\n    a = (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1):** Now we can find the ratio a2 / a1. The gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) are the same for both planets and will cancel out:\n    a2 / a1 = [ (G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K2²) ] / [ (G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K1²) ]\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2² / K2²) * (K1² / M_p1²)\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n\n7.  **Calculate the Necessary Ratios:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio (M_p2 / M_p1):**\n        M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n        M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n        M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n    *   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio (K1 / K2):** The RV semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the Doppler shift Δλ (K = c * Δλ / λ). Therefore, the ratio K1 / K2 is equal to the ratio Δλ1 / Δλ2.\n        Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n        Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n        K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n8.  **Substitute Ratios to find a2 / a1:**\n    a2 / a1 = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\n    a2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    a2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 37:\nThe web search results confirm the key physical principles and formulas used in the initial reasoning.\n\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the star's properties (luminosity/temperature and radius) and the planet's semi-major axis and albedo. The formula derived in the thought process, `T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`, is standard. For a fixed star and the same albedo for both planets, the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2` simplifies to `sqrt(a2 / a1)`.\n*   **Doppler Shift and Radial Velocity:** The radial velocity (v_r) is directly proportional to the Doppler shift (Δλ) via the formula v_r = c * (Δλ / λ_0), where λ_0 is the rest wavelength. This confirms that the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K) is equal to the ratio of the observed Doppler shifts: `K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2`.\n*   **Radial Velocity Semi-amplitude (K):** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the masses of the star (M_star) and planet (M_p), and the semi-major axis (a). The formula, assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's (`M_p << M_star`) and the orbit is viewed edge-on (`sin(i)≈1`), is `K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`. This is the same relationship used in the initial analysis.\n\nThe plan remains the same, as the physics and formulas have been verified.\n\n**1. Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1):**\nFrom the radial velocity formula `K ≈ (M_p / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a)`, we can solve for 'a':\n`a ≈ G * M_p^2 / (K^2 * M_star)`\nThe ratio of the semi-major axes is then:\n`a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K1^2) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`\n\n**2. Substitute the known values:**\n*   Mass ratio: `M_p2 / M_p1 = (5 M_earth) / (7 M_earth) = 5 / 7`\n*   Radial velocity ratio from Doppler shifts: `K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4`\n\nNow, calculate `a2 / a1`:\n`a2 / a1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2`\n`a2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)`\n`a2 / a1 = 225 / 784`\n\n**3.

Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star and its own properties. The formula is:\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n*   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 (T_eq1) and Planet2 (T_eq2), we can set up the following equation:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a₁))^(1/2) * (1 - A₁)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a₂))^(1/2) * (1 - A₂)^(1/4)]\n\nGiven that both planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are identical for both. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, most terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (1 / a₁)^(1/2) / (1 / a₂)^(1/2) = (a₂ / a₁)^(1/2)\n\nThe problem now is to determine the ratio of the semi-major axes (a₂ / a₁).\n\n### 2. Relating Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters\nThe periodic Doppler shift (Δλ) in the star's light is caused by its \"wobble\" as the planets orbit it. This shift is related to the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) by the formula:\nK = c * (Δλ / λ₀)\nwhere `c` is the speed of light and `λ₀` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * (G * M_star / a)^(1/2)\n\nWhere:\n*   `M_p` is the planet's mass.\n*   `M_star` is the star's mass.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\nWe can rearrange the formula for K to solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\na ≈ G * M_p² / (K² * M_star)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = [G * M_p₂² / (K₂² * M_star)] / [G * M_p₁² / (K₁² * M_star)]\n\nThe terms for `G` and `M_star` cancel out, leaving:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p₂² / M_p₁²) * (K₁² / K₂²) = (M_p₂ / M_p₁)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\nThe ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K₁ / K₂) can be found directly from the ratio of their Doppler shifts (Δλ):\nK₁ / K₂ = [c * (Δλ₁ / λ₀)] / [c * (Δλ₂ / λ₀)] = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n### 4. Plugging in the Values\nLet's substitute the given values into the equations:\n\n*   **Mass ratio (M_p₂ / M_p₁):**\n    M_p₂ / M_p₁ = (5 Earth masses) / (7 Earth masses) = 5 / 7\n\n*   **Doppler shift ratio (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂):**\n    Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4\n    Therefore, K₁ / K₂ = 3 / 4\n\n*   **Ratio of semi-major axes (a₂ / a₁):**\n    a₂ / a₁ = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)² = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16) = 225 / 784\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\nFinally, we can calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a₂ / a₁)^(1/2) = (225 / 784)^(1/2) = 15 / 28\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 39:\nThis problem requires us to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets.\n\n**1. Formulate the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\nwhere `T_star` is the star's temperature, `R_star` is the star's radius, `a` is the orbital semi-major axis, and `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\nTo find the ratio for Planet1 and Planet2, we have:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * (R_star / (2 * a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (`A1` = `A2`). Therefore, most terms cancel out, leaving:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (1 / a1)^(1/2) / (1 / a2)^(1/2) = (a2 / a1)^(1/2)\n\nOur goal is now to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, `a2 / a1`.\n\n**2. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit causing a radial velocity (RV) variation in its star, the RV semi-amplitude (K) is given by:\nK ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (a * M_star))\n(Assuming the planet's mass `M_p` is much less than the star's mass `M_star`).\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\nK² ≈ M_p² * G / (a * M_star)\na ≈ (G * M_p²) / (K² * M_star)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio `a2 / a1`:\na2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2²) / (K₂² * M_star)] / [(G * M_p1²) / (K₁² * M_star)]\n\nThe gravitational constant `G` and the star's mass `M_star` cancel out:\na2 / a1 = (M_p2² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p1²)\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**3. Relate RV Amplitude to Doppler Shift**\n\nThe Doppler shift `Δλ` is directly proportional to the radial velocity `v`, and therefore the RV semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift.\nK = c * (Δλ / λ₀)\nSo, the ratio of the amplitudes `K₁ / K₂` is equal to the ratio of their observed maximum Doppler shifts `Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`.\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n**4. Combine and Calculate**\n\nSubstitute the Doppler shift ratio into the equation for `a2 / a1`:\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²\n\nNow, we can substitute this entire expression back into our temperature ratio formula from Step 1:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a1)^(1/2)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [ (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)² ]^(1/2)\n\nThe square root cancels the squares:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\n**5.

The information about the star's mass, radius, temperature, and the planets' radii is extraneous and not needed for the final ratio calculation.\n\nThe provided code output `0.5357142857142857` confirms this calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 40:\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere:\n*   $T_{eff}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n*   $R_*$ is the star's radius.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   $A$ is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\nLet's set up the ratio:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{eff} \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{eff} \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{eff}$ and $R_*$ are the same for both. It also states that they have the same albedo, so $A_1 = A_2$. We can cancel these terms from the equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we first need to determine the ratio of the semi-major axes, $a_2 / a_1$. We can find this using the information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The semi-amplitude of the radial velocity ($K$) is related to the planet mass ($M_p$), star mass ($M_*$), and semi-major axis ($a$). For a circular orbit ($e=0$) and assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's ($M_p \\ll M_*$), the formula is:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{M_* a}} \\sqrt{G}$\nwhere $i$ is the orbital inclination. Since both planets were detected via the transit method, their orbits must be nearly edge-on, so we can assume $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$. The formula simplifies to:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{\\sqrt{M_* a}}$\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for $a$:\n$\\sqrt{a} \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{K \\sqrt{M_*}} \\implies a \\approx \\frac{M_p^2 G}{K^2 M_*}$\n\nNow we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p,2}^2 G / (K_2^2 M_*)}{M_{p,1}^2 G / (K_1^2 M_*)}$\nThe gravitational constant $G$ and the star's mass $M_*$ cancel out:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nThe radial velocity semi-amplitude $K$ is directly proportional to the observed Doppler shift $\\Delta\\lambda$ ($K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$). Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nWe are given the masses of the planets:\n$M_{p,1} = 7 M_{Earth}$\n$M_{p,2} = 5 M_{Earth}$\nSo the mass ratio is:\n$\\frac{M_{p,2}}{M_{p,1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\nNow, we substitute these ratios back into the equation for $a_2/a_1$:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\nFinally, we calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nCalculating the decimal value:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 41:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet depends on the star's properties and the planet's orbit. The formula is:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    Where `T_star` is the star's temperature, `A` is the planet's albedo, `R_star` is the star's radius, and `a` is the planet's semi-major axis.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Temperature Ratio:** We can write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for the two planets as:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem provides several conditions that allow for simplification:\n    *   Both planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both and cancel out.\n    *   Both planets are stated to have the same albedo, so `A₁ = A₂`, and the `(1 - A)^(1/4)` term cancels out.\n    *   The constant `2` also cancels from the square root.\n    After simplification, the ratio becomes:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a₁) / sqrt(1 / a₂) = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n    This means the problem is now reduced to finding the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n5.  **Connect Observations to Physical Properties:** The problem provides Doppler shifts (`Δλ`) and planet masses (`M_p`). We need to relate these to the semi-major axis (`a`). The Doppler shift is caused by the star's radial velocity (`v_r`), which is induced by the orbiting planet. The maximum radial velocity is the semi-amplitude, K.\n    The formula relating `K` to the planet's properties, for a circular orbit and a planet much less massive than the star, is:\n    K ≈ (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n    where `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n6.  **Incorporate Transit Information:** The problem states the planets were detected by both transit and RV methods. A transit is only seen if the system is edge-on, meaning the inclination `i` ≈ 90°. For this inclination, `sin(i)` ≈ 1. The formula simplifies to:\n    K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = (M_p / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G / a)\n\n7.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We can rearrange the equation to solve for `a`:\n    K² ≈ (M_p² * G) / (M_star * a)\n    a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n8.  **Calculate the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a₂/a₁):**\n    a₂ / a₁ = [ (G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\n    The constants `G` and `M_star` cancel out, leaving:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2² / K₂²) / (M_p1² / K₁²) = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n9.  **Relate RV Semi-Amplitude (K) to Doppler Shift (Δλ):** The Doppler formula states `Δλ / λ₀ = v_r / c`. The maximum shift `Δλ_max` corresponds to `K`.\n    Therefore, `K` is directly proportional to `Δλ_max`. The ratio of the semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts:\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n10. **Combine Ratios:** Substitute the result from step 9 into the equation from step 8:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²\n    Now substitute this back into our simplified temperature ratio from step 4:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁) = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)² )\n    Taking the square root gives the final, simple relationship:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\n11. **Final Calculation:** Plug the given values into this final formula.\n    *   M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n    *   M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n    *   Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n    *   Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n\n```python\n# Ratio of planet masses (M_p2 / M_p1)\nmass_ratio = 5.0 / 7.0\n\n# Ratio of Doppler shifts (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\nshift_ratio = 0.03 / 0.04\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is the product of these two ratios.\nequilibrium_temp_ratio = mass_ratio * shift_ratio\n\nprint(equilibrium_temp_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.5357142857142857\n</execute_code>\nThe calculation shows that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is approximately 0.536.

The equilibrium temperature of a planet is dependent on its star's temperature and the distance of the planet from that star. This distance, the semi-major axis, can be inferred from radial velocity measurements.**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is calculated by balancing the energy absorbed from its star with the energy it radiates away.

Given that both planets orbit the same star (constant T_eff and R_star) and have the same albedo (A), these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\nThe next step is to determine the semi-major axes (`a_1` and `a_2`) using the provided radial velocity (RV) data. The maximum radial velocity (K) of a star, induced by an orbiting planet in a circular orbit, is given by:\n\nK ≈ sqrt(G / a) * (M_p / sqrt(M_star))\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M_p is the planet's mass, and M_star is the star's mass. The Doppler shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to this radial velocity (K = c * Δλ / λ_0). We can rearrange the formula to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n\na ∝ (M_p / K)^2\n\nSince K is proportional to the Doppler shift Δλ, we can write:\n\na ∝ (M_p / Δλ)^2\n\nNow, we can establish the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / Δλ_2)^2 / (M_p1 / Δλ_1)^2 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2\n\nUsing the given values:\n*   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n*   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n*   Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n\nWe can calculate the ratios:\n*   M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n*   Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for a_2 / a_1:\n\na_2 / a_1 = (5/7)^2 * (3/4)^2 = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784\n\nFinally, we can find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1) = sqrt(225 / 784) = 15 / 28\n\nCalculating the decimal value:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis result is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 45:\nHere is the step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n### 1.

Relating Doppler Shift to Semi-Major Axis\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method measures the periodic Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K).\n\nThe relationship is: $K = c \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$, where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nThe radial velocity amplitude (K) for a star with a single planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $M_p$ is the mass of the planet.\n*   $M_{star}$ is the mass of the star.\n*   $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n*   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis.\n\nSince both planets were detected using the transit method, their orbits must be edge-on, which means the inclination $i \\approx 90^\\circ$ and $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n\nWe can now rearrange the formula to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n\n$K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2}{M_{star}} \\frac{G}{a} \\implies a = \\frac{G \\cdot M_p^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K^2}$\n\n### 3. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\n\nNow we can compute the ratio $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{\\frac{G \\cdot M_{p2}^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K_2^2}}{\\frac{G \\cdot M_{p1}^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K_1^2}}$\n\nSince $G$ and $M_{star}$ are the same for both planets, they cancel out:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2}{K_2^2} \\cdot \\frac{K_1^2}{M_{p1}^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\nThe ratio of the RV amplitudes ($K_1/K_2$) is directly proportional to the ratio of their observed Doppler shifts ($\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$):\n\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\, \\text{Å}}{0.04 \\, \\text{Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nThe ratio of the planet masses is given as:\n\n$\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\, M_{Earth}}{7 \\, M_{Earth}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\nNow, substitute these ratios back into the equation for $\\frac{a_2}{a_1}$:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\cdot \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\n\nFinally, calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 46:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures.\n\n**1. Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the radius of the star.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n\n**2. Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n\nWe need to find the ratio $T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$.\n$T_{eq1} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}$\n$T_{eq2} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}$\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both. The problem states that the albedos are the same ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, when we take the ratio, these terms cancel out:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\nSo, to find the temperature ratio, we first need to find the ratio of the orbital distances, $a_2 / a_1$.\n\n**3. Using Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\n\nThe maximum Doppler shift (Δλ) is related to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) by:\n$K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda_0}$\nwhere c is the speed of light and λ₀ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nThe ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes for the two planets is:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\lambda_0}}{c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_0}} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2}$\n\nUsing the given values:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n**4. Relating RV Amplitude to Planet Properties**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude (K) is given by:\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a}}$\n(This is a common form derived from Kepler's laws, assuming the planet mass $M_p$ is much smaller than the star mass $M_{star}$).\n\nSince both transit and RV methods work, the inclination angle $i$ is very close to 90°, so we can assume $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n\nNow, let's form the ratio $K_1 / K_2$:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\frac{M_{p1}}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a_1}}}{\\frac{M_{p2}}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{a_2}}} = \\frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\n**5. Solving for the Orbital Distance Ratio**\n\nWe can now rearrange the equation to solve for the term we need for the temperature ratio, $\\sqrt{a_2 / a_1}$:\n\n$\\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\times \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}$\n\nNow, we plug in the known values:\n*   $K_1 / K_2 = 3/4$\n*   $M_{p1} = 7$ Earth masses\n*   $M_{p2} = 5$ Earth masses\n*   $M_{p2} / M_{p1} = 5 / 7$\n\n$\\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right) = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\n**6. Final Calculation**\n\nFrom Step 2, we know that the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is equal to this value:\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nConverting this fraction to a decimal:\n$15 \\div 28 \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is closest to 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 47:\nThe final answer is C. Here's a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy balance between the radiation it receives from its star and the energy it radiates back into space. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_eff * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2a))\n\nwhere:\n*   T_eff is the star's effective temperature.\n*   A is the planet's albedo.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet 1 and Planet 2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_eff * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2a₁))] / [T_eff * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2a₂))]\n\nAccording to the problem description, both planets orbit the same star (so T_eff and R_star are the same) and possess the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we first need to determine the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.\n\n### 2. Relating Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters\n\nThe problem provides the periodic Doppler shifts (Δλ) caused by each planet. The Doppler shift is related to the star's maximum radial velocity (the semi-amplitude, K) by the formula:\n\nΔλ / λ₀ = K / c\n\nwhere c is the speed of light and λ₀ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line (6300 Å). The ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes is therefore equal to the ratio of their Doppler shifts:\n\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3/4\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass (M_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the semi-major axis (a) by the following approximation (assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass, and the orbit is viewed edge-on, which is a reasonable assumption for a transiting planet):\n\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nThis can be simplified to:\n\nK ≈ M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n\n### 3. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\n\nWe can express the relationship for each planet:\n\nK₁ ≈ M_p1 * sqrt(G / (M_star * a₁))\nK₂ ≈ M_p2 * sqrt(G / (M_star * a₂))\n\nNow, let's find the ratio K₁ / K₂ from these expressions:\n\nK₁ / K₂ = [M_p1 * sqrt(G / (M_star * a₁))] / [M_p2 * sqrt(G / (M_star * a₂))]\nK₁ / K₂ = (M_p1 / M_p2) * sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n\nWe want to find sqrt(a₂ / a₁), which is our temperature ratio. We can rearrange the equation:\n\nsqrt(a₂ / a₁) = (K₁ / K₂) * (M_p2 / M_p1)\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\n\nNow, we substitute the known values into the equation:\n\n*   The ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes: K₁ / K₂ = 3/4\n*   The ratio of the planetary masses: M_p2 / M_p1 = (5 Earth masses) / (7 Earth masses) = 5/7\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁) = (3/4) * (5/7)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.53.

We must derive them from the provided radial velocity (RV) data.\n    *   The maximum radial velocity of the star (the RV semi-amplitude, K) is proportional to the Doppler shift (Δλ): K = c * (Δλ / λ₀). Therefore, the ratio K1/K2 is equal to the ratio Δλ1/Δλ2.\n    *   For a planet in a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by: K = M_planet * sqrt(G / (a * M_star)).\n    *   By rearranging this formula for 'a', we get: a = G * M_planet² / (K² * M_star).\n    *   Now, we can find the ratio a2/a1:\n        a2 / a1 = [G * M_p2² / (K2² * M_star)] / [G * M_p1² / (K1² * M_star)]\n    *   The gravitational constant G and the star's mass M_star cancel out, leaving:\n        a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n    *   Since K1/K2 = Δλ1/Δλ2, the final expression for the semi-major axis ratio is:\n        a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)²\n\n6.  **Calculate and Conclude:** Substitute the given values for planet masses and Doppler shifts into the equation to find a2/a1, then take the square root to find the temperature ratio and match it to the given options.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Given Data ---\n# Planet 1\nm_p1 = 7.0  # Earth masses\nd_lambda1 = 0.03  # Angstroms\n\n# Planet 2\nm_p2 = 5.0  # Earth masses\nd_lambda2 = 0.04  # Angstroms\n\n# --- Step-by-step Calculation ---\n\n# 1.

The formula is:\n    `T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))`\n    where:\n    *   `T_star` is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   `R_star` is the star's radius.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n    *   `A` is the planet's bond albedo.\n\n3.  **Form the Ratio of Temperatures:** We can write the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2` as:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]`\n    The problem states that the star's properties (`T_star`, `R_star`) are the same for both planets and that the albedos are the same (`A_1 = A_2`). Therefore, these terms cancel out, leaving a simplified ratio:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)`\n\n4.  **Relate Orbital Distance to Given Data:** The semi-major axes (`a_1`, `a_2`) are not given directly. We must derive them from the radial velocity (RV) data.\n    The maximum Doppler shift (`Δλ_max`) is related to the star's radial velocity amplitude (`K`) by:\n    `K = c * (Δλ_max / λ_0)` where `c` is the speed of light and `λ_0` is the rest wavelength.\n    The radial velocity amplitude (`K`) for a star orbited by a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    `K = (M_p / M_star) * v_p * sin(i)` where `M_p` is planet mass, `M_star` is star mass, `v_p` is planet's orbital speed, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n    Since the planets are detected by both transit and RV methods, we can assume an edge-on orbit, so `sin(i) ≈ 1`.\n    The planet's orbital speed `v_p` is given by `v_p = sqrt(G * (M_star + M_p) / a)`. Since `M_p << M_star`, this simplifies to `v_p ≈ sqrt(G * M_star / a)`.\n    Substituting `v_p` into the equation for `K`:\n    `K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\n    Solving for the semi-major axis `a`:\n    `K^2 = (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a) = (M_p^2 * G) / (M_star * a)`\n    `a = (M_p^2 * G) / (M_star * K^2)`\n\n5.  **Form the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Now we can find the ratio `a_2 / a_1`:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = [(M_p2^2 * G) / (M_star * K_2^2)] / [(M_p1^2 * G) / (M_star * K_1^2)]`\n    The constants `G` and `M_star` cancel out:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_2^2) * (K_1^2 / M_p1^2) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2`\n    Since `K` is directly proportional to `Δλ_max`, we have `K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`. Substituting this in:\n    `a_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:** Substitute the expression for `a_2 / a_1` back into the temperature ratio equation from step 3:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)^2 )`\n    The square root and the squares cancel, leaving:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2)`\n\n**Careful Points**\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides several pieces of information that are not needed to calculate the final ratio, such as the star's mass, radius, and temperature, and the planets' radii.

This confirms that the ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2` is equal to `sqrt(a2 / a1)`.\n\n3.  **Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude (K):** For a circular orbit (eccentricity e=0) and assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_p << M_star`), the semi-amplitude `K` is given by formulas that simplify to `K` being proportional to `M_p / sqrt(a)`.\n    Source provides the relevant formulas for a circular orbit:\n    *   `v_star = (M_p / (M_star + M_p)) * v_K`\n    *   `v_K = sqrt(G * (M_star + M_p) / a)`\n    *   The observed radial velocity is `K = v_star * sin(i)`.\n    Combining and simplifying these (assuming `M_p << M_star` and `sin(i) ≈ 1`):\n    `K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)`\n    `K ≈ (M_p * sqrt(G)) / (sqrt(M_star) * sqrt(a))`\n    This confirms the proportionality `K ∝ M_p / sqrt(a)`.\n\nThe derivation remains solid.\n\n*   **Goal:** Find `T_eq1 / T_eq2`.\n*   **From formula:** `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)`.\n*   **Derivation:**\n    *   From the radial velocity formula, `K ∝ M_p / sqrt(a)`.\n    *   Therefore, `K1 / K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * sqrt(a2 / a1)`.\n    *   From the Doppler shift formula, `K1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`.\n    *   Combining these: `Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * sqrt(a2 / a1)`.\n*   **Solve for the temperature ratio:**\n    *   `sqrt(a2 / a1) = (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2) * (M_p2 / M_p1)`.\n    *   `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2) * (M_p2 / M_p1)`.\n*   **Plug in values:**\n    *   `Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 0.75`.\n    *   `M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7`.\n    *   `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 0.75 * (5 / 7) = (3/4) * (5/7) = 15 / 28`.\n*   **Calculate:**\n    *   `15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357`.\n\nThis result matches option C. The extraneous information (star's parameters, planets' radii) did not affect the final ratio. The logic is sound and confirmed by standard astronomical formulas.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation:\nI will present the step-by-step derivation, starting from the formulas for equilibrium temperature and radial velocity, to arrive at the final numerical answer.\n\n1.

Substitute the given values and calculate the result.\n\nThis seems complete.\n\nTo provide a comprehensive answer to the user based on the prompt provided, I've performed the following analysis:\n\n### 1. Identify the Goal\nThe objective is to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets (Planet1 and Planet2), denoted as T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n### 2. Recall Key Formulas\nThe solution requires two main physical principles:\n*   **Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):** The temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from its star and the energy it radiates away. For a given star, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis, `a`).\n    *   T_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n*   **Radial Velocity (RV) Method:** A planet's gravitational pull causes its host star to \"wobble,\" inducing a periodic Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines. For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is directly proportional to the planet's mass (M_p) and inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis (`a`).\n    *   K ∝ M_p / √a\n\n### 3. Formulate the Ratios\n\n*   **Temperature Ratio:** Based on the T_eq formula, the ratio of the two planets' equilibrium temperatures is:\n    *   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (1 / √a1) / (1 / √a2) = √ (a2 / a1)\n*   **Radial Velocity Ratio:** Based on the RV formula, the ratio of the star's wobble induced by each planet is:\n    *   K1 / K2 = (M_p1 / √a1) / (M_p2 / √a2) = (M_p1 / M_p2) * √ (a2 / a1)\n\n### 4. Connect the Formulas\nNotice that the term `√(a2 / a1)` is present in both ratio equations. This allows us to connect them. We can substitute the temperature ratio into the radial velocity ratio equation:\n*   K1 / K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * (T_eq1 / T_eq2)\n\n### 5. Incorporate Given Data\nThe problem provides the Doppler shift (`Δλ`) for each planet, which is directly proportional to the radial velocity semi-amplitude (`K`).\n*   K ∝ Δλ  => K1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2\n\nNow, substitute this into the combined equation:\n*   Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * (T_eq1 / T_eq2)\n\n### 6. Solve for the Unknown\nThe goal is to find T_eq1 / T_eq2. Rearranging the equation:\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2) * (M_p2 / M_p1)\n\n### 7. Substitute Values and Calculate\nPlug in the given values:\n*   `Δλ_1` = 0.03 Å\n*   `Δλ_2` = 0.04 Å\n*   `M_p1` = 7 Earth masses\n*   `M_p2` = 5 Earth masses\n\nCalculation:\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (0.03 / 0.04) * (5 / 7)\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (3 / 4) * (5 / 7)\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\n### 8. Final Conclusion\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.53, which corresponds to option C. The information regarding the star's properties (mass, radius, temperature) and the planets' radii was not needed for this specific ratio calculation as these terms cancel out.\n\nThe calculation is finalized and ready to be presented.\n\nFinal Answer is C.\n\nFinal Check. No issues found. The reasoning is sound and calculations are straightforward. All necessary information was used, and unnecessary information was correctly identified as such.\n\n<<<C>>>\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 can be determined by using the principles of planetary equilibrium temperature and the radial velocity method. Here is a step-by-step derivation:\n\n**1. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n\nA planet's equilibrium temperature (`T_eq`) depends on its star's temperature and radius, and the planet's distance from the star (semi-major axis, `a`). The relationship is given by `T_eq ∝ 1/√a`. Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 and Planet2 is:\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a2 / a1)`\n\nTo solve this, we need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, `a2 / a1`.\n\n**2. Radial Velocity and Doppler Shift**\n\nThe problem provides the periodic Doppler shifts (`Δλ`) in a spectral line caused by each planet. This shift is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (`K`).\n\n`K ∝ Δλ`\n\nSo, the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes is:\n\n`K1 / K2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 0.75`\n\n**3. Relating Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters**\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the radial velocity semi-amplitude (`K`) it induces on its star is proportional to the planet's mass (`M_p`) and inversely proportional to the square root of its semi-major axis (`a`).\n\n`K ∝ M_p / √a`\n\nTherefore, the ratio `K1 / K2` can also be expressed as:\n\n`K1 / K2 = (M_p1 / √a1) / (M_p2 / √a2) = (M_p1 / M_p2) * √(a2 / a1)`\n\n**4. Combining the Equations**\n\nWe now have two expressions for `K1 / K2`. We can set them equal to each other and substitute the temperature ratio `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a2 / a1)`:\n\n`(M_p1 / M_p2) * (T_eq1 / T_eq2) = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2`\n\n**5. Solving for the Temperature Ratio**\n\nWe can now rearrange the formula to solve for the desired temperature ratio:\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (Δλ_1 / Δλ_2) * (M_p2 / M_p1)`\n\n**6. Calculation**\n\nSubstitute the given values into the equation:\n*   `Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.75`\n*   `M_p1 = 7` Earth masses\n*   `M_p2 = 5` Earth masses\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 0.75 * (5 / 7) = (3/4) * (5/7) = 15 / 28`\n\n`T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   A is the planet's albedo.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n2.  **Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n    We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\n    Since both planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are the same. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂). Therefore, most terms cancel out, leaving:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n\n3.  **Finding the Semi-Major Axis (a)**\n    The semi-major axis `a` can be determined from the radial velocity (RV) data. For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by:\n    K = (M_p * sin(i) / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\n    Because the planets are detected by both transit and RV methods, the orbital inclination `i` is close to 90°, so we can assume sin(i) ≈ 1.\n    K = (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\n    Rearranging the formula to solve for `a`:\n    K² = (M_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a)\n    K² = (G * M_p²) / (a * M_star)\n    a = (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n4.  **Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\n    Now we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\n    a₂ / a₁ = [(G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K₂²)] / [(G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K₁²)]\n\n    The gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) cancel out:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2² / K₂²) * (K₁² / M_p1²)\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n5.  **Ratio of the RV Semi-Amplitudes (K)**\n    The RV semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ), since K = c * (Δλ / λ), where c and λ are constants. Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of their Doppler shifts:\n    K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n6.  **Combining and Calculating**\n    Substitute the ratio of K back into the equation for a₂ / a₁:\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²\n\n    Now, substitute this result into the temperature ratio equation:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)² )\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\n    Finally, plug in the given values:\n    *   M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n    *   M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n    *   Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n    *   Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet 1 and Planet 2.\n\n**1. Formula for Equilibrium Temperature**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its star. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   A is the planet's albedo.\n\n**2. Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\nT_eq1 = T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))\nT_eq2 = T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))\n\nThe ratio is:\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\nSince the star is the same for both planets (T_star and R_star are constant) and the problem states they have the same albedo (A₁ = A₂), the terms for temperature, albedo, and stellar radius cancel out.\n\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(1 / a₁) / sqrt(1 / a₂)\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we first need to determine the ratio of the semi-major axes, a₂/a₁.\n\n**3. Using Radial Velocity Data to Find the Semi-Major Axis Ratio**\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method measures the \"wobble\" of the star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The amplitude of the stellar radial velocity (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nWhere:\n*   M_p is the planet's mass.\n*   M_star is the star's mass.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis.\n(This assumes the orbital inclination is close to 90°, which is a valid assumption since the planets were also detected via the transit method).\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for `a`:\n\nsqrt(a) ≈ (M_p / K) * sqrt(G / M_star)\na ≈ (M_p / K)² * (G / M_star)\n\nNow we can find the ratio a₂ / a₁:\n\na₂ / a₁ = [(M_p2 / K₂)² * (G / M_star)] / [(M_p1 / K₁)² * (G / M_star)]\n\nThe terms (G / M_star) cancel out, leaving:\n\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / K₂)² / (M_p1 / K₁)²\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\nThe Doppler shift in wavelength (Δλ) is directly proportional to the radial velocity amplitude (K), so the ratio K₁ / K₂ is the same as the ratio Δλ₁ / Δλ₂.\n\n**4. Calculation**\n\nLet's plug in the given values:\n*   M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n*   M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n*   Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n\nFirst, calculate the mass and RV amplitude ratios:\n*   M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n*   K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nNow, substitute these into the equation for the semi-major axis ratio:\n*   a₂ / a₁ = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\n*   a₂ / a₁ = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n*   a₂ / a₁ = 225 / 784\n\nFinally, use this ratio to find the equilibrium temperature ratio:\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225) / sqrt(784)\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\nwhere:\n*   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n*   A is the planet's albedo.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis (the orbital distance for a circular orbit).\n\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_star * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are the same) and have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Thus, these terms cancel out:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( (1/a1) / (1/a2) ) = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital distances (a2 / a1), we use the information from the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\nK ≈ (M_p * sin(i) / sqrt(M_star)) * sqrt(G/a)\nwhere M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, `i` is the orbital inclination, and `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\nSince both planets were detected using the transit method, their orbits are viewed edge-on, so we can assume the inclination i ≈ 90° and sin(i) ≈ 1 for both.\nRearranging for `a`:\nsqrt(a) ≈ (M_p / K) * (sin(i) * sqrt(G) / sqrt(M_star))\nSince all terms in the second parenthesis are constant for this system, we have the proportionality:\nsqrt(a) ∝ M_p / K\n\nWe can now form a ratio:\nsqrt(a2) / sqrt(a1) = (M_p2 / K2) / (M_p1 / K1) = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (K1 / K2)\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift Δλ (since K = c * Δλ / λ₀, where c and λ₀ are constants). Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\nK1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for the semi-major axes:\nsqrt(a2 / a1) = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)\n\nWe know that T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1), so:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   M_p1 = 7 M_Earth\n*   M_p2 = 5 M_Earth\n*   Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n*   Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main objective is to calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2, denoted as T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula that balances the energy it absorbs from its star with the energy it radiates:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a))\n    where:\n    *   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n    *   R_star is the star's radius.\n    *   A is the planet's bond albedo.\n    *   a is the planet's orbital semi-major axis.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We create the ratio of T_eq1 to T_eq2:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A₁)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a₁))] / [T_star * (1 - A₂)^(1/4) * √(R_star / (2 * a₂))]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** Several terms cancel out based on the problem statement:\n    *   Both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are the same for both and cancel.\n    *   The problem states \"both planets possess the same albedo,\" so A₁ = A₂. This causes the (1 - A)^(1/4) term to cancel.\n    *   The constant '2' in the denominator under the square root also cancels.\n    *   This leaves a greatly simplified expression:\n        T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(1 / a₁) / √(1 / a₂) = √(a₂ / a₁)\n\n5.  **Connect to Observational Data:** The problem now hinges on finding the ratio a₂ / a₁. This must be derived from the provided radial velocity (RV) and mass information. The semi-amplitude of the radial velocity signal (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * √(G * M_star / a)\n    where M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, and G is the gravitational constant.\n\n6.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** We rearrange the formula to isolate 'a':\n    K² ≈ (M_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a)\n    K² ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * a)\n    a ≈ (G * M_p²) / (M_star * K²)\n\n7.  **Formulate the Ratio a₂ / a₁:**\n    a₂ / a₁ = [(G * M_p2²) / (M_star * K₂²)] / [(G * M_p1²) / (M_star * K_1²)]\n    *   The constants G and M_star are the same for both calculations and cancel out.\n    *   The ratio simplifies to:\n        a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2² / K₂²) / (M_p1² / K_1²)\n        a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K_1 / K_2)²\n\n8.  **Calculate Component Ratios from Given Values:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio (M_p2 / M_p1):**\n        M_p1 = 7 M_Earth, M_p2 = 5 M_Earth\n        => M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n    *   **RV Amplitude Ratio (K_1 / K_2):** The RV amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift (Δλ). Therefore, their ratio is the same.\n        Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å, Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n        => K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n9.  **Calculate a₂ / a₁:** Substitute the component ratios into the formula from step 7.\n    a₂ / a₁ = (5/7)² * (3/4)² = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784\n\n10. **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:** Substitute the result for a₂ / a₁ into the formula from step 4.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂ / a₁) = √(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n11. **Compute the Numerical Result:** To compare with the multiple-choice options, we perform the division.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is given by sqrt(a2/a1)\n# The ratio a2/a1 is given by (Mp2/Mp1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\n\n# Values from the problem\nmass_planet1 = 7\nmass_planet2 = 5\ndoppler_shift1 = 0.03\ndoppler_shift2 = 0.04\n\n# Ratio of masses (Mp2/Mp1)\nmass_ratio = mass_planet2 / mass_planet1\n\n# Ratio of RV amplitudes (K1/K2) is the same as the ratio of Doppler shifts\nrv_ratio = doppler_shift1 / doppler_shift2\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2/a1)\naxis_ratio = (mass_ratio)**2 * (rv_ratio)**2\n\n# Calculate the final temperature ratio\ntemperature_ratio = math.sqrt(axis_ratio)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n\nThe computed value is approximately 0.5357, which matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: 0.5357142857142857\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} (1 - A)^{1/4} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}}$\nwhere $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature, A is the planet's albedo, $R_{star}$ is the star's radius, and 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2 ($T_{eq1} / T_{eq2}$).\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\frac{T_{star} (1 - A_1)^{1/4} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_1}}}{T_{star} (1 - A_2)^{1/4} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a_2}}}$\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same for both.

The maximum RV shift of the star, K (also known as the RV semi-amplitude), is related to the planet's properties. For a circular orbit and assuming the inclination `i` is ~90° (a good assumption for planets detected via the transit method), the formula for K is:\n    K = M_p * sqrt(G / (a * M_star))\n    Where:\n    *   M_p is the planet's mass.\n    *   M_star is the star's mass.\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n    We can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis `a`:\n    K² = M_p² * (G / (a * M_star))\n    a = (M_p² * G) / (K² * M_star)\n\n4.  **Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1)**\n    Using the formula for `a`, we can find the ratio a2 / a1:\n    a2 / a1 = [(M_p2² * G) / (K2² * M_star)] / [(M_p1² * G) / (K1² * M_star)]\n\n    The terms G and M_star cancel out, leaving:\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2² / K2²) / (M_p1² / K1²)\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n\n5.  **Plugging in the Values**\n    First, let's find the ratio of the masses:\n    *   M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n    *   M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n    *   M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n    Next, let's find the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes (K).
