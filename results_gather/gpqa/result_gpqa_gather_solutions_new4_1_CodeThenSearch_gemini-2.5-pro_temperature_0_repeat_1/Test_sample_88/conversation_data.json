This corresponds to the formation of a ketone by replacing a CH₂ group with a C=O group. The most plausible structure for a ketone formed from the adamantane skeleton with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O is **2-adamantanone**.\n*   However, the provided ¹H NMR spectrum (4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H)) does not match the known spectrum of 2-adamantanone. Furthermore, the subsequent reaction step involves ozonolysis, which requires the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond. 2-adamantanone is a saturated ketone and would not react with ozone.\n*   This indicates a contradiction in the problem statement. The ozonolysis step implies that Product 1 must be an unsaturated ketone (containing a C=C bond). An unsaturated ketone with an adamantane skeleton would have the formula C₁₀H₁₂O. This contradicts the ¹H NMR integration of 14H.\n*   Let's assume the ozonolysis reaction is the key chemical fact and that the provided ¹H NMR integration for Product 1 is a typo. The most plausible unsaturated ketone that could be formed is **adamant-4-en-2-one**. The signal at 4.79 ppm, while low for vinylic protons, can be attributed to the two hydrogens on the C=C double bond in this strained system.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (assumed to be adamant-4-en-2-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Transformation:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces a ketone to an alcohol. The C=C double bond is not affected.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone at C-2 is reduced to a hydroxyl group. The product is **adamant-4-en-2-ol** (C₁₀H₁₄O).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (adamant-4-en-2-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Transformation:** This is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the C=C double bond and converts the carbon atoms of the double bond into aldehydes (since they are each attached to one hydrogen). The cleavage of the C4=C5 bond opens one of the rings of the adamantane cage.\n*   **Product 3:** The resulting structure is a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane skeleton. It has the original alcohol at C-2 and two new aldehyde groups at the positions corresponding to the original C-3 and C-7. The structure is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-2-ol-3,7-dicarbaldehyde** (C₁₀H₁₄O₃).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Identify the most deshielded hydrogen atom:** In Product 3, the most deshielded protons (excluding the exchangeable OH proton) are the two aldehyde protons (-CHO). Their chemical shifts are typically in the 9-10 ppm range, significantly higher than any other C-H proton in the molecule.\n*   **Determine the coupling pattern:** We need to determine the splitting pattern of one of these aldehyde protons. Let's analyze the aldehyde proton attached to C-3 (let's call it Hₐ).\n    *   **³J Coupling:** The aldehyde proton Hₐ is separated by three bonds from the proton on C-3 of the ring (H-3). This ³J coupling will split the signal of Hₐ into a **doublet**.\n    *   **⁴J Coupling (Long-Range Coupling):** In rigid cyclic systems like this, long-range coupling over four bonds can be significant. The aldehyde proton Hₐ is four bonds away from the two protons on C-4 (H-4a and H-4b). If this ⁴J coupling is resolved, and assuming the two H-4 protons are magnetically equivalent (or appear so due to similar coupling constants or rapid conformational changes), they will split the signal of Hₐ into a **triplet**.\n*   **Combine the couplings:** The signal for the aldehyde proton Hₐ would therefore be split first into a doublet by H-3, and each line of that doublet would be further split into a triplet by the two H-4 protons. The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets**.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and its NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240°C with an excess of potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n*   **Analysis:** The starting material is a rigid, cage-like alkane with two bromine substituents. The reaction conditions (a strong base at high temperature) suggest a complex reaction. While substitution or elimination might be considered, the rigid structure of adamantane makes these pathways unusual. This specific reaction is a known, albeit complex, skeletal rearrangement. The product formed under these conditions is **protoadamant-4-one**. The characteristic IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to a ketone, which is consistent with this product structure. The unusual ¹H NMR values provided in the prompt are likely erroneous for this known compound but point toward the formation of a rearranged ketone.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (protoadamant-4-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which reduces ketones to alcohols. However, heating an alcohol with a Lewis acid like aluminum isopropoxide can also lead to dehydration. Therefore, the ketone is first reduced to protoadamant-4-ol, which then dehydrates under the heated conditions to form an alkene. The resulting alkene is **protoadamant-4-ene**.\n\n### Step 3: Formation of Product 3\n\n*   **Reaction:** Ozone (O₃) is bubbled through a solution of Product 2 (protoadamant-4-ene) at -78°C, followed by the addition of dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup. Ozonolysis cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond and replaces it with two carbonyl groups. The cleavage of the double bond in protoadamant-4-ene opens one of the rings in the polycyclic structure.\n*   **Product 3:** The resulting product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione**. This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n\n### Step 4: ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione.\n*   **Most Deshielded Hydrogen:** In this symmetrical dione, the most deshielded protons are the two equivalent bridgehead protons (at positions C1 and C5). These protons are beta to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n*   **Coupling Pattern:** To determine the coupling pattern of one of these bridgehead protons (e.g., H1), we must identify its neighboring protons.\n    *   H1 is adjacent to the methylene groups at C2 and C8. By symmetry, the coupling interactions with the protons on C2 are identical to those with the protons on C8.\n    *   On each methylene group (C2 and C8), there are two non-equivalent protons: one axial and one equatorial.\n    *   The bridgehead proton H1 will couple to the two axial protons (H2-ax and H8-ax) with one coupling constant (J_ax). Since these two protons are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry, this coupling will split the H1 signal into a triplet.\n    *   Simultaneously, H1 will couple to the two equatorial protons (H2-eq and H8-eq) with a different coupling constant (J_eq). This interaction will also split the signal into a triplet.\n    *   While there is also potential for coupling to the protons on the C9 bridge, this coupling is often weak or unresolved in such systems. The major observable pattern is determined by the couplings to the four protons on C2 and C8.\n\nThe result of a proton being coupled to two different sets of two equivalent protons is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess KOH, heated to 240°C.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   IR: 1720 cm⁻¹ (characteristic of a C=O, ketone group).\n    *   ¹H NMR: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). Total 14H.\n    *   The molecular formula of the starting material is C₁₀H₁₄Br₂. The product has 14 protons and contains an oxygen atom, suggesting a formula of C₁₀H₁₄O.\n\n*   **Analysis:** The reaction involves the loss of two bromine atoms and the gain of one oxygen atom. The IR spectrum confirms the product is a ketone. The ¹H NMR is the most informative piece of data. The signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is in the vinylic region, indicating a C=C double bond with two protons. The fact that these two protons appear as a single signal with an integration of 2H implies they are chemically equivalent due to symmetry.\n\n*   A structure that fits all these data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n    *   **Formula:** C₁₀H₁₄O. Correct.\n    *   **Functionality:** It is a bicyclic ketone, consistent with the IR peak.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C3 carbonyl group and the C7 methylene group. This plane makes the two protons of the exocyclic C=CH₂ group chemically equivalent.\n    *   **NMR:** The chemical shift for exocyclic methylene protons (=CH₂) is typically 4.6-4.9 ppm, which is an excellent match for the observed signal at 4.79 ppm.\n    *   **Formation:** This product can be formed from 1,3-disubstituted adamantanes via a fragmentation-rearrangement pathway under harsh conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-i-Pr)₃.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces ketones to alcohols. The C=C double bond is not affected.\n*   **Product 2 Structure:** The ketone group at C3 of Product 1 is reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup. Ozonolysis cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. The exocyclic C₇=CH₂ double bond in Product 2 is cleaved.\n    *   The C₇ carbon of the ring becomes a ketone (C=O).\n    *   The external CH₂ group becomes formaldehyde (CH₂O), which is a byproduct.\n*   **Product 3 Structure:** The resulting main product is a bicyclic keto-alcohol.\n    *   Product 3 is **3-hydroxy-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-one**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in Product 3 (excluding the exchangeable -OH proton)?\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** 3-hydroxy-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-one. This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7.\n*   **Identifying the most deshielded proton:**\n    *   Protons alpha to the ketone (at C6 and C8) are deshielded (~2.5 ppm).\n    *   Bridgehead protons (at C1 and C5) are in the aliphatic region.\n    *   The proton on the carbon bearing the alcohol group (the H-C-OH proton at C3) is deshielded by the adjacent oxygen atom. Its chemical shift is typically in the range of 3.5-4.5 ppm.\n    *   Therefore, the proton at C3 (let's call it H3) is the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton.\n\n*   **Determining the coupling pattern of H3:**\n    *   The splitting of H3 is determined by the number of protons on the adjacent carbons, which are C2 and C4.\n    *   In the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane skeleton, both C2 and C4 are methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons on C2 are equivalent to the two protons on C4.\n    *   Thus, H3 is coupled to a total of 4 neighboring protons (two on C2 and two on C4).\n    *   According to the n+1 rule, a proton coupled to 'n' equivalent neighboring protons will be split into 'n+1' peaks.\n    *   Here, n = 4. Therefore, the signal for H3 will be split into 4 + 1 = 5 peaks.\n    *   A signal with 5 peaks is called a **pentet** (or quintet).\n\n(Note: In a rigid chair conformation, the axial and equatorial protons on C2 and C4 would be non-equivalent, leading to a more complex pattern like a triplet of triplets. However, given the options and the conformational flexibility of the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system, the coupling constants often become similar enough to resolve as a simpler pentet. \"Pentet\" is the best description among the choices for a proton coupled to four neighboring protons.)\n\nFinal Answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and its NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane. This is a rigid, tricyclic C10 hydrocarbon cage with bromine atoms at two bridgehead positions. Its formula is C10H14Br2.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess KOH at 240°C. These are harsh, basic conditions.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum shows a total of 2H + 10H + 2H = 14 protons. This means the C10H14 skeleton is retained.\n    *   The formula of Product 1 is therefore C10H14O.\n*   **Structure Determination:** The formula C10H14O for a molecule derived from the tricyclic adamantane framework (which has 3 degrees of unsaturation) implies 4 degrees of unsaturation (DoU = (2*10 + 2 - 14)/2 = 4). These are accounted for by 3 rings and 1 C=O group. This means Product 1 is a saturated tricyclic ketone. The most plausible and stable ketone with a C10 adamantane-type skeleton is **adamantan-2-one** (also known as tricyclo[3.3.1.1³,⁷]decan-2-one). While the mechanism for its formation from 1,3-dibromoadamantane is complex (involving hydrolysis and rearrangement), the product data strongly points to this structure. The provided NMR data is a simplified representation of its spectrum.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (adamantan-2-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic **Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction**. This reaction specifically reduces ketones and aldehydes to their corresponding alcohols.\n*   **Product 2 Structure:** The ketone group in adamantan-2-one is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Therefore, Product 2 is **adamantan-2-ol**. Its formula is C10H16O.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (adamantan-2-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** The reagent combination (O₃ followed by DMS) is characteristic of an ozonolysis reaction, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). However, Product 2, adamantan-2-ol, is a saturated alcohol and contains no C=C bonds. This suggests that the ozone is performing a different, less common reaction. Ozone is a powerful oxidizing agent and is known to oxidize C-H bonds, particularly tertiary C-H bonds.\n*   Adamantan-2-ol has four tertiary C-H bonds at the bridgehead positions (C1, C3, C5, and C7). The reaction with ozone will oxidize one of these bridgehead C-H bonds to a C-OH group.\n*   **Product 3 Structure:** The reaction will form a diol of adamantane. For example, if the C-H bond at position C5 is oxidized, the product is **adamantane-2,5-diol**. The exact position of the second hydroxyl group (C1, C5, or C7) does not affect the analysis of the target proton.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?\n*   **Identification of the Proton:** The protons that exchange with deuterated solvent are the -OH protons. We are interested in the C-H protons. The most deshielded C-H protons are those attached to carbons bearing an electronegative atom like oxygen. In adamantane-2,x-diol, the proton on C2 (H-C2) is attached to a carbon bearing a hydroxyl group and is typically the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton.\n*   **Coupling Analysis:** We need to determine how many neighboring protons the H-C2 proton is coupled to.\n    *   The C2 carbon in the adamantane cage is bonded to two other carbons: the bridgehead C1 and the bridgehead C3.\n    *   Both C1 and C3 are tertiary carbons, each bearing one proton (H-C1 and H-C3).\n    *   Therefore, the H-C2 proton is coupled to two neighboring protons.\n    *   Due to the symmetry of the adamantane cage relative to the C2 position, the two neighboring protons (H-C1 and H-C3) are in equivalent chemical environments. They will have the same coupling constant (J) to H-C2.\n*   **Determining the Splitting Pattern:** According to the n+1 rule, a proton coupled to 'n' equivalent neighboring protons is split into a signal with (n+1) peaks. In this case, n=2.\n*   **Conclusion:** The signal for H-C2 will be split into a (2+1) = 3 peak pattern. This pattern is called a **triplet**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\nThe starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. It is heated with a strong base (KOH) at a high temperature (240°C). This suggests a reaction involving elimination and/or rearrangement. The spectral data for the product (Product 1) are key:\n*   **IR spectrum:** An absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), likely a ketone.\n*   **¹H NMR spectrum:** The integration (2H + 10H + 2H = 14H) matches the number of hydrogens in the starting material (C10H14Br2), indicating the adamantane skeleton is likely intact and the formula is C10H14O.\nThe reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes under these conditions is known to cause a skeletal rearrangement to form a more strained isomer. The product is **protoadamantan-4-one**. The unusual chemical shift at 4.79 ppm in the provided NMR data is likely due to the high strain in this tetracyclic ketone structure.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\nProduct 1 (protoadamantan-4-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-iPr)₃. This reagent is used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts ketones to alcohols. Thus, protoadamantan-4-one is reduced to protoadamantan-4-ol.\nThe next step in the sequence is ozonolysis, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. This implies that the alcohol formed, protoadamantan-4-ol, must have been converted to an alkene. Under heating, alcohols can undergo dehydration. Dehydration of protoadamantan-4-ol forms a double bond between C4 and C5, yielding **protoadamant-4-ene** (Product 2). Elimination towards the C3 bridgehead is disfavored by Bredt's rule.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3**\nProduct 2 (protoadamant-4-ene) is subjected to ozonolysis (O₃ at -78°C) followed by a reductive workup with dimethylsulfide (DMS). This reaction cleaves the C=C double bond and replaces it with two carbonyl groups.\nCleavage of the C4=C5 double bond in the C10 tetracyclic protoadamant-4-ene skeleton results in a C10 tricyclic dicarbonyl compound. The carbon atom at position 4 of the double bond becomes a ketone, and the carbon atom at position 5 becomes an aldehyde. The resulting structure is **7-oxobicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3-carbaldehyde** (Product 3).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR of Product 3**\nThe question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in Product 3.\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** In a molecule containing alkyl protons, protons alpha to a ketone, and an aldehyde proton, the **aldehyde proton (-CHO)** is by far the most deshielded (typically δ 9-10 ppm).\n*   **Coupling Analysis:** We need to determine how the signal for this aldehyde proton is split by neighboring protons.\n    1.  **³J Coupling (3-bond coupling):** The aldehyde proton is coupled to the single proton on the adjacent carbon, C3. This coupling to one proton (n=1) splits the signal into a **doublet** (n+1 = 2 peaks).\n    2.  **Long-Range Coupling:** The answer choices suggest more complex splitting. We must consider coupling over more than three bonds. The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane framework is rigid, allowing for observable long-range couplings. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making the two bridgehead protons (at C1 and C5) chemically equivalent.\n    3.  **⁵J Coupling (5-bond coupling):** There is a viable coupling path over five bonds between the aldehyde proton and the two equivalent bridgehead protons (H1 and H5). Coupling to these two equivalent protons (n=2) would split the signal into a **triplet** (n+1 = 3 peaks).\n*   **Final Pattern:** The signal for the aldehyde proton is first split into a doublet by the C3 proton, and each peak of this doublet is then further split into a triplet by the two equivalent bridgehead protons. The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane. This is an adamantane molecule with bromine atoms at two bridgehead positions (C1 and C3).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess potassium hydroxide (KOH) at 240°C.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a reaction performed under harsh basic and thermal conditions on a tertiary alkyl halide. While substitution to a diol or elimination might be considered, the spectral data for Product 1 provides crucial clues.\n    *   **IR spectrum:** An absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone. This rules out a diol product.\n    *   **¹H NMR spectrum:** The provided NMR data (4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H)) is unusual and does not perfectly match common adamantane derivatives. However, the formation of a ketone is strongly supported by the IR data and known chemistry.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes with a strong base is known to cause a skeletal rearrangement. The established product of this reaction is **4-protoadamantanone** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]decan-4-one). This structure is a C₁₀H₁₄O ketone, consistent with the starting material and the IR data. We will proceed assuming Product 1 is 4-protoadamantanone, treating the provided NMR data as potentially misleading or for a different isomer not relevant to the main reaction path.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (4-protoadamantanone).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess aluminum isopropoxide (Al(O-iPr)₃) with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** The subsequent reaction step is ozonolysis, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. This means Product 2 must be an alkene. The transformation from a ketone (Product 1) to an alkene (Product 2) using Al(O-iPr)₃ can be understood as a two-step sequence in one pot:\n    1.  **Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) Reduction:** The ketone is reduced by aluminum isopropoxide to the corresponding alcohol. 4-protoadamantanone is reduced to **4-protoadamantanol**.\n    2.  **Dehydration:** The resulting alcohol is dehydrated upon heating, likely catalyzed by the Lewis acidic aluminum species. Dehydration of 4-protoadamantanol can form a double bond between C4 and C5.\n*   **Product 2:** The resulting alkene is **protoadamant-4-ene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene). This is a disubstituted alkene within the protoadamantane framework.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3 and analyze its ¹H NMR spectrum**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (protoadamant-4-ene).\n*   **Reagents:** Ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a reductive ozonolysis reaction. The C=C double bond is cleaved, and each carbon atom of the original double bond becomes a carbonyl group. Since Product 2 (protoadamant-4-ene) is a disubstituted alkene (R-CH=CH-R'), the ozonolysis will yield two aldehyde groups.\n    *   Cleaving the C4=C5 bond in the protoadamantane skeleton opens one of the rings. The remaining core is a **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane** system.\n    *   The two new aldehyde groups (-CHO) are attached to the positions that were connected to the double bond, which correspond to positions 3 and 7 of the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane skeleton.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde**.\n\n**¹H NMR Analysis of Product 3:**\n\n1.  **Identify the most deshielded hydrogen atom:** In bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde, the most deshielded protons are the two aldehyde protons (-CHO). They typically appear at δ 9-10 ppm. The question excludes protons that exchange with D₂O (like -OH or -NH), which does not apply to aldehyde protons.\n\n2.  **Determine the coupling of the aldehyde proton:** Each aldehyde proton is attached to a carbon (C3 or C7) that has one proton on it (a methine or CH group). Therefore, the aldehyde proton signal would be split into a **doublet**. However, \"doublet\" is not among the given options (A, B, C, D).\n\n3.  **Re-evaluate the question:** This discrepancy suggests that the question is not asking about the aldehyde proton, but rather the **most deshielded proton on the aliphatic skeleton**. These would be the protons at C3 and C7 (H3 and H7), which are alpha to the electron-withdrawing aldehyde groups. Their chemical shift would be around δ 2.5-3.0 ppm.\n\n4.  **Determine the coupling pattern of H3/H7:**\n    *   The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system in Product 3 adopts a stable dual-chair conformation. The molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry, making H3 and H7 chemically equivalent.\n    *   To minimize steric hindrance, the bulky aldehyde groups (-CHO) will occupy the equatorial positions on the cyclohexane-like chairs.\n    *   This forces the protons H3 and H7 into the axial positions.\n    *   An axial proton (e.g., H3) is coupled to the protons on the adjacent methylene groups (C2 and C4). It has four vicinal neighbors: two axial protons (H2ax, H4ax) and two equatorial protons (H2eq, H4eq).\n    *   Due to the C₂ symmetry, the two axial neighbors are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial neighbors are equivalent to each other.\n    *   The coupling constant between axial protons (J_ax,ax) is large (~10-13 Hz).\n    *   The coupling constant between axial and equatorial protons (J_ax,eq) is small (~2-5 Hz).\n    *   Therefore, the signal for H3 is split by two equivalent protons with a large coupling constant (giving a triplet) and also by two other equivalent protons with a small coupling constant (which splits each line of the first triplet into another triplet).\n    *   The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets (tt)**.\n\nThis pattern matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the formation and structure of Product 1.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane (C10H16) is a tricyclic alkane.\n*   **Reaction:** Heating with excess KOH at 240°C. These are harsh conditions suggesting a complex reaction, likely involving rearrangement, not a simple substitution or elimination.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   **IR:** 1720 cm⁻¹. This is a strong absorbance characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone. The frequency is typical for a non-conjugated ketone in a six-membered ring or a slightly strained system.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H).\n        *   The total integration is 2+10+2 = 14 protons. The molecular formula of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is C10H14Br2. The reaction involves replacing two Br atoms with one O atom, so the formula of Product 1 is C10H14O. This is consistent with the proton count.\n        *   The simple pattern of the NMR spectrum (2H, 10H, 2H) suggests a high degree of symmetry in Product 1 (e.g., a C2 axis or a plane of symmetry).\n        *   The signal at 4.79 ppm is unusual. It is too high for a typical proton alpha to a ketone and too low for a typical vinyl proton in an unstrained system.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the subsequent reactions to deduce the nature of Products 1, 2, and 3.**\n\n*   **Product 1 → Product 2:** Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-iPr)₃. This is the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which specifically reduces ketones and aldehydes to alcohols. This confirms that Product 1 is a ketone, and Product 2 is the corresponding alcohol.\n    *   Product 1 (C10H14O, Ketone) → Product 2 (C10H16O, Alcohol)\n*   **Product 2 → Product 3:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a reductive ozonolysis reaction, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C).\n    *   The fact that ozonolysis is performed proves that Product 2 must contain a C=C double bond.\n    *   Since Product 2 is just the reduced form of Product 1, **Product 1 must be an unsaturated ketone**.\n    *   The IR of Product 1 (1720 cm⁻¹) suggests the C=O and C=C bonds are not conjugated (an α,β-unsaturated ketone would absorb at a lower frequency, ~1685 cm⁻¹).\n    *   Ozonolysis of a -CH=CH- unit with reductive workup (DMS) yields two aldehyde (-CHO) groups. The question asks about the coupling of a hydrogen atom in Product 3, which confirms that aldehydes (which have a C-H bond) are formed, not ketones. This implies the double bond in Product 2 was of the -CH=CH- type.\n    *   Therefore, Product 3 is a dialdehyde-alcohol (C10H16O₂), formed by cleaving the C=C bond of the unsaturated alcohol Product 2.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3 and analyze its ¹H NMR spectrum.**\n\n1.  **Plausible Structure of Intermediates:** While the exact structure of Product 1 is difficult to determine from the given information without resorting to obscure literature, we can deduce the general structural features of the final product. The formation from adamantane under rearrangement conditions often leads to other polycyclic systems. A plausible, albeit complex, series of rearrangements could lead to a bicyclic enone. Let's consider a plausible bicyclic skeleton that results from the adamantane rearrangement, for example, a bicyclo[3.3.2]decane system. Let's assume Product 2 is a bicyclo[3.3.2]dec-6-en-2-ol.\n\n2.  **Ozonolysis:** Cleaving the C=C bond in a bicyclic system opens one of the rings, resulting in a larger monocyclic system. In this case, ozonolysis of a bicyclic C10 alkene-alcohol will produce a C10 monocyclic dialdehyde-alcohol. The resulting ring will be a 10-membered cyclodecane ring.\n\n3.  **Structure of Product 3:** Product 3 is a cyclodecane ring substituted with one hydroxyl (-OH) group and two aldehyde (-CHO) groups. The exact substitution pattern would depend on the exact structure of the precursor, but we can analyze the local environment of the aldehyde protons regardless.\n\n4.  **¹H NMR of Product 3:**\n    *   **Most Deshielded Proton:** The most deshielded protons in Product 3 (excluding the exchangeable -OH proton) will be the aldehyde protons (-CHO), which typically resonate at δ = 9-10 ppm.\n    *   **Coupling Pattern:** We need to determine the splitting pattern of these aldehyde protons. The splitting is caused by coupling to protons on adjacent carbons.\n    *   An aldehyde proton (H-C=O) couples to the protons on the adjacent carbon atom (the α-carbon) via three bonds (³J coupling). It can also exhibit weaker coupling to protons on the β-carbon via four bonds (⁴J coupling).\n    *   The dialdehyde product is formed by breaking a C=C bond within a ring structure. Let's analyze the fragments that are formed: `...-CαHn-CHO`.\n    *   The precursor (Product 2) is a complex bicyclic alcohol. The carbons adjacent to the double bond are likely part of the complex framework, including both methylene (-CH₂-) and methine (-CH-) groups.\n    *   When the ring opens to form Product 3, the new aldehyde groups will find themselves adjacent to these former parts of the bicyclic framework. It is highly probable that the local environment of an aldehyde group will be `H(CO)-CαH₂-CβH-...` or `H(CO)-CαH-CβH₂-...`.\n    *   Let's analyze the expected coupling pattern for such a fragment:\n        *   **³J Coupling:** The aldehyde proton will couple to the protons on the α-carbon. If Cα is a -CH₂- group, this gives a triplet. If Cα is a -CH- group, this gives a doublet.\n        *   **⁴J Coupling:** The aldehyde proton will also couple to the protons on the β-carbon. If Cβ is a -CH₂- group, this gives a triplet. If Cβ is a -CH- group, this gives a doublet. (Note: ⁴J couplings are generally smaller than ³J couplings).\n    *   Let's consider a likely scenario based on a plausible rearranged structure. For example, the ozonolysis of a bicyclo[3.3.2]decene derivative as reasoned in the scratchpad. This leads to a structure where one aldehyde proton is adjacent to a -CH- group and its β-carbon is a -CH₂- group. The other aldehyde proton is adjacent to a -CH₂- group and its β-carbon is a -CH- group.\n        *   Case 1: `H(CO)-CH-CH₂-`. The aldehyde proton is split by the α-CH proton into a **doublet**. This doublet is further split by the β-CH₂ protons into **triplets**. The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n        *   Case 2: `H(CO)-CH₂-CH-`. The aldehyde proton is split by the α-CH₂ protons into a **triplet**. This triplet is further split by the β-CH proton into **doublets**. The resulting pattern is a **triplet of doublets (td)**, which has the same appearance as a doublet of triplets.\n    *   Therefore, regardless of which of the two non-equivalent aldehyde protons is the most deshielded, its coupling pattern is expected to be a **doublet of triplets** (or triplet of doublets).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most deshielded non-exchangeable proton in Product 3 is an aldehyde proton. Based on the likely structure resulting from the ozonolysis of a rearranged bicyclic alcohol, this proton will be coupled to both an adjacent methine (-CH-) and a next-nearest methylene (-CH₂-) group (or vice versa). This coupling will result in a **doublet of triplets** pattern.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is the step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Product 1:** The starting material, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, reacts with a strong base (KOH) at a high temperature (240°C). This is not a simple substitution or elimination. The spectral data (IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicating a ketone, and ¹H NMR data) points to a known skeletal rearrangement reaction that forms **protoadamantan-4-one**.\n\n2.  **Identify Product 2:** Product 1 (protoadamantan-4-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide. This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which reduces the ketone to a secondary alcohol, protoadamantan-4-ol. However, the subsequent reaction is ozonolysis, which requires a C=C double bond. It is a common secondary reaction for the alcohol to dehydrate under heating to form an alkene. The most likely alkene formed is **protoadamant-4-ene**.\n\n3.  **Identify Product 3:** Product 2 (protoadamant-4-ene) is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS). This is an ozonolysis with a reductive workup. Ozonolysis cleaves the C=C double bond. In protoadamantene, the double bond is between two tertiary carbons (carbons with no hydrogens attached). Therefore, the reductive workup yields two ketone groups, not aldehydes. The resulting product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3:**\n    *   **Product Structure:** Bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione.\n    *   **Most Deshielded Proton:** The most deshielded non-exchangeable protons are the two equivalent bridgehead protons at positions C1 and C5. They are beta to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Spin-Spin Coupling:** We need to determine the splitting pattern for one of these bridgehead protons (e.g., H1). H1 is coupled to its neighboring protons on C2, C8, and C9.\n        *   The four vicinal protons (on C2 and C8) are not equivalent. They exist as two distinct sets: two axial protons and two equatorial protons.\n        *   The coupling constant between the bridgehead proton and the two axial protons is large (J_ax ≈ 6.5 Hz), while the coupling to the two equatorial protons is smaller (J_eq ≈ 3.5 Hz). There is also a very small long-range coupling to the bridge protons.\n    *   **Simplification for Interpretation:** In complex spectra like this, the observed pattern is often simplified by considering only the largest coupling constant. The dominant coupling is with the two equivalent axial protons.\n    *   **Applying the n+1 Rule:** Using only the two strongly coupled axial protons as neighbors (n=2), the splitting pattern is given by the n+1 rule: 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nThe resulting signal is a **triplet**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded hydrogen atom.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240°C with an excess of potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂).\n*   **Product 1 Analysis:** The product is described as a light yellow solid with an IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a ketone functional group. The ¹H NMR spectrum shows a total of 14 protons, indicating that no hydrogen atoms were lost during the reaction. The molecular formula of the product is therefore C₁₀H₁₄O.\n*   **Identification of Product 1:** The reaction of 1,3-dihalo-adamantanes with a strong base is a known method for synthesizing adamantan-2-one via rearrangement. The given IR data strongly supports the formation of a ketone. Although the provided NMR data is anomalous for adamantan-2-one, the reaction conditions and IR spectrum point convincingly to **adamantan-2-one** as Product 1. The unusual NMR data in the prompt is likely a red herring or erroneous.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (adamantan-2-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Reagents and Reaction Type:** This set of reagents is used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts ketones and aldehydes to their corresponding alcohols.\n*   **Identification of Product 2:** The MPV reduction of adamantan-2-one (a ketone) yields the corresponding secondary alcohol, **adamantan-2-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of Reaction 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (adamantan-2-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Reagents and Reaction Type:** The sequence of ozone followed by a reductive workup (with DMS) is the classic procedure for ozonolysis, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. However, Product 2, adamantan-2-ol, is a saturated alcohol and has no C=C double bonds.\n*   **Alternative Reactivity:** While not its most common application, ozone can oxidize secondary alcohols to ketones. Given the context of the problem, this is the most plausible transformation. The dimethylsulfide serves to quench any excess ozone.\n*   **Identification of Product 3:** The oxidation of adamantan-2-ol (a secondary alcohol) regenerates the ketone, **adamantan-2-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Product for Analysis:** The final product, Product 3, is adamantan-2-one.\n*   **Most Deshielded Hydrogen:** In a saturated ketone like adamantan-2-one, the most deshielded protons (those with the highest chemical shift) are the ones on the carbons alpha (adjacent) to the carbonyl group. In this case, these are the bridgehead protons at the C1 and C3 positions.\n*   **Coupling Pattern:** To determine the splitting pattern of the H1 proton, we must consider its neighboring protons. The adamantane cage is rigid, and coupling occurs over three bonds (vicinal coupling). The H1 proton is three bonds away from the protons on three different methylene (CH₂) groups: C6, C8, and C9.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the couplings to the protons on C6 and C8 are equivalent. These four protons can be considered as two sets of two equivalent protons.\n    *   A simplified and common interpretation for the coupling in this rigid system is to consider the major interactions. The H1 proton couples to the two pairs of non-equivalent protons on the adjacent C6 and C8 bridges.\n    *   Coupling to one pair of equivalent protons would result in a triplet. Coupling to a second, non-equivalent pair of protons would split each line of that triplet into another triplet.\n*   **Conclusion:** This leads to a theoretical splitting pattern of a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis is a multi-step synthesis problem that requires identifying the structures of three successive products. The key to solving this problem lies in correctly interpreting each reaction and the provided spectral data, and recognizing that the question ultimately hinges on the structure of the final product, which should have a distinctive NMR spectrum matching one of the options.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Product 1 Formation:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with excess potassium hydroxide (KOH) at a high temperature (240°C). These harsh conditions with a strong base suggest a complex reaction involving elimination and/or rearrangement of the adamantane cage structure. The product is a ketone, as indicated by the strong IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n\n2.  **Product 2 Formation:** Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide, which is the reagent for a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction specifically reduces ketones to alcohols. Therefore, Product 2 is the alcohol corresponding to Product 1.\n\n3.  **Product 3 Formation:** Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis (O₃ followed by dimethyl sulfide, DMS). Ozonolysis is a classic organic reaction that cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to form two carbonyl compounds. The fact that this reaction occurs is a crucial piece of information: it proves that **Product 2 must contain a C=C double bond**. Consequently, Product 1 must have been an unsaturated ketone.\n\n**The Contradiction and Resolution:**\n\nAt first glance, there seems to be a contradiction. The most common rearrangement product of 1,3-dihalo-adamantanes under these conditions is protoadamantan-4-one. However, this is a saturated ketone and would not react with ozone. Similarly, if the reaction produced 2-adamantanone, its reduction product, 2-adamantanol, is also saturated.\n\nThe most logical conclusion is that the reaction sequence is designed to produce a specific, highly symmetric final product, even if the synthetic route is non-obvious or obscure. The question's focus is on the NMR spectrum of the final product. Let's consider a plausible, highly symmetric dicarbonyl product that could be formed on an adamantane framework: **2,6-adamantanedione**.\n\n**Analysis of Product 3 (2,6-adamantanedione):**\n\n*   **Structure:** 2,6-adamantanedione has a highly symmetric (D₂d) cage structure with two ketone groups at opposite methylene bridge positions.\n*   **Most Deshielded Protons:** The most deshielded protons (excluding any potential exchangeable protons) are the ones on carbons adjacent (alpha) to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. In this molecule, these are the four equivalent bridgehead protons at positions C1, C3, C5, and C7.\n*   **Coupling Pattern:** Let's analyze the coupling for one of these protons, for instance, the one at C1. This proton is bonded to a carbon that is connected to C2 (a carbonyl group, no protons), C8 (a CH₂ group), and C9 (a CH₂ group). Therefore, the proton at C1 will be split by the protons on C8 and C9.\n*   Due to the high symmetry of the molecule, the two protons on C8 are chemically and magnetically equivalent to each other, and they are also equivalent to the two protons on C9. This means the proton at C1 is coupled to a total of **four equivalent neighboring protons**.\n*   According to the n+1 rule, a proton coupled to 'n' equivalent protons will be split into 'n+1' peaks. Here, n=4, so the signal for the C1 proton will be a pentet (a multiplet with 5 lines).\n\nThis analysis provides a perfect match to one of the given options. While the synthetic pathway to arrive at this specific product from the starting materials is complex and involves significant rearrangements, the structure of 2,6-adamantanedione is the most plausible candidate for Product 3 that fits the provided answer choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to determine the final product and its NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1 and Identify Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240°C with an excess of potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂). The bromine atoms are at bridgehead positions.\n*   **Conditions:** Strong base (KOH) and high temperature (240°C). These are harsh conditions that can promote rearrangements.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   IR spectrum: 1720 cm⁻¹. This indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone.\n    *   ¹H NMR spectrum: 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H). The total integration is 14 protons. The formula is CₓH₁₄O. Since the starting material is a C₁₀ compound, the product is likely C₁₀H₁₄O.\n\n*   **Interpretation:** The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes with strong bases is known to proceed through a skeletal rearrangement to a protoadamantane intermediate. Subsequent hydration (from water present in KOH or as a byproduct) and oxidation (possibly by air at high temperature) can lead to a ketone. The most common product formed under similar conditions is adamantan-2-one. However, the provided ¹H NMR spectrum, particularly the signal at 4.79 ppm, does not match adamantan-2-one. The unusual NMR data and the subsequent reaction with ozone suggest that an unsaturated product is formed. A known, albeit complex, pathway involves rearrangement and oxidation to form **protoadamant-4-en-2-one** (C₁₀H₁₂O). This structure is an unsaturated ketone (enone), which is consistent with the presence of a carbonyl group and the need for a double bond for the later ozonolysis step. The discrepancy in the proton count (12H in the structure vs. 14H in the given spectrum) is a known issue in this classic problem, often attributed to a typo in the problem statement. We will proceed assuming Product 1 is this enone.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2 and Identify Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (protoadamant-4-en-2-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-iPr)₃.\n*   **Interpretation:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces ketones and aldehydes to alcohols. It does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group in protoadamant-4-en-2-one is reduced to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Product 2 is protoadamant-4-en-2-ol.** This is an unsaturated alcohol, which can react with ozone.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 3 and Identify Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (protoadamant-4-en-2-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Interpretation:** This is an ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup. The C=C double bond is cleaved and replaced by two carbonyl groups. Since the workup is reductive (DMS), carbons of the double bond that have a hydrogen atom attached will become aldehydes.\n*   **Ozonolysis of the Precursor:** The ozonolysis of the parent alkene, protoadamantene, is known to yield a dialdehyde with a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane skeleton. The presence of the hydroxyl group in our substrate (Product 2) does not change the outcome of the cleavage but will be present in the final product.\n*   **Product 3 Structure:** The ozonolysis of protoadamant-4-en-2-ol results in the cleavage of the C4=C5 double bond, opening a ring of the tricyclic system. The final product is a bicyclic dialdehyde with a hydroxyl group. The specific structure is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-2-ol-3,6-dicarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in Product 3 (excluding the exchangeable OH proton)?\n*   **Identifying the Most Deshielded Proton:** In the structure of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-2-ol-3,6-dicarbaldehyde, the possible non-exchangeable protons are:\n    1.  **Aldehyde protons (-CHO):** These are typically the most deshielded, appearing at δ = 9-10 ppm.\n    2.  **Carbinol proton (H-C-OH):** The proton on the carbon bearing the alcohol group (H2). This proton is deshielded by the oxygen and appears around δ = 3.5-4.5 ppm.\n    3.  **Protons alpha to carbonyls (e.g., H3, H6):** These appear around δ = 2.5-3.5 ppm.\n    4.  Other ring protons.\n\n    The most deshielded protons are the two aldehyde protons. However, an aldehyde proton attached to a CH group (like H-C-CHO) typically appears as a doublet, which is not among the options. This suggests we might need to look at another proton, or there is more complex coupling.\n\n*   **Alternative Interpretation and a More Plausible Pathway for this Problem:**\n    There is a known ambiguity and potential typo in this problem's description. A more direct path to one of the answers involves a different, but plausible, series of products, which is likely the intended solution for this puzzle.\n\n    1.  **Product 1:** Adamantan-2-one. (Ignoring the problematic NMR data and assuming the most common product).\n    2.  **Product 2:** The reaction with Al(O-iPr)₃ and heat, followed by ozonolysis, suggests an alkene intermediate is formed. A hypothetical (but necessary for this path) reaction is the conversion of adamantanone to **adamantene** (specifically, the highly strained adamant-1-ene).\n    3.  **Product 3:** The ozonolysis of adamantene (C₁₀H₁₄) is a known reaction that cleaves the cage, loses one carbon atom (as formic acid or CO₂), and produces **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione** (C₉H₁₂O₂).\n\n    Let's assume this is Product 3 and analyze its spectrum. This diketone has a high degree of symmetry (C₂ᵥ). The most deshielded protons would be those alpha to the ketones (at C2, C4, C6, C8). However, if we assume the reaction sequence somehow retained the oxygen from the isopropoxide or water, a more logical product that fits the answer choices emerges.\n\n    Let's consider the product **9-hydroxy-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione**. This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C1, C5, and C9.\n    *   **Most Deshielded Proton:** The proton at C9 is attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (H-C-OH). Its chemical shift would be around 4 ppm. The protons alpha to the ketones would be further upfield (around 2.5-3.0 ppm). Therefore, the H9 proton is the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton.\n    *   **Coupling Pattern of H9:** The C9 atom is bonded to the two bridgehead carbons, C1 and C5. Due to the molecule's symmetry, the protons on these carbons (H1 and H5) are chemically equivalent. The H9 proton is therefore coupled to two equivalent protons.\n    *   According to the n+1 rule, a proton coupled to 'n' equivalent protons will be split into 'n+1' peaks. Here, n=2.\n    *   Therefore, the signal for the H9 proton will be a **triplet**.\n\nThis analysis provides a clean match with one of the options. Given the classic nature of this problem, this path leading to a highly symmetric product with a simple splitting pattern is the most likely intended solution.\n\nFinal Answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a corrected step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and NMR splitting pattern.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess KOH, 240°C. These are harsh conditions known to cause cage rearrangements in adamantane systems.\n*   **Product 1 Data:** The IR spectrum at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a ketone. The molecular formula, based on the ¹H NMR integration (14H, same as the starting material), is likely C₁₀H₁₄O. A common and stable product from rearrangements of 1,3-disubstituted adamantanes under these conditions is **adamantan-2-one**. While the provided NMR data is anomalous for this structure (and likely erroneous or for an obscure side product), the IR data and chemical precedent strongly point to adamantan-2-one as the major product, Product 1.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (adamantan-2-one) is treated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Process:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces ketones to alcohols.\n*   **Product 2:** Adamantan-2-one is reduced to **adamantan-2-ol**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (adamantan-2-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Process:** Since Product 2 is a saturated alcohol with no C=C bonds for ozonolysis, the ozone acts as a strong oxidizing agent. A known, albeit less common, reaction of ozone is the oxidation of tertiary C-H bonds to C-OH groups. Adamantan-2-ol has four tertiary (bridgehead) C-H bonds. Oxidation at the C5 or C7 position (which are equivalent relative to C2) is sterically and electronically plausible.\n*   **Product 3:** The resulting product is **adamantane-2,5-diol**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure:** Adamantane-2,5-diol. This molecule has an -OH group on a secondary carbon (C2) and another on a tertiary (bridgehead) carbon (C5).\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** The most deshielded protons (excluding the exchangeable -OH protons) are the carbinol protons—the protons attached to the carbons bearing the hydroxyl groups. These are the proton at C2 (let's call it H2) and the proton at C5 (H5). H5 is on a tertiary carbon with no adjacent protons, so its signal would be a singlet. The question asks for a signal with a complex coupling pattern, so it must refer to H2.\n*   **Symmetry and Coupling Partners:** The introduction of the -OH group at C5 removes the plane of symmetry that exists in adamantan-2-ol. As a result, the two bridgehead protons adjacent to C2, namely H1 and H3, are no longer chemically equivalent. This is because C3 is closer to the C5-OH (two bonds away, C3-C4-C5) than C1 is (three bonds away, C1-C7-C5). Therefore, J(H2,H1) ≠ J(H2,H3).\n*   **Long-Range Coupling:** In rigid cage systems like adamantane, long-range coupling (4-bond coupling, ⁴J) through a \"W\" shaped arrangement of bonds is significant. H2 has W-coupling pathways to protons on C4 and C8. Let's call these H4e and H8e. Due to the asymmetry caused by the C5-OH, H4e and H8e are also not chemically equivalent.\n*   **Putting it Together:** The H2 proton is coupled to four non-equivalent protons: H1, H3, H4e, and H8e. This would theoretically produce a complex \"doublet of a doublet of a doublet of a doublet\". Since this is not an option, we must look for plausible simplifications due to accidental equivalence of coupling constants.\n*   **Analyzing the Options:**\n    *   A **triplet** would arise if J(H2,H1) ≈ J(H2,H3) and long-range couplings were negligible. The checker feedback specifically refutes the premise that H1 and H3 are equivalent.\n    *   A **triplet of triplets** would require two pairs of equivalent couplings, e.g., J(H2,H1) ≈ J(H2,H3) and J(H2,H4e) ≈ J(H2,H8e). This is unlikely given the significant asymmetry.\n    *   A **doublet of triplets** is a plausible pattern. It would arise if H2 couples to one proton with a unique coupling constant (J_A), and to two other protons with a mutually equivalent coupling constant (J_B), with any other couplings being negligible. Let's examine the environment:\n        1.  The coupling to H1, J(H2,H1), is through a path relatively far from the C5-OH. Let's assume this is the unique coupling J_A, giving the initial **doublet**.\n        2.  The coupling to H3, J(H2,H3), and the long-range coupling to H4e, J(H2,H4e), are both through paths that are close to the C5-OH group. It is plausible that the electronic effects of the C5-OH make these two different types of coupling accidentally equivalent (J(H2,H3) ≈ J(H2,H4e) = J_B). This would split each line of the doublet into a **triplet**.\n        3.  The final long-range coupling, J(H2,H8e), is through a path far from the C5-OH and might be small enough to be unresolved or negligible.\n    *   This scenario (one unique coupling, two accidentally equivalent couplings, one negligible coupling) provides a chemically reasonable explanation for a **doublet of triplets** pattern.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence to determine the class of compounds for Products 1, 2, and 3.**\n\n1.  **Product 1:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂) is heated with excess KOH at 240°C. The product has an IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group, specifically a ketone. The provided ¹H NMR spectrum shows a total of 14 protons, indicating the adamantane C₁₀ skeleton is intact. The formula of Product 1 is therefore C₁₀H₁₄O.\n\n2.  **Product 2:** Product 1 is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-iPr)₃. This is the standard reagent for a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which reduces a ketone (Product 1) to an alcohol (Product 2). Thus, Product 2 is an alcohol with the formula C₁₀H₁₆O.\n\n3.  **Product 3:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a reductive ozonolysis reaction, which cleaves a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) and converts it into two carbonyl groups (ketones or aldehydes). The fact that ozonolysis occurs means that **Product 2 must contain a C=C double bond**. Consequently, **Product 1 must also contain a C=C double bond**.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can deduce the following:\n*   **Product 1** is an unsaturated ketone with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O.\n*   **Product 2** is an unsaturated alcohol with the formula C₁₀H₁₆O.\n*   **Product 3** is the ozonolysis product of Product 2. It is a dicarbonyl alcohol with the formula C₁₀H₁₆O₃ (ozonolysis adds two oxygen atoms without changing the C/H count).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the proton of interest in Product 3.**\n\nThe question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in Product 3, excluding those that exchange with a deuterated solvent (like an -OH proton).\n\nThe functional groups in Product 3 are two carbonyls (likely aldehydes, -CHO) and one alcohol (-CHOH).\n*   Aldehyde protons (H-C=O) are the most deshielded non-exchangeable protons, typically appearing at 9-10 ppm. However, they usually show simple coupling (singlet or doublet) and are unlikely to match the complex patterns given in the options (doublet of triplets, pentet, triplet of triplets).\n*   The next most deshielded proton would be the one on the carbon bearing the alcohol group (H-C-OH), which typically appears at 3.5-4.5 ppm. This proton's coupling pattern depends on the number of adjacent protons.\n\nGiven the answer choices, it is highly probable that the question refers to the **proton on the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group (the H-C-OH proton)**.\n\n**Step 3: Deduce the structure of Product 3 and the coupling pattern.**\n\nThe reaction starts with a highly symmetrical molecule (adamantane). It is plausible that the final product, despite the complex rearrangements, retains some symmetry. The simple coupling patterns suggested in the answer choices (pentet, triplet) also point towards a symmetrical structure for Product 3.\n\nLet's analyze the coupling pattern options for the H-C(OH) proton:\n*   A **triplet** would imply coupling to two equivalent neighboring protons.\n*   A **pentet** (or quintet) would imply coupling to four equivalent neighboring protons.\n*   A **doublet of triplets** would imply coupling to one proton and a set of two other equivalent protons.\n*   A **triplet of triplets** would imply coupling to two different sets of two equivalent protons.\n\nFor the H-C(OH) proton to appear as a **pentet**, it must be adjacent to four magnetically equivalent protons. This would occur in a structural fragment like **-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₂-** where the molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C-OH bond, making the two adjacent CH₂ groups equivalent.\n\nLet's assume that the reaction sequence leads to a final product (Product 3) with this specific symmetrical feature. A plausible structure for Product 3 that is a C₁₀ dicarbonyl alcohol and possesses this symmetry is **cis,cis-1,5-diformyl-3-hydroxy-cyclooctane**.\n\n*   **Formula:** The cyclooctane ring has 8 carbons, and the two formyl (-CHO) groups add 2 more, for a total of 10 carbons (C₁₀). The hydrogen and oxygen count (C₁₀H₁₆O₃) also matches.\n*   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C3-OH bond and bisects the C7-C8 bond.\n*   **Coupling:** The proton of interest is H3 (the one on the carbon with the OH group). It is adjacent to the two protons on C2 and the two protons on C4. Due to the plane of symmetry, the CH₂ group at C2 is equivalent to the CH₂ group at C4. Therefore, H3 is coupled to **four equivalent neighboring protons**.\n\nAccording to the n+1 rule, a proton coupled to four equivalent protons will appear as a **pentet** (or quintet).\n\nWhile the exact reaction pathway from 1,3-dibromoadamantane to this specific structure is complex and involves significant molecular rearrangement, the existence of a plausible, symmetrical final structure that perfectly explains one of the answer choices is a strong indicator in this type of chemical puzzle. The high symmetry of the starting material makes a symmetric fragmentation and rearrangement product plausible.\n\nTherefore, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable C-H proton in product 3 is a pentet.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe reaction sequence begins with the rearrangement of 1,3-dibromoadamantane under harsh basic conditions to form an alkenone, protoadamant-4-en-2-one (Product 1). This is supported by the IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ (ketone) and the subsequent ozonolysis reaction, which requires a double bond.\n\nProduct 1 is then reduced via a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reaction to the corresponding alcohol, protoadamant-4-en-2-ol (Product 2).\n\nFinally, ozonolysis of Product 2 with a reductive workup (dimethylsulfide) cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond, opening a ring to form a bicyclic dialdehyde-alcohol (Product 3). The most deshielded non-exchangeable protons in this molecule are the two aldehyde protons.\n\nDue to the asymmetry of the molecule, the two aldehyde protons are in different chemical environments. One aldehyde proton is adjacent to a CH₂ group, leading to vicinal coupling that splits its signal into a triplet. In the rigid bicyclo[3.2.1]octane framework of Product 3, this aldehyde proton also experiences significant long-range (4-bond) \"W-coupling\" to another CH₂ group, which further splits the signal into another triplet. The resulting pattern is a triplet of triplets.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThis multi-step synthesis problem requires a careful deduction of the structures of three successive products.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n\nThe starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. It is heated with a strong base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), at a high temperature (240°C). While the provided ¹H NMR data for product 1 contains an unusual peak at 4.79 ppm, the other pieces of information—the molecular formula C₁₀H₁₄O (inferred from the starting material and the 14 protons in the NMR) and the strong IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹—strongly point to a saturated, tricyclic ketone. The most plausible product under these conditions is 2-adamantanone, formed through a complex rearrangement. The reported NMR spectrum is likely erroneous, a common feature in such advanced problems to prevent simple spectral matching.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 (2-adamantanone) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide. This reagent is typically used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction of ketones to alcohols. However, the subsequent reaction is ozonolysis, which requires a carbon-carbon double bond. This implies that the reaction conditions (heating with a Lewis acidic aluminum species) not only reduce the ketone to 2-adamantanol but also catalyze a subsequent rearrangement and dehydration (elimination of water) to form a stable alkene. The adamantane skeleton rearranges to the less-strained protoadamantane skeleton, yielding **protoadamantene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene) as Product 2.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3 and Analyze its ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nProduct 2 (protoadamantene) is subjected to ozonolysis with a reductive workup using dimethyl sulfide (DMS). Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond. In this specific case, the reaction involves the cleavage of the C=C bond in protoadamantene and the loss of one carbon atom, a known fragmentation pathway for this system. The resulting product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione**.\n\nNow, we must determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded, non-exchangeable hydrogen atom in bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:** This molecule has a high degree of symmetry (C₂ᵥ). It consists of two fused six-membered rings in a stable dual-chair conformation. The two ketone groups are at positions 2 and 6.\n*   **Most Deshielded Protons:** The most deshielded protons will be those most influenced by the electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. The bridgehead protons at positions 1 and 5 are each alpha to *two* ketone groups. All other protons are alpha to only one or zero ketones. Therefore, the H1 and H5 protons are the most deshielded. Due to the molecule's symmetry, H1 and H5 are chemically equivalent.\n*   **Coupling Pattern:** We need to analyze the coupling of the H1 proton. It is adjacent to the CH₂ groups at C8 and C9. Thus, H1 is coupled to four protons in total: the two diastereotopic protons on C8 and the two diastereotopic protons on C9.\n    *   In the simplest analysis, coupling to the two protons on C8 would produce a triplet, and further coupling to the two protons on C9 would also produce a triplet. This combination results in a **triplet of triplets**.\n    *   While the four neighboring protons are not strictly equivalent, leading to a more complex multiplet in reality, \"triplet of triplets\" is the best description among the choices provided and relies on a common simplification where coupling to the protons of an adjacent CH₂ group is treated as a triplet.\n\nTherefore, the most deshielded hydrogen atom (the bridgehead proton) exhibits a triplet of triplets splitting pattern.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\n**Proposer's analysis of search results:**\n\nThe search results provide crucial information. Result states that 1,3-dibromoadamantane \"reacts in base to give the synthetically useful 7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one\". This strongly suggests a ring-opening reaction followed by cyclization. Result mentions that 1,3-adamantanediol can be used to prepare catalysts after ring opening. Specifically, Ho and co-workers synthesized cannabinoids via the ring opening of 1,3-adamantanediol. This confirms that the adamantane cage can open under certain conditions. The reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with a base leading to a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane derivative seems very plausible.\n\nLet's propose the structure of Product 1 based on this. The reaction is with KOH at high temperature. A plausible mechanism is the formation of 1,3-dehydroadamantane via elimination of 2 HBr, which is a known highly reactive intermediate. However, the presence of a strong base like KOH at high temperature could also favor a ring-opening fragmentation.\n\nLet's assume the structure is 7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one as suggested by reference.\n*   **Structure:** A bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane skeleton with a ketone at position 3 and an exocyclic double bond (methylene group) at position 7.\n*   **IR:** This structure has a ketone (C=O), which matches the 1720 cm-1 absorbance.\n*   **1H NMR:**\n    *   The two protons of the exocyclic double bond (=CH2) would be deshielded. This matches the signal at 4.79 ppm (2H).\n    *   The remaining protons are on the bicyclic alkane framework. Let's count them. The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane cage has 16 protons. Replacing a CH2 with C=O removes 2 protons. Replacing another CH2 with C=CH2 removes 2 protons. So we have 16 - 2 - 2 = 12 protons on the carbon framework. The formula is C10H12O. The starting 1,3-dibromoadamantane is C10H14Br2. The reaction involves elimination of 2 HBr and addition of one oxygen, which doesn't seem right.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the reaction. Perhaps it's a fragmentation followed by re-cyclization.\nLet's reconsider the NMR data for 7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one. The formula is C10H12O. The NMR data given is 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H). Total protons = 14. This matches the number of protons in 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C10H14Br2). So the formula of Product 1 is C10H14O.\n\nHow can we get C10H14O from C10H14Br2 with KOH? This implies a substitution of both bromines with -OH, followed by an oxidation-reduction or rearrangement. This seems overly complex.\n\nLet's look at the reference again. It says \"reacts in base to give... 7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one\". This is likely a known transformation. Let's assume this is the correct intermediate path, but maybe the final product is not this exact molecule.\n\nLet's reconsider the starting reaction. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + excess KOH at 240C. This is a Favorskii-type reaction on polycyclic systems. A search for \"Favorskii reaction of dihaloadamantane\" might be useful. Or perhaps a homo-Favorskii or quasi-Favorskii rearrangement.\n\nLet's assume the provided NMR data for Product 1 is correct and try to deduce the structure from it.\n*   C10H14O\n*   IR: 1720 cm-1 (ketone)\n*   1H NMR: 4.79(s, 2H), 2.41-2.23(m, 10H), 1.94(s, 2H).\nThe two signals at 4.79 and 1.94 are sharp (likely singlets or broad singlets), each integrating to 2H. This suggests some symmetry. The signal at 4.79 is extremely deshielded. It's not a simple vinyl proton. It could be a proton on a carbon attached to two oxygens (an acetal), but we have a ketone. It could be a proton on a very strained ring.\n\nLet's reconsider the reaction from a different angle. What if the adamantane cage rearranges? High temperature and strong base can induce skeletal rearrangements.\n\nLet's try to find the actual product of this specific reaction.\n\n**Proposer:** The evidence points towards a rearrangement of the adamantane skeleton. Reference suggests the formation of a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system. Let's hypothesize the structure of Product 1. The formula is C10H14O, and it contains a ketone. The NMR is the key. The 2H signal at 4.79 ppm is very unusual. Let's search for the product of the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with strong base at high temperature to confirm the structure of Product 1.\n\n**Skeptic:** The structure of Product 1 is not yet clear. While a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane derivative is plausible, the NMR data (especially the 4.79 ppm signal) is hard to reconcile with a simple structure like 7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one, which also has the wrong number of protons. We need to find a definitive source that identifies Product 1 and provides its spectral data. Without the correct structure for Product 1, we cannot proceed to Product 2 and 3.\n\n**Decide:** The next step must be to unambiguously identify Product 1. I will perform a more targeted search for the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH, looking for spectral data of the product.\n\n**Proposer's analysis of search results:**\n\nThe search results from the second step have been very fruitful. Several sources, including Organic Syntheses, describe the synthesis of **protoadamantan-4-one** (also called tricyclo[4.3.1.0<sup>3,8</sup>]decan-4-one). While the specific reaction in the problem (1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH at 240°C) is not explicitly detailed with this product name, the rearrangement of the adamantane skeleton to a protoadamantane skeleton is a known process. More importantly, the structure of protoadamantan-4-one is consistent with the spectral data provided for Product 1.\n\n*   **Structure of Product 1 (Protoadamantan-4-one):** This is a tetracyclic ketone, an isomer of adamantanone.\n*   **Formula:** C10H14O. This matches the expected formula.\n*   **IR:** It has a ketone group, consistent with the 1720 cm-1 peak.\n*   **1H NMR:** The structure of protoadamantan-4-one is less symmetrical than adamantane. A detailed analysis of its expected NMR spectrum would be complex, but the provided data (4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H)) is plausible for this strained, polycyclic ketone. The highly deshielded signal at 4.79 ppm is likely due to the protons at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C6) which are in a unique electronic environment in the protoadamantane cage. Let's assume this is the correct structure for Product 1.\n\n**Reaction 2:** Product 1 (protoadamantan-4-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a **Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction**.\n*   **Reagent:** Aluminum isopropoxide is a classic reagent for the MPV reduction, which reduces ketones and aldehydes to alcohols. It is a chemoselective reagent.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group in protoadamantan-4-one will be reduced to a hydroxyl group, forming **protoadamantan-4-ol**. The reduction can potentially form two diastereomers, *exo*- and *endo*-protoadamantan-4-ol. However, for the next step (ozonolysis), the stereochemistry at this position is irrelevant. The key transformation is the reduction of the ketone to an alcohol.\n\n**Reaction 3:** Product 2 (protoadamantan-4-ol) is treated with ozone followed by dimethylsulfide.\n*   **Reaction:** This is an **ozonolysis** reaction. Ozonolysis cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds.\n*   **Wait, there is no double bond in protoadamantan-4-ol.** Let me re-read the question carefully. \"This product [Product 1] was then heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2.\" \"ozone was bubbled through a solution of 2 at -78C\".\n\nThere must be a misunderstanding of Reaction 2. Let's reconsider. Heating a ketone with aluminum isopropoxide is an MPV reduction. But what if the conditions are forcing? Is it possible that the resulting alcohol dehydrates to form an alkene? The problem states \"heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide\". High temperatures can favor elimination.\n\nLet's assume the sequence is:\n1.  **Product 1:** Protoadamantan-4-one.\n2.  **Reaction 2:** MPV reduction of the ketone to protoadamantan-4-ol, followed by dehydration to form **protoadamantene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0<sup>3,8</sup>]dec-4-ene). This seems plausible as it creates the double bond needed for the ozonolysis step. Protoadamantene is a known compound.\n3.  **Product 2 is Protoadamantene.**\n4.  **Reaction 3:** Ozonolysis of protoadamantene.\n    *   The double bond in protoadamantene is between C4 and C5.\n    *   Ozonolysis with a reductive workup (dimethylsulfide) will cleave this C=C bond and form two carbonyl groups.\n    *   Cleaving the C4=C5 bond of protoadamantene will open the ring system. The product will be a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane derivative.\n    *   Let's trace the carbons. The C4=C5 bond is broken. C4 becomes a carbonyl, and C5 becomes a carbonyl. The rest of the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane framework remains. The product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione**.\n\n**Structure of Product 3:** Bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione.\n*   This is a symmetrical molecule. It has a plane of symmetry passing through the C1-C5 bridgehead bond and the C9 methylene bridge.\n*   We need to find the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding exchangeable ones, so we ignore any potential enol protons, though there are none here).\n*   In bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione, the most deshielded protons will be those adjacent to the two carbonyl groups.\n*   These are the protons at C2, C4, C6, and C8. Due to symmetry, the protons at C2 and C4 are equivalent to those at C8 and C6, respectively. Let's look at the protons on C2. They are alpha to the C3-ketone.\n*   However, the **bridgehead protons** at C1 and C5 are also in a unique environment. Let's analyze the chemical shifts. Protons alpha to a ketone are typically around 2.2-2.6 ppm. Bridgehead protons in bicyclic systems can be deshielded.\n*   Let's consider the protons at C1 and C5. These are the most likely candidates for being the most deshielded. Let's call them H1 and H5.\n*   Now, let's determine the coupling pattern of H1 (or H5).\n    *   H1 is coupled to the two protons on C2 (H2a, H2b).\n    *   H1 is coupled to the two protons on C8 (H8a, H8b).\n    *   H1 is coupled to the proton on C9 (H9, there are two protons on C9, H9-syn and H9-anti). Let's assume it couples to both. No, C1 is bonded to C2, C8, and C9. So H1 is coupled to the two H2 protons, the two H8 protons, and the two H9 protons. This would be a very complex multiplet.\n\nLet me re-examine the structure of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione.\n*   C1 is bonded to C2, C8, and C9.\n*   C5 is bonded to C4, C6, and C9.\n*   The protons at C1 and C5 are equivalent by symmetry.\n*   Let's focus on H1. It is coupled to:\n    *   Two protons at C2.\n    *   Two protons at C8.\n    *   One proton at C9 (the other C9 proton is on the other side of the symmetry plane). No, C1 is bonded to C9. C9 is a CH2 group. So H1 is coupled to two protons at C9.\n    *   Let's re-verify the structure. Bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane. C1 and C5 are bridgeheads. They are connected by three bridges: C2-C3-C4, C6-C7-C8, and C9.\n    *   In bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione, the ketones are at C3 and C7.\n    *   The bridgehead proton H1 is coupled to the two protons at C2, the two protons at C8, and the two protons at C9. This seems too complex.\n\nLet's reconsider the structure of Product 3.\nOzonolysis of protoadamantene (tricyclo[4.3.1.0<sup>3,8</sup>]dec-4-ene).\nThe double bond is between C4 and C5. The carbons are numbered differently in the systematic name. Let's use a drawing.\nProtoadamantane has a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane core with an extra C-C bond between C3 and C7 (using bicyclo numbering). No, that's not right.\nLet's look at the structure of protoadamantane. It is tricyclo[4.3.1.0<sup>3,8</sup>]decane.\nThe double bond in protoadamantene is at a bridgehead in one of the rings, which is unusual. Let me check the structure of protoadamantene again.\nLooking at the structure from reference, the double bond is at position 4, which is not a bridgehead of the main bicyclic system. Cleavage of this C4=C5 bond in protoadamantene (let's use the numbering from the paper) will indeed break one of the rings.\nThe resulting product is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione. I am confident in this structure.\n\nNow, let's re-evaluate the coupling of the most deshielded proton.\nThe protons alpha to the carbonyls (at C2, C4, C6, C8) and the bridgehead protons (at C1, C5) are the candidates. In similar bicyclic ketones, the bridgehead protons are often the most deshielded. Let's assume H1/H5 are the most deshielded.\nLet's analyze the coupling for H1 in bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione.\n*   H1 is coupled to two protons on C2 (geminal to the carbonyl). Let's call the coupling constant J_1,2.\n*   H1 is coupled to two protons on C8 (geminal to the other carbonyl). By symmetry, J_1,8 = J_1,2.\n*   H1 is coupled to two protons on C9 (the methylene bridge). Let's call the coupling constant J_1,9.\nThis would lead to a very complex signal, not a simple triplet, doublet of triplets, or pentet.\n\nThere must be something I am missing. Let's reconsider the most deshielded proton.\nCould it be one of the alpha-protons? For example, H2.\n*   H2 is coupled to its geminal partner on C2.\n*   H2 is coupled to the bridgehead proton H1.\nThis would be a doublet of doublets. Not one of the options.\n\nLet's think about the conformation of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione. It exists predominantly in a dual chair-chair conformation. In this conformation, the bridgehead protons H1 and H5 point inwards.\nLet's look at the couplings again for H1.\n*   Coupling to H2ax and H2eq.\n*   Coupling to H8ax and H8eq.\n*   Coupling to H9syn and H9anti.\nThis is still too complex.\n\nWhat if there is some simplification?\nPerhaps some coupling constants are zero. The dihedral angle between H1 and the equatorial protons on C2/C8 might be close to 90 degrees, making that coupling small (Karplus equation). But the coupling to the axial protons would be significant.\nWhat if the four protons on C2 and C8 are magnetically equivalent from the perspective of H1? And the two protons on C9 are also equivalent? This is unlikely.\n\nLet's reconsider the structure of Product 2. What if the reaction with aluminum isopropoxide does not lead to elimination?\nProduct 2 is protoadamantan-4-ol.\nThen what does ozonolysis do to an alcohol? Nothing. The question must imply that an alkene is formed. The sequence of ketone -> alcohol -> alkene is a very standard transformation, and the reagents are plausible for it, even if not explicitly stated as two separate steps.\n\nLet's go back to Product 3: bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione.\nLet's assume the most deshielded proton is indeed the bridgehead proton (H1/H5).\nLet's look at the neighbors again. C2, C8, C9. All are CH2 groups.\nSo H1 has 6 neighbors. This doesn't lead to any of the simple patterns given.\n\nIs there another possible product from the ozonolysis?\nWhat if Product 2 is not protoadamantene?\nWhat if the reaction with aluminum isopropoxide is an Oppenauer oxidation? That would be the reverse reaction, which makes no sense as we start with a ketone.\n\nLet's reconsider the initial reaction. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH.\nCould it form something else? The evidence for protoadamantan-4-one is strong, but based on inference, not a direct statement. However, it fits the spectral data requirement (ketone) and the formula. The unusual NMR shift is a hallmark of a strained polycyclic system.\n\nLet's assume the reaction sequence I've outlined is correct.\nProduct 1: Protoadamantan-4-one\nProduct 2: Protoadamantene\nProduct 3: Bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione\n\nNow, why would the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton in Product 3 be simple?\nLet's look at the structure of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione again.\nMaybe the most deshielded proton is not the bridgehead one.\nWhat about the protons on the C9 methylene bridge? They are beta to two carbonyls. This could deshield them significantly. Let's call them H9s and H9a.\n*   H9s is coupled to H9a (geminal coupling).\n*   H9s is coupled to H1 and H5.\nIf H1 and H5 are equivalent, this would be a triplet. But H9s is also coupled to H9a. So it would be a doublet of triplets.\n*   Let's check H1's coupling again. It couples to 2 protons on C2, 2 on C8, 2 on C9.\nWhat if, due to the chair-chair conformation, the coupling constants to the four protons on C2 and C8 are all very similar? And the coupling to the two protons on C9 is different?\nThis is getting speculative.\n\nLet's search for the 1H NMR spectrum of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione.\n\n**Proposer:** I have deduced the structures of the intermediates and the final product. Product 1 is protoadamantan-4-one. Product 2 is protoadamantene, formed by MPV reduction and subsequent dehydration. Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione, formed by ozonolysis of Product 2. The final step is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton in bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione. Based on the structure, the bridgehead protons (H1, H5) are likely the most deshielded. I need to find the NMR spectrum of this compound to confirm which proton is the most deshielded and what its coupling pattern is.\n\n**Skeptic:** The proposed reaction sequence is logical but contains an assumption: the one-pot reduction and dehydration to form protoadamantene. While plausible, it's not explicitly stated. More importantly, the analysis of the coupling pattern for the bridgehead proton in bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione suggests a very complex multiplet, which does not match any of the simple options (A, B, C, D). This indicates either the most deshielded proton is not the bridgehead proton, or there's some conformational averaging or accidental equivalence that simplifies the signal. We must find experimental NMR data for bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione to resolve this.\n\n**Decide:** The crucial next step is to find the 1H NMR spectrum and assignments for bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione. This will identify the most deshielded proton and its multiplicity.**Proposer's analysis of search results:**\n\nThe search for the 1H NMR of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione did not yield a readily available, fully assigned spectrum with clear coupling patterns. The search results show various substituted bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane derivatives, but not the specific parent dione I need. For instance, result provides data for 9-thiabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione, where the bridgehead protons (H1, H5) are at 3.37-3.38 ppm and the alpha-protons are at 2.47-2.69 ppm. This suggests the bridgehead protons are indeed deshielded. However, without the exact data for my target molecule, I cannot be certain.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the problem, as my deduction of the coupling pattern for the bridgehead proton (a complex multiplet) does not match the simple options provided in the question (triplet, doublet of triplets, pentet, triplet of triplets). This suggests one of three possibilities:\n1.  My structure for Product 3 is wrong.\n2.  The most deshielded proton is not the bridgehead proton.\n3.  There is a simplification of the coupling pattern due to specific dihedral angles or magnetic equivalence.\n\nLet's reconsider the structure of Product 3. The ozonolysis of protoadamantene should reliably give bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione. This part of the deduction seems solid.\n\nLet's reconsider which proton is the most deshielded. The candidates are the bridgehead protons (H1, H5) and the protons on the C9 methylene bridge. The C9 protons are beta to two carbonyl groups, which is a deshielding environment. The bridgehead protons (H1, H5) are alpha to two CH2 groups which are themselves alpha to carbonyls. It is plausible that the bridgehead protons are the most deshielded.\n\nLet's assume the bridgehead proton (H1) is the most deshielded and re-examine its coupling, looking for a reason for simplification.\n*   H1 is coupled to six neighboring protons: two on C2, two on C8, and two on C9.\n*   The molecule exists in a chair-chair conformation.\n*   Let's analyze the couplings from H1:\n    *   Coupling to H2-axial and H2-equatorial.\n    *   Coupling to H8-axial and H8-equatorial.\n    *   Coupling to H9-syn and H9-anti.\n*   By symmetry, the coupling to the C2 protons will be identical to the coupling to the C8 protons. So we have J(H1, H2ax) = J(H1, H8ax) and J(H1, H2eq) = J(H1, H8eq).\n*   This means H1 is coupled to two equivalent axial protons and two equivalent equatorial protons on the \"sides\" of the bicycle.\n*   It is also coupled to the two non-equivalent protons on the C9 bridge.\n*   This still seems too complex.\n\nLet's think about the options.\nA) triplet (n=2)\nB) doublet of triplets (n=1, and n=2)\nC) pentet (n=4)\nD) triplet of triplets (n=2, and n=2)\n\nA \"pentet\" (also called a quintet) arises from coupling to four equivalent protons (n+1=5).\nCould it be that H1 couples to the two axial protons on C2/C8 and the two equatorial protons on C2/C8 with roughly the same coupling constant? This would be an accidental equivalence. If J(H1, H2ax) ≈ J(H1, H2eq), then H1 would see four equivalent protons on C2 and C8. What about the C9 protons? The coupling to these might be negligible. In some bicyclic systems, long-range coupling across the bridge can be small. If we ignore the coupling to C9, and assume the four protons on C2/C8 are roughly equivalent, we would get a pentet.\n\nLet's try another approach. What if the most deshielded proton is on the C9 bridge? Let's call it H9a.\n*   H9a is coupled to its geminal partner, H9s (a doublet).\n*   H9a is coupled to the two equivalent bridgehead protons, H1 and H5 (a triplet).\n*   The resulting pattern would be a doublet of triplets. This is option B.\n\nNow we have two plausible scenarios leading to two different answers.\n1.  Bridgehead proton (H1) is most deshielded, and due to accidental equivalence of couplings to the four neighboring protons on C2/C8 (and negligible coupling to C9), it appears as a pentet (C).\n2.  C9 bridge proton is most deshielded, and it couples to its geminal partner and the two bridgehead protons, appearing as a doublet of triplets (B).\n\nWhich proton is more deshielded? A bridgehead proton (H1) or a methylene proton beta to two ketones (H9)? Without spectral data, this is hard to determine definitively. However, in many bicyclic systems, bridgehead protons are significantly deshielded.\n\nLet's reconsider the pentet possibility. For H1 to be a pentet, it needs to couple to four equivalent protons. The neighbors are H2ax, H2eq, H8ax, H8eq. For them to be equivalent in their coupling to H1, we would need J(H1,H2ax) = J(H1,H2eq) = J(H1,H8ax) = J(H1,H8eq). This seems unlikely given the different dihedral angles.\n\nLet's reconsider the doublet of triplets. This seems like a more \"classic\" coupling pattern. But is the C9 proton the most deshielded? It's beta to two carbonyls. The bridgehead proton is adjacent to carbons that are alpha to carbonyls. The deshielding effect falls off with distance. So it's a competition.\n\nLet's try to find a reference that discusses the relative chemical shifts in such a system. In norbornane, the bridgehead proton is at ~2.2 ppm. In adamantanone, the bridgehead protons are around 2.5-3.0 ppm. Protons alpha to a ketone are ~2.4 ppm. This doesn't give a clear winner.\n\nLet's look at the options again. A triplet of triplets (D) would mean coupling to two sets of two equivalent protons. For H1, this could happen if J(H1,H2ax) = J(H1,H8ax) and J(H1,H2eq) = J(H1,H8eq), and the coupling to C9 is negligible. This would give a triplet of triplets (or more accurately, a multiplet that could be approximated as such).\n\nLet's step back. The question is from a context (likely an exam or textbook) where there is a single correct answer based on general principles. Overly complex analyses or reliance on accidental equivalence might be the wrong path.\nThe structure of Product 3, bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione, is highly symmetric. The most deshielded protons are almost certainly the two equivalent bridgehead protons (H1 and H5).\nLet's focus on H1. It is coupled to H2(eq), H2(ax), H8(eq), H8(ax), H9(syn), and H9(anti).\nDue to the C2v symmetry of the molecule (in its ideal chair-chair form), H2(eq) is equivalent to H8(eq), H2(ax) is equivalent to H8(ax).\nSo, H1 couples to:\n-   Two protons with coupling J1\n-   Two protons with coupling J2\n-   Two protons (on C9) with couplings J3 and J4.\nThis is still too complex.\n\nThere must be a simplification. In many bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane systems, the molecule flattens to relieve steric strain between the C3 and C7 positions. In our dione, this strain is reduced, but the chair-chair form is still expected.\nWhat if the coupling to the C9 protons is negligible? This is a W-coupling (4-bond coupling) and can sometimes be significant, but let's assume it's not.\nThen H1 couples to two protons (H2ax, H8ax) with J_ax and two protons (H2eq, H8eq) with J_eq. This would give a triplet of triplets. This is option D.\n\nLet's compare the likelihood of Pentet vs. Triplet of Triplets.\n-   Pentet requires J_ax ≈ J_eq.\n-   Triplet of Triplets requires J_ax and J_eq to be different (and resolved) and J_W to be negligible.\nA triplet of triplets seems a more chemically reasonable pattern for this situation than a pentet, which relies on accidental equivalence.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the doublet of triplets. This requires the C9 proton to be the most deshielded. It couples to its geminal partner (doublet) and the two bridgehead protons (triplet). This is a clean pattern. Is it plausible for H9 to be the most deshielded? Being beta to two carbonyls is strongly deshielding.\n\nLet's try to find a calculated 1H NMR for bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione.\nA quick search doesn't provide this.\n\nLet's go with the most plausible chemical reasoning. The bridgehead protons H1/H5 are in a very constrained environment and are adjacent to carbons bearing electron-withdrawing groups (the CH2-C=O fragments). They are very likely the most deshielded. The coupling pattern would arise from coupling to the four protons on C2/C8 and potentially the two on C9. Given the options, a pattern that simplifies from this complex arrangement is expected. A triplet of triplets (D) arises naturally if we assume the two axial protons are equivalent, the two equatorial protons are equivalent (which they are by symmetry), and the long-range coupling to C9 is negligible. This seems like the most reasonable simplification that leads to one of the given answers.\n\nFinal check of the logic:\n1.  Product 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH -> Protoadamantan-4-one. (Reasonable based on IR/NMR and known rearrangements).\n2.  Product 2: Protoadamantan-4-one + Al(OiPr)3 -> Protoadamantene. (Reasonable as MPV reduction followed by elimination creates the substrate for the next step).\n3.  Product 3: Protoadamantene + O3/DMS -> Bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione. (Standard ozonolysis).\n4.  Most deshielded proton in Product 3: Bridgehead H1/H5. (Plausible due to electronic effects and constrained geometry).\n5.  Coupling of H1: Coupled to 2xH2 and 2xH8. By symmetry, this is coupling to two pairs of equivalent protons (axial and equatorial pairs). If long-range coupling is ignored, this gives a triplet of triplets.\n\nThis seems to be the most coherent line of reasoning.\n\nLet's reconsider the pentet. A pentet implies coupling to 4 equivalent protons. This would happen if J(H1, H2ax) is very similar to J(H1, H2eq). Looking at a model, the dihedral angle for the axial proton is ~60 degrees, and for the equatorial proton is also ~60 degrees, but in the other direction. The Karplus equation is sensitive to more than just the dihedral angle, but it's plausible they could be similar. If they are similar, the signal would be a pentet.\n\nLet's compare triplet of triplets vs pentet. Both are plausible depending on the relative coupling constants. However, a pentet is a simpler pattern. Often in such problems, simplifications are assumed. The simplification to a pentet (quintet) is a very common one when a proton is coupled to two adjacent CH2 groups where the couplings are not well-resolved.\n\nLet's assume the bridgehead proton H1 is the most deshielded. It is coupled to the four protons on the adjacent C2 and C8 methylene groups. If the coupling constants to all four of these protons are sufficiently similar, the signal will appear as a pentet (a quintet). This is a common simplification in proton NMR when multiple couplings are similar and not resolved.\n\nFinal decision process: The structure is almost certainly bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione. The most deshielded proton is likely the bridgehead proton. It is coupled to four protons on the adjacent methylenes (C2 and C8). The simplest and most common pattern for a proton coupled to an adjacent -CH2-CH2- system in a ring, where free rotation is not possible but the various J values are coincidentally similar, is a pentet.\n\nTherefore, I will choose C.\n\nLet's double check the other options.\nA) Triplet: requires coupling to 2 equivalent protons. Unlikely.\nB) Doublet of triplets: requires coupling to one proton and a set of two equivalent protons. This would fit the C9 proton if it were the most deshielded, but that is less likely than the bridgehead proton.\nD) Triplet of triplets: requires coupling to two different sets of two equivalent protons. This is plausible for the bridgehead proton if J_ax and J_eq are different and resolved, and W-coupling is negligible.\n\nBetween C and D, C represents a greater degree of simplification (all four J values are similar), while D represents a more nuanced view (two pairs of different J values). In the context of a multiple-choice question, the simpler, more idealized pattern is often the intended answer.\n\nFinal conclusion is C.Here is a step-by-step derivation of the products and the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240°C with an excess of potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C10H14Br2).\n*   **Reagents:** KOH is a strong base, and the reaction is performed at high temperature.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a ketone (C=O) group.\n    *   The molecular formula of the adamantane core is C10H14. The product has a ketone, suggesting a formula of C10H14O. This implies a reaction where the two bromine atoms are replaced by one oxygen atom, with the loss of 2 HBr and the addition of H2O overall, which is complex.\n    *   A more likely scenario under these harsh conditions is a skeletal rearrangement. The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes with a base can lead to a ring-opening/rearrangement to form a protoadamantane skeleton.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 1:** The product is **protoadamantan-4-one** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³'⁸]decan-4-one). This structure is an isomer of adamantanone (C10H14O) and is consistent with the formation of a ketone. The complex and highly deshielded ¹H NMR signals are characteristic of such a strained polycyclic system.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (protoadamantan-4-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction is a **Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction**, which reduces a ketone to an alcohol. However, the subsequent reaction is ozonolysis, which cleaves a C=C double bond. This strongly implies that the alcohol formed from the reduction undergoes dehydration in the same step to form an alkene. High temperatures favor this elimination.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 2:** The ketone is first reduced to protoadamantan-4-ol, which then dehydrates to form **protoadamantene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³'⁸]dec-4-ene).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (protoadamantene) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an **ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup**. This reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond (C4=C5 in protoadamantene) and replaces it with two carbonyl groups.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 3:** The cleavage of the C=C bond in the protoadamantene skeleton results in the formation of a single, larger ring system. The product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione**. This is a highly symmetrical molecule.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione.\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** In this symmetrical dione, the most deshielded protons are the two equivalent bridgehead protons at positions C1 and C5. These protons are in a unique electronic environment, being at a bridgehead and adjacent to carbons (C2, C8, C9) that are influenced by the two ketone groups.\n*   **Coupling Analysis:** Let's analyze the coupling for the proton at C1 (H1).\n    *   H1 is bonded to a carbon that is connected to C2, C8, and C9.\n    *   Therefore, H1 is coupled to the protons on these three carbons.\n    *   C2 and C8 are methylene groups (CH₂). Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons on C2 are equivalent to the two protons on C8 from the perspective of H1's coupling environment.\n    *   So, H1 is coupled to the four protons on C2 and C8.\n    *   In many bicyclic systems, long-range coupling across the C9 bridge might be negligible or unresolved.\n    *   The coupling of a proton to an adjacent CH₂-CH₂ group in a constrained ring system, where the individual coupling constants to the four neighboring protons are not resolved but are of similar magnitude, often results in a simplified pattern.\n    *   According to the n+1 rule, if a proton is coupled to 'n' equivalent protons, its signal is split into n+1 lines. If H1 couples to the four protons on C2 and C8 and they are treated as approximately equivalent, the signal will be split into (4+1) = 5 lines.\n*   **Conclusion on Coupling Pattern:** A signal with 5 lines is called a **pentet** (or quintet).\n\nTherefore, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3 is a pentet.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

This corresponds to the formation of a ketone by replacing a CH₂ group with a C=O group. The most plausible structure for a ketone formed from the adamantane skeleton with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O is **2-adamantanone**.\n*   However, the provided ¹H NMR spectrum (4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H)) does not match the known spectrum of 2-adamantanone. Furthermore, the subsequent reaction step involves ozonolysis, which requires the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond. 2-adamantanone is a saturated ketone and would not react with ozone.\n*   This indicates a contradiction in the problem statement. The ozonolysis step implies that Product 1 must be an unsaturated ketone (containing a C=C bond). An unsaturated ketone with an adamantane skeleton would have the formula C₁₀H₁₂O. This contradicts the ¹H NMR integration of 14H.\n*   Let's assume the ozonolysis reaction is the key chemical fact and that the provided ¹H NMR integration for Product 1 is a typo. The most plausible unsaturated ketone that could be formed is **adamant-4-en-2-one**. The signal at 4.79 ppm, while low for vinylic protons, can be attributed to the two hydrogens on the C=C double bond in this strained system.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (assumed to be adamant-4-en-2-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Transformation:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces a ketone to an alcohol.

The cleavage of the C4=C5 bond opens one of the rings of the adamantane cage.\n*   **Product 3:** The resulting structure is a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane skeleton. It has the original alcohol at C-2 and two new aldehyde groups at the positions corresponding to the original C-3 and C-7. The structure is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-2-ol-3,7-dicarbaldehyde** (C₁₀H₁₄O₃).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Identify the most deshielded hydrogen atom:** In Product 3, the most deshielded protons (excluding the exchangeable OH proton) are the two aldehyde protons (-CHO). Their chemical shifts are typically in the 9-10 ppm range, significantly higher than any other C-H proton in the molecule.\n*   **Determine the coupling pattern:** We need to determine the splitting pattern of one of these aldehyde protons. Let's analyze the aldehyde proton attached to C-3 (let's call it Hₐ).\n    *   **³J Coupling:** The aldehyde proton Hₐ is separated by three bonds from the proton on C-3 of the ring (H-3). This ³J coupling will split the signal of Hₐ into a **doublet**.\n    *   **⁴J Coupling (Long-Range Coupling):** In rigid cyclic systems like this, long-range coupling over four bonds can be significant. The aldehyde proton Hₐ is four bonds away from the two protons on C-4 (H-4a and H-4b). If this ⁴J coupling is resolved, and assuming the two H-4 protons are magnetically equivalent (or appear so due to similar coupling constants or rapid conformational changes), they will split the signal of Hₐ into a **triplet**.\n*   **Combine the couplings:** The signal for the aldehyde proton Hₐ would therefore be split first into a doublet by H-3, and each line of that doublet would be further split into a triplet by the two H-4 protons. The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets**.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and its NMR spectrum.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240°C with an excess of potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n*   **Analysis:** The starting material is a rigid, cage-like alkane with two bromine substituents. The reaction conditions (a strong base at high temperature) suggest a complex reaction. While substitution or elimination might be considered, the rigid structure of adamantane makes these pathways unusual. This specific reaction is a known, albeit complex, skeletal rearrangement. The product formed under these conditions is **protoadamant-4-one**. The characteristic IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to a ketone, which is consistent with this product structure. The unusual ¹H NMR values provided in the prompt are likely erroneous for this known compound but point toward the formation of a rearranged ketone.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (protoadamant-4-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which reduces ketones to alcohols. However, heating an alcohol with a Lewis acid like aluminum isopropoxide can also lead to dehydration. Therefore, the ketone is first reduced to protoadamant-4-ol, which then dehydrates under the heated conditions to form an alkene. The resulting alkene is **protoadamant-4-ene**.\n\n### Step 3: Formation of Product 3\n\n*   **Reaction:** Ozone (O₃) is bubbled through a solution of Product 2 (protoadamant-4-ene) at -78°C, followed by the addition of dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup. Ozonolysis cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond and replaces it with two carbonyl groups. The cleavage of the double bond in protoadamant-4-ene opens one of the rings in the polycyclic structure.\n*   **Product 3:** The resulting product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione**. This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n\n### Step 4: ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione.\n*   **Most Deshielded Hydrogen:** In this symmetrical dione, the most deshielded protons are the two equivalent bridgehead protons (at positions C1 and C5). These protons are beta to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n*   **Coupling Pattern:** To determine the coupling pattern of one of these bridgehead protons (e.g., H1), we must identify its neighboring protons.\n    *   H1 is adjacent to the methylene groups at C2 and C8. By symmetry, the coupling interactions with the protons on C2 are identical to those with the protons on C8.\n    *   On each methylene group (C2 and C8), there are two non-equivalent protons: one axial and one equatorial.\n    *   The bridgehead proton H1 will couple to the two axial protons (H2-ax and H8-ax) with one coupling constant (J_ax). Since these two protons are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry, this coupling will split the H1 signal into a triplet.\n    *   Simultaneously, H1 will couple to the two equatorial protons (H2-eq and H8-eq) with a different coupling constant (J_eq). This interaction will also split the signal into a triplet.\n    *   While there is also potential for coupling to the protons on the C9 bridge, this coupling is often weak or unresolved in such systems. The major observable pattern is determined by the couplings to the four protons on C2 and C8.\n\nThe result of a proton being coupled to two different sets of two equivalent protons is a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess KOH, heated to 240°C.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   IR: 1720 cm⁻¹ (characteristic of a C=O, ketone group).\n    *   ¹H NMR: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). Total 14H.\n    *   The molecular formula of the starting material is C₁₀H₁₄Br₂. The product has 14 protons and contains an oxygen atom, suggesting a formula of C₁₀H₁₄O.\n\n*   **Analysis:** The reaction involves the loss of two bromine atoms and the gain of one oxygen atom. The IR spectrum confirms the product is a ketone. The ¹H NMR is the most informative piece of data. The signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is in the vinylic region, indicating a C=C double bond with two protons. The fact that these two protons appear as a single signal with an integration of 2H implies they are chemically equivalent due to symmetry.\n\n*   A structure that fits all these data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n    *   **Formula:** C₁₀H₁₄O. Correct.\n    *   **Functionality:** It is a bicyclic ketone, consistent with the IR peak.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C3 carbonyl group and the C7 methylene group. This plane makes the two protons of the exocyclic C=CH₂ group chemically equivalent.\n    *   **NMR:** The chemical shift for exocyclic methylene protons (=CH₂) is typically 4.6-4.9 ppm, which is an excellent match for the observed signal at 4.79 ppm.\n    *   **Formation:** This product can be formed from 1,3-disubstituted adamantanes via a fragmentation-rearrangement pathway under harsh conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-i-Pr)₃.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces ketones to alcohols. The C=C double bond is not affected.\n*   **Product 2 Structure:** The ketone group at C3 of Product 1 is reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup. Ozonolysis cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. The exocyclic C₇=CH₂ double bond in Product 2 is cleaved.\n    *   The C₇ carbon of the ring becomes a ketone (C=O).\n    *   The external CH₂ group becomes formaldehyde (CH₂O), which is a byproduct.\n*   **Product 3 Structure:** The resulting main product is a bicyclic keto-alcohol.\n    *   Product 3 is **3-hydroxy-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-one**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in Product 3 (excluding the exchangeable -OH proton)?\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** 3-hydroxy-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-one. This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7.\n*   **Identifying the most deshielded proton:**\n    *   Protons alpha to the ketone (at C6 and C8) are deshielded (~2.5 ppm).\n    *   Bridgehead protons (at C1 and C5) are in the aliphatic region.\n    *   The proton on the carbon bearing the alcohol group (the H-C-OH proton at C3) is deshielded by the adjacent oxygen atom. Its chemical shift is typically in the range of 3.5-4.5 ppm.\n    *   Therefore, the proton at C3 (let's call it H3) is the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton.\n\n*   **Determining the coupling pattern of H3:**\n    *   The splitting of H3 is determined by the number of protons on the adjacent carbons, which are C2 and C4.\n    *   In the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane skeleton, both C2 and C4 are methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons on C2 are equivalent to the two protons on C4.\n    *   Thus, H3 is coupled to a total of 4 neighboring protons (two on C2 and two on C4).\n    *   According to the n+1 rule, a proton coupled to 'n' equivalent neighboring protons will be split into 'n+1' peaks.\n    *   Here, n = 4. Therefore, the signal for H3 will be split into 4 + 1 = 5 peaks.\n    *   A signal with 5 peaks is called a **pentet** (or quintet).\n\n(Note: In a rigid chair conformation, the axial and equatorial protons on C2 and C4 would be non-equivalent, leading to a more complex pattern like a triplet of triplets. However, given the options and the conformational flexibility of the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system, the coupling constants often become similar enough to resolve as a simpler pentet. \"Pentet\" is the best description among the choices for a proton coupled to four neighboring protons.)\n\nFinal Answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and its NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane. This is a rigid, tricyclic C10 hydrocarbon cage with bromine atoms at two bridgehead positions. Its formula is C10H14Br2.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess KOH at 240°C. These are harsh, basic conditions.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone.\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum shows a total of 2H + 10H + 2H = 14 protons. This means the C10H14 skeleton is retained.\n    *   The formula of Product 1 is therefore C10H14O.\n*   **Structure Determination:** The formula C10H14O for a molecule derived from the tricyclic adamantane framework (which has 3 degrees of unsaturation) implies 4 degrees of unsaturation (DoU = (2*10 + 2 - 14)/2 = 4). These are accounted for by 3 rings and 1 C=O group. This means Product 1 is a saturated tricyclic ketone. The most plausible and stable ketone with a C10 adamantane-type skeleton is **adamantan-2-one** (also known as tricyclo[3.3.1.1³,⁷]decan-2-one). While the mechanism for its formation from 1,3-dibromoadamantane is complex (involving hydrolysis and rearrangement), the product data strongly points to this structure. The provided NMR data is a simplified representation of its spectrum.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (adamantan-2-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic **Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction**. This reaction specifically reduces ketones and aldehydes to their corresponding alcohols.\n*   **Product 2 Structure:** The ketone group in adamantan-2-one is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Therefore, Product 2 is **adamantan-2-ol**. Its formula is C10H16O.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (adamantan-2-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** The reagent combination (O₃ followed by DMS) is characteristic of an ozonolysis reaction, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). However, Product 2, adamantan-2-ol, is a saturated alcohol and contains no C=C bonds. This suggests that the ozone is performing a different, less common reaction. Ozone is a powerful oxidizing agent and is known to oxidize C-H bonds, particularly tertiary C-H bonds.\n*   Adamantan-2-ol has four tertiary C-H bonds at the bridgehead positions (C1, C3, C5, and C7). The reaction with ozone will oxidize one of these bridgehead C-H bonds to a C-OH group.\n*   **Product 3 Structure:** The reaction will form a diol of adamantane. For example, if the C-H bond at position C5 is oxidized, the product is **adamantane-2,5-diol**. The exact position of the second hydroxyl group (C1, C5, or C7) does not affect the analysis of the target proton.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)?\n*   **Identification of the Proton:** The protons that exchange with deuterated solvent are the -OH protons. We are interested in the C-H protons. The most deshielded C-H protons are those attached to carbons bearing an electronegative atom like oxygen. In adamantane-2,x-diol, the proton on C2 (H-C2) is attached to a carbon bearing a hydroxyl group and is typically the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton.\n*   **Coupling Analysis:** We need to determine how many neighboring protons the H-C2 proton is coupled to.\n    *   The C2 carbon in the adamantane cage is bonded to two other carbons: the bridgehead C1 and the bridgehead C3.\n    *   Both C1 and C3 are tertiary carbons, each bearing one proton (H-C1 and H-C3).\n    *   Therefore, the H-C2 proton is coupled to two neighboring protons.\n    *   Due to the symmetry of the adamantane cage relative to the C2 position, the two neighboring protons (H-C1 and H-C3) are in equivalent chemical environments. They will have the same coupling constant (J) to H-C2.\n*   **Determining the Splitting Pattern:** According to the n+1 rule, a proton coupled to 'n' equivalent neighboring protons is split into a signal with (n+1) peaks. In this case, n=2.\n*   **Conclusion:** The signal for H-C2 will be split into a (2+1) = 3 peak pattern. This pattern is called a **triplet**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\nThe starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. It is heated with a strong base (KOH) at a high temperature (240°C). This suggests a reaction involving elimination and/or rearrangement. The spectral data for the product (Product 1) are key:\n*   **IR spectrum:** An absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), likely a ketone.\n*   **¹H NMR spectrum:** The integration (2H + 10H + 2H = 14H) matches the number of hydrogens in the starting material (C10H14Br2), indicating the adamantane skeleton is likely intact and the formula is C10H14O.\nThe reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes under these conditions is known to cause a skeletal rearrangement to form a more strained isomer. The product is **protoadamantan-4-one**. The unusual chemical shift at 4.79 ppm in the provided NMR data is likely due to the high strain in this tetracyclic ketone structure.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\nProduct 1 (protoadamantan-4-one) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-iPr)₃. This reagent is used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts ketones to alcohols. Thus, protoadamantan-4-one is reduced to protoadamantan-4-ol.\nThe next step in the sequence is ozonolysis, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. This implies that the alcohol formed, protoadamantan-4-ol, must have been converted to an alkene. Under heating, alcohols can undergo dehydration. Dehydration of protoadamantan-4-ol forms a double bond between C4 and C5, yielding **protoadamant-4-ene** (Product 2). Elimination towards the C3 bridgehead is disfavored by Bredt's rule.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3**\nProduct 2 (protoadamant-4-ene) is subjected to ozonolysis (O₃ at -78°C) followed by a reductive workup with dimethylsulfide (DMS). This reaction cleaves the C=C double bond and replaces it with two carbonyl groups.\nCleavage of the C4=C5 double bond in the C10 tetracyclic protoadamant-4-ene skeleton results in a C10 tricyclic dicarbonyl compound. The carbon atom at position 4 of the double bond becomes a ketone, and the carbon atom at position 5 becomes an aldehyde. The resulting structure is **7-oxobicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3-carbaldehyde** (Product 3).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR of Product 3**\nThe question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in Product 3.\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** In a molecule containing alkyl protons, protons alpha to a ketone, and an aldehyde proton, the **aldehyde proton (-CHO)** is by far the most deshielded (typically δ 9-10 ppm).\n*   **Coupling Analysis:** We need to determine how the signal for this aldehyde proton is split by neighboring protons.\n    1.  **³J Coupling (3-bond coupling):** The aldehyde proton is coupled to the single proton on the adjacent carbon, C3. This coupling to one proton (n=1) splits the signal into a **doublet** (n+1 = 2 peaks).\n    2.  **Long-Range Coupling:** The answer choices suggest more complex splitting. We must consider coupling over more than three bonds. The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane framework is rigid, allowing for observable long-range couplings. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making the two bridgehead protons (at C1 and C5) chemically equivalent.\n    3.  **⁵J Coupling (5-bond coupling):** There is a viable coupling path over five bonds between the aldehyde proton and the two equivalent bridgehead protons (H1 and H5). Coupling to these two equivalent protons (n=2) would split the signal into a **triplet** (n+1 = 3 peaks).\n*   **Final Pattern:** The signal for the aldehyde proton is first split into a doublet by the C3 proton, and each peak of this doublet is then further split into a triplet by the two equivalent bridgehead protons. The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane. This is an adamantane molecule with bromine atoms at two bridgehead positions (C1 and C3).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess potassium hydroxide (KOH) at 240°C.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a reaction performed under harsh basic and thermal conditions on a tertiary alkyl halide. While substitution to a diol or elimination might be considered, the spectral data for Product 1 provides crucial clues.\n    *   **IR spectrum:** An absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone. This rules out a diol product.\n    *   **¹H NMR spectrum:** The provided NMR data (4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H)) is unusual and does not perfectly match common adamantane derivatives. However, the formation of a ketone is strongly supported by the IR data and known chemistry.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes with a strong base is known to cause a skeletal rearrangement. The established product of this reaction is **4-protoadamantanone** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]decan-4-one). This structure is a C₁₀H₁₄O ketone, consistent with the starting material and the IR data. We will proceed assuming Product 1 is 4-protoadamantanone, treating the provided NMR data as potentially misleading or for a different isomer not relevant to the main reaction path.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (4-protoadamantanone).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess aluminum isopropoxide (Al(O-iPr)₃) with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** The subsequent reaction step is ozonolysis, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. This means Product 2 must be an alkene. The transformation from a ketone (Product 1) to an alkene (Product 2) using Al(O-iPr)₃ can be understood as a two-step sequence in one pot:\n    1.  **Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) Reduction:** The ketone is reduced by aluminum isopropoxide to the corresponding alcohol. 4-protoadamantanone is reduced to **4-protoadamantanol**.\n    2.  **Dehydration:** The resulting alcohol is dehydrated upon heating, likely catalyzed by the Lewis acidic aluminum species. Dehydration of 4-protoadamantanol can form a double bond between C4 and C5.\n*   **Product 2:** The resulting alkene is **protoadamant-4-ene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene). This is a disubstituted alkene within the protoadamantane framework.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3 and analyze its ¹H NMR spectrum**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (protoadamant-4-ene).\n*   **Reagents:** Ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a reductive ozonolysis reaction. The C=C double bond is cleaved, and each carbon atom of the original double bond becomes a carbonyl group. Since Product 2 (protoadamant-4-ene) is a disubstituted alkene (R-CH=CH-R'), the ozonolysis will yield two aldehyde groups.\n    *   Cleaving the C4=C5 bond in the protoadamantane skeleton opens one of the rings. The remaining core is a **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane** system.\n    *   The two new aldehyde groups (-CHO) are attached to the positions that were connected to the double bond, which correspond to positions 3 and 7 of the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane skeleton.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde**.\n\n**¹H NMR Analysis of Product 3:**\n\n1.  **Identify the most deshielded hydrogen atom:** In bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde, the most deshielded protons are the two aldehyde protons (-CHO). They typically appear at δ 9-10 ppm. The question excludes protons that exchange with D₂O (like -OH or -NH), which does not apply to aldehyde protons.\n\n2.  **Determine the coupling of the aldehyde proton:** Each aldehyde proton is attached to a carbon (C3 or C7) that has one proton on it (a methine or CH group). Therefore, the aldehyde proton signal would be split into a **doublet**. However, \"doublet\" is not among the given options (A, B, C, D).\n\n3.  **Re-evaluate the question:** This discrepancy suggests that the question is not asking about the aldehyde proton, but rather the **most deshielded proton on the aliphatic skeleton**. These would be the protons at C3 and C7 (H3 and H7), which are alpha to the electron-withdrawing aldehyde groups. Their chemical shift would be around δ 2.5-3.0 ppm.\n\n4.  **Determine the coupling pattern of H3/H7:**\n    *   The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system in Product 3 adopts a stable dual-chair conformation. The molecule possesses a C₂ axis of symmetry, making H3 and H7 chemically equivalent.\n    *   To minimize steric hindrance, the bulky aldehyde groups (-CHO) will occupy the equatorial positions on the cyclohexane-like chairs.\n    *   This forces the protons H3 and H7 into the axial positions.\n    *   An axial proton (e.g., H3) is coupled to the protons on the adjacent methylene groups (C2 and C4). It has four vicinal neighbors: two axial protons (H2ax, H4ax) and two equatorial protons (H2eq, H4eq).\n    *   Due to the C₂ symmetry, the two axial neighbors are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial neighbors are equivalent to each other.\n    *   The coupling constant between axial protons (J_ax,ax) is large (~10-13 Hz).\n    *   The coupling constant between axial and equatorial protons (J_ax,eq) is small (~2-5 Hz).\n    *   Therefore, the signal for H3 is split by two equivalent protons with a large coupling constant (giving a triplet) and also by two other equivalent protons with a small coupling constant (which splits each line of the first triplet into another triplet).\n    *   The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets (tt)**.\n\nThis pattern matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the formation and structure of Product 1.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane (C10H16) is a tricyclic alkane.\n*   **Reaction:** Heating with excess KOH at 240°C. These are harsh conditions suggesting a complex reaction, likely involving rearrangement, not a simple substitution or elimination.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   **IR:** 1720 cm⁻¹. This is a strong absorbance characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone. The frequency is typical for a non-conjugated ketone in a six-membered ring or a slightly strained system.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H).\n        *   The total integration is 2+10+2 = 14 protons. The molecular formula of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is C10H14Br2. The reaction involves replacing two Br atoms with one O atom, so the formula of Product 1 is C10H14O. This is consistent with the proton count.\n        *   The simple pattern of the NMR spectrum (2H, 10H, 2H) suggests a high degree of symmetry in Product 1 (e.g., a C2 axis or a plane of symmetry).\n        *   The signal at 4.79 ppm is unusual. It is too high for a typical proton alpha to a ketone and too low for a typical vinyl proton in an unstrained system.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the subsequent reactions to deduce the nature of Products 1, 2, and 3.**\n\n*   **Product 1 → Product 2:** Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-iPr)₃. This is the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which specifically reduces ketones and aldehydes to alcohols. This confirms that Product 1 is a ketone, and Product 2 is the corresponding alcohol.\n    *   Product 1 (C10H14O, Ketone) → Product 2 (C10H16O, Alcohol)\n*   **Product 2 → Product 3:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a reductive ozonolysis reaction, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C).\n    *   The fact that ozonolysis is performed proves that Product 2 must contain a C=C double bond.\n    *   Since Product 2 is just the reduced form of Product 1, **Product 1 must be an unsaturated ketone**.\n    *   The IR of Product 1 (1720 cm⁻¹) suggests the C=O and C=C bonds are not conjugated (an α,β-unsaturated ketone would absorb at a lower frequency, ~1685 cm⁻¹).\n    *   Ozonolysis of a -CH=CH- unit with reductive workup (DMS) yields two aldehyde (-CHO) groups. The question asks about the coupling of a hydrogen atom in Product 3, which confirms that aldehydes (which have a C-H bond) are formed, not ketones. This implies the double bond in Product 2 was of the -CH=CH- type.\n    *   Therefore, Product 3 is a dialdehyde-alcohol (C10H16O₂), formed by cleaving the C=C bond of the unsaturated alcohol Product 2.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3 and analyze its ¹H NMR spectrum.**\n\n1.  **Plausible Structure of Intermediates:** While the exact structure of Product 1 is difficult to determine from the given information without resorting to obscure literature, we can deduce the general structural features of the final product. The formation from adamantane under rearrangement conditions often leads to other polycyclic systems. A plausible, albeit complex, series of rearrangements could lead to a bicyclic enone. Let's consider a plausible bicyclic skeleton that results from the adamantane rearrangement, for example, a bicyclo[3.3.2]decane system. Let's assume Product 2 is a bicyclo[3.3.2]dec-6-en-2-ol.\n\n2.  **Ozonolysis:** Cleaving the C=C bond in a bicyclic system opens one of the rings, resulting in a larger monocyclic system. In this case, ozonolysis of a bicyclic C10 alkene-alcohol will produce a C10 monocyclic dialdehyde-alcohol. The resulting ring will be a 10-membered cyclodecane ring.\n\n3.  **Structure of Product 3:** Product 3 is a cyclodecane ring substituted with one hydroxyl (-OH) group and two aldehyde (-CHO) groups. The exact substitution pattern would depend on the exact structure of the precursor, but we can analyze the local environment of the aldehyde protons regardless.\n\n4.  **¹H NMR of Product 3:**\n    *   **Most Deshielded Proton:** The most deshielded protons in Product 3 (excluding the exchangeable -OH proton) will be the aldehyde protons (-CHO), which typically resonate at δ = 9-10 ppm.\n    *   **Coupling Pattern:** We need to determine the splitting pattern of these aldehyde protons. The splitting is caused by coupling to protons on adjacent carbons.\n    *   An aldehyde proton (H-C=O) couples to the protons on the adjacent carbon atom (the α-carbon) via three bonds (³J coupling). It can also exhibit weaker coupling to protons on the β-carbon via four bonds (⁴J coupling).\n    *   The dialdehyde product is formed by breaking a C=C bond within a ring structure. Let's analyze the fragments that are formed: `...-CαHn-CHO`.\n    *   The precursor (Product 2) is a complex bicyclic alcohol. The carbons adjacent to the double bond are likely part of the complex framework, including both methylene (-CH₂-) and methine (-CH-) groups.\n    *   When the ring opens to form Product 3, the new aldehyde groups will find themselves adjacent to these former parts of the bicyclic framework. It is highly probable that the local environment of an aldehyde group will be `H(CO)-CαH₂-CβH-...` or `H(CO)-CαH-CβH₂-...`.\n    *   Let's analyze the expected coupling pattern for such a fragment:\n        *   **³J Coupling:** The aldehyde proton will couple to the protons on the α-carbon. If Cα is a -CH₂- group, this gives a triplet. If Cα is a -CH- group, this gives a doublet.\n        *   **⁴J Coupling:** The aldehyde proton will also couple to the protons on the β-carbon. If Cβ is a -CH₂- group, this gives a triplet. If Cβ is a -CH- group, this gives a doublet. (Note: ⁴J couplings are generally smaller than ³J couplings).\n    *   Let's consider a likely scenario based on a plausible rearranged structure. For example, the ozonolysis of a bicyclo[3.3.2]decene derivative as reasoned in the scratchpad. This leads to a structure where one aldehyde proton is adjacent to a -CH- group and its β-carbon is a -CH₂- group. The other aldehyde proton is adjacent to a -CH₂- group and its β-carbon is a -CH- group.\n        *   Case 1: `H(CO)-CH-CH₂-`. The aldehyde proton is split by the α-CH proton into a **doublet**. This doublet is further split by the β-CH₂ protons into **triplets**. The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets (dt)**.\n        *   Case 2: `H(CO)-CH₂-CH-`. The aldehyde proton is split by the α-CH₂ protons into a **triplet**. This triplet is further split by the β-CH proton into **doublets**. The resulting pattern is a **triplet of doublets (td)**, which has the same appearance as a doublet of triplets.\n    *   Therefore, regardless of which of the two non-equivalent aldehyde protons is the most deshielded, its coupling pattern is expected to be a **doublet of triplets** (or triplet of doublets).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most deshielded non-exchangeable proton in Product 3 is an aldehyde proton. Based on the likely structure resulting from the ozonolysis of a rearranged bicyclic alcohol, this proton will be coupled to both an adjacent methine (-CH-) and a next-nearest methylene (-CH₂-) group (or vice versa). This coupling will result in a **doublet of triplets** pattern.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is the step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Product 1:** The starting material, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, reacts with a strong base (KOH) at a high temperature (240°C). This is not a simple substitution or elimination. The spectral data (IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicating a ketone, and ¹H NMR data) points to a known skeletal rearrangement reaction that forms **protoadamantan-4-one**.\n\n2.  **Identify Product 2:** Product 1 (protoadamantan-4-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide. This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which reduces the ketone to a secondary alcohol, protoadamantan-4-ol. However, the subsequent reaction is ozonolysis, which requires a C=C double bond. It is a common secondary reaction for the alcohol to dehydrate under heating to form an alkene. The most likely alkene formed is **protoadamant-4-ene**.\n\n3.  **Identify Product 3:** Product 2 (protoadamant-4-ene) is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS). This is an ozonolysis with a reductive workup. Ozonolysis cleaves the C=C double bond. In protoadamantene, the double bond is between two tertiary carbons (carbons with no hydrogens attached). Therefore, the reductive workup yields two ketone groups, not aldehydes. The resulting product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3:**\n    *   **Product Structure:** Bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione.\n    *   **Most Deshielded Proton:** The most deshielded non-exchangeable protons are the two equivalent bridgehead protons at positions C1 and C5. They are beta to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Spin-Spin Coupling:** We need to determine the splitting pattern for one of these bridgehead protons (e.g., H1). H1 is coupled to its neighboring protons on C2, C8, and C9.\n        *   The four vicinal protons (on C2 and C8) are not equivalent. They exist as two distinct sets: two axial protons and two equatorial protons.\n        *   The coupling constant between the bridgehead proton and the two axial protons is large (J_ax ≈ 6.5 Hz), while the coupling to the two equatorial protons is smaller (J_eq ≈ 3.5 Hz). There is also a very small long-range coupling to the bridge protons.\n    *   **Simplification for Interpretation:** In complex spectra like this, the observed pattern is often simplified by considering only the largest coupling constant. The dominant coupling is with the two equivalent axial protons.\n    *   **Applying the n+1 Rule:** Using only the two strongly coupled axial protons as neighbors (n=2), the splitting pattern is given by the n+1 rule: 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nThe resulting signal is a **triplet**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded hydrogen atom.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240°C with an excess of potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂).\n*   **Product 1 Analysis:** The product is described as a light yellow solid with an IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a ketone functional group. The ¹H NMR spectrum shows a total of 14 protons, indicating that no hydrogen atoms were lost during the reaction. The molecular formula of the product is therefore C₁₀H₁₄O.\n*   **Identification of Product 1:** The reaction of 1,3-dihalo-adamantanes with a strong base is a known method for synthesizing adamantan-2-one via rearrangement. The given IR data strongly supports the formation of a ketone. Although the provided NMR data is anomalous for adamantan-2-one, the reaction conditions and IR spectrum point convincingly to **adamantan-2-one** as Product 1. The unusual NMR data in the prompt is likely a red herring or erroneous.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (adamantan-2-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Reagents and Reaction Type:** This set of reagents is used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts ketones and aldehydes to their corresponding alcohols.\n*   **Identification of Product 2:** The MPV reduction of adamantan-2-one (a ketone) yields the corresponding secondary alcohol, **adamantan-2-ol**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of Reaction 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (adamantan-2-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Reagents and Reaction Type:** The sequence of ozone followed by a reductive workup (with DMS) is the classic procedure for ozonolysis, which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. However, Product 2, adamantan-2-ol, is a saturated alcohol and has no C=C double bonds.\n*   **Alternative Reactivity:** While not its most common application, ozone can oxidize secondary alcohols to ketones. Given the context of the problem, this is the most plausible transformation. The dimethylsulfide serves to quench any excess ozone.\n*   **Identification of Product 3:** The oxidation of adamantan-2-ol (a secondary alcohol) regenerates the ketone, **adamantan-2-one**.\n\n### **Step 4: ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Product for Analysis:** The final product, Product 3, is adamantan-2-one.\n*   **Most Deshielded Hydrogen:** In a saturated ketone like adamantan-2-one, the most deshielded protons (those with the highest chemical shift) are the ones on the carbons alpha (adjacent) to the carbonyl group. In this case, these are the bridgehead protons at the C1 and C3 positions.\n*   **Coupling Pattern:** To determine the splitting pattern of the H1 proton, we must consider its neighboring protons. The adamantane cage is rigid, and coupling occurs over three bonds (vicinal coupling). The H1 proton is three bonds away from the protons on three different methylene (CH₂) groups: C6, C8, and C9.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the couplings to the protons on C6 and C8 are equivalent. These four protons can be considered as two sets of two equivalent protons.\n    *   A simplified and common interpretation for the coupling in this rigid system is to consider the major interactions. The H1 proton couples to the two pairs of non-equivalent protons on the adjacent C6 and C8 bridges.\n    *   Coupling to one pair of equivalent protons would result in a triplet. Coupling to a second, non-equivalent pair of protons would split each line of that triplet into another triplet.\n*   **Conclusion:** This leads to a theoretical splitting pattern of a **triplet of triplets**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis is a multi-step synthesis problem that requires identifying the structures of three successive products. The key to solving this problem lies in correctly interpreting each reaction and the provided spectral data, and recognizing that the question ultimately hinges on the structure of the final product, which should have a distinctive NMR spectrum matching one of the options.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Product 1 Formation:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with excess potassium hydroxide (KOH) at a high temperature (240°C). These harsh conditions with a strong base suggest a complex reaction involving elimination and/or rearrangement of the adamantane cage structure. The product is a ketone, as indicated by the strong IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n\n2.  **Product 2 Formation:** Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide, which is the reagent for a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction specifically reduces ketones to alcohols. Therefore, Product 2 is the alcohol corresponding to Product 1.\n\n3.  **Product 3 Formation:** Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis (O₃ followed by dimethyl sulfide, DMS). Ozonolysis is a classic organic reaction that cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to form two carbonyl compounds. The fact that this reaction occurs is a crucial piece of information: it proves that **Product 2 must contain a C=C double bond**. Consequently, Product 1 must have been an unsaturated ketone.\n\n**The Contradiction and Resolution:**\n\nAt first glance, there seems to be a contradiction. The most common rearrangement product of 1,3-dihalo-adamantanes under these conditions is protoadamantan-4-one. However, this is a saturated ketone and would not react with ozone. Similarly, if the reaction produced 2-adamantanone, its reduction product, 2-adamantanol, is also saturated.\n\nThe most logical conclusion is that the reaction sequence is designed to produce a specific, highly symmetric final product, even if the synthetic route is non-obvious or obscure. The question's focus is on the NMR spectrum of the final product. Let's consider a plausible, highly symmetric dicarbonyl product that could be formed on an adamantane framework: **2,6-adamantanedione**.\n\n**Analysis of Product 3 (2,6-adamantanedione):**\n\n*   **Structure:** 2,6-adamantanedione has a highly symmetric (D₂d) cage structure with two ketone groups at opposite methylene bridge positions.\n*   **Most Deshielded Protons:** The most deshielded protons (excluding any potential exchangeable protons) are the ones on carbons adjacent (alpha) to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. In this molecule, these are the four equivalent bridgehead protons at positions C1, C3, C5, and C7.\n*   **Coupling Pattern:** Let's analyze the coupling for one of these protons, for instance, the one at C1. This proton is bonded to a carbon that is connected to C2 (a carbonyl group, no protons), C8 (a CH₂ group), and C9 (a CH₂ group). Therefore, the proton at C1 will be split by the protons on C8 and C9.\n*   Due to the high symmetry of the molecule, the two protons on C8 are chemically and magnetically equivalent to each other, and they are also equivalent to the two protons on C9. This means the proton at C1 is coupled to a total of **four equivalent neighboring protons**.\n*   According to the n+1 rule, a proton coupled to 'n' equivalent protons will be split into 'n+1' peaks. Here, n=4, so the signal for the C1 proton will be a pentet (a multiplet with 5 lines).\n\nThis analysis provides a perfect match to one of the given options. While the synthetic pathway to arrive at this specific product from the starting materials is complex and involves significant rearrangements, the structure of 2,6-adamantanedione is the most plausible candidate for Product 3 that fits the provided answer choices.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to determine the final product and its NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1 and Identify Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240°C with an excess of potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂). The bromine atoms are at bridgehead positions.\n*   **Conditions:** Strong base (KOH) and high temperature (240°C). These are harsh conditions that can promote rearrangements.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   IR spectrum: 1720 cm⁻¹. This indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone.\n    *   ¹H NMR spectrum: 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H). The total integration is 14 protons. The formula is CₓH₁₄O. Since the starting material is a C₁₀ compound, the product is likely C₁₀H₁₄O.\n\n*   **Interpretation:** The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes with strong bases is known to proceed through a skeletal rearrangement to a protoadamantane intermediate. Subsequent hydration (from water present in KOH or as a byproduct) and oxidation (possibly by air at high temperature) can lead to a ketone. The most common product formed under similar conditions is adamantan-2-one. However, the provided ¹H NMR spectrum, particularly the signal at 4.79 ppm, does not match adamantan-2-one. The unusual NMR data and the subsequent reaction with ozone suggest that an unsaturated product is formed. A known, albeit complex, pathway involves rearrangement and oxidation to form **protoadamant-4-en-2-one** (C₁₀H₁₂O). This structure is an unsaturated ketone (enone), which is consistent with the presence of a carbonyl group and the need for a double bond for the later ozonolysis step. The discrepancy in the proton count (12H in the structure vs. 14H in the given spectrum) is a known issue in this classic problem, often attributed to a typo in the problem statement. We will proceed assuming Product 1 is this enone.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2 and Identify Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (protoadamant-4-en-2-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-iPr)₃.\n*   **Interpretation:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. This reaction selectively reduces ketones and aldehydes to alcohols. It does not affect carbon-carbon double bonds.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group in protoadamant-4-en-2-one is reduced to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Product 2 is protoadamant-4-en-2-ol.** This is an unsaturated alcohol, which can react with ozone.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 3 and Identify Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (protoadamant-4-en-2-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Interpretation:** This is an ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup. The C=C double bond is cleaved and replaced by two carbonyl groups. Since the workup is reductive (DMS), carbons of the double bond that have a hydrogen atom attached will become aldehydes.\n*   **Ozonolysis of the Precursor:** The ozonolysis of the parent alkene, protoadamantene, is known to yield a dialdehyde with a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane skeleton. The presence of the hydroxyl group in our substrate (Product 2) does not change the outcome of the cleavage but will be present in the final product.\n*   **Product 3 Structure:** The ozonolysis of protoadamant-4-en-2-ol results in the cleavage of the C4=C5 double bond, opening a ring of the tricyclic system. The final product is a bicyclic dialdehyde with a hydroxyl group. The specific structure is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-2-ol-3,6-dicarbaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in Product 3 (excluding the exchangeable OH proton)?\n*   **Identifying the Most Deshielded Proton:** In the structure of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-2-ol-3,6-dicarbaldehyde, the possible non-exchangeable protons are:\n    1.  **Aldehyde protons (-CHO):** These are typically the most deshielded, appearing at δ = 9-10 ppm.\n    2.  **Carbinol proton (H-C-OH):** The proton on the carbon bearing the alcohol group (H2). This proton is deshielded by the oxygen and appears around δ = 3.5-4.5 ppm.\n    3.  **Protons alpha to carbonyls (e.g., H3, H6):** These appear around δ = 2.5-3.5 ppm.\n    4.  Other ring protons.\n\n    The most deshielded protons are the two aldehyde protons. However, an aldehyde proton attached to a CH group (like H-C-CHO) typically appears as a doublet, which is not among the options. This suggests we might need to look at another proton, or there is more complex coupling.\n\n*   **Alternative Interpretation and a More Plausible Pathway for this Problem:**\n    There is a known ambiguity and potential typo in this problem's description. A more direct path to one of the answers involves a different, but plausible, series of products, which is likely the intended solution for this puzzle.\n\n    1.  **Product 1:** Adamantan-2-one. (Ignoring the problematic NMR data and assuming the most common product).\n    2.  **Product 2:** The reaction with Al(O-iPr)₃ and heat, followed by ozonolysis, suggests an alkene intermediate is formed. A hypothetical (but necessary for this path) reaction is the conversion of adamantanone to **adamantene** (specifically, the highly strained adamant-1-ene).\n    3.  **Product 3:** The ozonolysis of adamantene (C₁₀H₁₄) is a known reaction that cleaves the cage, loses one carbon atom (as formic acid or CO₂), and produces **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione** (C₉H₁₂O₂).\n\n    Let's assume this is Product 3 and analyze its spectrum. This diketone has a high degree of symmetry (C₂ᵥ). The most deshielded protons would be those alpha to the ketones (at C2, C4, C6, C8). However, if we assume the reaction sequence somehow retained the oxygen from the isopropoxide or water, a more logical product that fits the answer choices emerges.\n\n    Let's consider the product **9-hydroxy-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione**. This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C1, C5, and C9.\n    *   **Most Deshielded Proton:** The proton at C9 is attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (H-C-OH). Its chemical shift would be around 4 ppm. The protons alpha to the ketones would be further upfield (around 2.5-3.0 ppm). Therefore, the H9 proton is the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton.\n    *   **Coupling Pattern of H9:** The C9 atom is bonded to the two bridgehead carbons, C1 and C5. Due to the molecule's symmetry, the protons on these carbons (H1 and H5) are chemically equivalent. The H9 proton is therefore coupled to two equivalent protons.\n    *   According to the n+1 rule, a proton coupled to 'n' equivalent protons will be split into 'n+1' peaks. Here, n=2.\n    *   Therefore, the signal for the H9 proton will be a **triplet**.\n\nThis analysis provides a clean match with one of the options. Given the classic nature of this problem, this path leading to a highly symmetric product with a simple splitting pattern is the most likely intended solution.\n\nFinal Answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a corrected step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and NMR splitting pattern.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess KOH, 240°C. These are harsh conditions known to cause cage rearrangements in adamantane systems.\n*   **Product 1 Data:** The IR spectrum at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a ketone. The molecular formula, based on the ¹H NMR integration (14H, same as the starting material), is likely C₁₀H₁₄O. A common and stable product from rearrangements of 1,3-disubstituted adamantanes under these conditions is **adamantan-2-one**. While the provided NMR data is anomalous for this structure (and likely erroneous or for an obscure side product), the IR data and chemical precedent strongly point to adamantan-2-one as the major product, Product 1.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (adamantan-2-one) is treated with aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Process:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces ketones to alcohols.\n*   **Product 2:** Adamantan-2-one is reduced to **adamantan-2-ol**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (adamantan-2-ol) is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Process:** Since Product 2 is a saturated alcohol with no C=C bonds for ozonolysis, the ozone acts as a strong oxidizing agent. A known, albeit less common, reaction of ozone is the oxidation of tertiary C-H bonds to C-OH groups. Adamantan-2-ol has four tertiary (bridgehead) C-H bonds. Oxidation at the C5 or C7 position (which are equivalent relative to C2) is sterically and electronically plausible.\n*   **Product 3:** The resulting product is **adamantane-2,5-diol**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure:** Adamantane-2,5-diol. This molecule has an -OH group on a secondary carbon (C2) and another on a tertiary (bridgehead) carbon (C5).\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** The most deshielded protons (excluding the exchangeable -OH protons) are the carbinol protons—the protons attached to the carbons bearing the hydroxyl groups. These are the proton at C2 (let's call it H2) and the proton at C5 (H5). H5 is on a tertiary carbon with no adjacent protons, so its signal would be a singlet. The question asks for a signal with a complex coupling pattern, so it must refer to H2.\n*   **Symmetry and Coupling Partners:** The introduction of the -OH group at C5 removes the plane of symmetry that exists in adamantan-2-ol. As a result, the two bridgehead protons adjacent to C2, namely H1 and H3, are no longer chemically equivalent. This is because C3 is closer to the C5-OH (two bonds away, C3-C4-C5) than C1 is (three bonds away, C1-C7-C5). Therefore, J(H2,H1) ≠ J(H2,H3).\n*   **Long-Range Coupling:** In rigid cage systems like adamantane, long-range coupling (4-bond coupling, ⁴J) through a \"W\" shaped arrangement of bonds is significant. H2 has W-coupling pathways to protons on C4 and C8. Let's call these H4e and H8e. Due to the asymmetry caused by the C5-OH, H4e and H8e are also not chemically equivalent.\n*   **Putting it Together:** The H2 proton is coupled to four non-equivalent protons: H1, H3, H4e, and H8e. This would theoretically produce a complex \"doublet of a doublet of a doublet of a doublet\". Since this is not an option, we must look for plausible simplifications due to accidental equivalence of coupling constants.\n*   **Analyzing the Options:**\n    *   A **triplet** would arise if J(H2,H1) ≈ J(H2,H3) and long-range couplings were negligible. The checker feedback specifically refutes the premise that H1 and H3 are equivalent.\n    *   A **triplet of triplets** would require two pairs of equivalent couplings, e.g., J(H2,H1) ≈ J(H2,H3) and J(H2,H4e) ≈ J(H2,H8e). This is unlikely given the significant asymmetry.\n    *   A **doublet of triplets** is a plausible pattern. It would arise if H2 couples to one proton with a unique coupling constant (J_A), and to two other protons with a mutually equivalent coupling constant (J_B), with any other couplings being negligible. Let's examine the environment:\n        1.  The coupling to H1, J(H2,H1), is through a path relatively far from the C5-OH. Let's assume this is the unique coupling J_A, giving the initial **doublet**.\n        2.  The coupling to H3, J(H2,H3), and the long-range coupling to H4e, J(H2,H4e), are both through paths that are close to the C5-OH group. It is plausible that the electronic effects of the C5-OH make these two different types of coupling accidentally equivalent (J(H2,H3) ≈ J(H2,H4e) = J_B). This would split each line of the doublet into a **triplet**.\n        3.  The final long-range coupling, J(H2,H8e), is through a path far from the C5-OH and might be small enough to be unresolved or negligible.\n    *   This scenario (one unique coupling, two accidentally equivalent couplings, one negligible coupling) provides a chemically reasonable explanation for a **doublet of triplets** pattern.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step deduction to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence to determine the class of compounds for Products 1, 2, and 3.**\n\n1.  **Product 1:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂) is heated with excess KOH at 240°C. The product has an IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group, specifically a ketone. The provided ¹H NMR spectrum shows a total of 14 protons, indicating the adamantane C₁₀ skeleton is intact. The formula of Product 1 is therefore C₁₀H₁₄O.\n\n2.  **Product 2:** Product 1 is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-iPr)₃. This is the standard reagent for a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which reduces a ketone (Product 1) to an alcohol (Product 2). Thus, Product 2 is an alcohol with the formula C₁₀H₁₆O.\n\n3.  **Product 3:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a reductive ozonolysis reaction, which cleaves a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) and converts it into two carbonyl groups (ketones or aldehydes). The fact that ozonolysis occurs means that **Product 2 must contain a C=C double bond**. Consequently, **Product 1 must also contain a C=C double bond**.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can deduce the following:\n*   **Product 1** is an unsaturated ketone with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O.\n*   **Product 2** is an unsaturated alcohol with the formula C₁₀H₁₆O.\n*   **Product 3** is the ozonolysis product of Product 2. It is a dicarbonyl alcohol with the formula C₁₀H₁₆O₃ (ozonolysis adds two oxygen atoms without changing the C/H count).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the proton of interest in Product 3.**\n\nThe question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in Product 3, excluding those that exchange with a deuterated solvent (like an -OH proton).\n\nThe functional groups in Product 3 are two carbonyls (likely aldehydes, -CHO) and one alcohol (-CHOH).\n*   Aldehyde protons (H-C=O) are the most deshielded non-exchangeable protons, typically appearing at 9-10 ppm. However, they usually show simple coupling (singlet or doublet) and are unlikely to match the complex patterns given in the options (doublet of triplets, pentet, triplet of triplets).\n*   The next most deshielded proton would be the one on the carbon bearing the alcohol group (H-C-OH), which typically appears at 3.5-4.5 ppm. This proton's coupling pattern depends on the number of adjacent protons.\n\nGiven the answer choices, it is highly probable that the question refers to the **proton on the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group (the H-C-OH proton)**.\n\n**Step 3: Deduce the structure of Product 3 and the coupling pattern.**\n\nThe reaction starts with a highly symmetrical molecule (adamantane). It is plausible that the final product, despite the complex rearrangements, retains some symmetry. The simple coupling patterns suggested in the answer choices (pentet, triplet) also point towards a symmetrical structure for Product 3.\n\nLet's analyze the coupling pattern options for the H-C(OH) proton:\n*   A **triplet** would imply coupling to two equivalent neighboring protons.\n*   A **pentet** (or quintet) would imply coupling to four equivalent neighboring protons.\n*   A **doublet of triplets** would imply coupling to one proton and a set of two other equivalent protons.\n*   A **triplet of triplets** would imply coupling to two different sets of two equivalent protons.\n\nFor the H-C(OH) proton to appear as a **pentet**, it must be adjacent to four magnetically equivalent protons. This would occur in a structural fragment like **-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₂-** where the molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C-OH bond, making the two adjacent CH₂ groups equivalent.\n\nLet's assume that the reaction sequence leads to a final product (Product 3) with this specific symmetrical feature. A plausible structure for Product 3 that is a C₁₀ dicarbonyl alcohol and possesses this symmetry is **cis,cis-1,5-diformyl-3-hydroxy-cyclooctane**.\n\n*   **Formula:** The cyclooctane ring has 8 carbons, and the two formyl (-CHO) groups add 2 more, for a total of 10 carbons (C₁₀). The hydrogen and oxygen count (C₁₀H₁₆O₃) also matches.\n*   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C3-OH bond and bisects the C7-C8 bond.\n*   **Coupling:** The proton of interest is H3 (the one on the carbon with the OH group). It is adjacent to the two protons on C2 and the two protons on C4. Due to the plane of symmetry, the CH₂ group at C2 is equivalent to the CH₂ group at C4. Therefore, H3 is coupled to **four equivalent neighboring protons**.\n\nAccording to the n+1 rule, a proton coupled to four equivalent protons will appear as a **pentet** (or quintet).\n\nWhile the exact reaction pathway from 1,3-dibromoadamantane to this specific structure is complex and involves significant molecular rearrangement, the existence of a plausible, symmetrical final structure that perfectly explains one of the answer choices is a strong indicator in this type of chemical puzzle. The high symmetry of the starting material makes a symmetric fragmentation and rearrangement product plausible.\n\nTherefore, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable C-H proton in product 3 is a pentet.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe reaction sequence begins with the rearrangement of 1,3-dibromoadamantane under harsh basic conditions to form an alkenone, protoadamant-4-en-2-one (Product 1). This is supported by the IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ (ketone) and the subsequent ozonolysis reaction, which requires a double bond.\n\nProduct 1 is then reduced via a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reaction to the corresponding alcohol, protoadamant-4-en-2-ol (Product 2).\n\nFinally, ozonolysis of Product 2 with a reductive workup (dimethylsulfide) cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond, opening a ring to form a bicyclic dialdehyde-alcohol (Product 3). The most deshielded non-exchangeable protons in this molecule are the two aldehyde protons.\n\nDue to the asymmetry of the molecule, the two aldehyde protons are in different chemical environments. One aldehyde proton is adjacent to a CH₂ group, leading to vicinal coupling that splits its signal into a triplet. In the rigid bicyclo[3.2.1]octane framework of Product 3, this aldehyde proton also experiences significant long-range (4-bond) \"W-coupling\" to another CH₂ group, which further splits the signal into another triplet. The resulting pattern is a triplet of triplets.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nThis multi-step synthesis problem requires a careful deduction of the structures of three successive products.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n\nThe starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. It is heated with a strong base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), at a high temperature (240°C). While the provided ¹H NMR data for product 1 contains an unusual peak at 4.79 ppm, the other pieces of information—the molecular formula C₁₀H₁₄O (inferred from the starting material and the 14 protons in the NMR) and the strong IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹—strongly point to a saturated, tricyclic ketone. The most plausible product under these conditions is 2-adamantanone, formed through a complex rearrangement. The reported NMR spectrum is likely erroneous, a common feature in such advanced problems to prevent simple spectral matching.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 (2-adamantanone) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide. This reagent is typically used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction of ketones to alcohols. However, the subsequent reaction is ozonolysis, which requires a carbon-carbon double bond. This implies that the reaction conditions (heating with a Lewis acidic aluminum species) not only reduce the ketone to 2-adamantanol but also catalyze a subsequent rearrangement and dehydration (elimination of water) to form a stable alkene. The adamantane skeleton rearranges to the less-strained protoadamantane skeleton, yielding **protoadamantene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene) as Product 2.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3 and Analyze its ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nProduct 2 (protoadamantene) is subjected to ozonolysis with a reductive workup using dimethyl sulfide (DMS). Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond. In this specific case, the reaction involves the cleavage of the C=C bond in protoadamantene and the loss of one carbon atom, a known fragmentation pathway for this system. The resulting product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione**.\n\nNow, we must determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded, non-exchangeable hydrogen atom in bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione.\n\n*   **Structure and Symmetry:** This molecule has a high degree of symmetry (C₂ᵥ). It consists of two fused six-membered rings in a stable dual-chair conformation. The two ketone groups are at positions 2 and 6.\n*   **Most Deshielded Protons:** The most deshielded protons will be those most influenced by the electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. The bridgehead protons at positions 1 and 5 are each alpha to *two* ketone groups. All other protons are alpha to only one or zero ketones. Therefore, the H1 and H5 protons are the most deshielded. Due to the molecule's symmetry, H1 and H5 are chemically equivalent.\n*   **Coupling Pattern:** We need to analyze the coupling of the H1 proton. It is adjacent to the CH₂ groups at C8 and C9. Thus, H1 is coupled to four protons in total: the two diastereotopic protons on C8 and the two diastereotopic protons on C9.\n    *   In the simplest analysis, coupling to the two protons on C8 would produce a triplet, and further coupling to the two protons on C9 would also produce a triplet. This combination results in a **triplet of triplets**.\n    *   While the four neighboring protons are not strictly equivalent, leading to a more complex multiplet in reality, \"triplet of triplets\" is the best description among the choices provided and relies on a common simplification where coupling to the protons of an adjacent CH₂ group is treated as a triplet.\n\nTherefore, the most deshielded hydrogen atom (the bridgehead proton) exhibits a triplet of triplets splitting pattern.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\n**Proposer's analysis of search results:**\n\nThe search results provide crucial information. Result states that 1,3-dibromoadamantane \"reacts in base to give the synthetically useful 7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one\". This strongly suggests a ring-opening reaction followed by cyclization. Result mentions that 1,3-adamantanediol can be used to prepare catalysts after ring opening. Specifically, Ho and co-workers synthesized cannabinoids via the ring opening of 1,3-adamantanediol. This confirms that the adamantane cage can open under certain conditions. The reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with a base leading to a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane derivative seems very plausible.\n\nLet's propose the structure of Product 1 based on this. The reaction is with KOH at high temperature. A plausible mechanism is the formation of 1,3-dehydroadamantane via elimination of 2 HBr, which is a known highly reactive intermediate. However, the presence of a strong base like KOH at high temperature could also favor a ring-opening fragmentation.\n\nLet's assume the structure is 7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one as suggested by reference.\n*   **Structure:** A bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane skeleton with a ketone at position 3 and an exocyclic double bond (methylene group) at position 7.\n*   **IR:** This structure has a ketone (C=O), which matches the 1720 cm-1 absorbance.\n*   **1H NMR:**\n    *   The two protons of the exocyclic double bond (=CH2) would be deshielded. This matches the signal at 4.79 ppm (2H).\n    *   The remaining protons are on the bicyclic alkane framework. Let's count them. The bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane cage has 16 protons. Replacing a CH2 with C=O removes 2 protons. Replacing another CH2 with C=CH2 removes 2 protons. So we have 16 - 2 - 2 = 12 protons on the carbon framework. The formula is C10H12O. The starting 1,3-dibromoadamantane is C10H14Br2. The reaction involves elimination of 2 HBr and addition of one oxygen, which doesn't seem right.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the reaction. Perhaps it's a fragmentation followed by re-cyclization.\nLet's reconsider the NMR data for 7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one. The formula is C10H12O. The NMR data given is 4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H). Total protons = 14. This matches the number of protons in 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C10H14Br2). So the formula of Product 1 is C10H14O.\n\nHow can we get C10H14O from C10H14Br2 with KOH? This implies a substitution of both bromines with -OH, followed by an oxidation-reduction or rearrangement. This seems overly complex.\n\nLet's look at the reference again. It says \"reacts in base to give... 7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one\". This is likely a known transformation. Let's assume this is the correct intermediate path, but maybe the final product is not this exact molecule.\n\nLet's reconsider the starting reaction. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + excess KOH at 240C. This is a Favorskii-type reaction on polycyclic systems. A search for \"Favorskii reaction of dihaloadamantane\" might be useful. Or perhaps a homo-Favorskii or quasi-Favorskii rearrangement.\n\nLet's assume the provided NMR data for Product 1 is correct and try to deduce the structure from it.\n*   C10H14O\n*   IR: 1720 cm-1 (ketone)\n*   1H NMR: 4.79(s, 2H), 2.41-2.23(m, 10H), 1.94(s, 2H).\nThe two signals at 4.79 and 1.94 are sharp (likely singlets or broad singlets), each integrating to 2H. This suggests some symmetry. The signal at 4.79 is extremely deshielded. It's not a simple vinyl proton. It could be a proton on a carbon attached to two oxygens (an acetal), but we have a ketone. It could be a proton on a very strained ring.\n\nLet's reconsider the reaction from a different angle. What if the adamantane cage rearranges? High temperature and strong base can induce skeletal rearrangements.\n\nLet's try to find the actual product of this specific reaction.\n\n**Proposer:** The evidence points towards a rearrangement of the adamantane skeleton. Reference suggests the formation of a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system. Let's hypothesize the structure of Product 1. The formula is C10H14O, and it contains a ketone. The NMR is the key. The 2H signal at 4.79 ppm is very unusual. Let's search for the product of the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with strong base at high temperature to confirm the structure of Product 1.\n\n**Skeptic:** The structure of Product 1 is not yet clear. While a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane derivative is plausible, the NMR data (especially the 4.79 ppm signal) is hard to reconcile with a simple structure like 7-methylenebicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one, which also has the wrong number of protons. We need to find a definitive source that identifies Product 1 and provides its spectral data. Without the correct structure for Product 1, we cannot proceed to Product 2 and 3.\n\n**Decide:** The next step must be to unambiguously identify Product 1. I will perform a more targeted search for the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH, looking for spectral data of the product.\n\n**Proposer's analysis of search results:**\n\nThe search results from the second step have been very fruitful. Several sources, including Organic Syntheses, describe the synthesis of **protoadamantan-4-one** (also called tricyclo[4.3.1.0<sup>3,8</sup>]decan-4-one). While the specific reaction in the problem (1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH at 240°C) is not explicitly detailed with this product name, the rearrangement of the adamantane skeleton to a protoadamantane skeleton is a known process. More importantly, the structure of protoadamantan-4-one is consistent with the spectral data provided for Product 1.\n\n*   **Structure of Product 1 (Protoadamantan-4-one):** This is a tetracyclic ketone, an isomer of adamantanone.\n*   **Formula:** C10H14O. This matches the expected formula.\n*   **IR:** It has a ketone group, consistent with the 1720 cm-1 peak.\n*   **1H NMR:** The structure of protoadamantan-4-one is less symmetrical than adamantane. A detailed analysis of its expected NMR spectrum would be complex, but the provided data (4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H)) is plausible for this strained, polycyclic ketone. The highly deshielded signal at 4.79 ppm is likely due to the protons at the bridgehead positions (C1 and C6) which are in a unique electronic environment in the protoadamantane cage. Let's assume this is the correct structure for Product 1.\n\n**Reaction 2:** Product 1 (protoadamantan-4-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a **Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction**.\n*   **Reagent:** Aluminum isopropoxide is a classic reagent for the MPV reduction, which reduces ketones and aldehydes to alcohols. It is a chemoselective reagent.\n*   **Product 2:** The ketone group in protoadamantan-4-one will be reduced to a hydroxyl group, forming **protoadamantan-4-ol**. The reduction can potentially form two diastereomers, *exo*- and *endo*-protoadamantan-4-ol. However, for the next step (ozonolysis), the stereochemistry at this position is irrelevant. The key transformation is the reduction of the ketone to an alcohol.\n\n**Reaction 3:** Product 2 (protoadamantan-4-ol) is treated with ozone followed by dimethylsulfide.\n*   **Reaction:** This is an **ozonolysis** reaction. Ozonolysis cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds.\n*   **Wait, there is no double bond in protoadamantan-4-ol.** Let me re-read the question carefully. \"This product [Product 1] was then heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2.\" \"ozone was bubbled through a solution of 2 at -78C\".\n\nThere must be a misunderstanding of Reaction 2. Let's reconsider. Heating a ketone with aluminum isopropoxide is an MPV reduction. But what if the conditions are forcing? Is it possible that the resulting alcohol dehydrates to form an alkene? The problem states \"heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide\". High temperatures can favor elimination.\n\nLet's assume the sequence is:\n1.  **Product 1:** Protoadamantan-4-one.\n2.  **Reaction 2:** MPV reduction of the ketone to protoadamantan-4-ol, followed by dehydration to form **protoadamantene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0<sup>3,8</sup>]dec-4-ene). This seems plausible as it creates the double bond needed for the ozonolysis step. Protoadamantene is a known compound.\n3.  **Product 2 is Protoadamantene.**\n4.  **Reaction 3:** Ozonolysis of protoadamantene.\n    *   The double bond in protoadamantene is between C4 and C5.\n    *   Ozonolysis with a reductive workup (dimethylsulfide) will cleave this C=C bond and form two carbonyl groups.\n    *   Cleaving the C4=C5 bond of protoadamantene will open the ring system. The product will be a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane derivative.\n    *   Let's trace the carbons. The C4=C5 bond is broken. C4 becomes a carbonyl, and C5 becomes a carbonyl. The rest of the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane framework remains. The product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione**.\n\n**Structure of Product 3:** Bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione.\n*   This is a symmetrical molecule. It has a plane of symmetry passing through the C1-C5 bridgehead bond and the C9 methylene bridge.\n*   We need to find the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding exchangeable ones, so we ignore any potential enol protons, though there are none here).\n*   In bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione, the most deshielded protons will be those adjacent to the two carbonyl groups.\n*   These are the protons at C2, C4, C6, and C8. Due to symmetry, the protons at C2 and C4 are equivalent to those at C8 and C6, respectively. Let's look at the protons on C2. They are alpha to the C3-ketone.\n*   However, the **bridgehead protons** at C1 and C5 are also in a unique environment. Let's analyze the chemical shifts. Protons alpha to a ketone are typically around 2.2-2.6 ppm. Bridgehead protons in bicyclic systems can be deshielded.\n*   Let's consider the protons at C1 and C5. These are the most likely candidates for being the most deshielded. Let's call them H1 and H5.\n*   Now, let's determine the coupling pattern of H1 (or H5).\n    *   H1 is coupled to the two protons on C2 (H2a, H2b).\n    *   H1 is coupled to the two protons on C8 (H8a, H8b).\n    *   H1 is coupled to the proton on C9 (H9, there are two protons on C9, H9-syn and H9-anti). Let's assume it couples to both. No, C1 is bonded to C2, C8, and C9. So H1 is coupled to the two H2 protons, the two H8 protons, and the two H9 protons. This would be a very complex multiplet.\n\nLet me re-examine the structure of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione.\n*   C1 is bonded to C2, C8, and C9.\n*   C5 is bonded to C4, C6, and C9.\n*   The protons at C1 and C5 are equivalent by symmetry.\n*   Let's focus on H1. It is coupled to:\n    *   Two protons at C2.\n    *   Two protons at C8.\n    *   One proton at C9 (the other C9 proton is on the other side of the symmetry plane). No, C1 is bonded to C9. C9 is a CH2 group. So H1 is coupled to two protons at C9.\n    *   Let's re-verify the structure. Bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane. C1 and C5 are bridgeheads. They are connected by three bridges: C2-C3-C4, C6-C7-C8, and C9.\n    *   In bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione, the ketones are at C3 and C7.\n    *   The bridgehead proton H1 is coupled to the two protons at C2, the two protons at C8, and the two protons at C9. This seems too complex.\n\nLet's reconsider the structure of Product 3.\nOzonolysis of protoadamantene (tricyclo[4.3.1.0<sup>3,8</sup>]dec-4-ene).\nThe double bond is between C4 and C5. The carbons are numbered differently in the systematic name. Let's use a drawing.\nProtoadamantane has a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane core with an extra C-C bond between C3 and C7 (using bicyclo numbering). No, that's not right.\nLet's look at the structure of protoadamantane. It is tricyclo[4.3.1.0<sup>3,8</sup>]decane.\nThe double bond in protoadamantene is at a bridgehead in one of the rings, which is unusual. Let me check the structure of protoadamantene again.\nLooking at the structure from reference, the double bond is at position 4, which is not a bridgehead of the main bicyclic system. Cleavage of this C4=C5 bond in protoadamantene (let's use the numbering from the paper) will indeed break one of the rings.\nThe resulting product is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione. I am confident in this structure.\n\nNow, let's re-evaluate the coupling of the most deshielded proton.\nThe protons alpha to the carbonyls (at C2, C4, C6, C8) and the bridgehead protons (at C1, C5) are the candidates. In similar bicyclic ketones, the bridgehead protons are often the most deshielded. Let's assume H1/H5 are the most deshielded.\nLet's analyze the coupling for H1 in bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione.\n*   H1 is coupled to two protons on C2 (geminal to the carbonyl). Let's call the coupling constant J_1,2.\n*   H1 is coupled to two protons on C8 (geminal to the other carbonyl). By symmetry, J_1,8 = J_1,2.\n*   H1 is coupled to two protons on C9 (the methylene bridge). Let's call the coupling constant J_1,9.\nThis would lead to a very complex signal, not a simple triplet, doublet of triplets, or pentet.\n\nThere must be something I am missing. Let's reconsider the most deshielded proton.\nCould it be one of the alpha-protons? For example, H2.\n*   H2 is coupled to its geminal partner on C2.\n*   H2 is coupled to the bridgehead proton H1.\nThis would be a doublet of doublets. Not one of the options.\n\nLet's think about the conformation of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione. It exists predominantly in a dual chair-chair conformation. In this conformation, the bridgehead protons H1 and H5 point inwards.\nLet's look at the couplings again for H1.\n*   Coupling to H2ax and H2eq.\n*   Coupling to H8ax and H8eq.\n*   Coupling to H9syn and H9anti.\nThis is still too complex.\n\nWhat if there is some simplification?\nPerhaps some coupling constants are zero. The dihedral angle between H1 and the equatorial protons on C2/C8 might be close to 90 degrees, making that coupling small (Karplus equation). But the coupling to the axial protons would be significant.\nWhat if the four protons on C2 and C8 are magnetically equivalent from the perspective of H1? And the two protons on C9 are also equivalent? This is unlikely.\n\nLet's reconsider the structure of Product 2. What if the reaction with aluminum isopropoxide does not lead to elimination?\nProduct 2 is protoadamantan-4-ol.\nThen what does ozonolysis do to an alcohol? Nothing. The question must imply that an alkene is formed. The sequence of ketone -> alcohol -> alkene is a very standard transformation, and the reagents are plausible for it, even if not explicitly stated as two separate steps.\n\nLet's go back to Product 3: bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione.\nLet's assume the most deshielded proton is indeed the bridgehead proton (H1/H5).\nLet's look at the neighbors again. C2, C8, C9. All are CH2 groups.\nSo H1 has 6 neighbors. This doesn't lead to any of the simple patterns given.\n\nIs there another possible product from the ozonolysis?\nWhat if Product 2 is not protoadamantene?\nWhat if the reaction with aluminum isopropoxide is an Oppenauer oxidation? That would be the reverse reaction, which makes no sense as we start with a ketone.\n\nLet's reconsider the initial reaction. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH.\nCould it form something else? The evidence for protoadamantan-4-one is strong, but based on inference, not a direct statement. However, it fits the spectral data requirement (ketone) and the formula. The unusual NMR shift is a hallmark of a strained polycyclic system.\n\nLet's assume the reaction sequence I've outlined is correct.\nProduct 1: Protoadamantan-4-one\nProduct 2: Protoadamantene\nProduct 3: Bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione\n\nNow, why would the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton in Product 3 be simple?\nLet's look at the structure of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione again.\nMaybe the most deshielded proton is not the bridgehead one.\nWhat about the protons on the C9 methylene bridge? They are beta to two carbonyls. This could deshield them significantly. Let's call them H9s and H9a.\n*   H9s is coupled to H9a (geminal coupling).\n*   H9s is coupled to H1 and H5.\nIf H1 and H5 are equivalent, this would be a triplet. But H9s is also coupled to H9a. So it would be a doublet of triplets.\n*   Let's check H1's coupling again. It couples to 2 protons on C2, 2 on C8, 2 on C9.\nWhat if, due to the chair-chair conformation, the coupling constants to the four protons on C2 and C8 are all very similar? And the coupling to the two protons on C9 is different?\nThis is getting speculative.\n\nLet's search for the 1H NMR spectrum of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione.\n\n**Proposer:** I have deduced the structures of the intermediates and the final product. Product 1 is protoadamantan-4-one. Product 2 is protoadamantene, formed by MPV reduction and subsequent dehydration. Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione, formed by ozonolysis of Product 2. The final step is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton in bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione. Based on the structure, the bridgehead protons (H1, H5) are likely the most deshielded. I need to find the NMR spectrum of this compound to confirm which proton is the most deshielded and what its coupling pattern is.\n\n**Skeptic:** The proposed reaction sequence is logical but contains an assumption: the one-pot reduction and dehydration to form protoadamantene. While plausible, it's not explicitly stated. More importantly, the analysis of the coupling pattern for the bridgehead proton in bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione suggests a very complex multiplet, which does not match any of the simple options (A, B, C, D). This indicates either the most deshielded proton is not the bridgehead proton, or there's some conformational averaging or accidental equivalence that simplifies the signal. We must find experimental NMR data for bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione to resolve this.\n\n**Decide:** The crucial next step is to find the 1H NMR spectrum and assignments for bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione. This will identify the most deshielded proton and its multiplicity.**Proposer's analysis of search results:**\n\nThe search for the 1H NMR of bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione did not yield a readily available, fully assigned spectrum with clear coupling patterns. The search results show various substituted bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane derivatives, but not the specific parent dione I need. For instance, result provides data for 9-thiabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-dione, where the bridgehead protons (H1, H5) are at 3.37-3.38 ppm and the alpha-protons are at 2.47-2.69 ppm. This suggests the bridgehead protons are indeed deshielded. However, without the exact data for my target molecule, I cannot be certain.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the problem, as my deduction of the coupling pattern for the bridgehead proton (a complex multiplet) does not match the simple options provided in the question (triplet, doublet of triplets, pentet, triplet of triplets). This suggests one of three possibilities:\n1.  My structure for Product 3 is wrong.\n2.  The most deshielded proton is not the bridgehead proton.\n3.  There is a simplification of the coupling pattern due to specific dihedral angles or magnetic equivalence.\n\nLet's reconsider the structure of Product 3. The ozonolysis of protoadamantene should reliably give bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione. This part of the deduction seems solid.\n\nLet's reconsider which proton is the most deshielded. The candidates are the bridgehead protons (H1, H5) and the protons on the C9 methylene bridge. The C9 protons are beta to two carbonyl groups, which is a deshielding environment. The bridgehead protons (H1, H5) are alpha to two CH2 groups which are themselves alpha to carbonyls. It is plausible that the bridgehead protons are the most deshielded.\n\nLet's assume the bridgehead proton (H1) is the most deshielded and re-examine its coupling, looking for a reason for simplification.\n*   H1 is coupled to six neighboring protons: two on C2, two on C8, and two on C9.\n*   The molecule exists in a chair-chair conformation.\n*   Let's analyze the couplings from H1:\n    *   Coupling to H2-axial and H2-equatorial.\n    *   Coupling to H8-axial and H8-equatorial.\n    *   Coupling to H9-syn and H9-anti.\n*   By symmetry, the coupling to the C2 protons will be identical to the coupling to the C8 protons. So we have J(H1, H2ax) = J(H1, H8ax) and J(H1, H2eq) = J(H1, H8eq).\n*   This means H1 is coupled to two equivalent axial protons and two equivalent equatorial protons on the \"sides\" of the bicycle.\n*   It is also coupled to the two non-equivalent protons on the C9 bridge.\n*   This still seems too complex.\n\nLet's think about the options.\nA) triplet (n=2)\nB) doublet of triplets (n=1, and n=2)\nC) pentet (n=4)\nD) triplet of triplets (n=2, and n=2)\n\nA \"pentet\" (also called a quintet) arises from coupling to four equivalent protons (n+1=5).\nCould it be that H1 couples to the two axial protons on C2/C8 and the two equatorial protons on C2/C8 with roughly the same coupling constant? This would be an accidental equivalence. If J(H1, H2ax) ≈ J(H1, H2eq), then H1 would see four equivalent protons on C2 and C8. What about the C9 protons? The coupling to these might be negligible. In some bicyclic systems, long-range coupling across the bridge can be small. If we ignore the coupling to C9, and assume the four protons on C2/C8 are roughly equivalent, we would get a pentet.\n\nLet's try another approach. What if the most deshielded proton is on the C9 bridge? Let's call it H9a.\n*   H9a is coupled to its geminal partner, H9s (a doublet).\n*   H9a is coupled to the two equivalent bridgehead protons, H1 and H5 (a triplet).\n*   The resulting pattern would be a doublet of triplets. This is option B.\n\nNow we have two plausible scenarios leading to two different answers.\n1.  Bridgehead proton (H1) is most deshielded, and due to accidental equivalence of couplings to the four neighboring protons on C2/C8 (and negligible coupling to C9), it appears as a pentet (C).\n2.  C9 bridge proton is most deshielded, and it couples to its geminal partner and the two bridgehead protons, appearing as a doublet of triplets (B).\n\nWhich proton is more deshielded? A bridgehead proton (H1) or a methylene proton beta to two ketones (H9)? Without spectral data, this is hard to determine definitively. However, in many bicyclic systems, bridgehead protons are significantly deshielded.\n\nLet's reconsider the pentet possibility. For H1 to be a pentet, it needs to couple to four equivalent protons. The neighbors are H2ax, H2eq, H8ax, H8eq. For them to be equivalent in their coupling to H1, we would need J(H1,H2ax) = J(H1,H2eq) = J(H1,H8ax) = J(H1,H8eq). This seems unlikely given the different dihedral angles.\n\nLet's reconsider the doublet of triplets. This seems like a more \"classic\" coupling pattern. But is the C9 proton the most deshielded? It's beta to two carbonyls. The bridgehead proton is adjacent to carbons that are alpha to carbonyls. The deshielding effect falls off with distance. So it's a competition.\n\nLet's try to find a reference that discusses the relative chemical shifts in such a system. In norbornane, the bridgehead proton is at ~2.2 ppm. In adamantanone, the bridgehead protons are around 2.5-3.0 ppm. Protons alpha to a ketone are ~2.4 ppm. This doesn't give a clear winner.\n\nLet's look at the options again. A triplet of triplets (D) would mean coupling to two sets of two equivalent protons. For H1, this could happen if J(H1,H2ax) = J(H1,H8ax) and J(H1,H2eq) = J(H1,H8eq), and the coupling to C9 is negligible. This would give a triplet of triplets (or more accurately, a multiplet that could be approximated as such).\n\nLet's step back. The question is from a context (likely an exam or textbook) where there is a single correct answer based on general principles. Overly complex analyses or reliance on accidental equivalence might be the wrong path.\nThe structure of Product 3, bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione, is highly symmetric. The most deshielded protons are almost certainly the two equivalent bridgehead protons (H1 and H5).\nLet's focus on H1. It is coupled to H2(eq), H2(ax), H8(eq), H8(ax), H9(syn), and H9(anti).\nDue to the C2v symmetry of the molecule (in its ideal chair-chair form), H2(eq) is equivalent to H8(eq), H2(ax) is equivalent to H8(ax).\nSo, H1 couples to:\n-   Two protons with coupling J1\n-   Two protons with coupling J2\n-   Two protons (on C9) with couplings J3 and J4.\nThis is still too complex.\n\nThere must be a simplification. In many bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane systems, the molecule flattens to relieve steric strain between the C3 and C7 positions. In our dione, this strain is reduced, but the chair-chair form is still expected.\nWhat if the coupling to the C9 protons is negligible? This is a W-coupling (4-bond coupling) and can sometimes be significant, but let's assume it's not.\nThen H1 couples to two protons (H2ax, H8ax) with J_ax and two protons (H2eq, H8eq) with J_eq. This would give a triplet of triplets. This is option D.\n\nLet's compare the likelihood of Pentet vs. Triplet of Triplets.\n-   Pentet requires J_ax ≈ J_eq.\n-   Triplet of Triplets requires J_ax and J_eq to be different (and resolved) and J_W to be negligible.\nA triplet of triplets seems a more chemically reasonable pattern for this situation than a pentet, which relies on accidental equivalence.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the doublet of triplets. This requires the C9 proton to be the most deshielded. It couples to its geminal partner (doublet) and the two bridgehead protons (triplet). This is a clean pattern. Is it plausible for H9 to be the most deshielded? Being beta to two carbonyls is strongly deshielding.\n\nLet's try to find a calculated 1H NMR for bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione.\nA quick search doesn't provide this.\n\nLet's go with the most plausible chemical reasoning. The bridgehead protons H1/H5 are in a very constrained environment and are adjacent to carbons bearing electron-withdrawing groups (the CH2-C=O fragments). They are very likely the most deshielded. The coupling pattern would arise from coupling to the four protons on C2/C8 and potentially the two on C9. Given the options, a pattern that simplifies from this complex arrangement is expected. A triplet of triplets (D) arises naturally if we assume the two axial protons are equivalent, the two equatorial protons are equivalent (which they are by symmetry), and the long-range coupling to C9 is negligible. This seems like the most reasonable simplification that leads to one of the given answers.\n\nFinal check of the logic:\n1.  Product 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH -> Protoadamantan-4-one. (Reasonable based on IR/NMR and known rearrangements).\n2.  Product 2: Protoadamantan-4-one + Al(OiPr)3 -> Protoadamantene. (Reasonable as MPV reduction followed by elimination creates the substrate for the next step).\n3.  Product 3: Protoadamantene + O3/DMS -> Bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione. (Standard ozonolysis).\n4.  Most deshielded proton in Product 3: Bridgehead H1/H5. (Plausible due to electronic effects and constrained geometry).\n5.  Coupling of H1: Coupled to 2xH2 and 2xH8. By symmetry, this is coupling to two pairs of equivalent protons (axial and equatorial pairs). If long-range coupling is ignored, this gives a triplet of triplets.\n\nThis seems to be the most coherent line of reasoning.\n\nLet's reconsider the pentet. A pentet implies coupling to 4 equivalent protons. This would happen if J(H1, H2ax) is very similar to J(H1, H2eq). Looking at a model, the dihedral angle for the axial proton is ~60 degrees, and for the equatorial proton is also ~60 degrees, but in the other direction. The Karplus equation is sensitive to more than just the dihedral angle, but it's plausible they could be similar. If they are similar, the signal would be a pentet.\n\nLet's compare triplet of triplets vs pentet. Both are plausible depending on the relative coupling constants. However, a pentet is a simpler pattern. Often in such problems, simplifications are assumed. The simplification to a pentet (quintet) is a very common one when a proton is coupled to two adjacent CH2 groups where the couplings are not well-resolved.\n\nLet's assume the bridgehead proton H1 is the most deshielded. It is coupled to the four protons on the adjacent C2 and C8 methylene groups. If the coupling constants to all four of these protons are sufficiently similar, the signal will appear as a pentet (a quintet). This is a common simplification in proton NMR when multiple couplings are similar and not resolved.\n\nFinal decision process: The structure is almost certainly bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione. The most deshielded proton is likely the bridgehead proton. It is coupled to four protons on the adjacent methylenes (C2 and C8). The simplest and most common pattern for a proton coupled to an adjacent -CH2-CH2- system in a ring, where free rotation is not possible but the various J values are coincidentally similar, is a pentet.\n\nTherefore, I will choose C.\n\nLet's double check the other options.\nA) Triplet: requires coupling to 2 equivalent protons. Unlikely.\nB) Doublet of triplets: requires coupling to one proton and a set of two equivalent protons. This would fit the C9 proton if it were the most deshielded, but that is less likely than the bridgehead proton.\nD) Triplet of triplets: requires coupling to two different sets of two equivalent protons. This is plausible for the bridgehead proton if J_ax and J_eq are different and resolved, and W-coupling is negligible.\n\nBetween C and D, C represents a greater degree of simplification (all four J values are similar), while D represents a more nuanced view (two pairs of different J values). In the context of a multiple-choice question, the simpler, more idealized pattern is often the intended answer.\n\nFinal conclusion is C.Here is a step-by-step derivation of the products and the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240°C with an excess of potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C10H14Br2).\n*   **Reagents:** KOH is a strong base, and the reaction is performed at high temperature.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a ketone (C=O) group.\n    *   The molecular formula of the adamantane core is C10H14. The product has a ketone, suggesting a formula of C10H14O. This implies a reaction where the two bromine atoms are replaced by one oxygen atom, with the loss of 2 HBr and the addition of H2O overall, which is complex.\n    *   A more likely scenario under these harsh conditions is a skeletal rearrangement. The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes with a base can lead to a ring-opening/rearrangement to form a protoadamantane skeleton.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 1:** The product is **protoadamantan-4-one** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³'⁸]decan-4-one). This structure is an isomer of adamantanone (C10H14O) and is consistent with the formation of a ketone. The complex and highly deshielded ¹H NMR signals are characteristic of such a strained polycyclic system.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (protoadamantan-4-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction is a **Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction**, which reduces a ketone to an alcohol. However, the subsequent reaction is ozonolysis, which cleaves a C=C double bond. This strongly implies that the alcohol formed from the reduction undergoes dehydration in the same step to form an alkene. High temperatures favor this elimination.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 2:** The ketone is first reduced to protoadamantan-4-ol, which then dehydrates to form **protoadamantene** (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³'⁸]dec-4-ene).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (protoadamantene) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an **ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup**. This reaction cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond (C4=C5 in protoadamantene) and replaces it with two carbonyl groups.\n*   **Conclusion for Product 3:** The cleavage of the C=C bond in the protoadamantene skeleton results in the formation of a single, larger ring system. The product is **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione**. This is a highly symmetrical molecule.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione.\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** In this symmetrical dione, the most deshielded protons are the two equivalent bridgehead protons at positions C1 and C5. These protons are in a unique electronic environment, being at a bridgehead and adjacent to carbons (C2, C8, C9) that are influenced by the two ketone groups.\n*   **Coupling Analysis:** Let's analyze the coupling for the proton at C1 (H1).\n    *   H1 is bonded to a carbon that is connected to C2, C8, and C9.\n    *   Therefore, H1 is coupled to the protons on these three carbons.\n    *   C2 and C8 are methylene groups (CH₂). Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons on C2 are equivalent to the two protons on C8 from the perspective of H1's coupling environment.\n    *   So, H1 is coupled to the four protons on C2 and C8.\n    *   In many bicyclic systems, long-range coupling across the C9 bridge might be negligible or unresolved.\n    *   The coupling of a proton to an adjacent CH₂-CH₂ group in a constrained ring system, where the individual coupling constants to the four neighboring protons are not resolved but are of similar magnitude, often results in a simplified pattern.\n    *   According to the n+1 rule, if a proton is coupled to 'n' equivalent protons, its signal is split into n+1 lines. If H1 couples to the four protons on C2 and C8 and they are treated as approximately equivalent, the signal will be split into (4+1) = 5 lines.\n*   **Conclusion on Coupling Pattern:** A signal with 5 lines is called a **pentet** (or quintet).\n\nTherefore, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3 is a pentet.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
