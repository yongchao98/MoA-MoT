    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results to determine the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### Analysis of the Mutant Phenotypes\n\n1.  **Role of G2:** The knock-out mutant `g2` shows 0% resistance, a complete loss of function. Furthermore, any double mutant including `g2` (i.e., `g1g2` and `g2g3`) also exhibits 0% resistance. When the phenotype of a double mutant is identical to that of one of the single mutants, it is a case of epistasis, where one gene's phenotype masks the effect of another. In this case, the `g2` mutation is epistatic to both `g1` and `g3`. This pattern is characteristic of a gene that acts upstream in a regulatory pathway or is essential for the pathway's function. Since the problem states at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, G2 is the strongest candidate for this role.\n\n2.  **Roles of G1 and G3:**\n    *   The single mutant `g1` retains 75% resistance (a 25% loss).\n    *   The single mutant `g3` retains 50% resistance (a 50% loss).\n    *   The double mutant `g1g3` has only 10% resistance (a 90% loss).\n\n3.  **Interaction between G1 and G3:** The phenotype of the `g1g3` double mutant (10% resistance) is more severe than either of the single mutants alone. This demonstrates that G1 and G3 are not in a simple, linear pathway. Instead, their functions are at least partially independent, and both contribute to overall resistance. The observation that the combined loss of resistance (90%) is greater than the sum of individual losses (25% + 50% = 75%) points to a synergistic interaction. This type of interaction often occurs when two genes have functions that are parallel or partially overlapping (redundant). Negative genetic interactions, where a double mutant is less fit than expected, often point to genes working in parallel or redundant pathways. Therefore, describing G1 and G3 as showing gene redundancy is a plausible interpretation of their relationship.\n\n4.  **Evaluating Epistasis between G1 and G3:** For G1 to be epistatic to G3, the `g1g3` double mutant would need to show the same phenotype as the `g1` single mutant (75% resistance). This is not the case (10% vs 75%). Therefore, the statement \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is incorrect based on the data.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This is incorrect. Pleiotropy (one gene affecting multiple traits) cannot be concluded from this experiment, and G1 is not epistatic towards G3.\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** This is incorrect. We have no information about the promoters, and G3 is not epistatic towards G1 (the double mutant's 10% resistance is not the same as `g3`'s 50%).\n*   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This option correctly identifies G2 as the likely transcription factor and plausibly describes the G1/G3 interaction as gene redundancy. Although the final clause (\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\") is incorrect based on the data, the first two conclusions are the strongest and most accurate deductions possible. In the context of a multiple-choice question with potential flaws, this option represents the best fit.\n*   **D) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** This is incorrect. G1 is unlikely to be the main transcription factor because the `g2` mutant has the more severe and epistatic phenotype.\n\nBased on the analysis, option C provides the most accurate description of the genetic relationships, despite an incorrect clause regarding epistasis between G1 and G3. The key conclusions—that G2 is a critical upstream regulator (transcription factor) and that G1 and G3 have partially redundant functions—are well-supported by the data.\n\n<<<C>>>"
