    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. The strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), deprotonates the ketone at the α-carbon to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated ester, ethyl acrylate.\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation:** The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The α-carbon at position 2 is quaternary (bonded to an ethyl and a methyl group) and has no hydrogens. The α-carbon at position 6 has one hydrogen and a methyl group. Therefore, the t-BuOK base will abstract the only available α-hydrogen from the C6 position to form the enolate.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The C6 of the resulting enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (H₂C=CH-COOEt). This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the terminal CH₂ group of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Product Structure A:** After protonation, a propanoate group is attached to the C6 position of the original cyclohexanone ring. To name the resulting product, `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`, the cyclohexyl ring is treated as a substituent on the ethyl propanoate chain.\n    *   Numbering the cyclohexyl ring from the point of attachment (the original C6) as C1, this carbon has a methyl group.\n    *   The adjacent carbonyl carbon (original C1) becomes C2, hence \"2-oxo\".\n    *   The next carbon (original C2) is C3, which bears both an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   This nomenclature correctly describes the product formed from the reaction.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile (KOH, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the carbon adjacent to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane, which is acidic. The resulting nitronate anion is the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Nucleophile and Electrophile:**\n    *   **Nucleophile (Michael Donor):** The anion of 1-nitropropane, CH₃CH₂CH⁻NO₂.\n    *   **Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), which has the structure CH₃-CH=CH-CN. The electron-withdrawing nitrile group makes the double bond susceptible to nucleophilic attack.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The nucleophilic carbon from the 1-nitropropane anion attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile (the carbon atom bearing the methyl group). An enolate intermediate is formed, which is then protonated by water.\n\n4.  **Product Structure B:** The new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane and the β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile. The final structure is `NC-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(NO₂)-CH₂-CH₃`.\n    *   To name this product, we identify the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon (C1).\n    *   The longest chain has six carbons, making it a **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Numbering from the nitrile carbon, there is a **methyl group** at position 3 and a **nitro group** at position 4.\n    *   Therefore, the correct IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The product of the first reaction, **A**, is correctly named **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The product of the second reaction, **B**, is correctly named **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these findings with the given options, only option A provides the correct structures for both products.\n\n<<<A>>>"
