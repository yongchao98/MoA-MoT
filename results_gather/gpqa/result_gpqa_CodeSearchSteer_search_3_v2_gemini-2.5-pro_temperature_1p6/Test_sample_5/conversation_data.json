    "To find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle, we first need to analyze the potential it is in.\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\n`V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)`\n\nTo simplify the problem, we can convert the potential to Cartesian coordinates (x, y) using the relations `x = r cos(θ)` and `r^2 = x^2 + y^2`.\n\nSubstituting these into the potential expression:\n`V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k(x^2)`\n`V(x, y) = 1/2 kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2 + 3/2 kx^2`\n`V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2`\n\nThis potential is in the form of a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. It can be separated into two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators, one in the x-direction and one in the y-direction:\n`V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)`\nwhere:\n`V_x(x) = 1/2 * (4k) * x^2`\n`V_y(y) = 1/2 * k * y^2`\n\nThe total energy E of the system is the sum of the energies from the two independent oscillators: `E = E_x + E_y`.\n\nThe energy levels for a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator are given by the formula E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, where ω is the angular frequency. The angular frequency is determined by `ω = sqrt(k_eff/m)`, where `k_eff` is the effective spring constant.\n\nFor the x-direction:\n*   The effective spring constant is `k_x = 4k`.\n*   The angular frequency is `ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)`.\n*   The energy eigenvalues are `E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k/m)`.\n\nFor the y-direction:\n*   The effective spring constant is `k_y = k`.\n*   The angular frequency is `ω_y = sqrt(k/m)`.\n*   The energy eigenvalues are `E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)`.\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of these two energies:\n`E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} = (n_x + 1/2) * 2ħ * sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k/m)`\n`E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)`\n`E = (2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)`\n`E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)`\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
