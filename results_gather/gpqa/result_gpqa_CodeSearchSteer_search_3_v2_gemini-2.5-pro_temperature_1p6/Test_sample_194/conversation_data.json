    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Conditions for Transit and Occultation\n\nA planet exhibits a transit when it passes in front of its star, and an occultation (or secondary eclipse) when it passes behind it. For a planet in a circular orbit, the geometric condition for both events to be possible is that the planet's path, as projected on the sky, must intersect the star's disk.\n\nThis is defined by the transit impact parameter, `b`, which is the projected distance between the center of the planet and the center of the star at the point of closest approach, measured in units of the star's radius. A transit or occultation occurs if the impact parameter `b` is less than or equal to 1. The maximum possible value for `b` that still allows for a transit (a \"grazing\" transit) is `b = 1`.\n\nThe impact parameter is given by the formula:\n`b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s`\nwhere:\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `i` is the orbital inclination (the angle between the orbital plane and the plane of the sky).\n*   `R_s` is the radius of the star.\n\n### 2. Using Planet 1 to Constrain the System's Geometry\n\nWe are given the following for Planet 1:\n*   Orbital period, `P1` = 3 days.\n*   Transit impact parameter, `b1` = 0.2.\n\nSince both planets are in the same orbital plane, they share the same inclination, `i`. The star is the same for both, so `R_s` is also constant.\n\nFrom the impact parameter formula for Planet 1, we have:\n`0.2 = (a1 * cos(i)) / R_s`\nwhere `a1` is the semi-major axis of Planet 1.\n\n### 3. Determining the Maximum Orbit for Planet 2\n\nWe want to find the maximum orbital period for Planet 2, which corresponds to the maximum possible semi-major axis, `a2`, that still allows for a transit. This occurs at the maximum impact parameter, `b2 = 1`.\n\nSo, for Planet 2 at its maximum orbit:\n`1 = (a2_max * cos(i)) / R_s`\n\n### 4. Relating the Orbits of the Two Planets\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n1.  `0.2 = (a1 * cos(i)) / R_s`\n2.  `1 = (a2_max * cos(i)) / R_s`\n\nBy dividing the second equation by the first, we can eliminate the unknown terms `cos(i)` and `R_s`:\n`(a2_max * cos(i)) / R_s` / `(a1 * cos(i)) / R_s` = `1 / 0.2`\n`a2_max / a1 = 5`\nThis shows that the maximum semi-major axis for Planet 2 is exactly 5 times the semi-major axis of Planet 1.\n\n### 5. Applying Kepler's Third Law\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (`P`) is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`a`).\n`P² ∝ a³`\n\nFor two planets orbiting the same star, the relationship can be written as:\n`(P2 / P1)² = (a2 / a1)³`\n\nWe can now solve for the maximum period of Planet 2, `P2_max`:\n`(P2_max / P1)² = (a2_max / a1)³`\n`(P2_max / 3 days)² = (5)³`\n`(P2_max / 3)² = 125`\n`P2_max / 3 = √125`\n`P2_max = 3 * √125`\n\nTo simplify `√125`:\n`√125 = √(25 * 5) = 5 * √5`\n\nSo, the final calculation is:\n`P2_max = 3 * 5 * √5 = 15 * √5`\n`P2_max ≈ 15 * 2.236`\n`P2_max ≈ 33.54` days\n\nThe maximum orbital period for the second planet is approximately 33.5 days. This corresponds to option A. The radii of the planets were not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
