    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine how many of the listed stars would be detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph.\n\nA star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel is achieved during a 1-hour exposure using a single 8.2m VLT telescope (1-UT mode).\n\n### **Step 1: Evaluate the visibility of each star from Paranal Observatory**\n\nThe Paranal Observatory is located at a latitude of approximately -24.6 degrees. A star's visibility depends on its declination (celestial latitude).\n\n*   **a) Canopus (α Carinae):** Has a declination of about -52° 41′. This is well within the observable range for Paranal.\n*   **b) Polaris (α Ursae Minoris):** Has a declination of about +89° 15′. For an observer at Paranal, Polaris will always be below the horizon and is therefore **not detectable**.\n*   **c), d), e), f) Unnamed Stars:** These stars are all located at a declination of 0 degrees, which is ideally positioned for observation from Paranal.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the apparent magnitude (m_V) of each star**\n\nThe apparent magnitude is the brightness of a star as seen from Earth.\n\n*   **a) Canopus:** This is the second brightest star in the night sky with an apparent magnitude (m_V) of -0.74.\n*   **c), d), e), f) Unnamed Stars:** For these stars, the apparent magnitude (m_V) must be calculated from the absolute magnitude (M_V = 15) and the distance (d) using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d/10)`.\n\n    *   **c) Distance = 10 pc:**\n        `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15 + 0 = 15.0`\n    *   **d) Distance = 200 pc:**\n        `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(200/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(20) ≈ 15 + 6.5 = 21.5`\n    *   **e) Distance = 5 pc:**\n        `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(5/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(0.5) ≈ 15 - 1.5 = 13.5`\n    *   **f) Distance = 50 pc:**\n        `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(50/10) = 15 + 5 * log10(5) ≈ 15 + 3.5 = 18.5`\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the limiting magnitude of ESPRESSO**\n\nThe crucial step is to find the faintest apparent magnitude a star can have and still meet the S/N ≥ 10 in a 1-hour exposure criterion in 1-UT mode.\n\nAccording to a 2010 SPIE proceeding regarding ESPRESSO, in the 1-UT mode, a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 is obtained for a star with V = 17.1 with three 20-minute exposures, which is equivalent to a single 1-hour exposure. Another document mentions that the limiting magnitude for this mode is around V ~ 16 mag. Based on these sources, a conservative limiting magnitude for achieving S/N=10 in one hour is approximately **V ≈ 17.0**. A star must have an apparent magnitude less than or equal to this value to be detectable.\n\n### **Step 4: Compare each star's magnitude to the limit**\n\n*   **a) Canopus:** m_V = -0.74. This is much brighter than the limit of ~17.0. Therefore, **Canopus is detectable**.\n*   **b) Polaris:** Not visible. **Not detectable**.\n*   **c) Star at 10 pc:** m_V = 15.0. This is brighter than ~17.0. Therefore, **this star is detectable**.\n*   **d) Star at 200 pc:** m_V = 21.5. This is fainter than ~17.0. Therefore, **this star is not detectable**.\n*   **e) Star at 5 pc:** m_V = 13.5. This is brighter than ~17.0. Therefore, **this star is detectable**.\n*   **f) Star at 50 pc:** m_V = 18.5. This is fainter than ~17.0. Therefore, **this star is not detectable**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe stars that meet the detectability criteria are:\n1.  Canopus (a)\n2.  Star with d = 10 pc (c)\n3.  Star with d = 5 pc (e)\n\nA total of **3** stars from the list are detectable.\n\n<<<A>>>"
