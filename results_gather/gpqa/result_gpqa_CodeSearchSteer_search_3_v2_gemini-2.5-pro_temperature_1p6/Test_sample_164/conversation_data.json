    "To determine the correct statement, we must evaluate each claim based on established principles of industrial and organometallic chemistry regarding ethylene polymerization and oligomerization. The overall goal is to produce a branched polymer using only ethylene, which requires a dual-catalyst system (or a tandem catalytic process) where one catalyst oligomerizes ethylene into short alpha-olefins (like 1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene), and the second catalyst copolymerizes these olefins with the remaining ethylene.\n\n*   **A) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.**\n    This statement is correct. Group VIa (or Group 6) of the periodic table includes Chromium (Cr). Chromium-based catalysts, particularly when combined with specific ligands (such as PNP, an amine-phosphine ligand) and activators, are highly effective and selective for the oligomerization of ethylene into alpha-olefins like 1-hexene and 1-octene. This process is the \"essential additional reaction step\" needed to generate the branches. The Phillips ethylene trimerization process, which was industrialized in 2003, uses a chromium catalyst to produce 1-hexene with high selectivity.\n\n*   **B) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.**\n    This statement is incorrect. Aluminum-based activators, such as methylaluminoxane (MAO) and modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO), are frequently used and are often essential co-catalysts for activating the chromium catalysts used in ethylene oligomerization. Numerous studies demonstrate that the choice of aluminum activator significantly impacts the catalyst's activity and selectivity. Therefore, they are not only functional but are a critical component of the system.\n\n*   **C) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.**\n    This statement is correct. Noble metals like palladium (Pd) and platinum (Pt) have been shown to catalyze the oligomerization of ethylene. However, the high cost of noble metals compared to more abundant early transition metals like chromium makes them economically unviable for the large-scale, industrial production of commodity polymers like branched polyethylene.\n\n*   **D) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.**\n    This statement is debatable and likely an oversimplification. While US companies have industrialized the production of alpha-olefins (like 1-hexene) from ethylene using chromium catalysts, this is often done in dedicated plants. The alpha-olefins are then typically transported and used as comonomers in separate polymerization reactors. True single-reactor tandem catalysis, where both oligomerization and polymerization occur concurrently, is a significant technical challenge due to catalyst compatibility issues. While there is extensive research and patent literature on such systems, suggesting industrial interest and development, it is not a broadly established, standard industrial process in the same way that separate olefin production and polymerization are. The wording suggests a maturity of implementation that may not be accurate.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBoth statements A and C are factually correct. However, Statement A describes the specific, industrially relevant class of catalysts (Group VIa - Chromium) that represent the breakthrough technology for selectively producing the short-chain branches from ethylene. This is the cornerstone of the chemistry discussed. Statement C is a more general truth about catalysis; while technically correct, it's less specific to the core industrial process in question than Statement A. Given the context of industrial research, the most pertinent and correct statement describing the key technology is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
