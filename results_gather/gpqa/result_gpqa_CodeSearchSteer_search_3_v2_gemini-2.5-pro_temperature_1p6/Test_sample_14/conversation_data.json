    "The search results confirm the formulas I used.\n\n*   **Transit Probability:** The probability of a planet transiting is approximately P_transit ≈ R_star / a, where R_star is the star's radius and 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. This approximation is valid for circular orbits.\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates the orbital period (P), semi-major axis (a), and the host star's mass (M_star). The formula is P² ≈ (4π²a³) / (G*M_star). From this, we can derive the semi-major axis as being proportional to (M_star * P²)^(1/3), or M_star^(1/3) * P^(2/3).\n\nThe derivation steps were:\n\n1.  **Define the Transit Probability Ratio:**\n    P_transit1 / P_transit2 = (R_star1 / a1) / (R_star2 / a2)\n\n2.  **Express Semi-Major Axis (a) using Kepler's Third Law:**\n    a ∝ (M_star * P²)^(1/3)\n\n3.  **Substitute 'a' into the probability ratio:**\n    P_transit1 / P_transit2 = [R_star1 / (M_star1 * P1²)^(1/3)] / [R_star2 / (M_star2 * P2²)^(1/3)]\n\n4.  **Input the given relationships:**\n    *   R_star1 = R_star2\n    *   M_star1 = 2 * M_star2\n    *   P2 = 3 * P1\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    P_transit1 / P_transit2 = [(M_star2 * (3*P1)²)^(1/3)] / [(2*M_star2 * P1²)^(1/3)]\n    P_transit1 / P_transit2 = [(M_star2 * 9 * P1²)^(1/3)] / [(2 * M_star2 * P1²)^(1/3)]\n    P_transit1 / P_transit2 = [9^(1/3)] / [2^(1/3)]\n    P_transit1 / P_transit2 = (9/2)^(1/3)\n    P_transit1 / P_transit2 = (4.5)^(1/3)\n\n6.  **Calculate the final value:**\n    (4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65096...\n\nThe calculation confirms that the transit probability for Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than for Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1.\n\nThis aligns perfectly with option C.\n\nThe probability of a planetary transit, assuming a circular orbit, is determined by the ratio of the host star's radius to the planet's orbital semi-major axis. To compare the transit probabilities of Planet_1 and Planet_2, we can establish a ratio.\n\nThe transit probability (p) is given by:\n*   p ∝ R_star / a\n\nWhere:\n*   R_star is the radius of the host star.\n*   a is the semi-major axis of the orbit.\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the semi-major axis (a) is related to the orbital period (P) and the mass of the host star (M_star) as follows:\n*   a ∝ (M_star * P²)^(1/3)\n\nBy substituting the expression for 'a' into the probability formula, we get:\n*   p ∝ R_star / (M_star * P²)^(1/3)  or p ∝ R_star * M_star^(-1/3) * P^(-2/3)\n\nNow, we can set up a ratio of the transit probabilities for Planet_1 (p1) and Planet_2 (p2):\n*   p1 / p2 = [R_star1 * M_star1^(-1/3) * P1^(-2/3)] / [R_star2 * M_star2^(-1/3) * P2^(-2/3)]\n\nWe are given the following relationships:\n*   The orbital period of Planet_2 is three times that of Planet_1 (P2 = 3 * P1).\n*   The host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as the host star of Planet_2 (M_star1 = 2 * M_star2).\n*   Both host stars have the same radius (R_star1 = R_star2).\n\nSubstituting these into the ratio equation:\n*   p1 / p2 = [R_star2 * (2 * M_star2)^(-1/3) * P1^(-2/3)] / [R_star2 * M_star2^(-1/3) * (3 * P1)^(-2/3)]\n\nAfter canceling out the common terms (R_star2, M_star2, and P1), we are left with:\n*   p1 / p2 = [2^(-1/3)] / [3^(-2/3)]\n*   p1 / p2 = 3^(2/3) / 2^(1/3)\n*   p1 / p2 = (9/2)^(1/3) = (4.5)^(1/3)\n\nCalculating the value:\n*   p1 / p2 ≈ 1.65\n\nThis means the probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
