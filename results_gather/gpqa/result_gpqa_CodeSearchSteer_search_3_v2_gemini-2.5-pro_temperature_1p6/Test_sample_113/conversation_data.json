    "### Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\nThis reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone (butan-2-one). The reaction involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN on the carbonyl carbon of the ketone. This forms an alkoxide intermediate. This intermediate must then be protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group. Reagent A's role is to be this proton source. An acidic workup, represented by H₃O⁺, provides the necessary proton to complete the reaction.\n\n### Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\nThis reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation can be catalyzed by either acid or base. Given the options, we are looking at acid catalysis. For the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, the nitrile is typically heated under reflux with a strong dilute acid, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl). The acid protonates the nitrile, making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water. A weak acid like acetic acid (CH₃COOH) would be far less effective.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Reagent **A** is **H₃O⁺** for the protonation step in cyanohydrin formation.\n*   Reagent **B** is **HCl** to act as a strong acid catalyst for nitrile hydrolysis.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of reagents is A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\n<<<A>>>"
