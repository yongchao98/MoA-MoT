    "Here is a step-by-step determination of the final product and the number of distinct hydrogen signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1**\nAcetic acid is treated with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. This is a variation of the Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky reaction for the alpha-bromination of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Starting Material:** Acetic acid (CH₃COOH)\n*   **Reaction:** α-bromination\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2**\nProduct 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a Fischer esterification reaction.\n*   **Starting Material:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)\n*   **Reaction:** Fischer Esterification\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3**\nProduct 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile and will displace the bromide ion in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n*   **Reaction:** Nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2)\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 → Product 4**\nProduct 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH₂)₅Br).\n1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride is a strong base that removes one of the acidic α-hydrogens from ethyl cyanoacetate, forming a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n    NCCH₂COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n2.  **Alkylation:** The enolate attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br(CH₂)₅Br → NC-CH( (CH₂)₅Br )-COOEt + Br⁻\n3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The resulting product still has an acidic α-hydrogen, which is removed by the excess NaH.\n    NC-CH( (CH₂)₅Br )-COOEt + NaH → [NC-C( (CH₂)₅Br )-COOEt]⁻Na⁺ + H₂\n4.  **Cyclization:** The newly formed carbanion attacks the other end of the carbon chain in an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, displacing the second bromine atom and forming a stable six-membered ring.\n*   **Final Product 4:** 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane\n\n**¹H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nThe final step is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals for 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane. A hydrogen is chemically distinct if it is in a unique electronic environment and cannot be interchanged with another hydrogen via a symmetry operation or rapid conformational change.\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₂CH₃) group attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n1.  **Symmetry:** The two substituents on C1 are different, so C1 is a stereocenter. This makes the entire molecule asymmetric, meaning it has no plane of symmetry or center of inversion.\n2.  **The Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene (-OCH₂-) group are adjacent to the rest of the chiral molecule. They are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. However, in standard ¹H NMR, the protons of an ethyl group are conventionally counted as two distinct signals unless very high resolution or special conditions are applied. We will follow the standard convention. The -CH₂- protons give **1 signal**.\n    *   Total for the ethyl group: 2 signals.\n\n3.  **The Cyclohexane Ring (-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂-):**\n    *   The ring contains 5 methylene (-CH₂) groups at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6.\n    *   Because C1 is a stereocenter, the two protons on *each* methylene group of the ring are diastereotopic and therefore chemically non-equivalent.\n    *   Since the molecule as a whole is asymmetric, the environment of C2 is different from C6, and the environment of C3 is different from C5.\n    *   Therefore, all 10 protons on the cyclohexane ring are in chemically distinct environments.\n    *   C2 protons (2 distinct H's) → 2 signals\n    *   C3 protons (2 distinct H's) → 2 signals\n    *   C4 protons (2 distinct H's) → 2 signals\n    *   C5 protons (2 distinct H's) → 2 signals\n    *   C6 protons (2 distinct H's) → 2 signals\n    *   Total for the ring: 10 signals.\n\n**Total Distinct Signals:**\nAdding the signals from the ethyl group and the ring:\n2 (from ethyl group) + 10 (from ring) = **12 distinct hydrogen signals**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
