    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, let's analyze the options based on the principles of planetary science.\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is essentially a planet with Earth's properties. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. This serves as our baseline for comparison.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** This planet's density is explicitly given as being about the same as Earth's.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** For planets with the same composition, density increases with mass. This is because the stronger gravity of a more massive planet compresses the material, packing the same \"stuff\" into a smaller volume and thus increasing its overall density. A rocky planet with 5 Earth masses (a \"super-Earth\") would experience significant gravitational compression, making it denser than Earth.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** Conversely, a planet with less mass experiences less gravitational compression. Therefore, a planet with the same composition as Earth but only half the mass would be less dense than Earth.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the four scenarios:\n*   Planet (a) has a density of ~5.51 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (b) has a density of ~5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (c) would be significantly denser than 5.51 g/cm³ due to gravitational compression from its high mass.\n*   Planet (d) would be less dense than 5.51 g/cm³ due to lower gravitational compression.\n\nTherefore, the planet with five times the mass of Earth and the same composition will have the highest density.\n\n<<<A>>>"
