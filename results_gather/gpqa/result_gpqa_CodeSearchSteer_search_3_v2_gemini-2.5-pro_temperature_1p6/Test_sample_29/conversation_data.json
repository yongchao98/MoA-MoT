    "To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we first need to find the color of the light it emits.\n\n1.  **Calculate the wavelength of the emitted light:**\n    The energy of the emitted light is given as 2.3393 eV. The relationship between energy (E) and wavelength (λ) is given by the formula E = hc/λ, where 'h' is Planck's constant and 'c' is the speed of light. A convenient form of this equation is λ (nm) = 1240 / E (eV).\n    *   λ = 1240 / 2.3393 eV ≈ 530 nm\n\n2.  **Determine the color of the emitted light:**\n    A wavelength of approximately 530 nm corresponds to green light in the visible spectrum.\n\n3.  **Determine the color of absorbed light:**\n    The color an object appears to be is the result of the wavelengths of light it reflects or transmits. The light it absorbs is the complementary color. When a compound emits light of a certain color, it absorbs light of the complementary color. The complementary color of green is red.\n\nTherefore, the organic compound absorbs red light.\n\n<<<D>>>"
