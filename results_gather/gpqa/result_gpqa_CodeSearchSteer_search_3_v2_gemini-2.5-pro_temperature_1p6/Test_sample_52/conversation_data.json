    "To identify the correct chemical formula, we can deduce the structure of the compound by analyzing the provided spectroscopic data step by step.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two substituents, which has a base formula of C₆H₄. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two signals for the aromatic protons, which strongly suggests a para (1,4) substitution pattern, as this symmetry would make the protons at positions 2 and 6 equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 equivalent.\n\n2.  **FTIR Spectrum:** The presence of an ester group (-COO-) is confirmed. This group contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n3.  **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the ring is split by the other vinyl proton, appearing as a doublet. The other vinyl proton is split by the first vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (creating a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n    *   **Two signals for -CH₃ groups:** One of these methyl groups is part of the propenyl substituent. The other must belong to the ester-containing substituent.\n    *   **No signals for -CH₂ groups:** This is a crucial piece of information that eliminates possibilities containing ethyl or longer alkyl chains.\n\n### Assembling the Molecular Structure:\n\nBased on the analysis, we can identify the following fragments that make up the molecule:\n*   A para-substituted benzene ring: **C₆H₄**\n*   A propenyl group: **-CH=CH-CH₃**, which has the formula **C₃H₅**\n*   An ester group and a methyl group: The simplest combination without a -CH₂- group is either a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate group (-OCOCH₃). Both of these fragments have the formula **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n### Determining the Chemical Formula:\n\nBy adding up the atoms from these identified fragments, we can determine the molecular formula:\n*   **Carbons:** 6 (from the ring) + 3 (from the propenyl group) + 2 (from the ester fragment) = 11 carbons\n*   **Hydrogens:** 4 (from the ring) + 5 (from the propenyl group) + 3 (from the methyl ester/acetate) = 12 hydrogens\n*   **Oxygens:** 2 (from the ester group)\n\nThis leads to a molecular formula of **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Verifying with Degree of Unsaturation:\n\nThe degree of unsaturation for a molecule with the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ can be calculated as follows:\nDoU = C - (H/2) + 1 = 11 - (12/2) + 1 = 11 - 6 + 1 = 6.\nThis matches the expected unsaturation for the proposed structure:\n*   1 for the benzene ring\n*   3 for the double bonds within the ring\n*   1 for the vinyl group's double bond (C=C)\n*   1 for the ester group's double bond (C=O)\n*   Total = 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 6\n\nThe spectroscopic data is fully consistent with a structure having the formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>"
