    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the structure of the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n### Step 1: Identifying Product 1\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂). Adamantane (C₁₀H₁₆) is a tricyclic alkane, meaning it has three rings. Its degree of unsaturation (DU) is 3.\n2.  **Reaction 1:** Heating with excess KOH at 240°C. This is a high-temperature reaction with a strong base, suggesting elimination and/or rearrangement reactions are likely.\n3.  **Product 1 Analysis:**\n    *   **IR Spectrum:** A peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), most likely a ketone.\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The integration (2H + 10H + 2H) shows a total of 14 protons. This means the molecular formula of the carbon skeleton is C₁₀H₁₄. Combined with the ketone, the formula is **C₁₀H₁₄O**.\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DU) for C₁₀H₁₄O:** DU = (2C + 2 + N - H - X)/2 = (2*10 + 2 - 14)/2 = 4.\n    *   **Ozonolysis Step:** The overall reaction sequence involves ozonolysis (Step 3), which cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). This implies that Product 1 (and Product 2) must contain a C=C bond.\n    *   **Structural Contradiction:** The adamantane cage has 3 rings (DU=3). A ketone adds one more DU (for the C=O bond), for a total of DU=4. This matches the formula C₁₀H₁₄O. However, this leaves no room for the C=C bond (which requires another DU) that is necessary for the ozonolysis step to proceed.\n    *   **Resolution:** The only way for Product 1 to have a C=O, a C=C, and the formula C₁₀H₁₄O (DU=4) is if the original tricyclic adamantane cage has opened, resulting in a bicyclic (DU=2) skeleton. Thus, Product 1 is a bicyclic unsaturated ketone.\n    *   **Proposed Structure for Product 1:** The high temperature and basic conditions likely induce a complex skeletal rearrangement. A plausible, symmetrical structure that fits the evidence is **bicyclo[3.3.2]dec-9-en-3-one**.\n        *   It is a **bicyclic** molecule (DU=2).\n        *   It has one **C=C** bond (DU=1).\n        *   It has one **C=O** group (DU=1).\n        *   Total DU = 2+1+1 = 4.\n        *   Its formula is **C₁₀H₁₄O**, matching the NMR integration.\n        *   The C₂ symmetry of this molecule would make the two vinylic protons (at C9 and C10) chemically equivalent, which could potentially explain the 2H signal observed in the NMR data (the reported shift of 4.79 ppm, while somewhat low for vinylic protons, could be due to the unusual bicyclic structure).\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Product 2\n\n1.  **Reaction 2:** Product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-iPr)₃.\n2.  **Mechanism:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces ketones to alcohols.\n3.  **Product 2:** The ketone group in bicyclo[3.3.2]dec-9-en-3-one is reduced to a hydroxyl group. Product 2 is **bicyclo[3.3.2]dec-9-en-3-ol**.\n\n### Step 3: Identifying Product 3 and Analyzing its NMR\n\n1.  **Reaction 3:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n2.  **Mechanism:** This is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the C=C double bond and converts the carbons of the double bond into aldehyde groups (-CHO).\n3.  **Product 3 Structure:** The C9=C10 double bond in bicyclo[3.3.2]dec-9-en-3-ol is cleaved. This opens the two-carbon bridge, resulting in a large, ten-membered ring structure. The original bridgehead carbons (C1 and C5) are now part of this ring, and each is attached to a newly formed aldehyde group. The structure of Product 3 is **3-hydroxy-cyclodecane-1,7-dicarbaldehyde** (the exact numbering can vary, but the connectivity is a 10-membered ring with substituents at positions 1, 3, and 7).\n4.  **¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3:**\n    *   **Most Deshielded Protons:** In Product 3, the most deshielded non-exchangeable protons are the two aldehyde protons (R-CHO). Their chemical shift is typically in the 9-10 ppm range. The proton on the carbon bearing the alcohol group (-CHOH) is next (~3.5-4.5 ppm), and the other ring protons are further upfield.\n    *   **Coupling Pattern:** We need to determine the splitting pattern of one of the aldehyde protons. Let's consider the aldehyde group attached to C1.\n        *   The carbon alpha (adjacent) to the aldehyde carbonyl is C1 of the ring. Based on the parent bicyclic structure, C1 is a methine group, meaning it is bonded to a single proton (H1).\n        *   **3-Bond Coupling (J³):** The aldehyde proton couples to the proton on the alpha-carbon (H1). Since it couples to one proton, this interaction will split the signal into a **doublet**.\n        *   **4-Bond Long-Range Coupling (J⁴):** Aldehyde protons can also exhibit smaller couplings to protons that are four bonds away. In the flexible cyclodecane ring, the aldehyde proton at C1 can couple to the protons on C2. The C2 position is a methylene group (-CH₂-), having two protons.\n        *   **Combining Couplings:** A likely scenario in such a system is that the major coupling is to the single alpha-proton (H1), causing a doublet splitting. This doublet is then further split by long-range coupling to the two protons on C2. If the two protons on C2 are magnetically equivalent, they will split the signal into a triplet.\n        *   **Final Pattern:** The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets**. Each peak of the main doublet is split into a smaller triplet.\n\nThis detailed analysis leads to the conclusion that the coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3 is a doublet of triplets.\n\n<<<D>>>"
