    "To determine the pH of the final solution, a step-by-step stoichiometric calculation is required. This involves calculating the initial moles of all acidic and basic species and then determining the excess amount of either acid or base after neutralization.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the calculation:\n\n**1. Calculate the initial moles of each reactant:**\n*   **CH3COOH (Acetic Acid - a weak acid):**\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 moles\n*   **HCl (Hydrochloric Acid - a strong acid):**\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, meaning the moles of H+ are equal to the moles of HCl.\n    *   Moles of H+ = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 moles\n*   **Ba(OH)2 (Barium Hydroxide - a strong base):**\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that dissociates to produce two hydroxide (OH-) ions for each formula unit.\n    *   Moles of OH- = Molarity × Volume × 2 = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L × 2 = 0.180 moles\n\n**2. Perform the neutralization reactions:**\nNeutralization reactions occur between acids and bases. The strong base (OH-) will first react with the strong acid (H+), and any remaining strong base will then react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Step 2a: Strong Acid - Strong Base Neutralization:**\n    *   Initial moles of H+ (from HCl) = 0.080 mol\n    *   Initial moles of OH- (from Ba(OH)2) = 0.180 mol\n    *   The strong acid (H+) is the limiting reactant and will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\n*   **Step 2b: Weak Acid - Strong Base Neutralization:**\n    *   The remaining 0.100 mol of strong base (OH-) will now react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n    *   Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n    *   Moles of OH- available = 0.100 mol\n    *   The weak acid is the limiting reactant in this step and will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of excess OH- = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n**3. Calculate the final pH:**\nThe final solution contains an excess of a strong base (OH-). The pH is determined by the concentration of these excess hydroxide ions.\n\n*   **Step 3a: Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Step 3b: Calculate the final concentration of OH-:**\n    *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Step 3c: Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH-]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>"
