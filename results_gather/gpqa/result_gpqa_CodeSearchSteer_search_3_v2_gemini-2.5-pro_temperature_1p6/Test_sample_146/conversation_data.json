    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Principle of Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the annihilation is equal to the total energy after the annihilation.\n\n2.  **Initial Energy ($E_{i}$):**\n    *   The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy. We can assume the annihilation happens at rest.\n    *   The initial energy is therefore the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n    *   The rest energy of a proton ($m_{p}c^{2}$) is approximately 938 MeV. The antiproton has the same rest mass.\n    *   $E_{i} = m_{p}c^{2} + m_{\\bar{p}}c^{2} = 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Final Energy ($E_{f}$):**\n    *   The annihilation produces four particles ($2A^{+} \\text{ and } 2A^{-}$).\n    *   The rest energy of each particle A ($m_{A}c^{2}$) is given as 300 MeV.\n    *   Due to the conservation of momentum (assuming the initial momentum is zero), the four resulting particles must have equal kinetic energy and, therefore, equal velocity (in magnitude).\n    *   The total energy of a single moving particle A is given by the relativistic energy equation: $E_A = \\gamma m_{A}c^{2}$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $1/\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$.\n    *   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four particles: $E_{f} = 4 \\times E_A = 4\\gamma m_{A}c^{2}$.\n\n4.  **Equating Initial and Final Energy:**\n    *   $E_{i} = E_{f}$\n    *   $1876 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n    *   $1876 = 1200\\gamma$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$):**\n    *   $\\gamma = 1876 / 1200 \\approx 1.5633$\n\n6.  **Solve for the velocity (v):**\n    *   From the definition of the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$, we can rearrange to solve for $v$.\n    *   $\\gamma^2 = 1 / (1 - v^2/c^2)$\n    *   $1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/\\gamma^2$\n    *   $v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/\\gamma^2$\n    *   $v = c \\times \\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the final velocity:**\n    *   $v = c \\times \\sqrt{1 - 1/(1.5633)^2}$\n    *   $v = c \\times \\sqrt{1 - 1/2.444}$\n    *   $v = c \\times \\sqrt{1 - 0.409}$\n    *   $v = c \\times \\sqrt{0.591}$\n    *   $v \\approx 0.7688c$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.77c.\n\n<<<B>>>"
