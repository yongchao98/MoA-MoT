    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment.\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   An atomic nucleus is at rest.\n    *   Rest-mass energy (E_M): 300 GeV. This means M*c*² = 300 GeV.\n    *   Initial momentum is zero.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments, fragment 1 (m1) and fragment 2 (m2).\n    *   Fragment 1 is the more massive one: m1 = 2 * m2.\n    *   The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.\n\n### 2. Calculate Fragment Masses and Energies\n\nFirst, we determine the rest mass of each fragment in terms of the initial mass M.\n*   Substitute `m1 = 2 * m2` into the sum equation:\n    `(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n    `m2 = 0.33 * M`\n*   Now, find m1:\n    `m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, calculate their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1 (E_m1):\n    `m1*c² = 0.66 * (M*c²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2 (E_m2):\n    `m2*c² = 0.33 * (M*c²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\n### 3. Determine the Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy.\n*   `Q = E_M - (m1*c² + m2*c²)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n*   `Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Relativistic Kinetic Energy (T1)\n\nDue to the conservation of momentum, since the initial nucleus was at rest, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal momentum magnitude.\n\nThe relativistic relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass energy (m*c*²) is E² = (p*c*)² + (m*c*²)².\n\nFrom this, the kinetic energy (T) can be related to momentum by (p*c*)² = T² + 2*T*(m*c*²).\n\nSince the momenta are equal, `(p1*c)² = (p2*c)²`:\n`T1² + 2*T1*(m1*c²) = T2² + 2*T2*(m2*c²)`\n\nWe also know `T2 = Q - T1`. Substituting this and the rest-mass energies:\n`T1² + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)² + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1² + 396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + T1² + 594 - 198*T1`\n\nSimplify the equation:\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\nSo, the correct relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is **1.005 GeV**.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Classical Kinetic Energy (T1_classical)\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T_cl = p_cl² / (2*m).\n\nFrom the conservation of classical momentum, `p1_cl = p2_cl`. Therefore:\n`T1_cl * (2*m1) = T2_cl * (2*m2)`\n`T1_cl / T2_cl = m2 / m1 = (0.33*M) / (0.66*M) = 1/2`\nSo, `T2_cl = 2 * T1_cl`.\n\nThe total classical kinetic energy is the same Q-value:\n`T1_cl + T2_cl = 3 GeV`\n`T1_cl + (2 * T1_cl) = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_cl = 3 GeV`\n`T1_cl = 1 GeV`\n\nSo, the classical approximation for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is **1 GeV**.\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\n\nThe difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is:\n*   Difference = T1 - T1_classical\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nFinally, convert this difference to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = 0.005 GeV * 1000 MeV/GeV = 5 MeV.\n\n<<<D>>>"
