    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture:** The problem describes an N-sided polygonal aperture where all apothems are of equal length, denoted by 'a'. As the number of sides, N, approaches infinity, a regular polygon with a constant apothem becomes a circle. The apothem 'a' of the polygon becomes the radius of the circle.\n\n2.  **Diffraction by a Circular Aperture:** The diffraction of light passing through a circular aperture creates a characteristic pattern known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central spot, called the Airy disk, surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings. The problem requires using the small-angle approximation (tan θ ≈ sin θ ≈ θ).\n\n3.  **Position of Minima:** The angular positions of the dark rings (minima) in the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture are given by the formula:\n    sin(θ) ≈ θ = m * (λ / D)\n    Here, λ is the wavelength of the light, D is the diameter of the aperture, and 'm' represents coefficients derived from the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind of order one.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Diameter:** The radius of the circular aperture is 'a', so its diameter D is 2a.\n\n5.  **Determine the Positions of the First Two Minima:**\n    *   **First Minimum (θ₁):** The first minimum corresponds to a coefficient m₁ ≈ 1.220. Its angular position is:\n        θ₁ = 1.220 * (λ / D) = 1.220 * (λ / 2a) = 0.610 * (λ / a).\n    *   **Second Minimum (θ₂):** The second minimum corresponds to a coefficient m₂ ≈ 2.233. Its angular position is:\n        θ₂ = 2.233 * (λ / D) = 2.233 * (λ / 2a) ≈ 1.1165 * (λ / a).\n\n6.  **Calculate the Angular Distance:** The angular distance between the first and second minima is the difference between their angular positions:\n    Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁\n    Δθ = (1.1165 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\n    Δθ = (1.1165 - 0.610) * (λ / a)\n    Δθ = 0.5065 * (λ / a)\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value, 0.5065 * (λ / a), is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
