    "A reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. This conclusion is based on a detailed analysis of the provided mass spectrometry, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy data.\n\n### Analysis of Spectral Data:\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:** The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak (M+) at an m/z of 156. An additional peak (M+2) at m/z 158 with roughly one-third the intensity (32%) of the molecular ion peak is also observed. This 3:1 ratio for the M+ and M+2 peaks is a distinctive isotopic signature indicating the presence of a single chlorine atom. All the proposed compounds have the chemical formula C7H5ClO2, which corresponds to a molecular weight of approximately 156.57 g/mol, consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:** The IR spectrum displays a very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. The extremely broad peak is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid, which is broadened due to hydrogen bonding. The strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid. Phenyl chloroformate lacks an O-H group and its carbonyl peak would be at a higher frequency, making it inconsistent with the IR data. 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde would show an O-H and a C=O stretch, but the exceptional broadness of the O-H peak is more indicative of a carboxylic acid. Both 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-chlorobenzoic acid fit the IR data well.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:** The proton NMR spectrum provides the most definitive evidence for the structure.\n    *   A singlet peak at a very downfield chemical shift of 11.0 ppm, integrating to one proton (1H), is highly characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   The aromatic region shows two doublets: one at 8.02 ppm (2H) and another at 7.72 ppm (2H). This symmetrical pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is a classic indicator of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   2-chlorobenzoic acid, being ortho-substituted, would produce a more complex and asymmetric splitting pattern in the aromatic region.\n    *   3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde would have three distinct aromatic protons, not the two-doublet pattern observed.\n    *   Therefore, the ¹H NMR data uniquely points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid, which has the necessary para-substitution to produce the observed symmetrical spectrum.\n\nCombining all pieces of spectral evidence, 4-chlorobenzoic acid is the only compound that is fully consistent with the mass, IR, and NMR data provided.\n\n<<<C>>>"
