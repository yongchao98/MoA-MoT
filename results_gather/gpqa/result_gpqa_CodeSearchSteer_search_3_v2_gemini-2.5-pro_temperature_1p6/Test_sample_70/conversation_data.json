    "The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is the theoretical temperature it would have if it were a perfect blackbody heated only by its star. To find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can use the principles of planetary thermodynamics and celestial mechanics.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its host star and the energy it radiates away. This can be expressed by the formula:\n\nT_eq ∝ (1/a)^1/2\n\nwhere 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. For circular orbits, as specified in the problem, the semi-major axis is equal to the orbital radius.\n\nFrom this relationship, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets (T_eq4 and T_eq2) in the same system is:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (a2 / a4)^1/2\n\nwhere a2 and a4 are the semi-major axes of Planet_2 and Planet_4, respectively.\n\nTo relate the semi-major axes to the orbital periods, we use Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion. This law states that the square of the orbital period (P) of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a).\n\nP² ∝ a³ or a ∝ P^(2/3)\n\nBy substituting this into our temperature ratio equation, we can express the temperature ratio in terms of the orbital periods (P2 and P4):\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = ((P2)^(2/3) / (P4)^(2/3))^1/2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\n\nThe problem states that the orbital periods of the five planets are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Therefore, the ratio of the period of Planet_2 to Planet_4 is:\n\nP2 / P4 = 2 / 3.5 = 4 / 7\n\nNow, we can calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (4 / 7)^(1/3) ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83\n\nThus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<A>>>"
