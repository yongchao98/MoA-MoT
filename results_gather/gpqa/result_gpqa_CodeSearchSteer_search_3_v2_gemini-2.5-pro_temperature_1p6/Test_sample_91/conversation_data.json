    "To calculate the enthalpy of formation of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, we can use the provided bond energies and enthalpy of atomization values. The calculation involves determining the energy required to break down the reactants in their standard states into gaseous atoms and subtracting the energy released when forming the product from these atoms.\n\nFirst, we determine the structure and molecular formula of the compound.\nThe structure is:\n```\n      CH3           CH3         CH3\n      |             |           |\nH3C - C = CH - CH2 - CH - CH2 - CH = C - CH3\n                                      |\n                                      CH3\n```\nFrom the structure, we can count the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms to find the molecular formula: C12H22.\n\nNext, we count the number of each type of bond in one mole of the compound:\n*   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 C-H bonds.\n*   **C-C single bonds:** There are 9 C-C bonds.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** There are 2 C=C bonds.\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) is calculated using the following formula, based on Hess's Law.\n**ΔHf = [Σ Enthalpies of atomization of elements in standard state] - [Σ Bond energies of the product]**\n\n**1. Calculate the sum of bond energies for the product molecule (enthalpy of atomization of the compound):**\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous compound to form gaseous atoms.\n*   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 mol × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ\n*   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 mol × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ\n*   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 mol × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ\n*   **Total bond energy = 600 + 1800 + 8800 = 11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**2. Calculate the sum of the enthalpies of atomization for the constituent elements in their standard states (reactants):**\nThis is the energy needed to convert the elements (12 moles of solid carbon and 11 moles of H2 gas) into gaseous atoms (12 moles of gaseous carbon and 22 moles of gaseous hydrogen).\n*   Atomization of Carbon: The energy to convert 12 moles of solid carbon to gaseous carbon is 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ.\n*   Atomization of Hydrogen: The bond energy of H-H is given as 100 kJ/mol. This is the energy to break one mole of H2 molecules into two moles of H atoms. Since the formula is C12H22, we need 22 moles of H atoms, which come from 11 moles of H2 molecules.\n    *   Energy to form 22 moles of H atoms = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ.\n*   **Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = 13100 kJ**\n\n**3. Calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound:**\n*   ΔHf = (Total enthalpy of atomization of reactants) - (Total bond energy of the product)\n*   ΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**4. Convert the answer to the required units:**\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. The options are given in both kJ/mol and kJ/g. Option B has the correct numerical value but incorrect units (kJ/g instead of kJ/mol). Option C is in kJ/g. Let's convert our result to kJ/g to check option C.\n\n*   Molar mass of C12H22 = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n*   Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.446 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
