    "This problem requires a calculation of the threshold energy for electron-positron pair production ($\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$) from the collision of a high-energy gamma-ray with a photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).\n\n### Key Concepts and Formula\nThe creation of an electron-positron pair requires an amount of energy at least equal to the sum of their rest masses. The rest mass energy of an electron ($m_e c^2$) is approximately 0.511 MeV. Since a positron has the same mass, the minimum energy required to create the pair is $2 m_e c^2 \\approx 1.022$ MeV.\n\nThis minimum energy must be available in the center-of-mass frame of the two colliding photons. To find the threshold energy of the high-energy gamma-ray ($E_\\gamma$) in the laboratory frame (our universe), we can use the conservation of four-momentum. For a head-on collision, which provides the most efficient energy transfer and thus corresponds to the minimum required energy for the gamma-ray, the threshold energy is given by the formula:\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{\\epsilon_{CMB}}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $E_\\gamma$ is the threshold energy of the high-energy gamma-ray.\n*   $m_e c^2$ is the rest mass energy of an electron.\n*   $\\epsilon_{CMB}$ is the energy of the CMB photon.\n\n### Given Values\nFrom the problem statement:\n*   Average photon energy of the CMB ($\\epsilon_{CMB}$): $10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$\n*   Rest mass energy of an electron ($m_e c^2$): $0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$\n\n### Calculation\nNow, we can substitute the given values into the formula:\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\nFirst, calculate the square of the electron's rest mass energy:\n\n$(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2 = 0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2$\n\nNext, divide this by the CMB photon energy:\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\nThis can be written as $2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$. The question asks for the answer in Giga-electron-volts (GeV), where $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$.\n\nTo convert from eV to GeV, we divide by $10^9$:\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculated threshold energy is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV. Gamma-rays with energies at or above this threshold will have their ability to travel long distances in the universe significantly limited by this pair-production process, making the universe effectively opaque to them. Comparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) 2.6*1e5 GeV\nB) 9.5*1e4 GeV\nC) 3.9*1e5 GeV\nD) 1.8*1e5 GeV\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
