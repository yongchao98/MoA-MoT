    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.\n\n### Reaction Sequence Analysis\n\n1.  **Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂):** This reaction is an alpha-bromination of a ketone. The bromine atom adds to the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon). This reaction typically occurs under acidic or basic conditions. The product, **1**, is **2-bromocyclohexanone**.\n\n2.  **Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH):** When an α-halo ketone like 2-bromocyclohexanone is heated with a strong base, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This is a characteristic reaction that results in a ring contraction. The six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to form a five-membered ring derivative. The product, **2**, is **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid** (after neutralization).\n\n3.  **Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine:** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl). The product, **3**, is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n4.  **Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃):** This reagent is a mild and bulky reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to an alcohol. Therefore, it reduces cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride to the corresponding aldehyde. The final product, **4**, is **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**.\n\n### Analysis of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze the molecule's symmetry. At room temperature, the cyclopentane ring undergoes rapid conformational changes (pseudorotation), which creates an \"averaged\" symmetry.\n\nThis time-averaged conformation possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the carbon it is attached to (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the cyclopentane ring. This symmetry makes pairs of carbons and their attached hydrogens equivalent.\n\nLet's count the distinct hydrogen environments based on this symmetry:\n*   **Environment 1:** The single proton of the aldehyde group (-CHO). (1 hydrogen)\n*   **Environment 2:** The single proton on the carbon atom C1, which is attached to the aldehyde group. (1 hydrogen)\n*   **Environment 3 & 4:** The protons on carbons C2 and C5 are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, on each of these carbons, the two protons are diastereotopic because of the chiral center at C1. This means they are in chemically different environments from each other. So, the four hydrogens on C2 and C5 give rise to **two distinct signals**. (4 hydrogens total, creating 2 signals)\n*   **Environment 5 & 6:** Similarly, the protons on carbons C3 and C4 are equivalent. The two protons on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. Therefore, the four hydrogens on C3 and C4 give rise to another **two distinct signals**. (4 hydrogens total, creating 2 signals)\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen environments. This is supported by predicted 1H NMR data for cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde, which shows distinct signals or multiplets for these groups of protons.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
