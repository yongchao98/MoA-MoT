    "The reaction of a ketone with sodium nitrite (NaNO₂) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a known method for the synthesis of α-diketones (1,2-diketones). In this reaction, nitrous acid (HNO₂) is generated in situ from NaNO₂ and HCl. The ketone, via its enol tautomer, attacks the electrophilic nitrosating agent (derived from nitrous acid), leading to nitrosation at the alpha-carbon (the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group). The resulting α-nitroso ketone then tautomerizes to a more stable α-oximino ketone, which is subsequently hydrolyzed by the acid present in the mixture to yield the final 1,2-diketone product. This reaction requires the starting ketone to have at least one hydrogen atom on an α-carbon.\n\nLet's analyze the two specific reactions given:\n\n**Reaction A: A + (NaNO₂, HCl, H₂O) → 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione**\n\nThe product is a 1,2-diketone. Based on the reaction mechanism, the starting material (A) should be a ketone that can be nitrosated at the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n\n*   **Option A and B for starting material A: 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol** This is an alcohol, not a ketone. While it could potentially be oxidized, it is not the direct precursor for an α-nitrosation reaction.\n*   **Option C and D for starting material A: 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one** This is a ketone. The carbonyl group is at position 1, and the adjacent (alpha) carbons are at positions 2 and 6. Nitrosation can occur at position 2, which has available hydrogen atoms. Following hydrolysis, this would lead to the desired product, 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione. This makes 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one a suitable starting material.\n\nTherefore, the correct starting material A is 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one. This eliminates options A and B.\n\n**Reaction B: B + (NaNO₂, HCl, H₂O) → 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione**\n\nThe product is also a 1,2-diketone. We need to find a suitable starting ketone (B) from the remaining options C and D.\n\n*   **Option C for starting material B: 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol** This is a diol (a compound with two alcohol groups). The reagents NaNO₂/HCl are not standard for oxidizing diols to diketones.\n*   **Option D for starting material B: 5-methylhexan-2-one** This is a ketone. The carbonyl group is at position 2. The alpha-carbons are at positions 1 (a methyl group) and 3 (a methylene group). Nitrosation will preferentially occur at the more substituted alpha-carbon with available hydrogens, which is position 3. Nitrosation at C3, followed by hydrolysis, will yield 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione. This is a plausible reaction pathway.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct pair of starting materials is 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one for A and 5-methylhexan-2-one for B.\n\n<<<D>>>"
