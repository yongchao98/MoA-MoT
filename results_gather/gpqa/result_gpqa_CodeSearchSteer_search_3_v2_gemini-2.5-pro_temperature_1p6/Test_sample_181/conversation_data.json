    "The Mott-Gurney equation is a fundamental model used to describe the current-voltage relationship in a specific regime of semiconductor device operation. The validity of this equation rests on several key assumptions about the device's properties and the nature of charge transport.\n\nAn analysis of the conditions required for the Mott-Gurney law reveals the following:\n*   **Single Carrier Type**: The model assumes that the current is carried by only one type of charge carrier, either electrons or holes. Therefore, it applies to single-carrier devices.\n*   **Trap-Free Material**: The derivation assumes the semiconductor is ideal and free from charge traps or energetic disorder that could capture the charge carriers.\n*   **Ohmic Contacts**: The model requires that the electrical contacts are \"Ohmic,\" meaning they form a charge reservoir and present no energy barrier to the injection of carriers into the semiconductor. This ensures that the current is limited by the space charge within the device, not by the injection process at the contact. An ideal Ohmic contact implies that the electric field at the injecting electrode is zero.\n*   **Negligible Diffusion Current**: The Mott-Gurney equation is derived by considering only the drift component of the current, which is driven by the electric field. The diffusion component, arising from the gradient in carrier concentration, is assumed to be negligible.\n*   **Negligible Intrinsic Conductivity**: The intrinsic charge carrier concentration in the material is assumed to be negligible compared to the injected charge carriers.\n\nBased on these points, the provided statements can be evaluated:\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.** This is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney law explicitly describes a drift-dominated current.\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect. A Schottky contact typically implies an energy barrier to injection, which violates the assumption of an ideal Ohmic contact.\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.** This statement accurately reflects the key assumptions. \"No carrier injection barrier\" is the defining characteristic of an ideal Ohmic contact in this context, and the device is assumed to be trap-free, involve a single carrier type, and have negligible diffusion current.\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect as the law is specifically derived for single-carrier devices.\n\n<<<C>>>"
