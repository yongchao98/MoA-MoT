    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], among all cobalt-containing species, we must calculate its mole fraction in the solution.\n\nThe formation of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes follows these equilibria:\n*   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺\n*   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]\n*   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n*   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe total concentration of all cobalt species, c(Co), is the sum of the free Co²⁺ ion and all its complexes:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nUsing the given overall stability constants (β), we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration, [Co²⁺], and the free thiocyanate concentration, [SCN⁻]:\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nThe mole fraction (α₂) of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration. The formula for the mole fraction of a specific complex, [MLₙ], can be derived as follows.\n\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\nα₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nBy factoring out [Co²⁺] from the denominator, the expression simplifies to:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values into this equation:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, let's calculate the terms in the denominator:\n*   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 × (0.1) = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 63 × 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 16 × 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nThe denominator is the sum of these terms plus 1:\nDenominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator is the term corresponding to the [Co(SCN)₂] complex:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\nNow, we calculate the mole fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo find the percentage, we multiply the mole fraction by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 × 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThis value corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
