    "To determine the energies of the system, we must consider the energy levels of a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well and then place the four spin-1/2 particles into these levels according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n**1. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\nThe energy for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L is given by:\nE_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n\nWhere `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\nThe problem defines the energy unit E = π²ħ² / 2mL². Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n*   E₁ = 1²E = 1E\n*   E₂ = 2²E = 4E\n*   E₃ = 3²E = 9E\n*   E₄ = 4²E = 16E\n*   and so on.\n\n**2. Applying the Pauli Exclusion Principle**\nSince the particles are identical spin-1/2 particles (fermions), they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. For this system, a quantum state is defined by the energy level `n` and the spin (up or down). Consequently, each energy level `E_n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**3. Ground State Energy**\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n*   Two particles go into the n=1 level.\n*   The remaining two particles go into the n=2 level.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of the four particles:\nE_ground = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂)\nE_ground = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy**\nThe first excited state is the lowest-energy configuration after the ground state. It is achieved by moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level (n=2) to the next available unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n*   Two particles remain in the n=1 level.\n*   One particle remains in the n=2 level.\n*   One particle is excited to the n=3 level.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_first = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃)\nE_first = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy**\nThe second excited state is the next-lowest energy configuration. We must consider the different possibilities for excitation from the ground state:\n*   **Possibility A:** Excite one particle from n=2 to n=4. The configuration is (2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4). Total Energy = 2*E₁ + 1*E₂ + 1*E₄ = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n*   **Possibility B:** Excite both particles from n=2 to n=3. The configuration is (2 in n=1, 2 in n=3). Total Energy = 2*E₁ + 2*E₃ = 2E + 2*(9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n*   **Possibility C:** Excite one particle from n=1 to n=3. The configuration is (1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3). Total Energy = 1*E₁ + 2*E₂ + 1*E₃ = 1E + 2*(4E) + 9E = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n\nComparing the possibilities, the lowest energy for the second excitation is 18E.\n\nThe energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<A>>>"
