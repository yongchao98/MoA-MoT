    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Define the initial state and operators**\n\n*   The initial unnormalized state of the system is given by the column matrix `|ψ_unnormalized⟩`:\n    ```\n    |ψ_unnormalized⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T\n    ```\n*   The operator for observable P is:\n    ```\n    P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]\n    ```\n*   The operator for observable Q is:\n    ```\n    Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]\n    ```\n\n**2. Normalize the initial state**\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized to have a length of 1.\n*   First, calculate the square of the norm (length) of the unnormalized state vector:\n    `⟨ψ_unnormalized|ψ_unnormalized⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n*   The norm is `√6`.\n*   The normalized state `|ψ⟩` is obtained by dividing the unnormalized state by its norm:\n    ```\n    |ψ⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T\n    ```\n\n**3. Find the eigenvector for P = 0**\n\nThe possible outcomes of a measurement of P are its eigenvalues. We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the outcome `P = 0`.\n*   We solve the eigenvalue equation `P|v⟩ = λ|v⟩` for `λ = 0`:\n    `(P - 0*I)|v⟩ = 0`, where `|v⟩ = [x, y, z]^T`.\n    ```\n    [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]^T = [0, 0, 0]^T\n    ```\n    This gives the system of equations:\n    1.  `y/√2 = 0`  => `y = 0`\n    2.  `x/√2 + z/√2 = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\n*   The eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]^T = x * [1, 0, -1]^T`.\n*   To normalize this eigenvector, we find its norm: `√(1² + 0² + (-1)²) = √2`.\n*   The normalized eigenvector `|p=0⟩` is:\n    ```\n    |p=0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T\n    ```\n\n**4. Calculate the probability of measuring P = 0**\n\nThe probability of measuring `P = 0` is the square of the absolute value of the inner product of the eigenvector `|p=0⟩` and the state `|ψ⟩`.\n*   `Prob(P=0) = |⟨p=0|ψ⟩|²`\n*   `⟨p=0|ψ⟩ = ( (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1] ) . ( (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T )`\n    `= (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1)`\n    `= (1/√12) * (-2) = -2 / (2√3) = -1/√3`\n*   `Prob(P=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`\n\n**5. Determine the state after measuring P = 0**\n\nAfter measuring P and obtaining the result 0, the system's state collapses to the corresponding normalized eigenvector.\n*   The new state `|ψ'⟩` is `|p=0⟩`:\n    ```\n    |ψ'⟩ = |p=0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T\n    ```\n\n**6. Find the eigenvector for Q = -1**\n\nThe operator Q is a diagonal matrix, so its eigenvalues are the diagonal entries (1, 0, -1) and its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\n*   The eigenvector `|q=-1⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue `Q = -1` is:\n    ```\n    |q=-1⟩ = [0, 0, 1]^T\n    ```\n    This vector is already normalized.\n\n**7. Calculate the probability of measuring Q = -1**\n\nNow, we measure Q on the new state `|ψ'⟩`. The probability of obtaining `Q = -1` is:\n*   `Prob(Q=-1 | after P=0) = |⟨q=-1|ψ'⟩|² = |⟨q=-1|p=0⟩|²`\n*   `⟨q=-1|p=0⟩ = ( [0, 0, 1] ) . ( (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T )`\n    `= (1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1))`\n    `= -1/√2`\n*   `Prob(Q=-1 | after P=0) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2`\n\n**8. Calculate the total probability**\n\nThe probability of measuring `P=0` and *then* `Q=-1` is the product of the probabilities calculated in steps 4 and 7.\n*   `Total Probability = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 | after P=0)`\n*   `Total Probability = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\nThe probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q is 1/6.\n\n<<<A>>>"
