    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds so they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, two key pieces of information are needed: the rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line and the atmospheric cutoff wavelength for ground-based observations.\n\n1.  **Lyman-alpha (Lyα) Wavelength (λ₀):** The Lyα spectral line is due to the electron transition in a neutral hydrogen atom from the n=2 to the n=1 energy level. This line has a rest wavelength of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å) (or 121.567 nm). This wavelength falls in the far-ultraviolet (FUV) part of the spectrum, which is blocked by the Earth's atmosphere.\n\n2.  **Atmospheric Cutoff Wavelength (λ_obs_min):** Ground-based telescopes are limited by the Earth's atmosphere, which absorbs most light below a certain wavelength. This \"cutoff\" is not perfectly sharp, but generally, atmospheric transmission becomes very low below about 3200-3500 Å. For a ground-based instrument to detect a spectral line, the line must have a wavelength longer than this cutoff.\n\n3.  **Redshift Calculation:** The cosmological redshift (z) stretches the wavelength of light. An object's observed wavelength (λ_obs) is related to its rest wavelength (λ₀) by the formula: λ_obs = λ₀ * (1 + z).\n\nTo find the minimum redshift (z_min) required for the Lyα line to be observable from the ground, we set the observed wavelength to the atmospheric cutoff limit. Using a conservative atmospheric cutoff of λ_obs_min ≈ 3500 Å:\n\nz_min = (λ_obs_min / λ₀) - 1\nz_min = (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\nz_min ≈ 2.88 - 1\nz_min ≈ 1.88\n\nThis calculation shows that a redshift of approximately 1.9 is required to shift the 1216 Å Lyα line into the observable optical window. Scientific literature confirms that direct ground-based observations of the Lyα transition are restricted to redshifts of z ≳ 1.7. Another source mentions that Lyα is accessible to optical ground-based telescopes in the redshift range of approximately 2 ≤ z ≤ 7.\n\nBased on this calculation and the supporting information, the value of 1.9 is the most accurate estimate among the given choices.\n\n<<<B>>>"
