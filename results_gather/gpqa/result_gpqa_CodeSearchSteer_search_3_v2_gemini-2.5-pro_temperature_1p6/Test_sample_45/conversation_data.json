    "The self-metathesis of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with a Grubbs catalyst is an olefin metathesis reaction. The reactant is a 50/50 mixture of two enantiomers: (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n\nIn a self-metathesis reaction of a terminal alkene (R-CH=CH₂), two molecules react to form a new internal alkene (R-CH=CH-R) and ethene (H₂C=CH₂). In this case, the 'R' group is a chiral sec-butyl group, -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃).\n\nSince the starting material is a racemic mixture of (S) and (R) enantiomers, three types of reactions can occur:\n1.  Reaction of two (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene molecules.\n2.  Reaction of two (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene molecules.\n3.  Reaction between one (S) and one (R) molecule (cross-metathesis).\n\nEach of these reactions produces 4,7-dimethyldec-5-ene, but with different stereochemistry. Additionally, the new double bond at the C5 position can have either E or Z geometry.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the possible products, excluding ethene:\n\n*   **(S) + (S) reaction:** This reaction produces (4S,7S)-4,7-dimethyldec-5-ene. Since a new double bond is formed, two stereoisomers are possible:\n    1.  (E)-(4S,7S)-4,7-dimethyldec-5-ene (chiral)\n    2.  (Z)-(4S,7S)-4,7-dimethyldec-5-ene (chiral)\n\n*   **(R) + (R) reaction:** This reaction produces (4R,7R)-4,7-dimethyldec-5-ene. These products are the enantiomers of the products from the (S)+(S) reaction.\n    3.  (E)-(4R,7R)-4,7-dimethyldec-5-ene (chiral)\n    4.  (Z)-(4R,7R)-4,7-dimethyldec-5-ene (chiral)\n\n*   **(S) + (R) reaction:** This \"cross-reaction\" produces (4S,7R)-4,7-dimethyldec-5-ene. We must examine the stereochemistry of the E and Z isomers.\n    5.  (E)-(4S,7R)-4,7-dimethyldec-5-ene: This molecule has a center of inversion, which makes it a meso compound (achiral despite having chiral centers). There is only one such product.\n    6.  (Z)-(4S,7R)-4,7-dimethyldec-5-ene: This molecule is chiral as it lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Its enantiomer, (Z)-(4R,7S), is not formed in this specific S+R cross-reaction. Therefore, this is a single, distinct product.\n\nIn total, adding up all the distinct products from the three possible reaction pathways gives a total of 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 possible products.\n\n<<<D>>>"
