    "In a synthetic organic chemistry lab, the phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is a common way to describe a purification problem, specifically referring to the results of a thin-layer chromatography (TLC) experiment.\n\nThis statement most closely aligns with option D, that the compounds have similar polarities.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation:\n*   **The Technique: Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC):** Chemists use TLC as a quick and inexpensive way to monitor the progress of a chemical reaction and to determine the purity of a substance. It involves spotting a small amount of the chemical mixture onto a plate coated with a stationary phase (commonly silica gel, which is very polar). The plate is then placed in a sealed chamber with a solvent, known as the mobile phase.\n*   **The Principle of Separation:** As the mobile phase moves up the plate via capillary action, it carries the compounds from the mixture with it. The separation occurs because compounds have different affinities for the polar stationary phase and the mobile phase.\n    *   **More polar compounds** interact more strongly with the polar silica gel, so they travel up the plate more slowly.\n    *   **Less polar compounds** interact less with the silica gel and are carried further up the plate by the mobile phase.\n*   **\"On Top of Each Other\":** After running the TLC, individual compounds appear as separate spots at different heights. If two compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel at nearly the same rate up the plate. This results in their spots being very close together or appearing as one overlapping spot. This is what the chemist means by the compounds being \"on top of each other.\"\n*   **The Problem:** The chemist's dismay (\"Not well\") comes from what this result implies. TLC is often used to figure out the right conditions for a larger-scale purification technique called column chromatography, which operates on the same principle. If the spots are on top of each other on the TLC plate, it signifies that separating the compounds on a larger scale will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, with that solvent system.\n\n**Why the other options are incorrect:**\n*   **A) Non-covalent/van der Waals interactions:** While these forces are the underlying physical reason for polarity and interactions with the chromatography phases, the direct and operational problem the chemist is observing is the *similarity in polarity* leading to no separation.\n*   **B) Similar boiling points:** This would be a problem for separation by distillation, not chromatography. The language used doesn't fit the context of distillation.\n*   **C) Similar optical rotations:** Optical rotation is a physical property of chiral molecules and is not a basis for separation in standard chromatography. Compounds with different polarities can have similar or zero optical rotation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
