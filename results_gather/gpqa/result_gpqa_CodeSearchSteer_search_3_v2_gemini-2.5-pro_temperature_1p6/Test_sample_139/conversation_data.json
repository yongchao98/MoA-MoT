    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B:** The melting point of substance B is stated to be very close to 277 K (which is 3.85 °C). This is a strong indicator for heavy water (D₂O), which has a melting point of 3.82 °C (276.97 K). Standard water (H₂O) melts at 0 °C (273.15 K), which is not as close. This suggests that the \"heavier isotope\" mentioned in the first clue is deuterium (D).\n\n2.  **Identify Gas W:** The gas W, released during the reaction, has molecules containing an equal number of neutrons and protons. If the reaction involves deuterium, a likely gaseous product is deuterium gas (D₂). A D₂ molecule consists of two deuterium atoms, each having 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, the D₂ molecule has a total of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description.\n\n3.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   Substance X contains a heavier isotope, which we've deduced to be deuterium.\n    *   It's a reagent in organic chemistry, with a close analog. This points towards common hydride reducing agents, like lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) and sodium borohydride (NaBH₄). The deuterated versions would be lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄) and sodium borodeuteride (NaBD₄).\n    *   X reacts violently with liquid Y, which we can now presume is heavy water (D₂O), to produce a precipitate G and D₂ gas.\n    *   Let's test the candidates:\n        *   **Reaction with LiAlD₄:** LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD(aq) + Al(OD)₃(s) + 4D₂(g). This reaction produces aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is the deuterated form of aluminum hydroxide, a known precipitate (G). It also produces D₂ gas (W).\n        *   **Reaction with NaBD₄:** NaBD₄ + 2D₂O → NaBO₂(aq) + 4D₂(g). This reaction produces sodium metaborate, which is soluble in water, so no precipitate (G) would form.\n    *   Therefore, the formation of a precipitate strongly indicates that **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n4.  **Confirming Clues:**\n    *   **Heating G:** Heating the precipitate G, Al(OD)₃, would cause decomposition: 2Al(OD)₃(s) → Al₂O₃(s) + 3D₂O(g). This releases substance B (D₂O), consistent with our initial finding.\n    *   **Keto Acid Reaction:** The problem states the reaction product of a keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid (e.g., R-CO-R'-COOH) has at least three oxygen atoms. LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent that reduces both the ketone group (C=O) and the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to hydroxyl groups (-OH). This reduction results in a diol (e.g., R-CH(OH)-R'-CH₂(OH)), which contains exactly two oxygen atoms. This clue further confirms X is LiAlD₄.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Cumulative Atomic Masses:**\n    *   Substance X is **LiAlD₄**.\n    *   The elements present in the molecule are Hydrogen (H, Z=1), Lithium (Li, Z=3), and Aluminium (Al, Z=13).\n    *   The **lightest element** by atomic number (Z) is Hydrogen.\n    *   The **heaviest element** by atomic number (Z) is Aluminium.\n    *   The problem requires summing the atomic masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule. We will use integer masses (mass numbers) for the isotopes.\n    *   **Mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen):** The molecule contains 4 atoms of Hydrogen, all as the isotope Deuterium (D or ²H), which has a mass number of 2.\n        *   Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass of the heaviest element (Aluminium):** The molecule contains 1 atom of Aluminium. The common, stable isotope is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27.\n        *   Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:** Sum = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<A>>>"
