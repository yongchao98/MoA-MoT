    "To determine the number of revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron, one must calculate the total energy gained and divide it by the energy gained per revolution. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Total Energy Gain**: The proton begins with negligible kinetic energy and reaches a final kinetic energy of T₁ = 950 MeV. Therefore, the total energy that must be imparted to the proton is 950 MeV.\n\n2.  **Energy Gain per Revolution**: In a synchrocyclotron, a charged particle is accelerated twice during each full turn as it crosses the gap between the two D-shaped electrodes. The energy gained at each crossing is given by the charge of the particle multiplied by the instantaneous voltage. The voltage is given as `U(t) = U₀cos[2πν(α)t + Φ₀]`.\n\n3.  **Synchronous Phase**: For stable acceleration in a synchrocyclotron, particles are accelerated at a specific \"synchronous phase,\" which is given as `Φ₀ = π/4`. The energy gain for each of the two accelerations per revolution is `ΔE = e * U₀ * cos(Φ₀)`.\n\n4.  **Calculation of Energy Gain per Revolution**:\n    *   The peak voltage is `U₀ = 190 kV = 0.190 MV`.\n    *   The charge of the proton is `e`.\n    *   The energy gain per acceleration event, in units of mega-electron-volts (MeV), is `ΔE = 0.190 * cos(π/4) MeV`.\n    *   Since `cos(π/4) = √2 / 2`, the energy gain per crossing is `0.190 * (√2 / 2) MeV`.\n    *   The total energy gained in one full revolution (two crossings) is `ΔE_rev = 2 * 0.190 * (√2 / 2) MeV = 0.190 * √2 MeV`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Number of Revolutions**: The total number of revolutions (N) is the total required energy divided by the energy gained per revolution:\n    `N = Total Energy / Energy per Revolution`\n    `N = 950 MeV / (0.190 * √2 MeV)`\n    `N = 5000 / √2`\n    `N = 2500 * √2`\n    `N ≈ 2500 * 1.4142`\n    `N ≈ 3535.5`\n\n6.  **Final Determination**: Since the proton must complete whole revolutions, we check the energy level at 3535 and 3536 revolutions.\n    *   After 3535 revolutions, the energy gained is `3535 * (0.190 * √2) MeV ≈ 949.85 MeV`, which is just short of the 950 MeV target.\n    *   To reach or exceed 950 MeV, the proton must undergo further acceleration. After completing 3536 revolutions, its energy will be `3536 * (0.190 * √2) MeV ≈ 950.12 MeV`.\n\nTherefore, the proton must make 3536 revolutions to achieve the final kinetic energy of 950 MeV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
