    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at the two specified points in the titration.\n\n### 1. Initial State and Dilution\n\nFirst, we determine the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution.\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid (HA):**\n    `Molarity × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.020 L = 0.001 mol`\n*   **New volume after adding water:**\n    `20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.040 L`\n*   **New concentration of acetic acid:**\n    `Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.040 L = 0.025 M`\n\n### 2. Equivalence Point Volume\n\nNext, we calculate the volume of 0.1 M NaOH required to reach the equivalence point, where the moles of acid equal the moles of base.\n*   **Moles of acid (from step 1):** 0.001 mol\n*   **Volume of NaOH (Vb):**\n    `(Moles of acid) / (Molarity of base) = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³`\n\n### 3. pH at 25% Titration\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the initial acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, forming its conjugate base, acetate (A⁻). This creates a buffer solution.\n*   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: `pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])`\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    `pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733`\n*   At this point, 25% of the acid is now the conjugate base ([A⁻]), and 75% of the acid ([HA]) remains. The ratio `[A⁻]/[HA]` is `25 / 75 = 1/3`.\n*   Now, calculate the pH:\n    `pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256`\n*   The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n### 4. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to 0.001 moles of acetate (A⁻). The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water, making the solution basic.\n*   **Total volume:** `40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L`\n*   **Concentration of acetate ([A⁻]):** `0.001 mol / 0.050 L = 0.02 M`\n*   The hydrolysis reaction is: `CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻`.\n*   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate, which is calculated from Ka and Kw (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C):\n    `Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰`\n*   Now we calculate the concentration of hydroxide ions, [OH⁻], produced by hydrolysis:\n    `[OH⁻] = √(Kb × [A⁻]) = √(5.41 × 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ √(1.082 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 × 10⁻⁶ M`\n*   Calculate the pOH:\n    `pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.29 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48`\n*   Finally, calculate the pH:\n    `pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52`\n*   The pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nBased on these calculations, the pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\n<<<C>>>"
