    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct ¹H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Compound's Description**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents attached.\n    *   **8 carbon atoms in total:** The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, so the two substituents together must contain 2 carbons.\n    *   **Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents contains a carbonyl functional group.\n    *   **Aromatic-halogen bond:** The other substituent is a halogen (e.g., Cl, Br, I) bonded directly to the aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the Molecular Structure**\n    *   Based on the requirements, we need two substituents on a benzene ring that have a combined total of 2 carbons and include a carbonyl group and a halogen.\n    *   The most plausible structure is **halo-acetophenone**. This consists of a halogen (X) and an acetyl group (-COCH₃) attached to the benzene ring.\n    *   This structure fulfills all criteria:\n        *   It is a di-substituted benzene ring.\n        *   It has 8 carbon atoms (6 in the ring + 2 in the acetyl group).\n        *   It contains a carbonyl group (in the acetyl substituent).\n        *   It has an aromatic-halogen bond.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Substitution Pattern and Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   The ¹H NMR options A and B both show a pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region (around 7-8 ppm), each with an integration of 2H. This is a hallmark of a **para (1,4) substitution pattern** on a benzene ring. In a para-disubstituted ring, symmetry results in only two unique types of aromatic protons, each having only one neighboring proton, thus appearing as doublets.\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the NMR Data Options**\n\n    *   **A) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at **9.9 ppm** is highly characteristic of an **aldehyde proton** (-CHO).\n        *   A structure with 8 carbons that fits this would be *p*-halophenylacetaldehyde (X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO). However, in this structure, the aldehyde proton (-CHO) would be coupled to the adjacent methylene protons (-CH₂-), resulting in a **triplet**, not a singlet. Similarly, the methylene protons would be split into a doublet by the aldehyde proton. Since the data shows two singlets, this option is inconsistent with the expected splitting patterns.\n\n    *   **B) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   The two doublets at **7.8 ppm** and **7.6 ppm** correspond to the para-substituted aromatic ring. Electron-withdrawing groups like the acetyl group cause downfield shifts for nearby protons.\n        *   The signal at **2.3 ppm** as a singlet integrating to 3H is a classic signal for a **methyl group attached to a carbonyl** (an acetyl group, -COCH₃). The chemical shift for acetophenone's methyl group is around 2.6 ppm. The presence of a halogen in the para position would slightly alter this, and 2.3 ppm is a very reasonable value.\n        *   This data set perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n    *   **C) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   The signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are not in the typical aromatic proton region (usually 6.5-8.5 ppm). This option can be dismissed.\n\n    *   **D) ¹H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   Similar to option C, the shifts at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are incorrect for aromatic protons. This option can be dismissed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe ¹H NMR data in option B is fully consistent with the structure of a *para*-haloacetophenone, which meets all the conditions described in the problem statement. The aromatic signals indicate para-substitution, and the singlet at 2.3 ppm is characteristic of an acetyl methyl group.\n\n<<<B>>>"
