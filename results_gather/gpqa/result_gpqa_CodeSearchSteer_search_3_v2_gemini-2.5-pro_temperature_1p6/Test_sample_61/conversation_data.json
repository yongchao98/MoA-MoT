    "This problem requires identifying the correct sequence of chemical reactions to transform ethynylcyclohexane into 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let's analyze the starting material and the final product to deduce the necessary transformations.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane, which has a cyclohexyl group attached to a terminal alkyne (C-C triple bond). Its structure is C₆H₁₁-C≡CH.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. To understand this structure, let's break down the IUPAC name:\n    *   The parent molecule is `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde`. This is a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached.\n    *   The prefix `1-` indicates that a substituent is attached to carbon-1 of the cyclohexane ring (the same carbon that bears the aldehyde group).\n    *   The substituent is `(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)`. This is a methyl group (-CH<) that is also bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH) and another cyclohexyl group (C₆H₁₁).\n    *   Putting it all together, the final product is the result of the **aldol self-condensation** of two molecules of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (C₆H₁₁CHO). In this reaction, one molecule acts as a nucleophile (forming an enolate at its α-carbon) and the other as an electrophile.\n\nThe overall strategy must therefore be:\n1.  Convert the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, into the key intermediate, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n2.  Induce the self-condensation (aldol addition) of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the final product.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options based on this strategy.\n\n### Analysis of the Reaction Sequences\n\n**A) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n1.  Alkylation of the terminal alkyne with ethyl chloride gives 1-cyclohexylbut-1-yne (C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₂CH₃).\n2.  Reduction of the alkyne with lithium in liquid ammonia produces the *trans*-alkene, (E)-1-cyclohexylbut-1-ene.\n3.  Ozonolysis with an oxidative workup (H₂O) cleaves the double bond to form carboxylic acids: cyclohexanecarboxylic acid (C₆H₁₁COOH) and propanoic acid. This sequence does not produce the required aldehyde intermediate.\n\n**B) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)₂; 3. H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**\n1.  Alkylation with methyl chloride gives 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne (C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₃).\n2.  Catalytic hydrogenation with H₂/Pd would reduce the alkyne completely to an alkane (propylcyclohexane). This leads to a dead end. Furthermore, the numbering and ordering of subsequent steps are illogical.\n\n**C) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/(CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n1.  **Alkylation:** Ethynylcyclohexane is deprotonated by the strong base sodium amide (NaNH₂) to form a sodium acetylide. This nucleophile then reacts with methyl chloride to give 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne (C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₃).\n2.  **Partial Reduction:** The alkyne is treated with H₂ over Lindlar's catalyst (Pd on CaCO₃, poisoned with lead acetate and quinoline). This is a standard method for the stereoselective reduction of an alkyne to a *cis* or (Z)-alkene, yielding (Z)-1-cyclohexylprop-1-ene (C₆H₁₁-CH=CH-CH₃).\n3.  **Ozonolysis:** The alkene is subjected to ozonolysis (O₃) followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide ((CH₃)₂S). This reaction cleaves the double bond and yields two carbonyl compounds. The cyclohexyl-substituted carbon gives **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** (C₆H₁₁-CHO), and the other fragment gives acetaldehyde (CH₃CHO). This step successfully produces our key intermediate.\n4.  **Aldol Condensation:** Barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂) is a strong base that will catalyze an aldol reaction between the aldehydes formed in the previous step. Although a mixture of products is possible (crossed-aldol and self-condensation), this sequence provides the necessary reagents to produce cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and then catalyze its self-condensation to form the target molecule. This is the only plausible route among the choices.\n\n**D) 1. NaNH₂, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/(CH₃)₂S; 4. NH₄OH**\n1.  The acetylide formed by NaNH₂ would be immediately protonated by methanol (an alcohol, which is a much stronger acid than the alkyne), regenerating ethynylcyclohexane. This first step is unproductive.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, sequence C is the only one that correctly outlines a valid synthetic route. It first transforms ethynylcyclohexane into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde via alkylation, partial hydrogenation, and ozonolysis. Then, it uses a base to catalyze the aldol condensation of the aldehyde intermediate to form the final α-hydroxy aldehyde product.\n\n<<<C>>>"
