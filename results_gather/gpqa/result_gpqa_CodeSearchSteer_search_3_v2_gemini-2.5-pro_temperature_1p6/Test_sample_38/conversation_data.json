    "The problem requires finding the value of the constant \"a\" by normalizing the given wave function over the specified interval.\n\n**1. Understand the Wave Function and Probability Density**\n\n*   The wave function for each particle is given as Ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i.\n*   In quantum mechanics, the probability of finding a particle at a certain position is given by the square of the modulus of the wave function, which is called the probability density function, P(x) = |Ψ(x)|².\n*   To find the modulus squared of a complex number of the form (Re + i\\*Im), we calculate Re² + Im².\n    *   Real part, Re = a / sqrt(1 + x)\n    *   Imaginary part, Im = -0.5\n*   Therefore, the probability density is:\n    |Ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n**2. Apply the Normalization Condition**\n\n*   A fundamental principle of quantum mechanics is that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere in the space where it can exist must be 1. This is known as the normalization condition.\n*   The problem states that the particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. This means we must integrate the probability density function from 1 to 3, and the result must be equal to 1.\n    ∫[from 1 to 3] |Ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n    ∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\n**3. Solve the Integral**\n\n*   We need to solve the definite integral:\n    ∫(a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫(0.25) dx\n*   The integral of a²/(1+x) with respect to x is a² * ln(1 + x).\n*   The integral of 0.25 with respect to x is 0.25x.\n*   So, we evaluate [a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25x] from 1 to 3.\n\n**4. Calculate the Numerical Value**\n\n*   First, evaluate at the upper limit (x=3):\n    a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3 = a² * ln(4) + 0.75\n*   Next, evaluate at the lower limit (x=1):\n    a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1 = a² * ln(2) + 0.25\n*   Subtract the lower limit result from the upper limit result:\n    (a² * ln(4) + 0.75) - (a² * ln(2) + 0.25) = 1\n*   Simplify the equation:\n    a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5 = 1\n    a² * ln(4/2) = 0.5\n    a² * ln(2) = 0.5\n*   Now, solve for 'a':\n    a² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n    Using the value ln(2) ≈ 0.693:\n    a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693 ≈ 0.7215\n    a ≈ sqrt(0.7215) ≈ 0.8494\n*   This value is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<A>>>"
