    "This problem describes the phenomenon of Larmor precession. Initially, the spin is in an eigenstate of the Sz operator. When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the Hamiltonian changes. The spin is no longer in an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, `H = -μ · B = -γB * Sy`, and it starts to evolve in time.\n\nThe spin vector begins to precess around the new magnetic field axis (the Y-axis). The frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency. The expectation values of the spin components perpendicular to the new field (`<Sx>` and `<Sz>`) will oscillate at this frequency.\n\nThe Larmor frequency (`ω`) is given by the formula: `ω = γB`.\n\nHere:\n*   `γ` (gamma) is the gyromagnetic ratio, a constant that relates the magnetic moment to the angular momentum of the particle.\n*   `B` is the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\nThe z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μz(t)>`, is directly proportional to the z-component of the spin, `<Sz(t)>` (since `μ = γS`). Therefore, `<μz(t)>` will oscillate at the same frequency as `<Sz(t)>`. Based on the principle of Larmor precession, this oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\nA detailed quantum mechanical calculation confirms this result:\n1.  **Initial State** (at t=0): The spin is aligned with the +Z direction, so the state is `|ψ(0)> = |↑z>`.\n2.  **Hamiltonian** (for t>0): The magnetic field is `B` in the +Y direction. The Hamiltonian is `H = -γB * Sy`.\n3.  **Time Evolution**: The state at time `t` is `|ψ(t)> = exp(-iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)> = exp(iγBt*Sy/ħ)|↑z>`.\n4.  **Expectation Value**: The average of the z-component of the spin is `<Sz(t)> = <ψ(t)|Sz|ψ(t)>`.\n5.  **Calculation**: Evaluating this expression shows that `<Sz(t)>` is proportional to `cos(γBt)`.\n6.  **Frequency**: The angular frequency of the cosine function is the coefficient of `t`, which is `γB`.\n\nThus, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is `γB`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
