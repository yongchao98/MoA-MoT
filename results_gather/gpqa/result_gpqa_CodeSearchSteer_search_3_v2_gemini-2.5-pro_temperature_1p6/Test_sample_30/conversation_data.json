    "To determine the molecular symmetry group of product 3, we must first correctly identify the products of the three sequential reactions.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n1.  **Reaction 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.**\n    This reaction is the nitration of toluene. The methyl group (-CH₃) is an ortho-, para-directing group. The reaction yields a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. Typically, the para isomer is the major product due to less steric hindrance. Thus, **Product 1** is p-nitrotoluene.\n\n2.  **Reaction 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄, forming product 2.**\n    This step involves the oxidation of p-nitrotoluene. While strong oxidizing agents like KMnO₄ or K₂Cr₂O₇ would oxidize the methyl group to a carboxylic acid, the use of MnO₂ under these conditions is known to oxidize activated methyl groups, such as the one on toluene, to an aldehyde. Therefore, the methyl group of p-nitrotoluene is oxidized to a formyl group (-CHO). This interpretation is strongly supported by the nature of the subsequent reaction. Thus, **Product 2** is p-nitrobenzaldehyde.\n\n3.  **Reaction 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\n    This reaction is a base-catalyzed crossed aldol condensation, specifically a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, between p-nitrobenzaldehyde (an aldehyde with no α-hydrogens) and acetone (a ketone with α-hydrogens). The sodium hydroxide acts as a base to deprotonate acetone, forming an enolate. The enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde. The resulting aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone. The major product formed is the more stable E-isomer. Thus, **Product 3** is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n### Molecular Symmetry of Product 3\n\nThe structure of Product 3 is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. Let's analyze its symmetry elements:\n\n*   The molecule has a conjugated system consisting of the p-nitrophenyl group, the C=C double bond, and the carbonyl group. This entire system tends to be planar to maximize orbital overlap.\n*   Let's assume the molecule is planar. This plane of the molecule would be a plane of symmetry (σ). All the heavy atoms (C, N, O) and the vinylic hydrogens lie within this plane. The methyl hydrogens can be oriented such that one is in the plane and the other two are reflected across it.\n*   **Identity (E):** All molecules have this element.\n*   **Proper Axis of Rotation (Cₙ):** There is no C₂ axis or any other rotational axis (for n>1). For example, rotating the molecule 180° around an axis perpendicular to the molecular plane does not result in an identical structure.\n*   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not possess a center of inversion. For instance, the nitro group on one end is not matched by a similar group at an inverted position on the other end.\n*   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** As discussed, the plane containing the main carbon and nitrogen framework of the molecule is a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Improper Axis of Rotation (Sₙ):** Since there is no Cₙ (n>1), there cannot be an Sₙ.\n\nA molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of product 3, (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one, is Cₛ.\n\n<<<B>>>"
