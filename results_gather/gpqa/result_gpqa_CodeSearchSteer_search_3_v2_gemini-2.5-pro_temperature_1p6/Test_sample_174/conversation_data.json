    "An oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with the symmetry axis along the z-axis can be approximated as an oscillating electric dipole, especially when its size is much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation. The behavior of such a dipole provides the framework for determining the characteristics of its radiated power.\n\nThe power radiated per unit solid angle by an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis is proportional to the square of the sine of the angle θ, measured from the z-axis. This relationship is expressed as:\n\ndP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)\n\nThis formula shows that the radiated power is zero along the axis of oscillation (θ = 0°) and at its maximum in the plane perpendicular to the axis (θ = 90°). This maximum power is denoted as 'A'.\n\nTo find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle of 30°, we can set up a ratio:\n\n(Power at 30°) / (Maximum Power A) = sin²(30°) / sin²(90°)\n\nSince sin(30°) = 1/2 and sin(90°) = 1, the calculation is as follows:\n\n(1/2)² / 1² = 1/4\n\nTherefore, the power radiated at an angle of 30° is 1/4 of the maximum power A.\n\nThe dependency of the radiated power on the wavelength (λ) for dipole radiation is another key aspect. The total power radiated is proportional to the fourth power of the oscillation frequency (ω⁴). Since the frequency is inversely proportional to the wavelength (ω = 2πc/λ), the radiated power is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength (λ⁻⁴). This is a characteristic feature of electric dipole radiation, often associated with phenomena like Rayleigh scattering, which explains why the sky appears blue.\n\nCombining these two findings:\n*   The fraction of the maximum power (A) radiated at 30° is 1/4.\n*   The radiated power's dependence on wavelength (λ) follows the form λ⁻⁴.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
