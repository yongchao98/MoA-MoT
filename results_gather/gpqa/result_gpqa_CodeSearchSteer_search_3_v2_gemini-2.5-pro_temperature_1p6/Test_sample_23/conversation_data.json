    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the chemistry problem:\n\n### 1. Identify Substance Z\nThe problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. It is formed by the hydrogenation of other substances and does not react further with hydrogen, indicating it is a saturated hydrocarbon.\n\n-   The general formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon (alkane) is CnH2n+2.\n-   The general formula for a saturated cyclic hydrocarbon (cycloalkane) is CnH2n.\n\nLet's test the cycloalkane formula (CnH2n) against the given mass fraction. Using atomic masses C ≈ 12 g/mol and H ≈ 1 g/mol:\n*Mass % of H = (Total mass of H / Molar mass of compound) x 100*\n*Mass % of H = (2n / (12n + 2n)) x 100 = (2n / 14n) x 100 = (1/7) x 100 ≈ 14.28%*\n\nThis percentage perfectly matches the given value. More precise calculations using atomic weights C=12.011 and H=1.008 also yield a result very close to this (~14.3%). Therefore, substance Z is a cycloalkane.\n\nThe problem also mentions that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C6H12)**. All subsequent information in the problem is consistent with this identification. Since hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives *only* cyclohexane, all compounds in these mixtures must have a C6 ring skeleton.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Reaction and Mixture Y\nMixture X, when heated with platinum, undergoes disproportionation to form mixture Y.\n-   **Disproportionation** is a reaction where a substance is simultaneously oxidized (loses hydrogen) and reduced (gains hydrogen).\n-   **Mixture Y** is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning both components are saturated.\n-   Substance Z (**cyclohexane, C6H12**) is one of the components of Y.\n\nA classic example of this type of reaction is the catalytic disproportionation of unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons. An H-donor molecule gives up hydrogen and becomes more unsaturated (often aromatic), while an H-acceptor molecule gains hydrogen and becomes saturated.\n\nGiven that one product is cyclohexane (C6H12), the other product must be the result of oxidation (hydrogen loss). The most stable C6 hydrocarbon with fewer hydrogens is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n-   Mixture Y is therefore an equimolar mixture of **benzene (C6H6)** and **cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n-   This mixture does not decolorize bromine water: cyclohexane is saturated, and benzene only reacts with bromine in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, not with bromine water.\n-   Hydrogenation of mixture Y (benzene + cyclohexane) under severe conditions would convert benzene to cyclohexane, resulting in only cyclohexane, which aligns with the problem statement.\n\n### 3. Deduce the Components of Mixture X\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two unsaturated liquids (A and B) that, upon reaction, form an equimolar mixture of benzene and cyclohexane.\n*A + B → C6H6 + C6H12*\n\nThis reaction is a hydrogen transfer between molecules A and B. To maintain the atom balance for this 1:1 reaction:\n-   **Carbon Balance**: Both A and B must have a C6 skeleton.\n-   **Hydrogen Balance**: The total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of A and one molecule of B must equal the total hydrogens in the products.\n    *Total H = (H in benzene) + (H in cyclohexane) = 6 + 12 = 18 atoms.*\n\nSo, we are looking for two non-conjugated, unsaturated C6 cyclic molecules (let's call them C6Hy and C6Hv) where the sum of their hydrogen atoms is 18 (y + v = 18).\n\nThe most common unsaturated C6 cyclic compounds are:\n-   **Cyclohexene (C6H10)**: One double bond. (Number of H = 10)\n-   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**: Two non-conjugated double bonds. (Number of H = 8). Note that 1,3-cyclohexadiene is conjugated and is thus excluded by the problem statement.\n\nLet's check if these two compounds fit the criteria:\n-   **Mixture X**: Equimolar mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n-   **Decolorizes bromine water?** Yes, both have double bonds.\n-   **No conjugated bonds?** Correct.\n-   **Total hydrogens?** 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our required hydrogen balance.\n-   **Reaction**: 1,4-cyclohexadiene can act as a hydrogen donor (forming benzene) and cyclohexene can act as a hydrogen acceptor (forming cyclohexane). This is a known catalytic disproportionation.\n    *C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C6H10 (cyclohexene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane)*\n-   **Hydrogenation of X**: Hydrogenating both cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene produces only cyclohexane.\n\nAll conditions of the problem are satisfied by this model.\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This corresponds to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n\n-   Hydrogen atoms in cyclohexene (C6H10): 10\n-   Hydrogen atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8): 8\n\nTotal number of hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
