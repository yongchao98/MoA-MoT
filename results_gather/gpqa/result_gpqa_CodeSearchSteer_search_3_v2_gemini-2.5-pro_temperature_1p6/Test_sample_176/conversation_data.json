    "The luminosity of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\n\nL = 4πR²σT⁴\n\nWhere:\n*   L is the luminosity\n*   R is the star's radius\n*   σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (a universal physical constant)\n*   T is the surface temperature of the star\n\nTo find the ratio of the luminosities of Star\\_1 (L₁) and Star\\_2 (L₂), we can set up the following equation:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n\nThe constants (4, π, σ) cancel out, simplifying the equation to:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n1.  The radius of Star\\_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star\\_2: R₁ = 1.5 * R₂, which means R₁/R₂ = 1.5.\n2.  The wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. According to Wien's Displacement Law, the peak emission wavelength (λ_max) of a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature (T): λ_max = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's constant. Since λ_max is the same for both stars, their surface temperatures must also be the same (T₁ = T₂). This means the ratio T₁/T₂ = 1.\n\nThe information about the stars' masses and radial velocities is not needed to solve this problem.\n\nNow, we substitute the known ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (1)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * 1\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25\n\nTherefore, the luminosity of Star\\_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star\\_2 by a factor of 2.25.\n\n<<<A>>>"
