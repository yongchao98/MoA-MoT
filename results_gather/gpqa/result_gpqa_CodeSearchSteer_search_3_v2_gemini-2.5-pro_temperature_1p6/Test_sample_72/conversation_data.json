    "Here is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n### 1. Calculation of the Relative Speed (v_rel)\n\nTo find the relative speed of the two astronauts, we use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula. Since both astronauts are moving in the same positive x-direction, the formula for their relative speed (v_rel) as observed from one astronaut to the other is:\n\nv_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)\n\nGiven:\n*   Velocity of the first astronaut, v₁ = 0.6c\n*   Velocity of the second astronaut, v₂ = 0.5c\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3c² / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\nv_rel ≈ 0.1428c\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Total Energy (E)\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the formula E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies of the two astronauts (E = E₁ + E₂).\n\n**For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):**\n\n*   Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ₁):\n    γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)² / c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n*   Calculate the energy (E₁):\n    E₁ = γ₁ * (2m) * c² = 1.25 * 2mc² = 2.5 mc²\n\n**For the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):**\n\n*   Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ₂):\n    γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)² / c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √(0.75) ≈ 1.1547\n*   Calculate the energy (E₂):\n    E₂ = γ₂ * (3m) * c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3mc² ≈ 3.464 mc²\n\n**Total System Energy (E):**\n\n*   E = E₁ + E₂ = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc² = 5.964 mc²\n\nSo, the total energy of the system is approximately **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated values are v_rel ≈ 0.14c and E ≈ 5.96 mc². These results correspond to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
