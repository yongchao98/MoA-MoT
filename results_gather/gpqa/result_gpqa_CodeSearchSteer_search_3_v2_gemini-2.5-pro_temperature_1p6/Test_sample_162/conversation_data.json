    "To solve this problem, we must first calculate the amount of strong acid needed to dissolve the iron(III) hydroxide and then determine the pH of the resulting solution.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the volume of acid needed\n\nThe reaction between iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, and a strong monobasic acid (which provides H⁺ ions) is a neutralization reaction:\n\n**Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)**\n\nThis equation shows that 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺ ions.\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is approximately 106.87 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = mass / molar mass\n    *   Moles = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 moles\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles of H⁺ required:**\n    *   From the stoichiometry, we need 3 moles of H⁺ for every mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ = 3 × 0.0009357 moles ≈ 0.002807 moles\n\n3.  **Calculate the volume of the 0.1 M acid:**\n    *   The acid has a concentration of 0.1 moles per liter (mol/L).\n    *   Volume (L) = moles / concentration\n    *   Volume = 0.002807 moles / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L\n    *   To convert this to cm³, we multiply by 1000.\n    *   Volume (cm³) = 0.02807 L × 1000 cm³/L = **28.07 cm³**\n\nThis calculated volume is very close to the 28.05 cm³ listed in option C.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the pH of the resulting solution\n\nAfter the Fe(OH)₃ is dissolved, the resulting 100 cm³ solution contains the dissolved Fe³⁺ ions. These ions hydrolyze in water, acting as a weak acid and releasing H⁺ ions, which lowers the pH.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is:\n**Fe³⁺(aq) + 2H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H₃O⁺(aq)**\n\n1.  **Calculate the concentration of Fe³⁺:**\n    *   The moles of Fe³⁺ are equal to the moles of Fe(OH)₃ that were dissolved (0.0009357 moles).\n    *   The total volume of the solution is 100 cm³ or 0.1 L.\n    *   [Fe³⁺] = moles / volume = 0.0009357 moles / 0.1 L ≈ 0.009357 M\n\n2.  **Calculate the H⁺ concentration and pH:**\n    *   The equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis is given by the acid dissociation constant, Ka.\n    *   The first hydrolysis constant (Ka1) for Fe³⁺ (aq) is often cited. Different sources give slightly different values, with log(Ka) being around -2.19 and Ka being 6.0 x 10⁻³. Using Ka = 6.0 x 10⁻³:\n    *   Ka = [Fe(OH)²⁺][H₃O⁺] / [Fe³⁺]\n    *   Let 'x' be the concentration of [H₃O⁺] at equilibrium.\n    *   Ka = (x)(x) / (0.009357 - x) = 6.0 x 10⁻³\n    *   This gives the quadratic equation: x² + (6.0 x 10⁻³)x - (5.614 x 10⁻⁵) = 0\n    *   Solving the quadratic formula for x gives:\n        x = [ -b ± √(b² - 4ac) ] / 2a\n        x ≈ 0.00508 M\n\n3.  **Calculate the final pH:**\n    *   [H₃O⁺] = x ≈ 0.00508 M\n    *   pH = -log[H₃O⁺] = -log(0.00508) ≈ 2.29\n\nThis pH value is close to the 2.04 given in option C. The discrepancy between the calculated pH (2.29) and the option's pH (2.04) can be attributed to the specific Ka value used for the hydrolysis of the Fe³⁺ ion, as this value can vary in literature. However, the calculated volume of acid (28.07 cm³) strongly matches option C's volume (28.05 cm³), and the calculated pH is in the same acidic range.\n\nTherefore, the combination of the calculated volume and the resulting pH points to option C as the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
