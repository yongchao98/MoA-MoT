    "### The expectation value of the operator is approximately -0.7.\n\nTo determine the expectation value of the given operator, one must employ the principles of quantum mechanics. The expectation value of an operator represents the average value of a measurement of a physical observable.\n\n**1. Defining the Quantum State and Operator:**\n\nThe spin-half particle is in the state `|ψ⟩`, which is a linear superposition of the spin-up `|↑⟩` and spin-down `|↓⟩` states:\n`|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩`\n\nThe operator for which the expectation value is to be calculated is:\n`O = 10σz + 5σx`\n\nHere, `σz` and `σx` are the Pauli matrices, which represent the spin observables in the z and x directions, respectively.\n\n**2. Calculating the Expectation Value:**\n\nThe expectation value of the operator `O`, denoted as `⟨O⟩`, for the state `|ψ⟩` is given by the formula `⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩`. Due to the linearity of the operator, this can be calculated as:\n`⟨O⟩ = ⟨ψ|(10σz + 5σx)|ψ⟩ = 10⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩ + 5⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩`\n\nThis breaks down the problem into finding the individual expectation values of `σz` and `σx` and then combining them.\n\n*   **Expectation value of σz:**\n    The expectation value of `σz` is calculated as `⟨σz⟩ = |a|² - |b|²`, where `a` and `b` are the coefficients of `|↑⟩` and `|↓⟩` respectively.\n    Given `a = 0.5` and `b = √3 / 2`:\n    `⟨σz⟩ = (0.5)² - (√3/2)² = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5`\n\n*   **Expectation value of σx:**\n    The expectation value of `σx` is calculated as `⟨σx⟩ = 2 * Re(a*b)`, where `a` and `b` are again the coefficients of the spin states. Since both coefficients are real numbers, this simplifies to `2ab`.\n    `⟨σx⟩ = 2 * (0.5) * (√3 / 2) = √3 / 2`\n    Using the approximation `√3 ≈ 1.732`, we get:\n    `⟨σx⟩ ≈ 1.732 / 2 = 0.866`\n\n**3. Final Calculation:**\n\nNow, substitute the individual expectation values back into the combined formula:\n`⟨O⟩ = 10 * ⟨σz⟩ + 5 * ⟨σx⟩`\n`⟨O⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3 / 2)`\n`⟨O⟩ = -5 + 2.5 * √3`\n\nUsing `√3 ≈ 1.732`:\n`⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732`\n`⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33`\n`⟨O⟩ ≈ -0.67`\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is -0.7.\n\n<<<B>>>"
