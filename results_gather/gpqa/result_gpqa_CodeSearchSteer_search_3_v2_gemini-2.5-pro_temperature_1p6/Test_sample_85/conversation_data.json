    "To determine the correct starting materials, a proper understanding of the selectivity of the reducing agents LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) and BH₃ (borane) is crucial.\n\n### Analysis of the Reactions\n\nThe general starting material is a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid, specifically an acid-ester with the structure 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule has two functional groups that can be reduced: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) at one end and an isobutyl ester (-CO-O-isobutyl) at the other. It also possesses a chiral center at the third carbon (C3), which is the location of the ethyl group. The reactions do not alter this chiral center, meaning the stereochemistry (R or S) of the starting material will be retained in the product.\n\nThe product in both reactions is a δ-lactone (a six-membered cyclic ester), 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The chiral C3 of the starting material becomes the chiral C4 of the lactone product.\n\n**Reaction A: Reduction with LiBH₄**\n\n*   **A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\nLithium borohydride is known to selectively reduce esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. Therefore, LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), while leaving the carboxylic acid group at C1 untouched.\n\nThe intermediate formed is (R)-3-ethyl-6-hydroxyhexanoic acid. In the acidic workup (H⁺), this hydroxy-acid undergoes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the six-membered lactone. Since the product is the (R)-enantiomer, the starting material **A** must also be the **(R)-enantiomer**: (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n**Reaction B: Reduction with BH₃**\n\n*   **B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n\nBorane is a reducing agent that exhibits high selectivity for carboxylic acids over esters. Thus, BH₃ will reduce the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH), while the isobutyl ester group at C5 remains unchanged.\n\nThe intermediate formed is isobutyl (S)-3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoate. This hydroxy-ester then undergoes intramolecular transesterification (a cyclization reaction where the alcohol group displaces the isobutoxy group from the ester) to yield the lactone. As the final product is the (S)-enantiomer, the starting material **B** must be the **(S)-enantiomer**: (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the chemo-selectivity of the reducing agents and the stereochemistry of the products, the correct starting materials are:\n*   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
