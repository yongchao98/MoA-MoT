    "Here is a breakdown of the three Michael addition reactions to determine the correct reactants and final products.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:** Dimethyl malonate is the Michael donor, and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is the Michael acceptor. Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH) is the base used to deprotonate the dimethyl malonate, forming a nucleophilic enolate.\n*   **Reaction:** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the unsaturated ester. Subsequent protonation of the intermediate enolate by the solvent yields the final product.\n*   **Product (A):** The attack occurs at the β-carbon of the acrylate, linking the `CH(COOMe)2` group from the malonate to the carbon that was in the β-position of the double bond. The resulting structure is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n\n    <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/uTq8l3h.png\" alt=\"Reaction A mechanism\" width=\"600\"/>\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine, which serves as the Michael donor (this is part of a Stork enamine synthesis). (E)-but-2-enenitrile is the Michael acceptor.\n*   **Reaction:** Enamines are nitrogen analogs of enolates and are excellent nucleophiles. The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the unsaturated nitrile. The resulting iminium ion intermediate is then hydrolyzed with acid (H3O+) to regenerate the ketone.\n*   **Product (B):** The overall process results in the alkylation of cyclohexanone at the α-position. The substituent added is derived from but-2-enenitrile, which becomes a butanenitrile group attached at its third carbon. The final product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n\n    <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zJd96wZ.png\" alt=\"Reaction B mechanism\" width=\"700\"/>\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants:** The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, and one of the reactants is but-3-en-2-one (a Michael acceptor). We need to identify reactant C, the Michael donor.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is a Michael addition where a nucleophile adds to but-3-en-2-one. The `3-oxobutyl` group in the product corresponds to the but-3-en-2-one reactant after it has accepted the nucleophile. The nucleophile must therefore be the enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The acidic protons at the C2 position (between the two carbonyls) are removed by the base (KOH) to form the enolate, which then attacks the Michael acceptor.\n*   **Reactant (C):** Therefore, the starting reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n    <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/M6L546M.png\" alt=\"Reaction C mechanism\" width=\"600\"/>\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
