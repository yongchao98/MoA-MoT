    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\n### 1. Observatory Requirements\n\nFirst, let's establish the criteria for a star to be observable by each instrument. This involves two factors: its location in the sky (declination) and its brightness (apparent V magnitude).\n\n*   **ESPRESSO at Paranal Observatory:**\n    *   **Location:** Paranal Observatory is in the Southern Hemisphere at a latitude of approximately -25 degrees. This allows it to observe the entire southern celestial hemisphere and northern celestial objects up to a declination of about +65 degrees.\n    *   **Brightness Limit:** Can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (m_V) brighter than 17 (i.e., m_V < 17).\n\n*   **HIRES at Keck Observatory:**\n    *   **Location:** The Keck Observatory is in the Northern Hemisphere, on Mauna Kea, at a latitude of about +20 degrees. This allows it to observe the entire northern celestial hemisphere and southern celestial objects down to a declination of about -70 degrees.\n    *   **Brightness Limit:** Can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (m_V) brighter than 16 (i.e., m_V < 16).\n\nFor a star to be detected by **both** observatories, it must meet the stricter of these requirements:\n1.  **Location:** Be in the overlapping field of view, which is a declination between -70 and +65 degrees.\n2.  **Brightness:** Be brighter than an apparent V magnitude of 16 (m_V < 16), as this is the more stringent limit.\n\n### 2. Star Analysis\n\nNext, we calculate the final apparent V magnitude for each star and check its declination.\n\n**Star 1**\n*   **Declination (DEC):** -75 deg. This is south of Keck's -70 degree limit, making it **not visible** from Keck.\n*   Therefore, Star 1 cannot be observed by both.\n\n**Star 2**\n*   **Declination (DEC):** 55 deg. This is within the visibility range of both observatories.\n*   **Apparent V magnitude (m_V):** Given as 16.5. This is fainter than the m_V < 16 limit for HIRES.\n*   Therefore, Star 2 cannot be observed by both.\n\n**Star 3**\n*   **Declination (DEC):** 48 deg. This is within the visibility range of both observatories.\n*   **Apparent V magnitude (m_V):** The problem states an \"apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag\" and also provides a color excess E(B-V). The most consistent interpretation is that 15.5 is the final, observed magnitude, as accounting for extinction would make the star too faint for any of the options to be correct.\n*   With m_V = 15.5, the star is bright enough for both ESPRESSO (15.5 < 17) and HIRES (15.5 < 16).\n*   Therefore, **Star 3 is observable by both.**\n\n**Star 4**\n*   **Declination (DEC):** -48 deg. This is within the visibility range of both observatories.\n*   **Apparent V magnitude (m_V):** We must calculate this from the absolute magnitude (M_V = 15.5), distance (d = 10 pc), and color excess (E(B-V) = 0.4).\n    *   Apparent magnitude without extinction: m_V = M_V + 5*log₁₀(d) - 5 = 15.5 + 5*log₁₀(10) - 5 = 15.5 mag.\n    *   Extinction (A_V): A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n    *   Final Apparent Magnitude: m_V_final = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n*   This magnitude (16.74) is fainter than the m_V < 16 limit for HIRES.\n*   Therefore, Star 4 cannot be observed by both.\n\n**Star 5**\n*   **Declination (DEC):** 60 deg. This is within the visibility range of both observatories.\n*   **Apparent V magnitude (m_V):** We calculate this from the absolute magnitude (M_V = 16.5) and distance (d = 5 pc).\n    *   Final Apparent Magnitude: m_V = M_V + 5*log₁₀(d) - 5 = 16.5 + 5*log₁₀(5) - 5 ≈ 16.5 + 3.5 - 5 = 15.0 mag.\n*   This magnitude (15.0) is bright enough for both ESPRESSO (15.0 < 17) and HIRES (15.0 < 16).\n*   Therefore, **Star 5 is observable by both.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, Star 3 and Star 5 are the only stars that meet both the location and brightness criteria for both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\n<<<C>>>"
