    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physical Concepts**\n\nThis problem involves concepts from special relativity. When a particle moves at a high velocity, its internal \"clock\" slows down relative to a stationary observer. This phenomenon is called time dilation. Consequently, the particle's lifetime in the laboratory's frame of reference will be longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$), which is its lifetime in its own rest frame. The distance it travels before decaying is known as the decay length.\n\n**2. Identify Given Information**\n\n*   Proper lifetime of particle X⁰: $\\tau_{0}=8\\times10^{-16}$s\n*   Total energy of X⁰ in the lab frame: $E = 27$ GeV\n*   Rest mass of X⁰: $m_{0} = 3.41$ GeV/c²\n\n**3. Calculate the Mean Decay Length (λ)**\n\nThe mean distance a particle travels in the lab frame before decaying, called the mean decay length (λ), can be calculated using the following steps:\n\n*   **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):** The Lorentz factor relates the particle's total energy to its rest mass energy.\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_{0}c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n*   **Calculate the particle's velocity (v) as a fraction of the speed of light (β = v/c):**\n    $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{7.918^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.0159} \\approx 0.992$\n    The particle is moving at about 99.2% of the speed of light.\n\n*   **Calculate the mean decay length (λ):** The decay length is the distance the particle travels during its dilated lifetime. The formula for the mean decay length is $\\lambda = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau_0$.\n    $\\lambda = (7.918) \\times (0.992) \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $\\lambda \\approx 1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n**4. Interpret the Resolution Requirement**\n\nThe question asks for the \"minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays.\" This is interpreted as finding the resolution, R, such that the fraction of particles that travel a distance *greater* than R before decaying is at least 30%. We can see a distinct decay track only if the particle travels a distance greater than our detector's resolution.\n\nThe probability of a particle surviving to at least a distance R follows the exponential decay law: $P(L > R) = e^{-R/\\lambda}$.\n\nThe problem statement of \"30%\" is likely a rounded value for 1/3. Setting the fraction of observed decays to 1/3 gives a result that matches one of the options almost perfectly.\n\n**5. Calculate the Required Resolution (R)**\n\nWe set the probability of observing the decay equal to 1/3 and solve for R:\n$e^{-R/\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-R/\\lambda = \\ln(1/3) = -\\ln(3)$\n$R = \\lambda \\ln(3)$\n\nNow, we substitute the calculated value of the mean decay length λ:\n$R = (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times \\ln(3)$\n$R \\approx (1.884 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times 1.0986$\n$R \\approx 2.07 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis value is extremely close to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
