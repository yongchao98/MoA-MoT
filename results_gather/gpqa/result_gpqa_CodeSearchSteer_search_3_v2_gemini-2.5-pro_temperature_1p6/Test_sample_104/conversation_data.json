    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the relative radius of the hypothetical exoplanet.\n\n### 1. Understand the Scenario\n\n*   **Starspots:** A star has one hemisphere covered in dark spots. These spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. As the star rotates, we see the brighter (unspotted) and dimmer (spotted) faces of the star, causing its total brightness to vary periodically.\n*   **Exoplanet Transit:** A planet passing in front of its star blocks a portion of the star's light, causing a temporary dip in brightness. The amount of this dip is called the transit depth.\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find the size of a hypothetical planet that would cause a transit depth equal to the brightness variation caused by the starspots.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Brightness Variation from Starspots\n\nThe brightness (or more formally, the flux) of a star is related to its temperature by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which states that the energy radiated per unit area is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (Flux ∝ T⁴).\n\n**Given Information:**\n*   Star's effective temperature (T_eff) = 6000 K\n*   Temperature of the spots (T_spot) = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n*   Filling factor of spots on the spotted hemisphere (f) = 20% = 0.20\n\n**Maximum Brightness (F_max):**\nThis occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The flux is proportional to the temperature of the normal photosphere raised to the fourth power.\nF_max ∝ T_eff⁴\n\n**Minimum Brightness (F_min):**\nThis occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. The visible disk is a composite of the normal photosphere (80% of the area) and cooler spots (20% of the area).\nF_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴\nF_min ∝ (1 - 0.20) * (6000)⁴ + 0.20 * (5000)⁴\nF_min ∝ 0.8 * (6000)⁴ + 0.2 * (5000)⁴\n\n**Amplitude of the Signal:**\nThe problem asks for the amplitude of the signal, which in this context is the relative change in flux. This is equivalent to the transit depth an exoplanet would create.\nAmplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max = 1 - (F_min / F_max)\n\nLet's substitute the expressions for flux:\nAmplitude = 1 - [ (0.8 * T_eff⁴ + 0.2 * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴ ]\nAmplitude = 1 - [ 0.8 + 0.2 * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴ ]\nAmplitude = 0.2 - 0.2 * (T_spot / T_eff)⁴\nAmplitude = 0.2 * [ 1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴ ]\n\nNow, we plug in the temperature values:\nAmplitude = 0.2 * [ 1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴ ]\nAmplitude = 0.2 * [ 1 - (5/6)⁴ ]\nAmplitude = 0.2 * [ 1 - (625 / 1296) ]\nAmplitude = 0.2 * [ (1296 - 625) / 1296 ]\nAmplitude = 0.2 * [ 671 / 1296 ]\nAmplitude ≈ 0.2 * 0.51775\nAmplitude ≈ 0.10355\n\nSo, the brightness of the star varies by about 10.36% due to the rotation and the spots.\n\n### 3. Relate Brightness Variation to Planet Size\n\nThe depth of an exoplanet transit is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. Since the area of a circle is πR², the transit depth is given by:\n\nTransit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n### 4. Solve for the Planet's Relative Radius\n\nWe set the transit depth equal to the calculated amplitude from the starspots:\n(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.10355\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star) by taking the square root:\nR_pl / R_star = √0.10355\nR_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.32\nB) ~0.39\nC) ~0.07\nD) ~0.11\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
