    "The search results confirm the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude, K. One form presented is `V = V0 + K1(cos(ω+v) + ecosω)`. For a circular orbit, e=0, so the expression simplifies. More directly, other sources show the relationship I used. For instance, result gives the formula:\n\n`K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / (M_star^(2/3) * (1-e²)^(1/2))`\n\nwhere P is the period. This is exactly the formula I used in my derivation. For circular orbits (e=0), the `(1-e²)^(1/2)` term becomes 1.\n\nThe problem states:\n*   M₁ = M₂ (same star mass)\n*   m_p1 = m_p2 (same planet mass)\n*   e₁ = e₂ = 0 (circular orbits)\n*   The problem implies a direct comparison is possible, so it's assumed that the inclination angle `i` is the same for both systems (sin i₁ = sin i₂).\n\nWith these conditions, the formula for K simplifies to:\n\nK ∝ P^(-1/3) or K ∝ T^(-1/3) (using T for period)\n\nThe rest of my logical steps and calculations follow from this relationship.\n\n1.  **Relate K to the given data:** The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the measured periodic wavelength shift (Δλ).\n    *   K₁ ∝ Δλ₁ = 5 miliangstrom\n    *   K₂ ∝ Δλ₂ = 7 miliangstrom\n    *   Therefore, the ratio K₂ / K₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4.\n\n2.  **Relate the K ratio to the period ratio (T):** From the formula, the relationship between K and T is:\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = (T₂)^(-1/3) / (T₁)^(-1/3) = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)\n\n3.  **Solve for the period ratio (T₂ / T₁):**\n    *   1.4 = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)\n    *   Cube both sides: (1.4)³ = T₁ / T₂\n    *   2.744 = T₁ / T₂\n    *   Invert the fraction to find the desired ratio: T₂ / T₁ = 1 / 2.744\n\n4.  **Calculate the final value:**\n    *   T₂ / T₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\nComparing this with the options:\nA) ~ 0.36\nB) ~ 1.96\nC) ~ 0.85\nD) ~ 1.40\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\nThe logic holds up. A larger Doppler shift (and thus a larger stellar radial velocity K) for the same star and planet masses implies that the orbital period must be shorter. My result (T₂/T₁ ≈ 0.36) correctly shows that Planet #2, which causes the larger shift, has a shorter period.\n\nFinal check of the question: \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\". This means to calculate the ratio T₂/T₁. My calculation is for this exact ratio.\n\nThe calculation is sound, and the underlying physics is confirmed by the search results. I am ready to give the final answer.\n\nThe ratio of the periodic wavelength shifts corresponds to the ratio of the semi-amplitudes of the stars' radial velocities (K).\n\nΔλ₂ / Δλ₁ = K₂ / K₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by:\n\nK = (2πG / T)^(1/3) * (m_p * sin(i)) / M_star^(2/3)\n\nWhere:\n*   T is the orbital period\n*   m_p is the planet's mass\n*   M_star is the star's mass\n*   i is the orbital inclination\n*   G is the gravitational constant\n\nThe problem states that the star masses are the same (M₁ = M₂) and the planet masses are the same (m_p1 = m_p2). It is implied that the inclination angles are also the same to allow for a direct comparison.\n\nThus, K is proportional to T^(-1/3).\n\nWe can set up a ratio:\n\nK₂ / K₁ = (T₂)^(-1/3) / (T₁)^(-1/3) = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)\n\nNow, substitute the known value of K₂ / K₁:\n\n1.4 = (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)\n\nTo find T₂ / T₁, we first solve for T₁ / T₂ by cubing both sides:\n\nT₁ / T₂ = (1.4)³ = 2.744\n\nFinally, we find the required ratio T₂ / T₁ by taking the reciprocal:\n\nT₂ / T₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.3644\n\nThis value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
