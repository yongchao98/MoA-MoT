    "To design a molecular diagnostic kit for a quick and accurate detection of a new retrovirus, the correct approach involves sequencing its genetic material and then developing a real-time PCR kit.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the correct option and why the others are not suitable:\n\n### Correct Approach:\n\n**D) First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing. You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.**\n\nThis option describes the modern, standard workflow for identifying a new RNA virus and developing a diagnostic test.\n*   **Identify the virus by cDNA sequencing:** Retroviruses have an RNA genome. To determine the genetic sequence of an RNA virus, scientists must first convert the viral RNA into a more stable DNA copy. This is done using an enzyme called reverse transcriptase, and the resulting DNA is known as complementary DNA (cDNA). This cDNA can then be sequenced to reveal the unique genetic code of the virus.\n*   **Develop a real-time PCR kit:** Once the viral sequence is known, scientists can design specific primers and probes that target unique regions of the virus's genome. A real-time Reverse Transcription PCR (RT-PCR) test is the ideal diagnostic tool. It is highly sensitive, specific, and provides rapid results, often within hours. This technique is the gold standard for diagnosing active RNA virus infections, such as those caused by HIV (a retrovirus) or SARS-CoV-2.\n\n### Why Other Options Are Incorrect:\n\n*   **A) First you identify the virus by performing DNA sequencing:** This is incorrect because retroviruses are RNA viruses. Direct DNA sequencing would not work on the viral particle itself, as it does not contain a DNA genome.\n*   **B) First you identify the IgG antibodies for the infection:** This describes a serological test, not a molecular one. While useful for tracking past exposure, it is not ideal for quick diagnosis of a new outbreak. The body takes time to produce IgG antibodies, so this method is of limited use in the early stages of an infection.\n*   **C) First you identify the virus using the information about the symptoms:** Identifying a virus based on symptoms alone is unreliable. Many different viruses can cause similar illnesses. To design a highly specific molecular test like PCR, the exact genetic sequence of the pathogen is required.\n\n<<<D>>>"
