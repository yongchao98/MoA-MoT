    "The synthesis proceeds through three steps. The number of carbon atoms at each stage determines the final count in product 3. There is a typographical error in the third step of the question, which should state that product 2 is treated, not product 3.\n\n1.  **Step 1: trans-cinnamaldehyde + methylmagnesium bromide → product 1**\n    *   *trans*-cinnamaldehyde (C₆H₅CH=CHCHO) is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde containing 9 carbon atoms.\n    *   Methylmagnesium bromide (CH₃MgBr) is a Grignard reagent. In the absence of a copper catalyst, Grignard reagents typically perform a 1,2-addition to the carbonyl group of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes.\n    *   The methyl group (CH₃) adds to the carbonyl carbon, and upon workup, the carbonyl oxygen becomes a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   This reaction adds one carbon atom to the molecule.\n    *   Product 1 is 4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol (C₆H₅CH=CHCH(OH)CH₃), which has **10 carbon atoms**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: product 1 + pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) → product 2**\n    *   Product 1 is a secondary allylic alcohol.\n    *   Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) is a mild oxidizing agent that converts secondary alcohols into ketones.\n    *   The oxidation does not change the number of carbon atoms.\n    *   Product 2 is 4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one (C₆H₅CH=CHC(=O)CH₃), also known as benzylideneacetone. This product still has **10 carbon atoms**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: product 2 + (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane → product 3**\n    *   The reagent is dimethylsulfoxonium methylide, ((CH₃)₂S(O)CH₂), a key component in the Johnson–Corey–Chaykovsky reaction.\n    *   When this sulfur ylide reacts with a ketone, it transfers a methylene group (CH₂) to form an epoxide.\n    *   In the case of α,β-unsaturated ketones like product 2, dimethylsulfoxonium methylide selectively attacks the carbonyl group to yield an epoxide, rather than attacking the carbon-carbon double bond to form a cyclopropane.\n    *   This reaction adds one more carbon atom (from the CH₂ group) to the molecule.\n    *   Product 3 is an epoxide, which has 10 + 1 = **11 carbon atoms**.\n\nTherefore, product 3 contains 11 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<C>>>"
