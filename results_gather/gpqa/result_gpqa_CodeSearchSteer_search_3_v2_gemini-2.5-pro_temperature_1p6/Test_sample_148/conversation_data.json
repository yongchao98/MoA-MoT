    "The observations described in the prompt are classic indications of a specific type of isomerism common in peptides. Let's break down the evidence:\n\n*   **Â¹H NMR Data:** The presence of two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, which together integrate to one proton, indicates that this proton exists in two different chemical environments. Because these peaks have similar chemical shifts and are not the result of spin-spin coupling, it suggests the two environments are very similar in nature but structurally distinct. This phenomenon is often caused by slow conformational changes on the NMR timescale.\n*   **LC-MS Data:** The LC-MS analysis confirms the presence of two distinct species. Since liquid chromatography separates compounds based on physical properties like polarity and shape, the two peaks show that the two species can be physically separated. The fact that both peaks exhibit the same mass spectrum is critical, as it proves they are isomers (molecules with the same formula but different structures) and not, for example, a precursor or a side-product with a different chemical formula.\n*   **The Underlying Chemistry:** In peptides, the amide bond (C-N bond) has partial double-bond character due to resonance. This restricts free rotation around the bond, creating a significant energy barrier. As a result, two stable planar conformations, *cis* and *trans*, can exist. These isomers are known as rotamers or atropisomers. Protons near the amide bond, such as the alpha-proton, will experience a different chemical environment in the *cis* form compared to the *trans* form, leading to separate signals in the NMR spectrum. The interconversion between these isomers is often slow on the NMR timescale at room temperature, allowing both to be observed.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options based on this understanding:\n\n*   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This is unlikely. If this meant an extra amino acid was added, the mass would be different, which contradicts the LC-MS data.\n*   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** *Cis* and *trans* rotamers are stereoisomers. If the peptide contains at least one other chiral center, the *cis* and *trans* rotamers are not mirror images of each other and are therefore, by definition, diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by techniques like LC, and they give distinct NMR spectra. This explanation fits all the observations perfectly.\n*   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical NMR spectra (in achiral solvent) and cannot be separated by standard LC. This is inconsistent with the data.\n*   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would have a different molecular weight, which is ruled out by the identical mass spectra of the two LC peaks.\n\nThe most precise explanation is the presence of *cis-trans* isomers (rotamers) around an amide bond. These rotamers are a specific type of diastereomer, making option B the correct and most encompassing answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
