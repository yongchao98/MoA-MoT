    "### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Compound A to B:** Compound A is C3H6, which is propene. Bromination in CCl4 adds bromine across the double bond.\n    *   `CH3-CH=CH2 (Propene, A) + Br2/CCl4 → CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br) (1,2-Dibromopropane, B)`\n\n2.  **Compound B to C:** Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH in a double dehydrohalogenation reaction to form an alkyy_ne_.\n    *   `CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br) (B) + 2 KOH (alc.) → CH3-C≡CH (Propyne, C) + 2 KBr + 2 H2O`\n\n3.  **Compound C to D:** Passing propyne through a red-hot iron tube causes cyclic trimerization to form a substituted benzene.\n    *   `3 CH3-C≡CH (C) --(Red-hot Fe tube)→ 1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene, D)`\n\n4.  **Compound D to E:** Mesitylene reacts with a nitrating mixture (conc. HNO3 + conc. H2SO4) to form a nitro compound.\n    *   `1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene (D) + HNO3/H2SO4 → 2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (E)`\n\n5.  **Compound E to F:** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group using iron scrap and hydrochloric acid.\n    *   `2-Nitro-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (E) + Fe/HCl → 2-Amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesidine, F)`\n\n6.  **Compound F to G:** The primary aromatic amine (mesidine) undergoes diazotization with nitrous acid (NaNO2 + HCl).\n    *   `2-Amino-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (F) + HNO2 → 1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene-2-diazonium salt (G)`\n\n7.  **Compound G to H:** The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed with a base (NaOH) to form a phenol.\n    *   `1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene-2-diazonium salt (G) + NaOH/H2O → 2-Hydroxy-1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (Mesitylol, H)`\n\n### Evaluation of the Statements:\n\n*   **A) C is a flammable gas:** Compound C is propyne. Propyne is a colorless, highly flammable gas at room temperature. This statement is correct.\n\n*   **B) F is used for the synthesis of dyes:** Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline (mesidine). Aromatic amines are key precursors in the synthesis of many dyes. For instance, they are used as the diazo component in producing azo dyes. This statement is correct.\n\n*   **C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra:** Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene). Due to its high molecular symmetry, the three aromatic protons are chemically equivalent, and the nine protons of the three methyl groups are also chemically equivalent. This results in two distinct signals in the 1H NMR spectrum, both of which are singlets. This statement is correct.\n\n*   **D) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution:** Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (mesitol), which is a phenol. The ferric chloride test is a characteristic test for phenols, which typically produce an intense blue, violet, purple, green, or red-brown color upon the addition of neutral ferric chloride solution. The initial ferric chloride solution is yellow; a yellow result indicates a negative test. Therefore, the formation of a yellow color is not a positive result for a phenol. This statement is incorrect.\n\n<<<D>>>"
