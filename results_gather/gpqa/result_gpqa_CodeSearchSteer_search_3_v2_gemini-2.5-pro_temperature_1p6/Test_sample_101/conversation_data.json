  "question": "You identified a new ligand-receptor pair initially expressed in the neural crest cells and want to understand the developmental fate of their interaction. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane barrel with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets that create a binding site for the ligand. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. You create a bicistronic lox-Cre vector with the ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between the receptor and the eGFP, there is a stop in the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.

Total proteins give a signal proportional to the actin loading. You finally breed a mouse model homozygous for your construct in the wt background.

    "An analysis of the experimental design reveals a fundamental issue in the molecular tools used, which explains the lack of a green signal.\n\nThe mouse model uses a SOX10-Cre driver to activate gene expression in neural crest cells. This activation relies on the Cre recombinase protein excising sequences flanked by special recognition sites called loxP sites. In the provided bicistronic construct, two such \"lox-stop-lox\" cassettes are used to control the expression of two separate fusion proteins.\n\nThe first cassette, loxP-stop-loxP, is placed between the ligand and the mCherry fluorescent protein. Standard Cre recombinase, expressed from the SOX10-Cre transgene, efficiently recognizes these loxP sites. It would excise the \"stop\" signal, allowing the cell to produce the Ligand-mCherry fusion protein, which should result in a red fluorescent signal.\n\nThe second cassette, lox2272-stop-lox2272, is placed between the receptor open reading frame (ORF) and the eGFP fluorescent protein. The critical issue lies here: lox2272 is a mutant variant of the loxP site. Standard Cre recombinase has very low to negligible efficiency at recombining two lox2272 sites. Because the SOX10-Cre mouse produces standard Cre protein, it cannot effectively remove the stop cassette flanked by lox2272 sites.\n\nAs a result, when the cell's machinery reads the messenger RNA from this part of the construct, it translates the receptor's ORF and then encounters the un-excised stop signal from the lox2272 cassette, terminating protein synthesis. The eGFP gene, located downstream of this stop signal, is never translated into protein. The termination of translation due to the persistent stop cassette means that the receptor and the eGFP protein are not linked together in a single, continuous open reading frame.\n\nEvaluating the given options:\n*   A) The receptor-eGFP construct being stuck in the Golgi is a protein trafficking issue, but it cannot occur if the eGFP portion of the protein is never synthesized in the first place.\n*   B) An enhancer for expression is not missing; the construct uses the strong and widely active CBA promoter to drive transcription.\n*   D) A paracrine relationship is a biological concept describing cell-to-cell signaling and does not affect the internal mechanics of protein translation from a reporter gene.\n*   C) The statement that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame accurately describes the molecular consequence. Because of the un-excised stop cassette, the ribosome reads the receptor ORF and stops, preventing it from ever reading the eGFP ORF. Therefore, they cannot be translated in a single frame to create the intended fusion protein.\n\nThus, the most likely reason for the absence of a green signal is a direct consequence of the molecular incompatibility between the Cre recombinase and the lox2272 sites.\n\n<<<C>>>"
