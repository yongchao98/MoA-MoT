    "An electron in a hydrogen atom in the state |3,0,0⟩ can decay to the ground state |1,0,0⟩ through a sequence of two electric dipole transitions. The pathway and the associated probability for one such route are presented in the options. To determine the correct option, one must first identify the allowed intermediate states based on the selection rules for electric dipole transitions and then ascertain the probability of the specified decay path.\n\nThe selection rules for electric dipole transitions in the non-relativistic theory for a hydrogen atom are given by changes in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, Δl, and the magnetic quantum number, Δm:\n*   Δl = ±1\n*   Δm = 0, ±1\n\nLet's analyze the two-step transition from the initial state |3,0,0⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩.\n\n**First Transition: |3,0,0⟩ → intermediate state |n',l',m'⟩**\n\n*   The initial state has l=0. According to the selection rule Δl = ±1, the intermediate state must have l' = 1.\n*   The initial state has m=0. The selection rule Δm = 0, ±1 allows the intermediate state to have m' = 0, +1, or -1.\n*   For a decay process, the principal quantum number must decrease, so n' < 3. The most likely intermediate principal quantum number is n'=2.\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.\n\n**Second Transition: Intermediate state |2,1,m'⟩ → final state |1,0,0⟩**\n\n*   The intermediate states have l'=1, and the final state has l=0, which satisfies the selection rule Δl = -1.\n*   The final state has m=0.\n    *   For the intermediate state |2,1,0⟩, the transition to |1,0,0⟩ involves Δm=0, which is allowed.\n    *   For the intermediate state |2,1,1⟩, the transition to |1,0,0⟩ involves Δm=-1, which is allowed.\n    *   For the intermediate state |2,1,-1⟩, the transition to |1,0,0⟩ involves Δm=+1, which is allowed.\n\nThus, there are three possible decay routes from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ via an n=2 intermediate state:\n1.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n2.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n3.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\nDue to the spherical symmetry of the initial |3,0,0⟩ state, the probabilities for decaying into any of the three intermediate states, |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩, are equal. Since these are the only allowed transitions to the n=2 shell, the probability for each path is 1/3. Once the atom is in any of the |2,1,m'⟩ states, it is certain to decay to the |1,0,0⟩ ground state, as it is the only available lower energy state that satisfies the selection rules. Therefore, the branching ratio for each of the three decay routes is 1/3.\n\nExamining the given options:\n*   A) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3\n*   B) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4\n*   C) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4\n*   D) ⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 2/3\n\nOption A correctly identifies a possible transition route and assigns the correct probability of 1/3. Options B and C list correct routes but with incorrect probabilities. Option D is improperly written and has an incorrect probability.\n\nTherefore, the correct transition route and corresponding probability among the choices is:\n\n$|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n\n<<<A>>>"
