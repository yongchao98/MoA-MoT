    "The total minimum energy of the system is the sum of two components:\n1.  The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge (`Q`) and the 12 charges (`q`) on the sphere's surface (`U_central`).\n2.  The potential energy from the mutual repulsion of the 12 charges on the sphere (`U_sphere`).\n\nThe charge values are `Q = q = 2e`, where `e` is the elementary charge (`1.602 x 10^-19` C). The radius of the sphere is `R = 2` m. Coulomb's constant is `k ≈ 8.98755 x 10^9 N·m²/C²`.\n\n**1. Potential Energy between Central Charge and Sphere Charges (`U_central`)**\n\nThe potential energy between two point charges is given by `U = k * q1 * q2 / r`. Here, the central charge `Q` interacts with each of the 12 charges `q` on the sphere at a distance `R`.\n\nThe energy for one such interaction is:\n`U_one = k * Q * q / R = k * (2e) * (2e) / R = 4 * k * e² / R`\n\nSince there are 12 charges on the sphere, the total potential energy from this interaction is:\n`U_central = 12 * U_one = 12 * (4 * k * e² / R) = 48 * k * e² / R`\n\n**2. Potential Energy of the 12 Charges on the Sphere (`U_sphere`)**\n\nTo find the minimum energy of the 12 charges on the sphere, we must determine their optimal arrangement. This is a classic physics problem known as the Thomson problem. For `N=12` charges, the minimum energy configuration is achieved when the charges are located at the vertices of a regular icosahedron inscribed within the sphere.\n\nThe potential energy of this configuration is the sum of the potential energies for all pairs of charges. The formula is:\n`U_sphere = k * q² * (E_12 / R)`\nwhere `q = 2e` and `E_12` is the dimensionless energy constant for the `N=12` Thomson problem, which represents the sum of inverse distances between all pairs of vertices on a unit-radius icosahedron (`sum(1/r_ij)`).\n\nSubstituting `q = 2e`:\n`U_sphere = k * (2e)² * (E_12 / R) = (4 * k * e² / R) * E_12`\n\nVarious sources in physics literature have calculated the value of `E_12` to be approximately 49.165.\n\n**Total System Energy (`U_total`)**\n\nThe total minimum energy is the sum of the two components:\n`U_total = U_central + U_sphere`\n`U_total = (48 * k * e² / R) + (4 * k * e² / R) * E_12`\n`U_total = (4 * k * e² / R) * (12 + E_12)`\n\nNow, we substitute the known values:\n*   `k ≈ 8.98755 x 10^9 N·m²/C²`\n*   `e ≈ 1.602177 x 10^-19 C`\n*   `R = 2 m`\n*   `E_12 ≈ 49.165`\n\nFirst, calculate the pre-factor `(4 * k * e² / R)`:\n`4 * (8.98755 x 10^9) * (1.602177 x 10^-19)² / 2 ≈ 4.614 x 10^-28 J`\n\nNext, calculate the term in the parenthesis:\n`12 + 49.165 = 61.165`\n\nFinally, multiply these results:\n`U_total ≈ (4.614 x 10^-28) * 61.165`\n`U_total ≈ 2.822 x 10^-26 J`\n\nThis value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
