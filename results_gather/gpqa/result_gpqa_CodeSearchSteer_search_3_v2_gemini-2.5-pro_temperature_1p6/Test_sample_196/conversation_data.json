    "### **Identification of Compound X**\n\nThe structure of the initial reactant, Compound X, is determined by analyzing its spectroscopic data.\n\n**Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n*   A very broad absorption between **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the O-H bond in a carboxylic acid that is undergoing hydrogen bonding.\n*   The strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, which is consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n*   Absorptions at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** indicate the presence of C=C bonds within an aromatic ring.\n\nThis IR data strongly suggests that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n*   **10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H):** This signal is indicative of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (doublet, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, points to a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield shift of the signal at 8.0 ppm is due to the deshielding effect of the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group.\n*   The remaining signals describe the alkyl substituent on the ring:\n    *   **0.9 ppm (triplet, 3H):** A methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n    *   **1.4 ppm (doublet, 3H):** A methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH).\n    *   **1.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H):** A methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to both a methyl group and a methine group.\n    *   **2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H):** A methine group (-CH-) that is benzylic (attached to the benzene ring) and also bonded to a methyl and a methylene group.\n\nAssembling these pieces confirms the alkyl group is a **sec-butyl** group. Therefore, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### **Reaction and Final Product**\n\nThe reaction involves treating Compound X with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce carboxylic acids (-COOH) to their corresponding alkanes, specifically to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\nThe reaction proceeds as follows:\n*   The starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n*   The reducing agent, red P/HI, specifically targets the carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   The -COOH group is reduced to a -CH₃ group.\n*   The *sec*-butyl group and the aromatic ring are unaffected by these reaction conditions.\n\nThe resulting final product is a benzene ring substituted with a *sec*-butyl group at one position and a methyl group at the *para* position. The IUPAC name for this structure is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\nComparing this to the given choices:\n*   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure.\n*   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material.\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - This has an incorrect butyl isomer.\n*   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches the identified final product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
