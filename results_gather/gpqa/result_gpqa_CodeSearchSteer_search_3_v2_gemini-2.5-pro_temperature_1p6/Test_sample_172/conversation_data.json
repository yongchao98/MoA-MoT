    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of the electron.\n\n1.  **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle**: The relationship between the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) is given by Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. The formula states that their product is at least on the order of the reduced Planck constant (ħ). For minimum uncertainty, we use the equality:\n    Δx * Δp ≈ ħ / 2\n    where ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n\n2.  **Calculate the uncertainty in momentum (Δp)**: We can rearrange the formula to solve for the minimum uncertainty in momentum.\n    Given:\n    *   Uncertainty in position (Δx) = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   Reduced Planck's constant (ħ) ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\n    Δp ≈ ħ / (2 * Δx)\n    Δp ≈ (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 10⁻¹⁰ m)\n    Δp ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\n3.  **Relate uncertainty in energy (ΔE) to uncertainty in momentum (Δp)**: Since the electron is traveling at a significant fraction of the speed of light (v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s), we must use the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n    E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²\n    where E is the total energy, p is the momentum, m₀ is the rest mass of the electron, and c is the speed of light.\n\n    To find the relationship between the uncertainties, we can differentiate energy (E) with respect to momentum (p):\n    dE/dp = v (the velocity of the particle)\n\n    For small uncertainties, this can be expressed as:\n    ΔE ≈ v * Δp\n\n4.  **Calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE)**: Now, we can substitute the known values into this relationship.\n    Given:\n    *   Velocity (v) = 2 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   Uncertainty in momentum (Δp) ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\n    ΔE ≈ (2 x 10⁸ m/s) * (5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)\n    ΔE ≈ 10.54 x 10⁻¹⁷ J\n    ΔE ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The calculated minimum uncertainty in the energy is approximately 10⁻¹⁶ J. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
