    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the approximate flux ratio.\n\n### 1. Identify Neutrino Sources in the Energy Bands\nFirst, we must understand which solar fusion reactions produce neutrinos in the two specified energy bands:\n*   **Band 1 (700–800 keV):** The primary contributors to this band are neutrinos from the decay of Boron-8 (⁸B), which are produced in the pp-III branch, and neutrinos from the CNO cycle.\n*   **Band 2 (800–900 keV):** This band is dominated by the strong, monoenergetic neutrino line from the electron capture of Beryllium-7 (⁷Be) at 861 keV, which is part of the pp-II branch. This band also receives contributions from ⁸B and CNO neutrinos.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Hypothetical Scenario\nThe problem states that the **pp-III branch suddenly stops**. The key consequence of this is the cessation of ⁸B neutrino production, as the reaction `⁷Be + p → ⁸B + γ` is the starting point of the pp-III branch. The problem also states that all other reactions, including the pp-II branch (producing ⁷Be neutrinos) and the CNO cycle, continue as they were.\n\n### 3. Determine the Remaining Flux in Each Band\nWith the pp-III branch stopped, the neutrino flux in each band is now composed of the remaining sources:\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700–800 keV):** Since the ⁸B neutrinos are gone, the only significant remaining contributors are the neutrinos from the CNO cycle.\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800–900 keV):** The flux from ⁸B disappears, but the band is still dominated by the very strong ⁷Be neutrino line at 861 keV. The contribution from the CNO cycle in this band is negligible compared to the ⁷Be flux.\n\n### 4. Estimate the Ratio\nThe question now simplifies to calculating the following approximate ratio:\n\n**Ratio ≈ (Flux of CNO neutrinos in the 700-800 keV band) / (Flux of the 861 keV ⁷Be neutrino line)**\n\nTo estimate this, we compare the total fluxes of the parent reactions:\n*   The total flux of neutrinos from the main ⁷Be decay branch is approximately **4.9 x 10⁹ neutrinos/cm²/s**.\n*   The total flux from all CNO cycle reactions is approximately **(2.8 + 2.1) x 10⁸ = 4.9 x 10⁸ neutrinos/cm²/s**.\n\nComparing the total fluxes, the CNO neutrino flux is roughly 10% of the ⁷Be flux. However, we are not comparing the total fluxes. We are comparing the flux of the *entire* ⁷Be line (which falls completely within Band 2) to only a *fraction* of the CNO flux (the part that falls within the 100 keV-wide Band 1).\n\nThe CNO neutrinos have a continuous energy spectrum, so only a small portion of their total flux will be in the 700-800 keV window. Estimating this fraction precisely is complex, but it will be significantly less than 1. This means the numerator in our ratio is much smaller than the total CNO flux.\n\nLet's perform an approximation:\n*   **Numerator (Flux in Band 1):** A small fraction (let's say ~10%) of the total CNO flux (`~0.1 * 4.9 x 10⁸`).\n*   **Denominator (Flux in Band 2):** The entire high-flux ⁷Be line (`~4.9 x 10⁹`).\n\nRatio ≈ (0.1 * 4.9 x 10⁸) / (4.9 x 10⁹) = 0.1 * 0.1 = **0.01**\n\nThis estimation shows that the flux in Band 1 is approximately 1/100th of the flux in Band 2.\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter the pp-III branch stops, the flux in the 700-800 keV band is due to the low-intensity CNO cycle, while the flux in the 800-900 keV band is dominated by the high-intensity ⁷Be line from the pp-II branch. The ratio of the CNO flux in a narrow energy window to the total ⁷Be line flux is approximately 0.01.\n\n<<<D>>>"
