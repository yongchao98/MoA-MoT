    "Answering this question requires applying the principle of conservation of energy to a relativistic system. The total energy of the relativistic harmonic oscillator is the sum of its relativistic energy and its potential energy.\n\n1.  **Total Energy of the System**\n    The total energy ($E_{total}$) of the system is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy ($E_{particle}$) and the potential energy ($U$) stored in the spring:\n    $E_{total} = E_{particle} + U(x)$\n\n    The particle's relativistic energy is given by $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor, $m$ is the rest mass, $v$ is the speed, and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n    The potential energy of the harmonic oscillator is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where $k$ is the spring constant and $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\n    Therefore, the total energy of the system at any point in its motion is:\n    $E_{total} = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n2.  **Conservation of Energy**\n    The total energy of the isolated system is conserved. We can evaluate the total energy at two critical points in the oscillator's motion:\n    *   **At the maximum amplitude ($x = A$):** The mass is momentarily at rest, so its speed is $v = 0$. At this point, the Lorentz factor $\\gamma=1$. The total energy is:\n        $E_{total} = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    *   **At the equilibrium position ($x = 0$):** The potential energy is zero, $U(0) = 0$. The mass reaches its maximum speed, $v = v_{max}$. The total energy is:\n        $E_{total} = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n3.  **Solving for Maximum Speed ($v_{max}$)**\n    By the principle of energy conservation, the total energy at the maximum amplitude must equal the total energy at the equilibrium position:\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, we first rearrange the equation. Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n    Now, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}}$\n\n    Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n    $\\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2} = 1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$\n\n    Rearrange the terms to isolate $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
