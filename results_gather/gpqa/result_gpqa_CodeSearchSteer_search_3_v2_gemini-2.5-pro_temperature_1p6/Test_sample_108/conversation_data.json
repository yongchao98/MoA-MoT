    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which partial wave is not permitted.\n\n### **1. Initial State Analysis**\n\nThe initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state.\n*   The notation is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   **Total Spin (S):** `2S+1 = 1` implies `S(NN, initial) = 0`.\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L):** The 'S' corresponds to `L(NN, initial) = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J):** `J(NN, initial) = 0`.\n*   **Parity (P):** The parity of the NN system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. So, `P(NN, initial) = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### **2. Conservation Laws**\n\nFor the decay `1S0 -> (NN)_final + X`, two fundamental laws must be conserved:\n\n*   **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n    *   `J(initial) = 0`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's total angular momentum `J(NN, final)` and the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `L(X)`.\n    *   Therefore, `**J**(initial) = **J**(NN, final) + **L**(X) = 0`.\n    *   This implies that the magnitudes must be equal: `J(NN, final) = L(X)`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n    *   `P(initial) = P(NN, initial) = +1`.\n    *   The final parity is the product of the final NN state's parity, the intrinsic parity of particle X, and the orbital parity of particle X.\n    *   `P(final) = P(NN, final) * P(X, intrinsic) * P(X, orbital)`.\n    *   We are given `P(X, intrinsic) = -1`.\n    *   `P(NN, final) = (-1)^L(NN, final)`.\n    *   `P(X, orbital) = (-1)^L(X)`.\n    *   So, `P(final) = (-1)^L(NN, final) * (-1) * (-1)^L(X) = (-1)^(L(NN, final) + L(X) + 1)`.\n    *   For parity to be conserved, `+1 = (-1)^(L(NN, final) + L(X) + 1)`.\n    *   This requires the exponent `L(NN, final) + L(X) + 1` to be an even number, which means `L(NN, final) + L(X)` must be an **odd** number.\n\n### **3. Pauli Statistics for the Final State**\n\nThe problem states that for the final NN state, which has Isospin `T(NN) = 0`, the following relation must hold:\n*   `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   Substituting `T(NN) = 0`, we get `0 = S(NN, final) + L(NN, final) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This implies that `S(NN, final) + L(NN, final) + 1` must be an even number.\n*   Therefore, `S(NN, final) + L(NN, final)` must be an **odd** number.\n\n### **Summary of Conditions for a Permitted Transition:**\n1.  The final state must be a valid two-nucleon state (Total spin S=0 or S=1).\n2.  `J(NN, final) = L(X)`. (Angular Momentum Conservation)\n3.  `L(NN, final) + L(X)` must be odd. (Parity Conservation)\n4.  `S(NN, final) + L(NN, final)` must be odd. (Pauli Statistics for T=0)\n\n### **4. Evaluating the Options**\n\nThe lowercase letters denote the orbital angular momentum of particle X: `s`(L=0), `p`(L=1), `d`(L=2), `f`(L=3).\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` -> `S=3`. This is not possible for a two-nucleon system, as two spin-1/2 particles can only form total spin S=0 or S=1. Thus, this transition is not permitted.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S=1, L=2, J=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`): `L(X)=3`.\n*   Check 1: `S=1` is valid.\n*   Check 2: `J(NN, final) = L(X)` -> `3 = 3`. (OK)\n*   Check 3: `L(NN, final) + L(X)` is odd -> `2 + 3 = 5`. (OK)\n*   Check 4: `S(NN, final) + L(NN, final)` is odd -> `1 + 2 = 3`. (OK)\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S=1, L=1, J=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`): `L(X)=0`.\n*   Check 1: `S=1` is valid.\n*   Check 2: `J(NN, final) = L(X)` -> `0 = 0`. (OK)\n*   Check 3: `L(NN, final) + L(X)` is odd -> `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n*   Check 4: `S(NN, final) + L(NN, final)` is odd -> `1 + 1 = 2`. **(VIOLATED)**. The sum is even.\n*   This transition is not permitted.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S=1, L=0, J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`): `L(X)=1`.\n*   Check 1: `S=1` is valid.\n*   Check 2: `J(NN, final) = L(X)` -> `1 = 1`. (OK)\n*   Check 3: `L(NN, final) + L(X)` is odd -> `0 + 1 = 1`. (OK)\n*   Check 4: `S(NN, final) + L(NN, final)` is odd -> `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n*   This transition is permitted.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBoth transitions A and C are not permitted. However, they are forbidden for different reasons.\n*   Transition A is impossible because the final state `7D1` cannot be formed by two nucleons.\n*   Transition C respects conservation of angular momentum and parity, but violates the specific Pauli statistics condition given for the `T=0` final state.\n\nThe question asks to make use of all given principles. Transition C is the one that satisfies the conservation laws but is ruled out specifically by the Pauli statistics rule for the T=0 final state, making it a comprehensive test of all the stated conditions.\n\n<<<C>>>"
