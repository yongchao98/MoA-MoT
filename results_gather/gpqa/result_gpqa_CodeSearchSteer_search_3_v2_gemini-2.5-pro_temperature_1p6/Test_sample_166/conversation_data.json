    "Here is a step-by-step calculation of the non-Gaussianity (nG) for the given Schrödinger cat state.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Non-Gaussianity Measure\n\nThe non-Gaussianity is calculated using the relative entropy measure, defined as:\n`del_b = trace(rho * ln(rho)) - trace(tau * ln(tau))`\n\nThis can be rewritten in terms of von Neumann entropy `S(ρ) = -trace(ρ * ln(ρ))` as:\n`del_b = S(tau) - S(rho)`\n\nHere:\n*   `rho` is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state in question. Since `rho` corresponds to a pure state `|psi>`, its entropy `S(rho)` is zero.\n*   `tau` is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. This state is chosen to have the same first and second moments as `rho`. For a state with zero displacement, this reference state is a thermal state.\n\nTherefore, the non-Gaussianity is simply the entropy of the reference thermal state `tau`:\n`nG = S(tau)`\n\n### 2. Calculating the Average Photon Number\n\nThe entropy of the thermal state `tau` depends on its average photon number, `n_th`. This is equal to the average photon number `<n>` of the Schrödinger cat state `|psi>`.\n\nThe state is given by:\n`|psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N`\nwith the normalization constant `N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi) * exp(-2*alpha^2))`.\n\nThe average photon number is calculated as `<n> = <psi|a†a|psi>`, which yields the formula:\n`<n> = (alpha^2 * (1 - sin(2*phi) * exp(-2*alpha^2))) / (1 + sin(2*phi) * exp(-2*alpha^2))`\n\nNow, we substitute the given values:\n*   `alpha = 0.5` => `alpha^2 = 0.25`\n*   `phi = -pi / 4` => `sin(2*phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1`\n\nPlugging these into the equation for `<n>`:\n`<n> = (0.25 * (1 - (-1) * exp(-2 * 0.25))) / (1 + (-1) * exp(-2 * 0.25))`\n`<n> = 0.25 * (1 + exp(-0.5)) / (1 - exp(-0.5))`\n\nUsing the value `exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065`:\n`<n> ≈ 0.25 * (1 + 0.6065) / (1 - 0.6065)`\n`<n> ≈ 0.25 * (1.6065 / 0.3935) ≈ 0.25 * 4.0826`\n`<n> ≈ 1.0207`\n\nSo, the average photon number of the reference thermal state is `n_th ≈ 1.0207`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Entropy of the Reference State\n\nThe von Neumann entropy of a thermal state `tau` with an average photon number `n_th` is given by:\n`S(tau) = (n_th + 1) * ln(n_th + 1) - n_th * ln(n_th)`\n\nSubstituting `n_th ≈ 1.0207`:\n`S(tau) ≈ (1.0207 + 1) * ln(1.0207 + 1) - 1.0207 * ln(1.0207)`\n`S(tau) ≈ 2.0207 * ln(2.0207) - 1.0207 * ln(1.0207)`\n`S(tau) ≈ 2.0207 * 0.7035 - 1.0207 * 0.0205`\n`S(tau) ≈ 1.4215 - 0.0209`\n`S(tau) ≈ 1.4006`\n\nThe calculated non-Gaussianity is approximately **1.40**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing the result with the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 2.48\nC) 1.38\nD) 0.25\n\nThe calculated value of 1.40 is closest to 1.38. This small discrepancy might arise from approximations in the problem's formulation. For instance, if the average photon number `<n>` were approximated to be 1, the entropy would be `S = 2ln(2) ≈ 1.386`. Given the choices, 1.38 is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
