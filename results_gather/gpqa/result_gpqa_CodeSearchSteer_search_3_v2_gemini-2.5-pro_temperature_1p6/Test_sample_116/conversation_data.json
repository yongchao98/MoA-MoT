    "Based on the analysis of the compounds and the information from the search results, here's a breakdown of their potential for optical isomerism:\n\n**1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:**\nThis molecule is a substituted biphenyl. Biphenyls can exhibit a type of stereoisomerism called atropisomerism if the rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is sterically hindered. This hindrance occurs when there are bulky groups at the ortho-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'). In this specific compound, all four ortho-positions are substituted with either nitro groups (-NO₂) or dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH₃). This substitution creates significant steric strain that restricts free rotation, leading to the existence of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). The historical discovery of atropisomerism was confirmed in a similar compound, 6,6'-dinitrodiphenic acid, which was resolved into two optically active forms. Therefore, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate shows optical isomerism.\n\n**2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\nAlso known as methyl lactate, this molecule has a central carbon atom (the second carbon) bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom bonded to four different substituents is known as a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are optically active and exist as a pair of enantiomers (D and L forms). The search results explicitly state that methyl lactate is a chiral ester and is available as a single enantiomer or a racemic mixture.\n\n**3. Benzophenone:**\nBenzophenone ((C₆H₅)₂CO) consists of a carbonyl group bonded to two phenyl groups. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the carbonyl group and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image and is therefore achiral and not optically active.\n\n**4. Dimethyl fumarate:**\nThis compound is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of but-2-enedioic acid. Due to the double bond, it has a planar structure. This planarity results in a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral and not optically active. While it has a geometric isomer (dimethyl maleate, the *cis*-isomer), it does not exhibit optical isomerism. The molecule is superimposable on its mirror image.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCompounds that exhibit optical isomerism are:\n*   **1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate** (due to atropisomerism)\n*   **2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (due to a chiral center)\n\nCompounds that do not exhibit optical isomerism are:\n*   **3. benzophenone** (achiral due to a plane of symmetry)\n*   **4. dimethyl fumarate** (achiral due to a plane of symmetry)\n\nTherefore, the correct option is the one that includes only compounds 1 and 2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
