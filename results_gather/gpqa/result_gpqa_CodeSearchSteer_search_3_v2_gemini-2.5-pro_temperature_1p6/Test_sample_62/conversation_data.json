    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the energy of the photon required to induce a transition from the fundamental state to the next lowest possible energy state in a diatomic molecule, as described by the non-rigid rotor model. From this energy, we can determine the photon's momentum.\n\n### 1. Identify the Energy States and Transition\n\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy of a state in the rotation-vibration model is given by:\n    E(v, J) = (v + ½)ħω + B J(J + 1)\n    where `v` is the vibrational quantum number, `J` is the rotational quantum number, `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration, and `B` is the rotational constant.\n\n*   **Fundamental State:** The ground or fundamental state of the molecule corresponds to the lowest possible energy, which occurs when v = 0 and J = 0.\n    E_initial = E(0, 0) = (0 + ½)ħω + B(0)(0 + 1) = ½ħω\n\n*   **Selection Rules:** For a photon to be absorbed by a diatomic molecule, causing a rovibrational transition, the selection rules are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1.\n\n*   **Final State:** Starting from the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), the only possible transition allowed by the selection rules is to the state where v = 1 (since Δv = +1) and J = 1 (since ΔJ = +1). A transition to J=-1 is not possible. Therefore, the final state is (v=1, J=1).\n    E_final = E(1, 1) = (1 + ½)ħω + B(1)(1 + 1) = ³/₂ħω + 2B\n\n*   **Energy of Absorbed Photon:** The energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between these two states.\n    ΔE = E_final - E_initial = (³/₂ħω + 2B) - (½ħω) = ħω + 2B\n\n### 2. Calculate the Necessary Constants\n\nWe are given:\n*   Mass of atom X (Mx): 20 amu\n*   Mass of atom Y (My): 2 amu\n*   Bond length (R): 2 Å = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   Angular frequency (ω): 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s\n\nWe also need the following physical constants:\n*   Atomic mass unit (amu): 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n*   Reduced Planck constant (ħ): 1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   Speed of light (c): 2.998 x 10⁸ m/s\n\n**a. Reduced Mass (μ):**\nμ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\nμ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.8182 amu\nμ ≈ 1.8182 * (1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.0192 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n**b. Moment of Inertia (I):**\nI = μ * R²\nI ≈ (3.0192 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\nI ≈ 1.2077 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n**c. Rotational Constant (B):**\nB = ħ² / (2 * I)\nB ≈ (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (2 * 1.2077 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²)\nB ≈ 1.1121 x 10⁻⁶⁸ / 2.4154 x 10⁻⁴⁶ J ≈ 4.604 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n### 3. Calculate the Photon Energy (ΔE)\n\nNow we can calculate the total energy of the transition:\nΔE = ħω + 2B\nΔE ≈ (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s * 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) + 2 * (4.604 x 10⁻²³ J)\nΔE ≈ (4.2183 x 10⁻²⁰ J) + (0.09208 x 10⁻²⁰ J)\nΔE ≈ 4.2275 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n### 4. Calculate the Photon Momentum (p)\n\nThe energy and momentum of a photon are related by the equation E = pc. Therefore, the photon's momentum is:\np = ΔE / c\np ≈ (4.2275 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.998 x 10⁸ m/s)\np ≈ 1.410 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis value is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
