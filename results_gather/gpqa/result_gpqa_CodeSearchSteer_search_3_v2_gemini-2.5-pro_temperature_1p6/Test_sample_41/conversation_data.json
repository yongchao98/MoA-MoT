    "Here is a step-by-step solution to determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1.\n\n### 1. Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\n\n`T_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n\nwhere:\n- `T_star` is the star's temperature.\n- `R_star` is the star's radius.\n- `a` is the semi-major axis (the orbital radius for a circular orbit).\n- `A` is the planet's albedo.\n\nWhen we take the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets (e.g., Planet X and Planet Y) orbiting the same star, the terms for the star's temperature and radius (`T_star`, `R_star`) cancel out. Since the problem states that the albedo (`A`) is the same for all three planets, that term also cancels out.\n\nThe ratio simplifies to:\n\n`(T_eq(X) / T_eq(Y)) = (a_Y / a_X)^(1/2)`\n\nSquaring both sides gives the relationship between the orbital radii and the equilibrium temperatures:\n\n`(a_Y / a_X) = (T_eq(X) / T_eq(Y))^2`\n\n### 2. Calculate the Ratios of Orbital Radii\n\nUsing the formula above and the given temperature ratios:\n\n*   For Planet1 and Planet2, the ratio of their orbital radii is:\n    `a₂ / a₁ = (T_eq₁ / T_eq₂)² = 1.4² = 1.96`\n\n*   For Planet2 and Planet3, the ratio of their orbital radii is:\n    `a₃ / a₂ = (T_eq₂ / T_eq₃)² = 2.3² = 5.29`\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital radii between Planet3 and Planet1, we multiply the individual ratios:\n\n`a₃ / a₁ = (a₃ / a₂) * (a₂ / a₁) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684`\n\n### 3. Apply Kepler's Third Law\n\nKepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion states that the square of the orbital period (`P`) of a planet is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`a`). For two planets orbiting the same star, the ratio is:\n\n`(P_X / P_Y)² = (a_X / a_Y)³`\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives the ratio of the orbital periods:\n\n`P_X / P_Y = (a_X / a_Y)^(3/2)`\n\n### 4. Calculate the Ratio of Orbital Periods\n\nNow, we can calculate the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1:\n\n`P₃ / P₁ = (a₃ / a₁)^(3/2)`\n`P₃ / P₁ = (10.3684)^(1.5)`\n`P₃ / P₁ ≈ 33.38`\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4. The information provided about the planetary masses and the TTV discovery method is extra detail that is not required for this calculation, as the planets' masses are negligible compared to their host star's mass.\n\nThe final answer is approximately **33.4**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
