    "The problem asks for the joint probability of measuring specific eigenvalues for the z-component of the orbital angular momentum of two electrons, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The state of the 2-electron system is given in the coupled angular momentum representation as $|l, m\\rangle = |2, -1\\rangle$, where $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$. We want to find the probability of measuring the eigenvalues of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to both be $-\\hbar$. This corresponds to finding the system in the state where the magnetic quantum numbers are $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\nIn the theory of angular momentum coupling in quantum mechanics, the total angular momentum state $|l, m\\rangle$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the uncoupled states $|l_1, m_1\\rangle|l_2, m_2\\rangle$. The coefficients of this expansion are known as Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, denoted by $\\langle l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$. The probability of measuring the system to be in a specific uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2\\rangle$ is the square of the magnitude of the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.\n\nA fundamental selection rule for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to be non-zero is that the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers must equal the total magnetic quantum number: $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n*   The total state given by $|l, m\\rangle = |2, -1\\rangle$, so $m = -1$.\n*   The measurement outcome we are interested in is $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n\nLet's check if the selection rule is satisfied:\n$m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\nSince $m_1 + m_2 = -2$ and $m = -1$, the condition $m = m_1 + m_2$ is not met.\n\nTherefore, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1, 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ is zero. The probability, which is the square of this coefficient, is also zero. This means there is a zero probability of jointly measuring $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to have eigenvalues of $-\\hbar$ each.\n\n<<<A>>>"
