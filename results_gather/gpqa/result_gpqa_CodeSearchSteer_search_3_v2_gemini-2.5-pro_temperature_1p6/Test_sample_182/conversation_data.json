    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we first need to deduce the structure of the starting material and the final product of the reaction.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Reactant and its Molecular Formula\n\nThe reactant is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Parent Structure**: Cyclohex-3-ene-1-carboxylic acid. This is a six-membered ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and 4, and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1.\n*   **Substituents**:\n    *   A formyl group (-CHO, an aldehyde) is at position 2.\n    *   A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) is at position 5.\n\nBased on this, the molecular formula of the reactant can be determined as C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\nThe **Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**, also known as the degree of unsaturation, for the reactant can be calculated using the formula:\nIHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\nIHD = 10 - (12/2) + 0/2 + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5\n\nThis IHD of 5 corresponds to:\n*   One ring (1)\n*   One C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring (1)\n*   One C=C double bond in the vinyl group (1)\n*   One C=O double bond in the formyl group (1)\n*   One C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group (1)\nTotal IHD = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus (Red P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI)**. This combination is a very strong reducing agent. It is known to reduce a wide variety of functional groups to simple alkanes.\n\n*   The **carboxylic acid group** (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The **formyl group** (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The **alkene double bond** in the cyclohexene ring will be reduced to a single bond (C-C).\n*   The **alkene double bond** in the vinyl group will be reduced, converting the vinyl group into an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Product Structure and Molecular Formula\n\nThe reaction will convert the starting molecule into a substituted cyclohexane.\n*   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The carboxylic acid at C1 becomes a methyl group.\n*   The formyl group at C2 becomes a methyl group.\n*   The vinyl group at C5 becomes an ethyl group.\n\nThe final product is a disubstituted cyclohexane, specifically an isomer of ethyl-dimethylcyclohexane (the exact numbering/name, like 4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane, isn't necessary for determining the molecular formula).\n\nThe molecular formula of the product is derived from the initial carbon skeleton (C₁₀) which is fully saturated with hydrogen atoms. The original reactant had 10 carbon atoms, and this number does not change during the reduction. The resulting product is a saturated cycloalkane with the formula **C₁₀H₂₀**. This fits the general formula for a monocyclic alkane, CₙH₂ₙ.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\n\nThe IHD of the product can be calculated from its molecular formula, C₁₀H₂₀. The formula for a saturated, acyclic alkane with 10 carbons would be C₁₀H₂₂.\n\nThe IHD is calculated as half the difference in the number of hydrogens compared to the saturated acyclic equivalent:\nIHD = (2C + 2 - H) / 2\nIHD = (2 * 10 + 2 - 20) / 2\nIHD = (22 - 20) / 2\nIHD = 2 / 2 = 1\n\nThis IHD of 1 corresponds to the single ring structure of the cyclohexane molecule. There are no remaining double or triple bonds.\n\nThus, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
