    "Here is a step-by-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Normalize the State Vector |α>\n\nThe given unnormalized state is proportional to `(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`. Let's call this state |ψ>.\nIn vector notation, `|up> = [1, 0]` and `|down> = [0, 1]`, so:\n`|ψ> = [(1+i), (2-i)]`\n\nTo normalize the state, we need to divide it by its norm. The squared norm is `<ψ|ψ>`.\n`<ψ|ψ> = |1+i|² + |2-i|²`\n`|1+i|² = 1² + 1² = 2`\n`|2-i|² = 2² + (-1)² = 5`\n`<ψ|ψ> = 2 + 5 = 7`\n\nThe normalization constant is `1/√7`.\nTherefore, the normalized state `|α>` is:\n`|α> = (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n\n### 2. Determine the Operator Matrix A\n\nThe problem states that the matrix elements are `Aij = hbar/2` if `i ≠ j` and `0` otherwise. This gives the matrix:\n`A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]`\nThis can be written as `A = (hbar/2) * σx`, where `σx` is the Pauli-X matrix.\n\n### 3. Find the Eigenstates and Eigenvalues of A\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`.\n`det([[ -λ, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -λ]]) = 0`\n`λ² - (hbar/2)² = 0`\n`λ = ± hbar/2`\n\nThe eigenvalues are `λ₁ = +hbar/2` and `λ₂ = -hbar/2`.\n\nNext, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors.\n*   **For λ₁ = +hbar/2**: The eigenvector `|v₁>` satisfies `(A - λ₁I)|v₁> = 0`. This gives `x = y`. The normalized eigenvector is `|v₁> = (1/√2) * [1, 1] = (1/√2) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n*   **For λ₂ = -hbar/2**: The eigenvector `|v₂>` satisfies `(A - λ₂I)|v₂> = 0`. This gives `x = -y`. The normalized eigenvector is `|v₂> = (1/√2) * [1, -1] = (1/√2) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Measurement Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue is the square of the magnitude of the inner product of its corresponding eigenstate with the state `|α>`.\n\n*   **Probability P(λ₁)** for `λ₁ = +hbar/2`:\n    `P(λ₁) = |<v₁|α>|²`\n    `<v₁|α> = [(1/√2)(<up| + <down|)] * [(1/√7)((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<v₁|α> = (1/√14) * (1*(1+i) + 1*(2-i)) = 3/√14`\n    `P(λ₁) = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429`\n\n*   **Probability P(λ₂)** for `λ₂ = -hbar/2`:\n    `P(λ₂) = |<v₂|α>|²`\n    `<v₂|α> = [(1/√2)(<up| - <down|)] * [(1/√7)((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<v₂|α> = (1/√14) * (1*(1+i) - 1*(2-i)) = (1/√14) * (-1 + 2i)`\n    `P(λ₂) = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571`\n\nThe probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n### 5. Find the Average (Expectation) Value of A\n\nThe average or expectation value `<A>` can be calculated in two ways:\n\n*   **Method 1: Using eigenvalues and probabilities**\n    `<A> = P(λ₁)λ₁ + P(λ₂)λ₂`\n    `<A> = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2)`\n    `<A> = (hbar/28) * (9 - 5) = 4*hbar/28 = hbar/7`\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the matrix representation `<A> = <α|A|α>`**\n    `<α|A|α> = (1/√7) * [1-i, 2+i] * [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] * (1/√7) * [[1+i], [2-i]]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [1-i, 2+i] * [[2-i], [1+i]]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [(2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1)]`\n    `<A> = (hbar/14) * [1 - 3i + 1 + 3i] = 2*hbar/14 = hbar/7`\n\nThe average value of the operator is `hbar/7`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is `hbar/7`. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
