    "I will first analyze the NMR data of the product to determine its structure.\n\n**Analysis of the Product's NMR Spectra**\n\n*   **¹³C NMR:** The signal at δ 197.7 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O), most likely a ketone conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring. The signals at δ 21.3 and 28.4 ppm correspond to two distinct aliphatic carbons, likely methyl groups. The remaining nine carbons are in the aromatic/olefinic region (δ 126.9 - 144.1 ppm).\n*   **¹H NMR:**\n    *   δ 2.28 (3H, s) and 2.31 (3H, s): These are two separate singlets, each integrating to three protons. This indicates the presence of two methyl (CH₃) groups that are not coupled to any adjacent protons. This typically means they are attached to a quaternary carbon or a double bond/aromatic ring with no adjacent protons.\n    *   δ 7.08 (2H, d) and 7.71 (2H, d): This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   δ 6.75 (1H, d) and 7.68 (1H, d): These two doublets, each for one proton, strongly suggest the presence of a disubstituted carbon-carbon double bond (-CH=CH-), where the two protons are chemically non-equivalent and are coupled to each other.\n\n**Assembling the Product's Structure**\n\nBased on the NMR analysis, the product contains the following fragments:\n1.  A ketone group (C=O).\n2.  A *para*-substituted benzene ring.\n3.  Two methyl groups.\n4.  A -CH=CH- (vinyl) group.\n\nThe molecular formula of the starting material is C₁₁H₁₂O. Since the reaction is an isomerization, the product has the same formula. Let's assemble the fragments to match this formula and the NMR data.\n\nThe presence of a *p*-disubstituted ring and two methyl groups suggests a *p*-tolyl group (CH₃-C₆H₄-) and another methyl group elsewhere. A plausible structure is an unsaturated ketone, such as a chalcone derivative. Let's propose the structure **4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\nStructure: CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃\n\n*   **Formula Check:** C₁₁H₁₂O (Tolyl group C₇H₇ + vinyl group C₂H₂ + acetyl group C₂H₃O = C₁₁H₁₂O). The formula is correct.\n*   **NMR Prediction Check:**\n    *   *p*-tolyl methyl singlet: Yes (matches δ 2.31).\n    *   Acetyl methyl singlet: Yes (matches δ 2.28).\n    *   *p*-disubstituted aromatic protons (two 2H doublets): Yes (matches δ 7.08 and 7.71).\n    *   Vinyl protons (-CH=CH-) (two 1H doublets): Yes (matches δ 6.75 and 7.68). The vinyl proton alpha to the carbonyl is typically upfield compared to the beta proton.\n\nThe proposed structure perfectly matches the product's NMR data.\n\n**Identifying the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nThe reaction involves heating Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O) with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), a non-nucleophilic base, which suggests a base-catalyzed rearrangement. The options for X are all epoxides. The rearrangement of a vinyloxirane (an epoxide adjacent to a double bond) can lead to an α,β-unsaturated ketone, which matches our product's structure. This is a known transformation, related to the Meinwald rearrangement.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options for Compound X:\n\n*   **A) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane (C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(O)CH-CH₃):** Formula C₁₁H₁₂O is correct. However, its rearrangement would lead to a product containing an unsubstituted phenyl group, not a *p*-tolyl group. Thus, this is incorrect.\n*   **B) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane (p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂):** The formula is C₁₁H₁₂O. This compound is a vinyloxirane. A plausible mechanism involves deprotonation by DABCO at the carbon between the vinyl group and the epoxide ring, followed by epoxide ring opening and tautomerization.\n    1.  *Deprotonation:* p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-**CH**(O)CH₂ + Base → p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-**C⁻**(O)CH₂\n    2.  *Ring Opening:* → p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=CH₂)O⁻\n    3.  *Tautomerization:* → p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃ (the identified product)\n    This pathway correctly yields the product.\n*   **C) 2-styrylepoxide (C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂):** The molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₀O, which does not match C₁₁H₁₂O.\n*   **D) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane (C₆H₅-CH=C(CH₃)-CH(O)CH₂):** Formula C₁₁H₁₂O is correct. However, in this molecule, the carbon atom between the vinyl group and the epoxide ring is quaternary and has no proton to be abstracted by the base. Rearrangement would likely proceed via a different, less favorable pathway, probably yielding an aldehyde, which does not match the product's NMR data.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only reactant that can form the identified product under the given conditions is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<B>>>"
