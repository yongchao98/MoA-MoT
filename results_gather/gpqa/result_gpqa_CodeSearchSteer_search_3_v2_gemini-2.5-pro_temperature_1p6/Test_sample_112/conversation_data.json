    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n### 1. Analysis of FTIR Spectrum\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a key indicator of an O-H stretching vibration. The significant broadness is characteristic of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) due to strong hydrogen bonding, often centered around 3000 cm⁻¹ and can span from 2500-3300 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, carboxylic acids show an intense C=O stretch between 1690-1760 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, which is typically found in the 1680-1640 cm⁻¹ range.\n\nThe combination of a very broad O-H stretch and a C=O stretch strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This means the molecule must contain two oxygen atoms, which eliminates options **A (C6H10O)** and **B (C6H12O)**.\n\n### 2. Analysis of 1H NMR Spectrum\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** This confirms the presence of an alkene (C=C). Vinyl hydrogens are hydrogens directly attached to the carbons of a double bond, and they typically appear in a distinct region of the 1H NMR spectrum (around 4.5-6.5 ppm). This finding supports the FTIR data indicating a C=C bond.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Mass Spectrum\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the [COOH]+ fragment (mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45).\n\n### 4. Analysis of Chemical Formulas and Degrees of Unsaturation\n\nWe are left with two possibilities: C6H10O2 and C6H12O2. To differentiate between them, we can calculate the degrees of unsaturation. The degrees of unsaturation indicate the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule.\n\nThe formula is:\nDegrees of Unsaturation = (2C + 2 + N - H - X) / 2\nWhere C = number of carbons, H = number of hydrogens, N = number of nitrogens, and X = number of halogens.\n\n*   **For C6H10O2 (Option C):**\n    Degrees of Unsaturation = (2 * 6 + 2 - 10) / 2 = (12 + 2 - 10) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2.\n    These two degrees of unsaturation perfectly match our findings: one for the C=O of the carboxylic acid and one for the C=C of the alkene.\n\n*   **For C6H12O2 (Option D):**\n    Degrees of Unsaturation = (2 * 6 + 2 - 12) / 2 = (12 + 2 - 12) / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1.\n    A single degree of unsaturation would only account for the C=O of the carboxylic acid. This formula does not allow for the presence of the C=C double bond confirmed by both FTIR and 1H NMR.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll three characterization techniques point to a compound that contains both a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond. Only the chemical formula C6H10O2 has the required two degrees of unsaturation to accommodate both of these functional groups.\n\n<<<C>>>"
