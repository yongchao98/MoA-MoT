    "Here is a detailed analysis of the products from each reaction and their behavior in different chromatography systems.\n\n### Reaction I\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This molecule is a ketone and possesses one chiral center at the C5 carbon, with an (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone is reduced to an alcohol using Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent. This reaction converts the carbonyl group at C3 into a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Product Analysis:** The reduction of the planar carbonyl group creates a new stereocenter at C3. The hydride from LAH can attack from either face of the carbonyl, leading to the formation of two possible stereoisomers. Since the original stereocenter at C5 remains unchanged, the two products formed are (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These two molecules are diastereomers because they differ at one stereocenter (C3) but are the same at another (C5).\n*   **Outcome of Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric alcohol products.\n\n### Reaction II\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone). This is a symmetrical diketone and is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to alcohols using excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBHâ‚„). This converts the diketone into a diol, pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Product Analysis:** The reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. There are three possible stereoisomers for pentane-2,4-diol:\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   meso-pentane-2,4-diol\nThe (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) forms are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them a pair of enantiomers. The third form is a meso compound because it has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral despite having two stereocenters. The meso form is a diastereomer of the other two stereoisomers.\n*   **Outcome of Reaction II:** A pair of enantiomers and a meso compound, for a total of three stereoisomeric products.\n\n### Combined Products & HPLC Analysis\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the product mixtures are combined. This gives a total of five different compounds:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n\n#### Normal-Phase HPLC\n\nA normal-phase (achiral) HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity. It cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n\n*   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the pair of enantiomers, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, have identical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a **single peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it will be separated, giving a **second peak**. This results in a total of two peaks from the products of Reaction II.\n*   The products from Reaction I (methoxyhexanols) and Reaction II (pentanediols) are structurally very different and will have different retention times.\n*   **Total Peaks:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### Chiral HPLC\n\nA chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers.\n\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated, resulting in **two peaks**.\n*   The chiral column will separate the enantiomeric pair from Reaction II, giving **two distinct peaks**. The meso compound from Reaction II is a diastereomer and will also be separated, yielding a **third peak**.\n*   Again, the compounds from Reaction I and Reaction II are different enough to elute at separate times.\n*   **Total Peaks:** 2 (from Rxn I) + 3 (from Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe final mixture will show 5 peaks in the chromatogram from the chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in the chromatogram from the normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<D>>>"
