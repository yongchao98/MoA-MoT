    "All of the provided statements regarding the molecular biology of SARS-CoV-2 are accurate, with one exception. After a thorough review of the current scientific literature, the incorrect statement is identified.\n\n**A) SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The nsp10/nsp14 complex functions as a 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease, which is essential for proofreading during viral RNA synthesis. This function involves the *degradation* or *excision* of mismatched nucleotides from the 3' end of the newly synthesized RNA strand, which is a form of breakdown. Rather than preventing the breakdown of dsRNA, the complex actively hydrolyzes it to correct errors. One report suggests this breakdown of dsRNA may also serve to inhibit host immune sensors. The claim that the complex *prevents* the breakdown of dsRNA misrepresents its fundamental proofreading activity.\n\n**B) Programmed ribosomal frameshifting creates two polyproteins near to 5` end of the genome by moving back by 1 nucleotide with the help of slippery nucleotides, and pseudoknot. The SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mostly has the same conformation as the SARS-CoV programmed ribosomal frameshifting.**\n\nThis statement is correct. Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, use a -1 programmed ribosomal frameshift (-1 PRF) to synthesize the ORF1ab polyprotein from the ORF1a frame. [8] This process is mediated by a slippery sequence and a downstream RNA pseudoknot structure. [12, 18] Studies confirm that the frameshift signals of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are highly conserved, resulting in similar frameshifting efficiencies and adopting the same overall conformation. [9, 15]\n\n**C) SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has the ability to trigger caspase-8 activation/cleavage, without affecting the expression levels of Bcl-2. Caspase-8 activation is recognized as a characteristic feature of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via death receptors, while Bcl-2 plays a crucial role in initiating the mitochondrial pathway. This suggests that the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces apoptosis is via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.**\n\nThis statement is correct. Research has shown that the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a protein is a potent inducer of apoptosis. This is achieved through the activation and cleavage of caspase-8, a key initiator of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. [5, 6] Notably, this activation occurs without altering the levels of Bcl-2, a central regulator of the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway, strongly indicating that ORF3a triggers cell death via the extrinsic route. [7, 10, 16]\n\n**D) The rate of frameshifting in vitro is linearly correlated with the number of conformations that a pseudoknot can adopt. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Programmed -1 Frameshift Signals show two conformations when under tension, similar to other pseudoknots that induce comparable frameshifting rates.**\n\nThis statement is correct. Studies using techniques like optical tweezers have explored the relationship between the physical properties of the frameshifting pseudoknot and its efficiency. It has been reported that a linear correlation exists between the in vitro frameshifting rate and the number of conformations the pseudoknot can adopt. [21] The pseudoknots of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 exhibit two main conformations when placed under mechanical tension, which is consistent with their moderate frameshifting efficiencies when compared to other viral pseudoknots.
