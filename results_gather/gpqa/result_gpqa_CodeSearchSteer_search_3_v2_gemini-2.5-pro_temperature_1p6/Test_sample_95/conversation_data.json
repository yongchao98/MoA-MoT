    "Here is a step-by-by-step derivation of the black hole's entropy:\n\n1.  **Calculate the radius of the event horizon (R):**\n    *   The distance to the galaxy is d = 10¹⁰ parsecs.\n    *   1 parsec ≈ 3.086 x 10¹⁶ meters.\n    *   d ≈ 10¹⁰ * (3.086 x 10¹⁶ m) = 3.086 x 10²⁶ m.\n    *   The angular size is θ = 10⁻¹⁷ degrees.\n    *   To use the small-angle approximation, we need to convert degrees to radians: 1 degree = π/180 radians.\n    *   θ ≈ 10⁻¹⁷ * (π/180) ≈ 1.745 x 10⁻¹⁹ radians.\n    *   For small angles, the radius R can be approximated as R = d * θ.\n    *   R ≈ (3.086 x 10²⁶ m) * (1.745 x 10⁻¹⁹) ≈ 5.385 x 10⁷ m.\n\n2.  **This radius is the Schwarzschild radius (Rₛ) of the black hole.** The Schwarzschild radius defines the event horizon for a non-rotating black hole.\n\n3.  **Calculate the area of the event horizon (A):**\n    *   The area of a sphere is A = 4πR².\n    *   A ≈ 4 * π * (5.385 x 10⁷ m)² ≈ 3.64 x 10¹⁶ m².\n\n4.  **Calculate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy (S):**\n    *   The formula for the entropy of a black hole is given by:\n        S = (kₛ * c³ * A) / (4 * ħ * G).\n    *   Where:\n        *   kₛ (Boltzmann constant) ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K\n        *   c (speed of light) ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n        *   ħ (reduced Planck constant) ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n        *   G (gravitational constant) ≈ 6.674 x 10⁻¹¹ N(m/kg)²\n\n5.  **Substitute the values into the entropy formula:**\n    *   S ≈ [ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) * (3.00 x 10⁸ m/s)³ * (3.64 x 10¹⁶ m²) ] / [ 4 * (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (6.674 x 10⁻¹¹ m³kg⁻¹s⁻²) ]\n    *   S ≈ [ (1.38 x 10⁻²³) * (27 x 10²⁴) * (3.64 x 10¹⁶) ] / [ 4 * (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴) * (6.674 x 10⁻¹¹) ] J/K\n    *   S ≈ (1.356 x 10¹⁹) / (2.814 x 10⁻⁴⁴) J/K\n    *   S ≈ 4.82 x 10⁶² J/K\n\nThe calculated entropy is approximately 4.82 x 10⁶² J/K. The order of magnitude is 10⁶².\n\n<<<C>>>"
