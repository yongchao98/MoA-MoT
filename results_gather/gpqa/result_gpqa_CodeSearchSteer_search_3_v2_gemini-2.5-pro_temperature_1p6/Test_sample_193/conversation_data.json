    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the partition function Z for the given system of three spins.\n\n### 1. Define the System and States\nThe system consists of three spins: S₁, S₂, and S₃. Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1. This gives a total of 2³ = 8 possible configurations or states for the system.\n\nThe 8 possible states are:\n*   (S₁, S₂, S₃)\n*   (+, +, +)\n*   (+, +, -)\n*   (+, -, +)\n*   (-, +, +)\n*   (+, -, -)\n*   (-, +, -)\n*   (-, -, +)\n*   (-, -, -)\n\n### 2. Write the Energy Equation\nThe energy of the system is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃]\nwhere J is the interaction energy.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Energy for Each State\nWe need to calculate the energy for each of the 8 states by substituting the spin values into the energy equation. For convenience, let's first calculate the value of the term `X = S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃` for each state.\n\n*   **State 1: (+1, +1, +1)**\n    X = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3\n    E = -3J\n\n*   **States with two spins +1 and one spin -1:**\n    *   (+, +, -): X = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1\n    *   (+, -, +): X = (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1\n    *   (-, +, +): X = (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1\n    For these three states, the energy is E = -J(-1) = J.\n\n*   **States with one spin +1 and two spins -1:**\n    *   (+, -, -): X = (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1\n    *   (-, +, -): X = (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1\n    *   (-, -, +): X = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1\n    For these three states, the energy is also E = -J(-1) = J.\n\n*   **State 8: (-1, -1, -1)**\n    X = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n    E = -3J\n\n### 4. Group States by Energy Level (Degeneracy)\nFrom the calculations above, we can see there are two distinct energy levels:\n\n*   **Energy Level E₁ = -3J:**\n    This energy level corresponds to two states: (+1, +1, +1) and (-1, -1, -1). The degeneracy (g₁) for this level is 2.\n\n*   **Energy Level E₂ = J:**\n    This energy level corresponds to the other six states. The degeneracy (g₂) for this level is 6.\n\nThe sum of degeneracies g₁ + g₂ = 2 + 6 = 8, which is the total number of states.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Partition Function (Z)\nThe partition function Z is the sum over all states of the Boltzmann factor, `exp(-βE)`, where `β = 1/(kT)`. We can write this as a sum over the energy levels, taking degeneracy into account:\n\nZ = Σᵢ gᵢ * exp(-βEᵢ)\n\nSubstituting the values we found:\n\nZ = g₁ * exp(-βE₁) + g₂ * exp(-βE₂)\nZ = 2 * exp(-β(-3J)) + 6 * exp(-β(J))\nZ = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 6 * exp(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n\nA) Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ)+6e^(Jβ)\nB) Z= 2 e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ)\nC) Z= 2e^(2Jβ)+6e^(-2Jβ)\nD) Z= 6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ)\n\nOur calculated partition function matches option B. This is a standard problem in statistical mechanics often referred to as a 3-spin Ising model on a triangular lattice.\n\n<<<B>>>"
