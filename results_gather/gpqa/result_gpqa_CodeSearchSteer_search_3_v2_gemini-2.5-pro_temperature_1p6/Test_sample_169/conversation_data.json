    "To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, ⟨S_y⟩, for an electron in the spin state |ψ⟩ = (3i, 4), we use the formula:\n\n⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩\n\nWhere:\n*   The spin state is given by the column vector `|ψ⟩ = [3i, 4]ᵀ`.\n*   The corresponding \"bra\" vector is the conjugate transpose `⟨ψ| = [-3i, 4]`.\n*   The spin operator in the y-direction is `S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y`, with `σ_y` being the Pauli matrix `[[0, -i], [i, 0]]`.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the term `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` in the denominator, which is the squared norm of the state vector:\n⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * [3i, 4]ᵀ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = -9i² + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25.\n\nNext, we calculate the action of the `S_y` operator on the state `|ψ⟩`:\nS_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i, 4]ᵀ\nS_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [(0)(3i) + (-i)(4), (i)(3i) + (0)(4)]ᵀ\nS_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-4i, 3i²]ᵀ\nS_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-4i, -3]ᵀ\n\nNow, we calculate the numerator term `⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩`:\n⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * (ħ/2) * [-4i, -3]ᵀ\n⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)]\n⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [12i² - 12]\n⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-12 - 12]\n⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-24] = -12ħ\n\nFinally, we compute the expectation value by dividing the two results:\n⟨S_y⟩ = (-12ħ) / 25 = -12ħ/25\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 12*hbar/25\nB) -25*hbar/2\nC) -12*hbar/25\nD) 25*hbar/2\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
