    "This problem requires the application of the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity (v) between the ejecta and the Galaxy is 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame (Δt₀) is 50 seconds. This is the \"proper time\" because it is measured in the frame that is moving.\n    *   The speed of light (c) is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n2.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   The objective is to find the distance traveled by the ejecta as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame. To do this, we first need to calculate how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   The Lorentz factor, γ, is essential for relativistic calculations and is given by the formula γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n    *   First, find the ratio of the velocity to the speed of light: v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2.\n    *   Next, square this ratio: (v/c)² = 0.2² = 0.04.\n    *   Now, calculate γ: γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96 ≈ 1.0206.\n\n4.  **Calculate Time Dilation:**\n    *   Time dilation describes how a moving clock runs slower relative to a stationary observer's clock. The formula is Δt = γ * Δt₀.\n    *   Using the values from the previous steps: Δt ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s.\n    *   This means that while 50 seconds have passed for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy's reference frame would measure approximately 51.03 seconds.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Distance:**\n    *   The distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame is its relative velocity multiplied by the time elapsed in that same frame.\n    *   Distance = v * Δt\n    *   Distance ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km.\n\nThis calculated distance is closest to 3,060,000 km. The minor difference is due to rounding. Without relativity, the distance would simply be 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. Because of the effects of time dilation, the distance measured from the Galaxy's frame is greater.\n\n<<<A>>>"
