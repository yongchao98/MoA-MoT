    "Based on the evidence from the search results, the following deductions can be made to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Identifying Element Y:**\n    *   Substance A1 is described as bright-red, decomposes at 293 K (20 °C), and oxidizes xenon under normal conditions.\n    *   The search results indicate that Gold(V) fluoride (AuF₅), is a red solid. Another compound, sometimes called gold heptafluoride, is now understood to be a complex of gold pentafluoride and difluorine (AuF₅·F₂). This complex is known to decompose and is an extremely powerful oxidizing agent. Another candidate, Platinum hexafluoride (PtF₆), which also oxidizes xenon, is a deep-red solid but is more stable than described. Gold(VI) fluoride (AuF₆) is a hypothetical compound that has not yet been observed.\n    *   Crucially, A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine gas. Let's reconsider the initial assumption. The problem states \"A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 ... and fluorine\". While AuF₆ is hypothetical, \"gold heptafluoride\" (AuF₅·F₂) decomposes into AuF₅ and F₂. This complex is a powerful oxidizer. Let's assume A1 is AuF₅·F₂. This would make Y = Gold (Au).\n    *   A1 = AuF₅·F₂ (let's use the empirical formula AuF₇). It decomposes: AuF₇ → AuF₅ + F₂.\n    *   This makes A2 = AuF₅.\n\n2.  **Verifying A2:**\n    *   The problem states the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is 31.96%.\n    *   Let's calculate the mass percentage of F in AuF₅. The molar mass of Au is approximately 196.97 g/mol, and F is 19.00 g/mol.\n    *   Molar mass of AuF₅ = 196.97 + 5 * 19.00 = 291.97 g/mol.\n    *   Mass percentage of F in AuF₅ = (5 * 19.00 / 291.97) * 100% ≈ 32.54%.\n    *   This value is very close to the given 31.96%. The slight discrepancy is common in such problems due to rounding or experimental values. So, A2 is confirmed as AuF₅.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Five Binary Compounds:**\n    *   The problem states five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y (Gold) are known.\n    *   The known binary fluorides of gold are AuF, AuF₃, and AuF₅.\n    *   Additionally, complexes and unstable species like AuF₂, dimeric Au₂F₆, and the AuF₅·F₂ complex exist. The problem likely refers to the main stable or semi-stable fluorides: AuF, AuF₃, AuF₅, and possibly their oligomers or complexes which could be counted. Let's assume the main ones are the most relevant.\n    *   The compounds are:\n        *   Y = Gold (Au)\n        *   A1 = AuF₇ (AuF₅·F₂)\n        *   A2 = AuF₅ (red solid)\n\n4.  **Identifying A3, A4, and A5:**\n    *   **A3** can also interact with xenon and is obtained by fluorinating element Y. Gold pentafluoride (AuF₅) fits this description. It can be synthesized by fluorinating gold and is a powerful Lewis acid known to react with xenon fluorides like XeF₂. So, **A3 = AuF₅**.\n    *   **A4** is a binary gold fluoride whose hot, concentrated solution is colorless.\n        *   AuF₅ is red.\n        *   AuF₃ is an orange-yellow solid.\n        *   While Au(I) fluoride itself is unstable, gold(I) complexes are known and are often colorless. Gold(I) is a plausible candidate for forming a colorless solution.\n        *   The prompt, however, speaks of a solution of A4. Many gold fluorides react with water. The reaction likely occurs in a non-aqueous solvent like anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride (aHF), where such species can be stable. Solutions of gold compounds in aHF are known. The color clue remains important. Au(III) solutions are typically colored. This points towards a fluoride of Au(I) or perhaps a complex fluoride ion that is colorless. Let's reconsider AuF₃. It's possible that in a specific solvent (like aHF), it forms a colorless complex anion, such as [AuF₄]⁻. Several complex anions like [AuF₄]⁻ and [AuF₆]⁻ are known. The [AuF₄]⁻ anion, containing Au(III), is square planar. The simple binary fluoride A4 is most likely AuF₃.\n    *   **A5** is obtained by adding Y (Au metal) to a solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. A5 decomposes in water.\n        *   If A4 is AuF₃, the reaction is: `Au + AuF₃ → A5` (1:1 ratio).\n        *   This suggests a comproportionation reaction, where Au(0) and Au(III) react to form a compound with an intermediate oxidation state. `Au(0) + Au(III) → ?`\n        *   A plausible product would involve Au(I). Let's balance the equation assuming the product contains Au(I): `Au(0) + AuF₃ → 3 AuF`.\n        *   This does not match the 1:1 molar ratio given.\n        *   Let's reconsider the reaction as an addition or complex formation: `Au(s) + [AuF₃]`_solv_ → `[Au₂F₃]`_solv_ or similar. The most straightforward interpretation of adding metal Y to its fluoride A4 (AuF₃) in a 1:1 ratio is the formation of a mixed-valence compound. Given the context of gold chemistry, this points to Au(I) and Au(III) species.\n        *   However, let's revisit the prompt: \"adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". A solution of AuF₃ in anhydrous HF (aHF) can form hydrogentetrafluoroaurate(III), H[AuF₄]. `AuF₃ + HF → H[AuF₄]`. A solution of this acid might be what's described.\n        *   Let's assume the reaction is: `Au + H[AuF₄] → ?` This path is becoming overly complex.\n        *   Let's stick to the simplest interpretation. A4 is a binary fluoride. The most likely candidates are AuF₃ and AuF₅. AuF₅ is red. AuF₃ is orange-yellow. A colorless solution could point to a complex ion in solution.\n        *   The disproportionation of gold(I) or comproportionation involving gold(III) and gold(0) are key reactions. The reaction `2Au + AuCl₃ → 3AuCl` is known. A similar reaction with fluoride, `2Au + AuF₃ → 3AuF`, is plausible but doesn't fit the 1:1 ratio.\n        *   What if the species in solution is a dimer, and the ratio refers to the monomer? AuF₃ is polymeric. In solution, let's assume it exists as AuF₃. If we add one mole of Au to one mole of AuF₃, we get a mixture with a 1:1 ratio.\n        *   `Au(s) + AuF₃(solv)  →  A₅(solv)`\n        *   This reaction strongly points to the formation of a mixed-valence compound containing Au(I) and Au(III). Perhaps a complex like Au(I)[Au(III)F₄]. This has a 1:1 ratio of Au(I) to Au(III), formed from Au(0) and Au(III). `2Au(0) + 2AuF₃ → 2Au[AuF₄]`. The stoichiometry is still 1:1.\n        *   Let's assume A4 is indeed **AuF₃**. The problem description (colorless solution) might be slightly inaccurate, or refer to a specific complex in solution. Let's proceed with this assumption as it is the most logical candidate among the stable binary fluorides.\n\n5.  **Determining the Molecular Weight of A4:**\n    *   We have identified A4 as Gold(III) fluoride, AuF₃.\n    *   Molar Mass (Au) = 196.9665 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass (F) = 18.9984 g/mol\n    *   Molecular Weight of AuF₃ = 196.9665 + 3 * 18.9984 = 196.9665 + 56.9952 = 253.9617 g/mol.\n\n6.  **Checking the Answer Ranges:**\n    *   The calculated molecular weight of AuF₃ is ~254.0 g/mol.\n    *   The given ranges are:\n        *   A) 220-240\n        *   B) 140-160\n        *   C) 160-180\n        *   D) 110-130\n    *   None of these ranges contain 254.0. This indicates a probable error in my identification of A4 or in the question/options provided.\n\n7.  **Re-evaluating A4:**\n    *   Let's reconsider all possibilities for A4. It must be a binary gold fluoride.\n        *   AuF: M.W. = 196.97 + 19.00 = 215.97 g/mol. (Unstable, but let's check the range). Not in any range.\n        *   AuF₃: M.W. = 253.96 g/mol. Not in any range.\n        *   AuF₅: M.W. = 291.96 g/mol. (It is red, not colorless). Not in any range.\n        *   AuF₇ (AuF₅·F₂): M.W. = 330.95 g/mol. (It is A1, not A4). Not in any range.\n        *   Perhaps A4 is not a binary fluoride but a complex formed in solution? The question states \"concentrated solution of A4\". A4 must be the solute. The prompt states \"Five binary compounds ... are known\", and A1, A2, A3, A4, A5 are these compounds. This implies A4 is a binary compound.\n        *   There is a contradiction. The calculated molecular weights of known binary gold fluorides do not match any of the provided ranges.\n\n8.  **Re-examining the entire problem for misinterpretations:**\n    *   Maybe Y is not Gold? Let's check other elements that form high oxidation state fluorides capable of oxidizing xenon (e.g., Platinum, Ruthenium, Rhodium).\n        *   PtF₆: deep red, oxidizes Xe. A1? PtF₆ → PtF₅ + F. Let's check ɷF for A2 = PtF₅. M(Pt) ≈ 195.08. M(PtF₅) = 195.08 + 5*19 = 290.08. %F = (95/290.08)*100 = 32.75%. This is very close to 31.96%. So Y could be Pt.\n        *   Let's check Platinum fluorides. PtF, PtF₂, PtF₄, PtF₅, PtF₆ are known. This fits the \"five binary compounds\" clue.\n        *   Y = Platinum (Pt)\n        *   A1 = PtF₆ (deep-red, oxidizes Xe, decomposes into PtF₅ + F)\n        *   A2 = PtF₅ (product of decomposition, ɷF ≈ 32.75% which is close to 31.96%)\n        *   A3 = Obtained by fluorinating Pt, interacts with Xe. Could be PtF₆.\n        *   A4 = A binary platinum fluoride. Solution is \"colorless\".\n            *   PtF₆: deep-red\n            *   PtF₅: red\n            *   PtF₄: yellow-brown to red-brown\n            *   This doesn't solve the \"colorless\" issue.\n    *   The \"bright-red\" description fits AuF₅·F₂ or AuF₅ better than \"deep-red\" PtF₆. Let's stick with Gold (Au) and assume there is an error in the question's data (either the ranges or the \"colorless\" description).\n\n9.  **What if A5 is A4?**\n    *   \"...adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained\". This phrasing is slightly ambiguous. It could mean A4 and A5 are related but not that the entire solution becomes A5. However, the standard reading implies A4 is the reactant and A5 is the product.\n\n10. **Revisiting the molecular weights and ranges:**\n    * Let's check the molecular weights of some *other* compounds in the sequence, in case A4 has been misidentified in the question's text.\n    * Let's check the molecular weights of hydrofluoroauric acids or their anions, just in case \"substance A4\" refers to the solute species.\n        * HAuF₄: M.W. = 1 + 196.97 + 4*19 = 273.97 g/mol.\n        * H₂AuF₆: M.W. = 2 + 196.97 + 6*19 = 312.97 g/mol.\n        * These don't fit either.\n\n11. **Final Conclusion based on deduction and elimination:**\n    *   Element Y is very likely Gold (Au).\n    *   The fluorides are AuF, AuF₃, AuF₅, and related complexes/dimers.\n    *   A1 = AuF₇ (AuF₅·F₂); A2 = AuF₅; A3 = AuF₅.\n    *   A4 must be a binary gold fluoride. The most likely options are AuF or AuF₃.\n    *   MW(AuF) = 215.97 g/mol.\n    *   MW(AuF₃) = 253.96 g/mol.\n    *   MW(AuF₅) = 291.96 g/mol.\n    *   None of the molecular weights of the simple binary fluorides fall into ranges B, C, or D. AuF (~216) is close to range A, but AuF₃ (~254) is not.\n    *   Let's scrutinize the reaction `Y + A4 -> A5` again. If Y=Au, A4=? -> A5=?.\n        *   Let's test the answer choices. Suppose the answer is B (140-160). No binary gold fluoride fits. Suppose the answer is C (160-180). No binary gold fluoride fits.\n    *   There must be an error in the problem statement or the options. Let's assume there is a typo in one of the numbers.\n    *   Let's reconsider the mass percentage calculation for A2 = AuFx.\n        *   0.3196 = (19x) / (196.97 + 19x) -> x = 4.87. This is robustly close to 5. So Y=Au, A2=AuF₅ seems certain.\n    *   Let's assume the question meant A5 falls in that range, not A4. If A4=AuF₃, then A5 could be AuF. MW(AuF) = 215.97, which is close to range A (220-240).\n    *   What if Y is another element? With Platinum, PtF₄ has a M.W. of 195.08 + 4*19 = 271.08. PtF₂ has a M.W. of 195.08 + 2*19 = 233.08. This falls in range A (220-240). Let's check this hypothesis.\n        *   Y = Pt. A1 = PtF₆. A2 = PtF₅. ɷF = 32.75% (close to 31.96%). A3 = PtF₆. Five fluorides known. This works so far.\n        *   A4 = a platinum fluoride with a \"colorless\" solution. This is still a problem.\n        *   If A4 = PtF₂, M.W. = 233.08 g/mol, which is in range **A**.\n        *   The reaction is: `Pt + PtF₂ -> A5` (1:1). This would lead to a mixed valence compound `Pt₂(II)F₂` or disproportionation, which seems unlikely. A comproportionation is more likely, but Pt(0) + Pt(II) gives Pt(I), which is common. `Pt + PtF₂ -> 2 PtF`. This fits the 1:1 molar ratio of the *reactants* Pt and PtF₂ (if A5 is considered 2 PtF). The problem says adding Y to A4, not reacting them to form something else entirely in a different ratio. A 1:1 adduct makes sense: Pt₂F₂.\n        *   This seems plausible. Let's check the options again.\n        *   A) 220-240 --> PtF₂ (M.W. 233)\n        *   The issue of the \"colorless\" solution persists for platinum fluorides, much like gold fluorides. Given this is likely a tricky competitive chemistry question, one of the details might be misleading or slightly incorrect. However, the molecular weight of PtF₂ fits perfectly into one of the ranges. This seems a stronger lead than the color.\n    *   Let's re-read the final instruction: \"indicate the range in which the molecular weight of the substance A4 falls.\" Based on the Pt hypothesis, the answer would be A.\n\n12. **Let's go back to Gold.** The evidence for Gold is strong. Bright-red A1 fits AuF₇ better than PtF₆. The F percentage for A2 fits both AuF₅ and PtF₅ reasonably well.\n    Let's assume the question or options have a typo and AuF₃ (MW ~254) is the intended A4. Which range is *closest*? None are particularly close.\n    What about the dimeric form of AuF₃, Au₂F₆? MW = 507.9 g/mol. No.\n    What about another known gold fluoride mentioned in the research, AuF₂? MW = 196.97 + 2*19 = 234.97 g/mol. This is within range A (220-240). Let's see if this works.\n    *   Y = Au. Five compounds known. Yes.\n    *   A1 = AuF₇. A2 = AuF₅. A3 = AuF₅. Yes.\n    *   A4 = AuF₂. M.W. = 235 g/mol, in range A.\n    *   Reaction: `Au(0) + AuF₂(II) → A5`. Comproportionation gives 2 AuF(I). `Au + AuF₂ -> 2 AuF`.\n    *   This is a plausible chemical reaction and fits the 1:1 molar ratio of reactants. A5 would be gold(I) fluoride. AuF decomposes in water, which fits the last clue. \"In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances\". AuF would disproportionate: `3AuF → 2Au + AuF₃`, and the AuF₃ would then react with water `2AuF₃ + 6H₂O → 2Au(OH)₃ + 6HF`. This results in two final substances, Gold metal and Gold(III) hydroxide (or Auric acid). This fits perfectly.\n    *   The only issue is the \"colorless solution\" of A4 (AuF₂). Like the other fluorides, its properties in solution are not widely documented, and color can be dependent on the solvent and complex formation. However, all other clues point strongly to A4 being AuF₂.\n    *   Therefore, Y=Au, A1=AuF₇, A2=AuF₅, A3=AuF₅, A4=AuF₂, A5=AuF.\n    *   The molecular weight of A4 (AuF₂) is ~235 g/mol. This falls squarely in the range 220-240.\n\nThe substance A4 is AuF₂ with a molecular weight of approximately 235 g/mol, which falls into the range 220-240.\n\nFinal check of the steps:\n1. Element Y is Gold (Au) because its higher fluorides are strong oxidizers (\"oxidizes xenon\") and bright red (A1).\n2. A1 is likely the AuF₅·F₂ complex (empirical formula AuF₇) as it decomposes to AuF₅ (A2) and F₂, fitting the description.\n3. A2 is AuF₅, as the fluorine mass percentage (31.96%) is very close to the calculated value for AuF₅ (~32.5%).\n4. A3 is also AuF₅, as it's a strong fluorinating agent made from gold that can react with xenon compounds.\n5. The reaction to form A5 is adding Au metal (Y) to A4 in a 1:1 ratio. The product, A5, decomposes in water into two substances.\n6. Assuming the reaction is a comproportionation, `Au(0) + Au(II)F₂ → 2 Au(I)F` is a plausible reaction that fits the 1:1 reactant ratio. This makes A4 = AuF₂ and A5 = AuF.\n7. The decomposition of A5 (AuF) in water via disproportionation (`3AuF → 2Au + AuF₃`) followed by hydrolysis of AuF₃ fits the description.\n8. The molecular weight of A4 (AuF₂) is 196.97 + 2 * 19.00 = 234.97 g/mol.\n9. This molecular weight falls into the range 220-240.\n\n<<<A>>>"
