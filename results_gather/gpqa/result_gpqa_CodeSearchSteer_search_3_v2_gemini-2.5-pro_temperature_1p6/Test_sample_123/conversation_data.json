    "This problem can be solved by using the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation, and the law of radioactive decay.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Survival Probability:** The fraction of particles that survive after a certain time is governed by the exponential decay law. In the laboratory frame, the survival probability (F) of a particle after traveling a time `t_lab` is given by:\n    `F = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n    where `τ_lab` is the particle's mean lifetime in the lab frame.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** Due to time dilation, a particle moving at a relativistic speed has a longer mean lifetime in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) compared to its proper mean lifetime (`τ₀`, its lifetime in its own rest frame). The relationship is:\n    `τ_lab = γ * τ₀`\n    where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Time of Flight:** The particles are ultra-relativistic, meaning their speed `v` is very close to the speed of light, `c`. The time it takes for them to travel the detector radius `L` in the lab frame is:\n    `t_lab = L / v ≈ L / c`\n\n4.  **Combined Formula:** Substituting the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab` into the survival probability formula, we get:\n    `F = exp(-(L/c) / (γ * τ₀)) = exp(-L / (γ * c * τ₀))`\n\n5.  **Applying the Initial Conditions:** We are given that for a Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, the fraction of particles reaching the detector is `F₁ = 1/3`. The detector radius `L` is 30 meters.\n    `1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * c * τ₀))`\n\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * c * τ₀)`\n    `-ln(3) = -1.5 / (c * τ₀)`\n\n    This allows us to determine the constant term `c * τ₀`, which represents the particle's mean free path in its rest frame.\n    `c * τ₀ = 1.5 / ln(3)`\n\n6.  **Solving for the New Lorentz Factor:** We want to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, for which the survival fraction is `F₂ = 2/3`.\n    `2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * c * τ₀))`\n\n    Again, taking the natural logarithm:\n    `ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ₀)`\n    `-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ₀)`\n    `ln(1.5) = 30 / (γ₂ * c * τ₀)`\n\n    Now, substitute the expression for `c * τ₀` that we found in the previous step:\n    `ln(1.5) = 30 / (γ₂ * (1.5 / ln(3)))`\n    `ln(1.5) = (30 * ln(3)) / (1.5 * γ₂)`\n    `ln(1.5) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Solve for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)`\n\n    Using the approximate values for the natural logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThis calculated value is closest to 54.\n\n<<<C>>>"
