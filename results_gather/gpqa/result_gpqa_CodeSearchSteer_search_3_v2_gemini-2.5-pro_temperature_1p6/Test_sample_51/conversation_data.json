    "The final checks confirm the reasoning.\n- The Boltzmann equation relates the population of two energy levels (N1, N2) to the temperature T and the energy difference ΔE. The ratio of populations N2/N1 for energy levels E2 > E1 is given by N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE / (kT)), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights.\n- The problem states that the ratio of the number of atoms between level 1 and level 2 decreases when the star has spots (lower temperature). Let's call this ratio R. So, R_spots < R_nospots.\n  - If R = N1/N2 (lower/upper), then R is proportional to exp(ΔE/kT). As T decreases, 1/T increases, so R would *increase*. This contradicts the problem statement.\n  - If R = N2/N1 (upper/lower), then R is proportional to exp(-ΔE/kT). As T decreases, 1/T increases, and -1/T decreases, so R *decreases*. This matches the problem statement.\n- Therefore, the ratio in question is R = N2/N1.\n- I need to find the factor by which the ratio changes, which is R_nospots / R_spots.\n- Factor = R_nospots / R_spots = exp[(-ΔE/k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots)].\n- The energy difference ΔE can be calculated from the wavelength λ using the formula ΔE = hc/λ.\n- Using hc ≈ 1240 eV·nm and λ = 144.8 nm, ΔE ≈ 8.56 eV.\n- The Boltzmann constant k ≈ 8.617 x 10^-5 eV/K.\n- T_nospots = 6000 K\n- T_spots = 5500 K\n- Factor = exp [ (-8.56 / 8.617e-5) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) ]\n- Factor = exp [ -99338 * (-1.51515e-5) ]\n- Factor = exp(1.5051) ≈ 4.50\nThe calculation is consistent and the result strongly points to option A. The information about the star's radius, mass, and spot coverage percentage is not needed for the final calculation as the effective temperatures for both states are provided directly.\n\nFinal calculation:\n1.  **Determine the ratio formulation**: The problem states that the ratio of atom populations in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases as the temperature drops. The population of a higher energy level is more sensitive to temperature than a lower one. According to the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of the population of a higher energy level (N_upper) to a lower energy level (N_lower) is proportional to `exp(-ΔE/kT)`. As temperature (T) decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, causing the ratio to decrease. This matches the problem's description. Therefore, the ratio being examined is N_upper / N_lower.\n\n2.  **Calculate the energy difference (ΔE)**: The transition wavelength (λ) is given as 1448 Å, which is 144.8 nm. The energy difference ΔE is related to the wavelength by the Planck-Einstein relation, ΔE = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.\n    *   A convenient form of this relation is ΔE (in eV) ≈ 1240 / λ (in nm).\n    *   ΔE ≈ 1240 eV·nm / 144.8 nm ≈ 8.5635 eV.\n\n3.  **Set up the factor calculation**: We need to find the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. This is the ratio of the ratios: Factor = R_nospots / R_spots.\n    *   R_nospots ∝ exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots))\n    *   R_spots ∝ exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))\n    *   Factor = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))\n    *   Factor = exp [ (-ΔE/k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) ]\n\n4.  **Perform the calculation**:\n    *   T_nospots = 6000 K\n    *   T_spots = 5500 K\n    *   ΔE = 8.5635 eV\n    *   k (Boltzmann constant) = 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K\n    *   ΔE/k ≈ 8.5635 / (8.617 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 99379 K\n    *   (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) = (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (11 - 12) / 66000 = -1 / 66000 K⁻¹\n    *   Exponent = (-99379 K) * (-1 / 66000 K⁻¹) ≈ 1.5057\n    *   Factor = exp(1.5057) ≈ 4.507\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.5. This corresponds to option A.\n\nThe logic and calculations are sound. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\nThe problem asks for the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when a star goes from having 40% of its surface covered by dark spots to having no spots.\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical law**: The distribution of atoms among different energy levels in a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in an upper energy level (N₂) to a lower energy level (N₁) is given by:\n    R = N₂/N₁ = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    where g₁ and g₂ are the statistical weights of the levels, ΔE is the energy difference between them, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.\n\n2.  **Determine the direction of the ratio change**: The problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. When the star has spots, its effective temperature is lower (T_spots = 5500 K) than when it has no spots (T_nospots = 6000 K). In the formula R ∝ exp(-ΔE/kT), as T decreases, 1/T increases, making the exponent (-ΔE/kT) more negative. This causes the ratio R to decrease. This matches the observation given in the problem, confirming that the ratio in question is indeed N_upper / N_lower.\n\n3.  **Calculate the energy difference (ΔE)**: The transition between the two energy levels corresponds to a photon with a wavelength (λ) of 1448 Å (or 1.448 x 10⁻⁷ m). The energy difference is calculated using the formula ΔE = hc/λ. It's often convenient to work in electronvolts (eV).\n    *   Using the constant hc ≈ 1240 eV·nm:\n    *   λ = 1448 Å = 144.8 nm\n    *   ΔE = 1240 eV·nm / 144.8 nm ≈ 8.56 eV.\n\n4.  **Calculate the factor**: We need to find the ratio of the ratios, F = R_nospots / R_spots. The statistical weight term (g₂/g₁) cancels out.\n    *   F = [exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots))] / [exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))]\n    *   F = exp[(-ΔE/k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots)]\n    *   We have T_nospots = 6000 K and T_spots = 5500 K.\n    *   The value of the Boltzmann constant (k) is approximately 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K.\n    *   The term ΔE/k is: 8.56 eV / (8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K) ≈ 99340 K.\n    *   The term in the parentheses is: (1/6000 - 1/5500) K⁻¹ = (11 - 12) / 66000 K⁻¹ = -1 / 66000 K⁻¹.\n    *   Plugging these values into the exponent: Exponent = (-99340 K) * (-1 / 66000 K⁻¹) ≈ 1.505.\n    *   F = exp(1.505) ≈ 4.50.\n\nThe factor by which the ratio changes is approximately 4.5. The additional information about the star's radius and mass is not required for this specific calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
