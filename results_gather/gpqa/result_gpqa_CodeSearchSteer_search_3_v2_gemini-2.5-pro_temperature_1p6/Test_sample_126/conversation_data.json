    "When 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated, it undergoes a thermal rearrangement reaction known as the Cope rearrangement. This reaction is a specific type of pericyclic reaction called a-sigmatropic rearrangement, which is common for 1,5-dienes. The reaction proceeds through a single, concerted step involving a cyclic transition state.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactant and Reaction Type:** The starting molecule is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Its structure contains a 1,5-diene system, which is the prerequisite for the Cope rearrangement. Heating provides the energy needed to overcome the activation energy for this rearrangement.\n    *   **Reactant Structure:** `CH₃-CH(2)=CH(3)-CH₂(4)-CH(5)(C₄H₉)-CH(6)=CH(7)-CH₂-CH₃`\n\n2.  **Mechanism of the Cope Rearrangement:** In this-sigmatropic rearrangement, the sigma (σ) bond between carbons 4 and 5 breaks. Simultaneously, a new sigma bond forms between carbons 2 and 7. The pi (π) bonds also shift: the double bond between C2 and C3 moves to between C3 and C4, and the double bond between C6 and C7 moves to between C5 and C6.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product Structure:** Tracing the connectivity of the atoms after the rearrangement gives the following structure:\n    *   The original methyl group (C1) is on C2.\n    *   The original butyl group is on C5.\n    *   The original ethyl group (C8-C9) is attached to C7.\n    *   This results in the molecule: `CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH=CH-(CH₂)₃CH₃`\n\n4.  **Name the Product:** To name the resulting molecule according to IUPAC nomenclature, we first identify the longest carbon chain that contains both double bonds.\n    *   The longest chain has 10 carbon atoms, making it a decadiene.\n    *   Numbering the chain starts from the end that gives the double bonds the lowest possible locants (positions). Numbering begins at the `CH₂=` end.\n    *   The double bonds are at positions 1 and 5 (`deca-1,5-diene`).\n    *   The substituents on this chain are a methyl group at position 3 and an ethyl group at position 4.\n    *   Alphabetizing the substituents gives the final name: **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, the correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
