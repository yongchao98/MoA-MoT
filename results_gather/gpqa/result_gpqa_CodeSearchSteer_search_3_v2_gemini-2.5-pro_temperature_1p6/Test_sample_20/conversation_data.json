    "**A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n*   **Tautomerism** is a type of isomerism where a molecule can exist in two or more readily interconvertible structures that differ in the relative position of at least one atomic nucleus, which is typically a hydrogen atom. Keto-enol tautomerism is a common type that involves the migration of a proton and a shift in the location of a double bond. A necessary condition for most keto-enol tautomerism is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen—a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n*   **Benzoquinone** (specifically p-benzoquinone) is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the double bonds and do not have any hydrogen atoms attached. Lacking an alpha-hydrogen, benzoquinone does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione** possesses alpha-hydrogens on the carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6, which are located between the carbonyl groups. Therefore, it can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), is particularly stable because it is an aromatic compound, which means the equilibrium strongly favors the enol form.\n*   Therefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n*   **Optical isomerism** occurs in molecules that are chiral, meaning they are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common source of chirality is a stereocenter, such as a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (also known as methyl lactate) has the formula CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydrogen (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). This makes the carbon a chiral center, and thus the molecule exhibits optical isomerism, existing as L and D isomers.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate** is the trans isomer of the molecule with the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar around the central C=C double bond and has a plane of symmetry. It does not contain a chiral center and is not a chiral molecule. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n*   Therefore, the compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nBased on this analysis, A is benzoquinone and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
