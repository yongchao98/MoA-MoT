    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as an extension of the Standard Model (SM), incorporating higher-dimensional operators to parametrize the effects of new physics at a higher energy scale. The construction of these operators adheres to certain fundamental symmetries.\n\n1.  **Lorentz and Poincare Symmetry:** SMEFT is built upon the foundational principles of quantum field theory, which include the symmetries of spacetime. A core assumption is that the underlying theory is a local, Poincare-invariant quantum field theory. Poincare symmetry encompasses both translations in spacetime and Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts). Therefore, all operators in the SMEFT Lagrangian must be constructed to be singlets under Lorentz transformations, ensuring the theory respects both Lorentz and the broader Poincare symmetry. Theories that intentionally violate these symmetries are categorized differently, for instance, as the Standard-Model Extension (SME).\n\n2.  **CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a cornerstone of quantum field theory. It states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be symmetric under the combined transformation of Charge conjugation (C), Parity (P), and Time-reversal (T). Since SMEFT is constructed to be a Lorentz-invariant and local effective field theory, it must respect CPT symmetry.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry:** The Standard Model itself contains sources of CP violation, notably through a complex phase in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix. Because the SM is not fully CP-symmetric, there is no requirement for the effective operators in SMEFT to be CP-symmetric either. In fact, SMEFT introduces a framework for many new potential sources of CP violation beyond the Standard Model. Numerous studies focus on classifying and constraining these CP-violating operators.\n\nBased on this, the symmetries that all operators in the SMEFT must respect are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<A>>>"
