    "Here is the step-by-step synthesis of the final product:\n\n*   **Step 1: Nitration of Benzene**\n    Benzene is treated with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO₃) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction known as nitration. The reaction introduces a nitro group (-NO₂) onto the benzene ring to form nitrobenzene (Product 1).\n\n*   **Step 2: Bromination of Nitrobenzene**\n    Product 1, nitrobenzene, is treated with bromine (Br₂) and iron powder. The iron reacts with bromine to form iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃), a Lewis acid catalyst. The nitro group is a deactivating group and a meta-director. Therefore, the incoming bromine atom is directed to the position meta to the nitro group, yielding 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene (Product 2).\n\n*   **Step 3: Reduction of the Nitro Group**\n    Product 2, 1-bromo-3-nitrobenzene, is stirred with a palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere (H₂). This reaction selectively reduces the nitro group to an amino group (-NH₂) without affecting the bromo-substituent. The resulting compound is 3-bromoaniline (Product 3).\n\n*   **Step 4: Diazotization**\n    Product 3, 3-bromoaniline, is treated with sodium nitrite (NaNO₂) and tetrafluoroboric acid (HBF₄). This is a diazotization reaction that converts the primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. The product is 3-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate (Product 4).\n\n*   **Step 5: Aryl-Aryl Coupling**\n    Product 4, the diazonium salt, is heated and then treated with anisole (methoxybenzene). This is a Gomberg-Bachmann reaction, which is a method for forming a new carbon-carbon bond between two aromatic rings. The 3-bromobenzenediazonium salt generates a 3-bromophenyl radical (or cation), which then attacks the anisole ring. The methoxy group (-OCH₃) on anisole is an ortho, para-director. Due to steric hindrance, the attack preferentially occurs at the para position. This coupling results in the formation of **3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl** (Product 5).\n\nBased on the reaction sequence, the final product is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.\n\n<<<B>>>"
