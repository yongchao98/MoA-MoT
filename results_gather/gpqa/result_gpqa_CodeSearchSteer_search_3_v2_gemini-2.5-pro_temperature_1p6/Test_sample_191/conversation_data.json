    "Here's a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the principles of electrostatics:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** When a positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity, it attracts the free electrons within the conductor. These electrons accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity, inducing a total charge of `-q` there.\n\n2.  **Charge Conservation:** The spherical conductor was initially uncharged. To maintain its overall electrical neutrality, a charge of `+q` must appear on its outer surface to balance the `-q` induced on the inner surface.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** The conductor acts as an electrostatic shield. This means the arrangement of the charge `+q` inside the cavity and the induced charge `-q` on the cavity's surface have no effect on the electric field outside the conductor. The electric field at any point outside the conductor is produced solely by the charge on its outer surface.\n\n4.  **Field of a Spherical Conductor:** The charge `+q` on the outer surface of the spherical conductor will distribute itself uniformly because of the symmetrical shape of the conductor.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** For any point outside a uniformly charged sphere, the electric field is the same as that of a point charge with the same total charge located at the sphere's center. The point P is at a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor. Therefore, the electric field at point P is determined only by the charge `+q` on the outer surface, treated as a point charge at the center of the large sphere.\n\nThe formula for the electric field `E` at a distance `L` from a point charge `q` is given by Coulomb's Law:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe other variables, such as the cavity's radius `r`, its distance from the center `s`, the distance `l`, and the angle `Î¸`, are all irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor due to the shielding effect.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
