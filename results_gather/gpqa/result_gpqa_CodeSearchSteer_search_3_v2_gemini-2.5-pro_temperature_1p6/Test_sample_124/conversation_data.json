    "For a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2r^2$. The energy eigenvalues of this system are quantized and can be determined by the formula:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\nwhere $n = n_x + n_y + n_z = 0, 1, 2, ...$, and $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are the quantum numbers corresponding to the harmonic motion along the x, y, and z axes, respectively.\n\nThe different energy states are:\n*   **Ground State (n=0):** This is the lowest energy level.\n    $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **First Excited State (n=1):**\n    $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Second Excited State (n=2):**\n    $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n*   **Third Excited State (n=3):**\n    $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\nThus, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level is known as the degeneracy of that level. For the n-th excited state of the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy, $g_n$, is given by the formula:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\n\nFor the third excited state, we have n=3. Substituting this into the degeneracy formula:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$\n\nThis degeneracy can also be found by counting the possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:\n*   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) - which gives 3 states.\n*   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) - which gives 6 states.\n*   The combination (1, 1, 1): (1,1,1) - which gives 1 state.\n\nThe total number of linearly independent eigenfunctions is the sum of these possibilities: 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2)\\hbar\\omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for this energy eigenvalue.\n\n<<<C>>>"
