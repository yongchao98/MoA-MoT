    "To determine the factor by which System 1 is more massive than System 2, we can use the principles of orbital mechanics applied to double-lined spectroscopic binary stars. For such systems, the total mass (the sum of the masses of the two stars, M = m₁ + m₂) can be related to the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K₁ and K₂).\n\n### Key Formula\n\nThe total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system is given by the formula derived from Kepler's Third Law:\nM = (P / (2πG)) * (K₁ + K₂ )³ / sin³(i)\n\nWhere:\n*   **M** is the total mass of the system (m₁ + m₂).\n*   **P** is the orbital period.\n*   **K₁** and **K₂** are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars.\n*   **G** is the gravitational constant.\n*   **i** is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n\nThe problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This is crucial information, as it implies that the orbital inclination, *i*, is very close to 90 degrees for both systems. When *i* ≈ 90°, sin(i) ≈ 1, and sin³(i) ≈ 1. This simplifies the mass calculation significantly.\n\n### Applying to the Systems\n\nWe can establish a ratio of the mass of System 1 (M₁) to the mass of System 2 (M₂). The constant terms (2πG) and the sin³(i) factor (since it's approximately 1 for both) will cancel out.\n\nThe ratio is:\nM₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ)³] / [P₂ * (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ)³]\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Period (P₁) = 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Period (P₂) = 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n### Calculation\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the ratio formula. We can use the periods in years and velocities in km/s, as the units will cancel out.\n\nM₁ / M₂ = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\n\nFirst, calculate the cubes of the velocities:\n*   15³ = 3,375\n*   25³ = 15,625\n\nNow plug these back into the ratio:\nM₁ / M₂ = (2 * 3,375) / (1 * 15,625)\nM₁ / M₂ = 6,750 / 15,625\n\nFinally, calculate the decimal value:\nM₁ / M₂ = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
