    "Here is a breakdown of the analysis to determine the two aromatic compounds in the mixture:\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Provided ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₁₀H₁₄ for both compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlet signals are observed at approximately 6.7 ppm, and they have a 1:1 integration ratio. This indicates that there are two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture, and each type is present in equal amounts. The singlet nature of these signals means the aromatic protons do not have any adjacent proton neighbors.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** Three singlet signals are seen at roughly 2.2 ppm with an integration ratio of 2:1:1. These signals correspond to the protons of the methyl (–CH₃) groups attached to the aromatic rings. Since they are all singlets, none of the methyl groups are adjacent to protons that would cause splitting. The presence of three distinct signals indicates three different chemical environments for the methyl groups in the mixture.\n\n### **2. Predicted ¹H NMR Spectra for Each Option**\n\nLet's predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds to see which pair would match the experimental data when mixed.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   *Symmetry:* This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   *Aromatic Protons:* The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal, which will be a singlet because they are not adjacent to any other ring protons.\n    *   *Alkyl Protons:* Due to the molecule's symmetry, all four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, resulting in one singlet signal for all 12 methyl protons.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   *Symmetry:* This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   *Aromatic Protons:* The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will appear as a single singlet.\n    *   *Alkyl Protons:* The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent to each other, and the methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 are also equivalent to each other. This results in two distinct singlet signals with a 6H:6H, or 1:1, integration ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   *Symmetry:* This molecule is less symmetrical.\n    *   *Aromatic Protons:* The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments and will produce two separate singlet signals.\n    *   *Alkyl Protons:* There are three sets of chemically different methyl groups: the one at C5, the two equivalent ones at C1 and C3, and the one at C2. This leads to three singlet signals with an integration ratio of 3H:6H:3H, which simplifies to 1:2:1.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   *Symmetry:* This molecule is symmetrical.\n    *   *Aromatic Protons:* All four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent and will show as a single singlet.\n    *   *Alkyl Protons:* The signals for the ethyl groups would not be singlets. The –CH₂– protons would be a quartet, and the –CH₃– protons would be a triplet. This is inconsistent with the data.\n\n### **3. Evaluating the Mixture**\n\nThe correct pair of compounds must combine to produce a total of two aromatic singlets and three alkyl singlets in the specified ratios. Let's examine the proposed mixture in option D.\n\n**Mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene in a 1:1 ratio:**\n\n*   **Aromatic Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (for its 2 equivalent protons).\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (for its 2 equivalent protons).\n    *   **Total:** This gives a total of **two aromatic singlets**. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 mixture and each singlet represents 2 protons, the integration ratio will be 1:1. This perfectly matches the observed data.\n\n*   **Alkyl Signals:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet (representing all 12 of its methyl protons).\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes two singlets (each representing 6 methyl protons).\n    *   **Total:** This gives a total of **three alkyl singlets**.\n    *   **Integration Ratio:** The ratio of the protons for these three singlets will be 12H (from 1,2,4,5-TMB) : 6H (from 1,2,3,4-TMB) : 6H (from 1,2,3,4-TMB). This simplifies to a **2:1:1** ratio. This also perfectly matches the observed data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only pair that explains the observed ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
