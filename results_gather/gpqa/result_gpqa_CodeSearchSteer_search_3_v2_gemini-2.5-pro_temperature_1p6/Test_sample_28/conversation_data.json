    "To eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, the most effective mutation would be one that results in a complete loss of function of the enzyme responsible for its synthesis. This is most reliably achieved by a mutation that prevents the formation of a functional protein. Let's analyze the effects of each mutation on the protein sequence by examining the gene's codons (three-nucleotide sequences).\n\n**Intact Gene Analysis:**\nThe initial codons of the functional gene are:\n- `ATG` -> Methionine (Start codon)\n- `TTT` -> Phenylalanine\n- `CTC` -> Leucine\n- `GCT` -> Alanine\n- The protein sequence begins: Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-...\n\n**Analysis of the Mutants:**\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-ATG**TTC** **TAC**GCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\n    *   The `TTT` codon is changed to `TTC`. Both code for Phenylalanine, so this part is a silent mutation.\n    *   The `CTC` codon (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which swaps one amino acid for another. While this could potentially disrupt protein function, it might also have little to no effect, making it less certain to eliminate the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-ATG**TTC** **TAA**GCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\n    *   Similar to Mutant 1, `TTT` changes to `TTC` (silent).\n    *   The crucial change is `CTC` (Leucine) to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **nonsense mutation**, also known as a stop codon. This mutation signals the cell's machinery to stop protein synthesis prematurely. The resulting protein would be only two amino acids long (Met-Phe), rendering it completely non-functional.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n    *   This sequence is three base pairs longer than the intact gene's sequence, suggesting an in-frame insertion of a full codon. This would add an extra amino acid to the protein. While this could alter the protein's function, it is not as definitively disruptive as a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n    *   This sequence is three base pairs shorter than the intact gene's, indicating a deletion of one full codon. This leads to the loss of one amino acid. Like an in-frame insertion, this might alter or eliminate function, but it is not as guaranteed as a premature stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nA nonsense mutation that introduces a premature stop codon is one of the most severe types of mutations, typically leading to a complete loss of protein function. Similarly, a frameshift mutation (caused by an insertion or deletion not divisible by three) also drastically alters the protein and usually eliminates function.\n\nBetween the given options, Mutant 2 introduces a stop codon at the very beginning of the protein sequence (the third codon). This is the most direct and certain method among the choices to ensure a non-functional, truncated protein is produced, thereby eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<A>>>"
