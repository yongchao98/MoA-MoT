    "The reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. The number of possible products can be determined by analyzing the steps of this mechanism.\n\n### The Reaction Mechanism\n\n1.  **Elimination Step (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates):**\n    Sodium amide is a very strong base. It initiates the reaction by removing an acidic proton (or deuteron in this case) from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the one bearing the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such positions:\n    *   **Position 6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H). The amide ion can remove this proton.\n    *   **Position 2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D). The amide ion can also remove this deuteron.\n\n    Due to the kinetic isotope effect, breaking a C-H bond is faster than breaking a C-D bond. Therefore, two different benzyne intermediates are formed:\n\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** Removal of the proton from C-6, followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C-1, results in the formation of a triple bond between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom at C-2 remains in the molecule. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** Removal of the deuteron from C-2, followed by the loss of the bromide ion from C-1, forms a triple bond between C-1 and C-2. In this process, the deuterium atom is eliminated. This intermediate is **benzyne** (with no deuterium).\n\n2.  **Addition Step (Nucleophilic Attack):**\n    The highly reactive benzyne intermediates are then attacked by the nucleophilic amide ion (NH2⁻). The resulting carbanion is subsequently protonated by the ammonia solvent to yield the final products.\n\n    *   **From 3-deuterobenzyne (Pathway A):** The amide ion can attack either carbon of the triple bond (C-1 or C-6).\n        *   Attack at C-1 leads to the formation of **2-deuteroaniline** (ortho-deuteroaniline), where the amino group and the deuterium are on adjacent carbons.\n        *   Attack at C-6 leads to the formation of **3-deuteroaniline** (meta-deuteroaniline), where there is one carbon between the amino group and the deuterium.\n\n    *   **From benzyne (Pathway B):** The amide ion can attack either C-1 or C-2 of the non-deuterated benzyne intermediate. In either case, after protonation, the product is **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂), which contains no deuterium.\n\n### The Possible Organic Products\n\nBased on the two-step mechanism, three distinct organic products can be formed in this reaction:\n1.  **Aniline** (from the non-deuterated benzyne intermediate).\n2.  **2-Deuteroaniline** (from the deuterated benzyne intermediate).\n3.  **3-Deuteroaniline** (from the deuterated benzyne intermediate).\n\nTherefore, there are a total of three possible organic products.\n\n<<<C>>>"
