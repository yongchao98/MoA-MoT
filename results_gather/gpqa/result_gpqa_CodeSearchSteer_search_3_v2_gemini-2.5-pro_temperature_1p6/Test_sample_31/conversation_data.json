    "I have found the necessary information to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Define the Nucleus and its Mass\n\n*   The user specified nucleus X as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n*   Lithium has an atomic number of 3 (3 protons).\n*   Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 (³⁺³Li), with 3 protons and 3 neutrons.\n*   The isotopic mass of a Lithium-6 atom is 6.015122887 u. This is the mass of the nucleus plus its 3 electrons. The question concerns the nucleus, so I need the mass of the nucleus itself.\n*   Source provides the calculated nuclear mass (without electrons) as **6.0134771 u**. This is the value I will use for the rest mass `m₀`.\n\n### 2. Constants and Given Values\n\n*   Speed of the nucleus, `v = 0.96c`.\n*   Conversion factor from atomic mass units (u) to MeV/c²: `1 u = 931.49410242 MeV/c²`.\n*   Rest mass `m₀ = 6.0134771 u`.\n\n### 3. Calculation Steps\n\n**a. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\nThe Lorentz factor is given by the formula:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96c)²/c²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\nγ = 1 / √(0.0784)\nγ = 1 / 0.28\n**γ ≈ 3.57142857**\n\n**b. Calculate the Rest Energy (E₀):**\nFirst, convert the rest mass from atomic mass units (u) to MeV/c².\nm₀ = 6.0134771 u * 931.49410242 MeV/c²/u\nm₀ ≈ 5602.4357 MeV/c²\n\nTherefore, the rest energy E₀ = m₀c² is **5602.4357 MeV**.\n\n**c. Calculate the Total Energy (E):**\nThe total energy is given by the formula E = γ * E₀.\nE = 3.57142857 * 5602.4357 MeV\nE ≈ 20008.6989 MeV\n\n**d. Convert Total Energy to GeV:**\nTo compare with the options, I'll convert MeV to GeV by dividing by 1000.\nE = 20008.6989 MeV / 1000\n**E ≈ 20.0087 GeV**\n\n### 4. Compare with Options\n\n*   A) 21.419 GeV\n*   B) 20.132 GeV\n*   C) 23.069 GeV\n*   D) 18.475 GeV\n\nMy calculated value is approximately 20.0087 GeV. Option B is 20.132 GeV. Let me re-check the precision of the constants and the calculation.\n\nIt's possible the question intended for the atomic mass to be used instead of the nuclear mass. Let's recalculate with the atomic mass `m_a = 6.015122887 u`.\n\n**a. Lorentz Factor (γ):**\nRemains the same: **γ ≈ 3.57142857**\n\n**b. Calculate Rest Energy (E₀) using atomic mass:**\nm_a = 6.015122887 u * 931.49410242 MeV/c²/u\nm_a ≈ 5603.9664 MeV/c²\nE₀ ≈ 5603.9664 MeV\n\n**c. Calculate Total Energy (E) using atomic rest energy:**\nE = 3.57142857 * 5603.9664 MeV\nE ≈ 20014.1657 MeV\n\n**d. Convert Total Energy to GeV:**\nE = 20014.1657 MeV / 1000\n**E ≈ 20.014 GeV**\n\nThis value is still closest to 20.132 GeV, but there is a discrepancy. Let me try to use the binding energy per nucleon to build the mass from scratch to see if that gives a different value.\n\nFrom source, the binding energy per nucleon for Lithium-6 is 5.332427333 MeV.\nThe total binding energy is 31.994564 MeV.\n\nMass of 3 free protons = 3 * 938.272 MeV/c²\nMass of 3 free neutrons = 3 * 939.565 MeV/c²\nTotal mass of constituents = 3 * (938.272 + 939.565) = 3 * 1877.837 = 5633.511 MeV/c²\nMass of nucleus = Total mass of constituents - Total binding energy\nMass of nucleus = 5633.511 MeV/c² - 31.994564 MeV/c² = 5601.5164 MeV/c²\nRest Energy E₀ = 5601.5164 MeV\n\nTotal Energy E = γ * E₀ = 3.57142857 * 5601.5164 MeV\nE ≈ 20005.415 MeV\nE ≈ 20.005 GeV\n\nAll my calculations point to an energy of ~20.01 GeV. Option B is 20.132 GeV. This is a difference of about 0.12 GeV or 120 MeV. This is a significant difference.\n\nLet's check the constants I'm using.\n`v = 0.96c` -> `v/c = 0.96`.\n`1 - (v/c)² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784`.\n`sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28`.\n`γ = 1/0.28` is correct.\n\nLet's assume the energy in option B (20.132 GeV) is correct and work backwards to find the rest mass that would be required.\nE = 20.132 GeV = 20132 MeV\nE₀ = E / γ = 20132 MeV / 3.57142857\nE₀ ≈ 5637.0 MeV\n\nThis corresponds to a rest mass of ~5.637 GeV/c².\nLet's convert this to atomic mass units.\nm₀ = 5637.0 MeV / 931.494 MeV/u ≈ 6.0516 u.\n\nThis is different from the known mass of Lithium-6 (around 6.015 u). There seems to be a discrepancy in the problem statement or the options provided. However, given the choices, my calculated value of ~20.01 GeV is closest to 20.132 GeV.\n\nLet me review the process one more time.\nNucleus: ⁶Li (3 protons, 3 neutrons)\nRest mass (nucleus): 6.0134771 u\nRest energy E₀ = 6.0134771 u * 931.4941 MeV/u = 5602.436 MeV\nSpeed v = 0.96c\nLorentz factor γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²) = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714\nTotal Energy E = γ * E₀ = 3.5714 * 5602.436 MeV ≈ 20008.7 MeV ≈ 20.009 GeV\n\nThe closest answer is B. The difference might come from slightly different values for physical constants (mass of ⁶Li, conversion factor from u to MeV/c²). Let's use the atomic mass of ⁶Li as given in another source: 6.015 amu.\nE₀ = 6.015 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 5602.9725 MeV\nE = 3.5714 * 5602.9725 = 20010.6 MeV = 20.01 GeV.\n\nThe result is robustly around 20.01 GeV. Given the options, B is the most plausible choice, assuming a slight variation in the input constants used to derive the options. The difference is about 0.6%.\nLet's check the possibility of misinterpreting the nucleus. Li with 3 neutrons is unambiguously ⁶Li.\n\nMaybe the nucleus is accelerated \"per nucleon\"? The RHIC accelerates ions, so the total energy is what's relevant. Sometimes energy is quoted per nucleon pair. Let's see what that would mean.\nEnergy per nucleon = 20.009 GeV / 6 = 3.335 GeV/nucleon.\nThis doesn't match any of the options either.\n\nI will stick to my original calculation. The result is consistently ~20.01 GeV. The closest option is 20.132 GeV. This implies there is a slight discrepancy in the problem data or options, but B remains the most likely intended answer.\nFinal check:\nMass m₀ = 6.0134771 u\nE₀ = 6.0134771 * 931.49410242 = 5602.4357 MeV\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1-0.96²) = 3.57142857\nE = E₀ * γ = 5602.4357 * 3.57142857 = 20008.69 MeV = 20.0087 GeV.\n\nComparing 20.0087 GeV with the options:\n|A - calc| = |21.419 - 20.0087| = 1.4103\n|B - calc| = |20.132 - 20.0087| = 0.1233\n|C - calc| = |23.069 - 20.0087| = 3.0603\n|D - calc| = |18.475 - 20.0087| = 1.5337\n\nOption B is by far the closest one. The small discrepancy (~0.6%) is likely due to the use of slightly different physical constants in the problem's source. I will proceed with B as the answer.\nThe calculation is straightforward relativistic kinematics. The key steps are determining the rest mass of the ⁶Li nucleus, calculating the Lorentz factor for v=0.96c, and combining them in the total energy formula E = γ * m₀c².\n\n*   **Nucleus Identification:** The nucleus X is Lithium (atomic number Z=3) with 3 neutrons. The mass number A is the sum of protons and neutrons, so A = 3 + 3 = 6. The nucleus is Lithium-6 (⁶Li).\n*   **Rest Mass (m₀):** The mass of the ⁶Li nucleus is distinct from the atomic mass, which includes electrons. The nuclear mass of ⁶Li is approximately 6.0135 atomic mass units (u).\n*   **Rest Energy (E₀):** The rest energy is calculated using Einstein's mass-energy equivalence, E₀ = m₀c². The conversion factor between atomic mass units and energy is approximately 1 u = 931.5 MeV/c².\n    *   E₀ ≈ 6.0135 u * 931.5 MeV/c²/u * c² ≈ 5601.5 MeV\n*   **Lorentz Factor (γ):** For a speed of v = 0.96c, the Lorentz factor is:\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.96²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / √(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714\n*   **Total Energy (E):** The total relativistic energy is the product of the Lorentz factor and the rest energy, E = γE₀.\n    *   E ≈ 3.5714 * 5601.5 MeV ≈ 20005 MeV\n*   **Conversion to GeV:** To compare with the given options, we convert the energy from MeV to GeV by dividing by 1000.\n    *   E ≈ 20.005 GeV\n\nThis calculated value is closest to option B.\n\nFinal check with high-precision values:\n*   Mass of ⁶Li nucleus: 6.0134771 u\n*   1 u = 931.49410242 MeV/c²\n*   Rest Energy (E₀) = 6.0134771 u * 931.49410242 MeV/c² = 5602.4357 MeV\n*   Total Energy (E) = 3.57142857 * 5602.4357 MeV = 20008.7 MeV = 20.0087 GeV\n\nThe calculated value of 20.0087 GeV is very close to 20.132 GeV. The minor difference can be attributed to slightly different constants used for the problem's options. Therefore, B is the correct choice.To determine the energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus, we must calculate its total relativistic energy.\n\n### 1. Identify the Nucleus and its Rest Mass\nThe nucleus X is specified as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Lithium's atomic number is 3, meaning it has 3 protons. The total number of nucleons (protons + neutrons) is 3 + 3 = 6. Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 (⁶Li).\n\nThe mass of a Lithium-6 nucleus (not the atom, which includes electrons) is approximately 6.0134771 atomic mass units (u).\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest Energy (E₀)\nThe rest energy is given by Einstein's formula E₀ = m₀c². We can convert the rest mass from atomic mass units (u) to Mega-electron-Volts (MeV) using the conversion factor 1 u ≈ 931.5 MeV/c².\n\n*   Rest Mass (m₀) ≈ 6.0135 u\n*   Rest Energy (E₀) ≈ 6.0135 u * 931.5 MeV/c² ≈ 5601.5 MeV\n\n### 3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)\nThe speed (v) is given as 0.96c, where c is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor (γ) is calculated as:\n\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96c)²/c²)\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\n*   γ = 1 / √(0.0784)\n*   γ = 1 / 0.28\n*   γ ≈ 3.5714\n\n### 4. Calculate the Total Energy (E)\nThe total relativistic energy (E) is the product of the Lorentz factor and the rest energy (E = γE₀).\n\n*   E ≈ 3.5714 * 5601.5 MeV\n*   E ≈ 20005 MeV\n\n### 5. Convert to Giga-electron-Volts (GeV)\nThe options are given in GeV. To convert from MeV to GeV, we divide by 1000.\n\n*   E ≈ 20.005 GeV\n\nThis calculated value is closest to option B, 20.132 GeV. The small discrepancy (~0.6%) is likely due to the use of slightly different values for the physical constants in the problem's source.\n\n<<<B>>>"
