    "The analysis of the scenario is as follows:\n\n1.  **Mean Free Path (λ):** The mean free path is the average distance a particle travels between successive collisions. It is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ), following the relationship λ = 1 / (nσ).\n\n2.  **Scenario Parameters:** In the described situation, the sample compartment's vacuum state (< 10⁻⁹ Torr), the type of residual gas molecules, and the temperature remain constant. This means that the number density (n) of the gas molecules is the same for both scenarios (before and after the electron beam is on). Therefore, the comparison between λ1 and λ2 hinges on the comparison of their respective collision cross-sections.\n\n3.  **λ1 (Gas-Gas Collision):** This is the mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules. The relevant cross-section, σ₁, is the kinetic cross-section, which is related to the physical size of the molecules. For collisions between identical molecules, this is approximately related to their geometric size.\n\n4.  **λ2 (Electron-Gas Collision):** This is the mean free path of an electron from the beam as it scatters off the residual gas molecules. The relevant cross-section, σ₂, is the electron scattering cross-section. Because electrons are charged particles and interact with gas molecules via the long-range electromagnetic force, their scattering cross-section is generally much larger than the geometric (kinetic) cross-section of the gas molecules. An electron can be deflected by an atom's or molecule's electrostatic field even when it is not on a direct \"physical\" collision course.\n\n5.  **Comparing the Cross-Sections:** The interaction between a charged electron and a neutral gas molecule involves long-range forces that are not present in a collision between two neutral gas molecules. This results in a much larger effective target area for the electron. It's a well-established principle in physics that the scattering cross-section for a charged particle with an atom is typically larger than the kinetic cross-section for atom-atom collisions.\n\n6.  **Conclusion on λ1 vs. λ2:**\n    *   Since σ₂ (electron-gas scattering) > σ₁ (gas-gas collision),\n    *   And λ is inversely proportional to σ (λ = 1/nσ),\n    *   It follows that λ2 < λ1.\n\nThe observation that the mean free path changed from λ1 to λ2 upon introducing the electron beam is due to the different nature of the interactions being measured. λ1 refers to gas molecules hitting each other, while λ2 refers to beam electrons scattering off gas molecules. The higher probability of an electron interacting with a gas molecule (larger cross-section) results in a shorter average distance traveled before a scattering event.\n\n<<<C>>>"
