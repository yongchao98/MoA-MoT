    "Here is a step-by-step identification of compound D:\n\n1.  **Identify Compound A:** The proton NMR data shows a triplet for 6 protons and a quartet for 4 protons. This 3:2 proton ratio and splitting pattern (triplet and quartet) strongly suggests the presence of two equivalent ethyl groups. However, the chemical shifts given (0.9 ppm and 1.3 ppm) are typical for an alkane. The ¹H NMR spectrum for n-butane (CH₃CH₂CH₂CH₃) shows signals for two equivalent methyl groups (6H) and two equivalent methylene groups (4H). The methyl signal is a triplet, and while the methylene signal is technically a more complex multiplet, it is often simplified or appears as a quartet in introductory problems. Therefore, Compound A is identified as **n-butane**.\n\n2.  **Identify Compound B:** Compound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination. Free-radical bromination of butane can produce 1-bromobutane and 2-bromobutane. The formation of 2-bromobutane is favored because it proceeds through a more stable secondary radical intermediate. Thus, Compound B is predominantly **2-bromobutane**.\n\n3.  **Identify Compound C:** Compound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH). This is a strong base in an alcohol solvent, conditions which favor an E2 elimination reaction. Dehydrohalogenation of 2-bromobutane yields two products: but-1-ene (minor product) and but-2-ene (major product, according to Zaitsev's rule). But-2-ene exists as two geometrical isomers: *cis*-2-butene and *trans*-2-butene. The problem specifies that the *cis*-isomer of C is used in the next step. Therefore, Compound C is **cis-2-butene**.\n\n4.  **Identify Compound D:** Compound C (*cis*-2-butene) acts as a dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction with the diene, (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol. The Diels-Alder reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition that is highly stereospecific. The stereochemistry of the reactants determines the stereochemistry of the resulting cyclohexene product.\n    *   **From the Diene:** An (E,E)-configured diene, like the one given, results in the two substituents on the ends of the diene (the -OH at C1 and the -CH₃ at C4) being *cis* to each other in the product.\n    *   **From the Dienophile:** A *cis*-alkene dienophile results in the two substituents (the two -CH₃ groups of cis-2-butene) also being *cis* to each other in the product.\n    *   **The Endo Rule:** The reaction proceeds through an *endo* transition state, which is kinetically favored. This rule dictates the relative orientation of the substituents from the diene and dienophile. For this specific reaction, it results in the substituents from the dienophile (the methyl groups at C5 and C6) being *trans* to the substituents from the diene (the -OH at C1 and the -CH₃ at C4).\n\n    Combining these stereochemical rules leads to a single product isomer. By assigning the stereocenters using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules, the specific isomer formed is **(1S,4R,5S,6S)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
