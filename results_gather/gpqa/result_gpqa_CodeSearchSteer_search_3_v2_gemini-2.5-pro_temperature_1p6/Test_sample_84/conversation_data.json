    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures.\n\n1.  **Formula for Equilibrium Temperature**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. The formula is:\n    T_eq = T_star * ( (1 - A) / (2) )^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / a)\n    where:\n    *   `T_star` is the effective temperature of the star.\n    *   `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n2.  **Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n    We need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * ((1 - A1) / 2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / a1)] / [T_star * ((1 - A2) / 2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / a2)]\n\n    The problem states that the planets have the same albedo (A1 = A2) and they orbit the same star (T_star and R_star are the same for both). Therefore, these terms cancel out:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(R_star / a1) / sqrt(R_star / a2)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a1) / sqrt(1 / a2)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\n3.  **Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity**\n    The semi-major axis (`a`) is not given directly. We must derive it from the radial velocity (RV) data. The maximum RV of the star (the amplitude `K`) induced by a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a) = M_p * sqrt(G / (M_star * a))\n    (This assumes the planet's mass M_p is much smaller than the star's mass M_star, and that the orbital inclination `i` is ~90°, which is a reasonable assumption for planets detected via the transit method).\n\n4.  **Solving for the Semi-Major Axis**\n    We can rearrange the formula to solve for `a`:\n    K² ≈ M_p² * G / (M_star * a)\n    a ≈ G * M_p² / (M_star * K²)\n\n5.  **Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes (a2 / a1)**\n    Now we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes for Planet2 and Planet1:\n    a2 / a1 = [G * M_p2² / (M_star * K2²)] / [G * M_p1² / (M_star * K1²)]\n\n    The gravitational constant `G` and the star's mass `M_star` cancel out:\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2² / K2²) / (M_p1² / K1²)\n    a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n\n6.  **Finding the Ratio of RV Amplitudes (K1 / K2)**\n    The RV amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the measured Doppler shift `Δλ` (since K = c * Δλ / λ₀). Therefore, the ratio of the amplitudes is the same as the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\n    K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 3 / 4\n\n7.  **Plugging in the Values**\n    We have the following ratios:\n    *   Mass ratio: M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 M_earth / 7 M_earth = 5 / 7\n    *   RV amplitude ratio: K1 / K2 = 3 / 4\n\n    Now, substitute these into the equation for a2 / a1:\n    a2 / a1 = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)² = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16) = 225 / 784\n\n8.  **Final Calculation of the Temperature Ratio**\n    Finally, substitute the value of a2 / a1 back into the temperature ratio equation:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1) = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<B>>>"
