    "To determine the number of 13C-NMR signals, we must first deduce the structure of the final product, E, by analyzing the sequence of reactions.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A**\n    This reaction involves the protection of the aldehyde group of propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) using 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT, HSCH₂CH₂SH) with a Lewis acid catalyst (BF₃). This forms a cyclic thioacetal known as a 1,3-dithiane.\n    *   **Product A:** 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n\n2.  **Step 2: A + BuLi → B**\n    Butyllithium (BuLi) is a very strong base. It deprotonates the most acidic proton in compound A. The proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (C2) is acidic and is removed by BuLi. This process is an example of \"umpolung\" or polarity reversal, as the typically electrophilic carbonyl carbon becomes a nucleophilic carbanion.\n    *   **Product B:** The lithium salt of 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane (a nucleophilic carbanion).\n\n3.  **Step 3: B + Bromoethane → C**\n    The nucleophilic carbanion (B) attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in an Sₙ2 reaction. An ethyl group is added to the C2 position of the dithiane ring.\n    *   **Product C:** 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n\n4.  **Step 4: C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D**\n    This step is the deprotection of the thioacetal using mercuric chloride (HgCl₂) in the presence of water and acid to regenerate the carbonyl group.\n    *   **Product D:** 3-Pentanone (diethyl ketone), (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O.\n\n5.  **Step 5: D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E**\n    This is a Wittig reaction, which converts a carbonyl group into an alkene.\n    *   **Ylide Formation:** First, the Wittig reagent (a phosphonium ylide) is prepared. Triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) reacts with 3-bromopentane [(CH₃CH₂)₂CHBr] to form a phosphonium salt. A strong base, BuLi, then deprotonates the carbon adjacent to the phosphorus atom to form the ylide. The ylide is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=PPh₃.\n    *   **Wittig Reaction:** The ylide reacts with the ketone D (3-pentanone). The C=O double bond of the ketone is replaced by a C=C double bond from the ylide.\n    *   **Product E:** The ketone part contributes a `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=` fragment, and the ylide part also contributes a `(CH₃CH₂)₂C=` fragment. These combine to form the final product E. The structure is (CH₃CH₂)₂C=C(CH₂CH₃)₂, which is named 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene.\n\n### **Analysis of the 13C-NMR Spectrum of Product E**\n\nProduct E is **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**:\n\n```\n      CH₂CH₃\n      |\nCH₃CH₂-C=C-CH₂CH₃\n      |\n      CH₂CH₃\n```\n\nTo determine the number of signals in the ¹³C-NMR spectrum, we need to identify the number of chemically non-equivalent carbon atoms in the molecule. This is done by looking for elements of symmetry.\n\nThe structure of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene is highly symmetrical. It has a twofold (C₂) axis of rotation perpendicular to the C=C double bond and an inversion center at the midpoint of the C=C bond. Due to this symmetry:\n\n1.  **Alkene Carbons (`C=`):** The two sp² hybridized carbons of the double bond are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal.\n2.  **Methylene Carbons (`-CH₂-`):** There are four ethyl groups, and due to the molecule's symmetry, all four are equivalent. Within these groups, all four methylene (`-CH₂-`) carbons are chemically equivalent and will produce one signal.\n3.  **Methyl Carbons (`-CH₃`):** Similarly, the four terminal methyl (`-CH₃`) carbons of the ethyl groups are all chemically equivalent, resulting in a single signal.\n\nTherefore, the molecule will show a total of **3 signals** in its ¹³C-NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
