    "Phonons, magnons, and pions are all examples of (pseudo-)Nambu-Goldstone bosons, which arise from the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry.\n\n*   **Phonon:** In a solid crystal, the continuous translational symmetry of free space is spontaneously broken by the formation of a regular lattice. The atoms can still be displaced together in a long-wavelength wave without costing much energy. The quantized excitations of these lattice vibrations are phonons, which are the Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken translational symmetry.\n\n*   **Magnon:** In a ferromagnet, the individual atomic spins align in a specific direction below the Curie temperature. This breaks the continuous rotational symmetry of the underlying physical laws. A magnon, or a quantized spin wave, corresponds to a slow, collective rotation of these spins and is the Goldstone boson for the broken rotational symmetry.\n\n*   **Pion:** In the theory of strong interactions (quantum chromodynamics), an approximate chiral symmetry would exist if quarks were massless. This symmetry is spontaneously broken by the QCD vacuum, which would lead to massless Nambu-Goldstone bosons. Since the up and down quarks have a small but non-zero mass, this symmetry is also explicitly broken. The resulting particles, the pions, are therefore massive but significantly lighter than other hadrons. They are referred to as pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons.\n\n*   **Skyrmion:** A skyrmion is not a Goldstone boson. It is a topologically stable, particle-like excitation (a topological soliton) in a continuous field. While the systems in which skyrmions are found, such as chiral magnets, do exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking, the skyrmion itself is a topologically protected configuration, not the massless or low-mass particle that necessarily emerges from the broken symmetry according to Goldstone's theorem.\n\nTherefore, the skyrmion is the particle in this list that is not directly a consequence of spontaneously broken symmetry in the sense of being a Goldstone boson.\n\n<<<A>>>"
