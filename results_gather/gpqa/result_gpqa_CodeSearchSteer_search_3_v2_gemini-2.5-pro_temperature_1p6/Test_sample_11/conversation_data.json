    "This problem requires the application of the principles of conservation of energy and momentum to the decay of a subatomic particle.\n\n**1. Define the Initial and Final States:**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A stationary positive pion (π⁺). Since it is at rest, its total energy is its rest mass energy, and its momentum is zero.\n*   **Final State:** The pion decays into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν). Both particles are in motion and therefore have both kinetic energy and momentum.\n\n**2. Apply Conservation Laws:**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** Because the initial pion is stationary (zero momentum), the total momentum of the decay products must also be zero. This means the muon and the neutrino must fly off in opposite directions with equal-magnitude momenta. Let's call this momentum 'p'.\n    *   p(μ⁺) = p(ν) = p\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    *   E(π⁺) = E(μ⁺) + E(ν)\n\n**3. Use Relativistic Energy and Momentum Formulas:**\n\nThe relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest mass (m) is given by: E² = (pc)² + (m_₀c²)²\n\n*   **For the pion (π⁺):** E(π⁺) = m(π⁺)c² = 139.6 MeV\n*   **For the muon (μ⁺):** E(μ⁺) = KE(μ⁺) + m(μ⁺)c², where m(μ⁺)c² = 105.7 MeV.\n*   **For the neutrino (ν):** The rest mass of a neutrino is considered to be zero for this type of calculation. For a massless particle, its energy is E(ν) = pc. Since its rest mass is zero, its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy, so KE(ν) = E(ν).\n\n**4. Solve for the Unknown Energies:**\n\nWe can set up a system of equations.\nFrom energy conservation:\nm(π⁺)c² = E(μ⁺) + E(ν)  `(Equation 1)`\n\nFrom the energy-momentum relation for the muon and the fact that the momenta are equal (p(μ⁺)c = p(ν)c = E(ν)):\nE(μ⁺)² = (p(μ⁺)c)² + (m(μ⁺)c²)²\nE(μ⁺)² = E(ν)² + (m(μ⁺)c²)²\nE(μ⁺)² - E(ν)² = (m(μ⁺)c²)²\n\nFactoring the left side (difference of squares):\n(E(μ⁺) - E(ν))(E(μ⁺) + E(ν)) = (m(μ⁺)c²)²\n\nSubstitute `(Equation 1)` into this:\n(E(μ⁺) - E(ν)) (m(π⁺)c²) = (m(μ⁺)c²)²\nE(μ⁺) - E(ν) = (m(μ⁺)c²)² / m(π⁺)c²  `(Equation 2)`\n\nNow, solve the system of linear equations (`Equation 1` and `Equation 2`):\n\n*   E(μ⁺) + E(ν) = 139.6 MeV\n*   E(μ⁺) - E(ν) = (105.7 MeV)² / 139.6 MeV = 11172.49 / 139.6 ≈ 79.9 MeV\n\nAdd the two equations together:\n2 * E(μ⁺) = 139.6 + 79.9 = 219.5 MeV\nE(μ⁺) = 109.75 MeV\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first:\n2 * E(ν) = 139.6 - 79.9 = 59.7 MeV\nE(ν) = 29.85 MeV\n\n**5. Calculate the Kinetic Energies:**\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the neutrino (KE(ν)):**\n    Since the neutrino is treated as massless, its kinetic energy is its total energy.\n    KE(ν) ≈ 29.8 MeV.\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the muon (KE(μ⁺)):**\n    The kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy.\n    KE(μ⁺) = E(μ⁺) - m(μ⁺)c²\n    KE(μ⁺) = 109.75 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 4.05 MeV.\n\nThe calculated values are approximately 4.1 MeV and 29.8 MeV. Comparing these results to the given options, the closest match is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
