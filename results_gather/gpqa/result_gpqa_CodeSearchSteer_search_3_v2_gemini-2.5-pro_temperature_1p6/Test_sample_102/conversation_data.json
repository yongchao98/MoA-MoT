    "To determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful analysis of the directing effects of the substituents is necessary. The target molecule has an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromine atom (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2) in a 1,3,5-relationship (meta to each other).\n\n### Analysis of Reaction Steps and Substituent Effects\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3):** This reaction introduces an acetyl group (-COCH3) onto the benzene ring, forming acetophenone. The acetyl group is an electron-withdrawing group and a **meta-director** for subsequent electrophilic aromatic substitution. It also deactivates the ring, which prevents polyacylation. Starting a synthesis with a meta-director is a sound strategy for achieving a 1,3,5-substitution pattern. Friedel-Crafts reactions generally fail on strongly deactivated rings, such as nitrobenzene.\n\n2.  **Bromination (Br2/FeBr3):** This reaction introduces a bromine atom. Bromine itself is an **ortho, para-director**, though it is weakly deactivating. When brominating acetophenone, the meta-directing acetyl group dictates the position of the incoming bromine, leading to the formation of 3-bromoacetophenone.\n\n3.  **Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4):** This step adds a nitro group (-NO2), which is a strong electron-withdrawing group and a **meta-director**.\n\n### Evaluation of Possible Synthetic Routes\n\nThe goal is to place three substituents meta to each other. The most effective strategy is to start by introducing a meta-directing group.\n\n*   **Option 1: Start with Acylation.**\n    *   **Step i: Acylation of benzene** yields acetophenone. The -COCH3 group is a meta-director.\n    *   **Step ii: Bromination of acetophenone** correctly places the bromine at the meta-position, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   **Step iii: Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone.** At this stage, the ring has a meta-directing -COCH3 group at C1 and an ortho, para-directing -Br group at C3. The -COCH3 group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. The -Br group directs to C2, C4, and C6. The directing effects are \"reinforcing,\" both favoring substitution at position 5 (which is ortho to the bromine and meta to the acetyl group). This cleanly produces the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThis sequence (**Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration**) is a chemically sound and high-yield pathway.\n\n*   **Option 2: Start with Nitration.**\n    Nitrating benzene first gives nitrobenzene. However, nitrobenzene is a strongly deactivated ring, and subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation will not proceed efficiently. This makes it a poor starting point for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n### Analysis of the Given Choices\n\nLet's examine the options based on this analysis:\n\n*   **A)** Starts with nitration, then creates aniline, then attempts to perform reactions that ultimately lead back to benzene. This sequence is incorrect.\n*   **B)** Starts with nitration, then reduction to aniline. Friedel-Crafts acylation (iii) on aniline is problematic as the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amine group, deactivating the ring. This path is not viable.\n*   **C)** Starts with bromination, which is an ortho, para-director. This leads to 1,4-disubstituted products in the next step (ii), which is not the correct pattern for reaching a 1,3,5-trisubstituted product.\n*   **D)** The first three steps are: **i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4**. This sequence perfectly matches the viable synthetic pathway identified above (Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration). The subsequent steps (iv through vii) appear to be erroneous additions, as they describe the reduction and subsequent removal of the nitro group just added. However, the initial three steps represent the correct and high-yield synthesis of the target molecule.\n\nGiven the choices, Option D contains the correct core synthesis, making it the best answer despite the superfluous latter steps.\n\n<<<D>>>"
