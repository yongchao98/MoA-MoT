    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Starting Material**\n\nFirst, we must determine the structure of the initial compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO using the provided 1H-NMR data.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation is 5. A benzene ring accounts for four degrees, and the fifth is likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) indicates it is adjacent to a -CH2- group.\n    *   **6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n    *   **6.27 (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical of a primary amine (-NH2).\n    *   **3.66 (d, 2H):** A doublet for two protons, which corresponds to the -CH2- group. This -CH2- is coupled to the single aldehyde proton, hence it appears as a doublet.\n\nBased on this data, the starting compound is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence.\n\n1.  **NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization):** This reagent mixture converts a primary aromatic amine into a diazonium salt. The amino group (-NH2) on the benzene ring is transformed into a diazonium group (-N2+Cl-). The rest of the molecule remains unchanged under these cold conditions. The product after this step is the diazonium salt of 4-formylmethylphenylamine.\n\n2.  **H2O (Hydrolysis):** Heating the aqueous solution of the diazonium salt causes the diazonium group to be replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing nitrogen gas. This reaction converts the diazonium salt into **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation):** 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is an aldehyde with α-hydrogens (the protons on the carbon between the ring and the aldehyde group). In the presence of a strong base (KOH) and heat, it will undergo a self-condensation reaction, which is an Aldol condensation.\n\n    *   **Aldol Addition:** One molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde forms an enolate, which then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule. This initially forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde adduct.\n    *   **Dehydration:** The reaction is heated, which strongly favors the elimination of a water molecule from the β-hydroxy aldehyde intermediate to form a more stable, conjugated product. The product of this dehydration is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Final Product Structure**\n\nThe aldol condensation of two molecules of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (let's denote the 4-hydroxyphenyl group as Ar) proceeds as follows:\n\n*   **Reactants:** 2 x Ar-CH2-CHO\n*   **Aldol Adduct (Intermediate):** Ar-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(Ar)-CHO. The systematic name is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This matches option (D).\n*   **Final Condensation Product (after dehydration):** Heat causes the elimination of the -OH group from C3 and an acidic proton from C2. This forms a double bond between C2 and C3. The resulting structure is **Ar-CH2-CH=C(Ar)-CHO**.\n\nLet's name this final product systematically. The main chain is a but-2-enal. It has a 4-hydroxyphenyl group at position 2 and another at position 4. The name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**, which corresponds to option (A).\n\nGiven that the reaction includes heat, the reaction is driven to the final, dehydrated condensation product rather than stopping at the aldol adduct.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<A>>>"
