    "To determine the concentration of free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) in the solution, we need to consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe reaction for the formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe given formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA) for this reaction is 5x10¹⁰.\n\nThe question, however, concerns the dissociation of the complex, which is the reverse reaction:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this dissociation (K_d), also known as the instability constant, is the inverse of the formation constant.\n\nK_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5x10¹⁰) = 2x10⁻¹¹\n\nNow, we can set up an equilibrium calculation using the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex, which is 0.02 M. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions that form from the dissociation.\n\nThe equilibrium concentrations will be:\n*   **[[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]** = 0.02 - x\n*   **[Ca²⁺]** = x\n*   **[EDTA⁴⁻]** = x\n\nThe dissociation constant expression is:\nK_d = ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]\n\nSubstituting the equilibrium concentrations into the expression:\n2x10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n\nBecause the dissociation constant (K_d) is very small, the amount of the complex that dissociates (x) will be negligible compared to the initial concentration (0.02 M). We can therefore simplify the denominator to approximately 0.02.\n\n2x10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nNow, we solve for x:\nx² ≈ (2x10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\nx² ≈ 4x10⁻¹³\nx = √(4x10⁻¹³)\nx = √(40x10⁻¹⁴)\nx ≈ 6.32x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is approximately 6.3x10⁻⁷ M. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
