    "Here is a step-by-step identification of the compound C9H11NO2 based on the provided spectral data.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula to calculate the DBE is C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n    *   DBE = 9 - (11/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 9 - 5.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 5\n*   A DBE of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and an additional double bond, such as a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is characteristic of the N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2). One band corresponds to the asymmetric stretch and the other to the symmetric stretch.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is typical for a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. Its position is consistent with an ester group that is conjugated to an aromatic ring, which tends to lower the frequency from that of a saturated aliphatic ester (1735-1750 cm⁻¹).\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This signal corresponds to 3 protons, indicating a methyl group (-CH3). The triplet (t) splitting pattern means it is adjacent to a carbon with 2 protons (-CH2-). This is the upfield part of a classic ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This signal represents 2 protons in a methylene group (-CH2-). Its downfield chemical shift (typically 3.5-4.5 ppm for esters) indicates it is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom. The quartet (q) splitting means it is adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). Together with the signal at 1.20 ppm, this confirms the presence of an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet corresponds to 2 protons. Its chemical shift (3-5 ppm) and broadness are characteristic of the protons of a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The broadening is caused by rapid chemical exchange and quadrupolar coupling with the nitrogen atom.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals, each a doublet integrating to 2 protons, are in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm). This pattern is highly indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two distinct doublets show that the two substituents on the ring are electronically different. One substituent is electron-donating, shifting the adjacent protons upfield (to ~7.0 ppm), while the other is electron-withdrawing, shifting its adjacent protons downfield (to ~8.0 ppm).\n\n### **4. Evaluating the Proposed Structures**\n\n*   **A) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This has the correct formula, but the ethyl group is part of the acid portion. Its -CH2- protons would be adjacent to the C=O group and would appear much further upfield, around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This structure is an amide, not an ester. The C=O stretch in the IR for an amide would typically be at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm⁻¹). It also contains a primary amide (-CONH2), not a primary amine attached to the ring. Finally, meta-substitution would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region, not two clean doublets.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the data.\n    *   It is a **C9H11NO2** compound.\n    *   It has a **primary amine** (-NH2), explaining the two IR bands at 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹ and the broad NMR singlet for 2H at 4.0 ppm.\n    *   It has a **conjugated ester** group, explaining the strong IR band at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n    *   It has an **ethyl ester** group, explaining the triplet (3H) at 1.20 ppm and the quartet (2H) at 4.5 ppm in the NMR.\n    *   It has a **1,4-disubstituted benzene ring** with an electron-donating group (-NH2) and an electron-withdrawing group (-COOEt). This creates the characteristic pair of doublets at 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, so its IR spectrum should show only one N-H band, not two. It would also show a formyl proton (-CHO) signal in the NMR spectrum around 8-8.5 ppm, which is not observed.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe spectral data are fully consistent with the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
