    "Under the assumption of a uniform spatial distribution of stars, we can determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Here is a step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Volume and Number of Stars:** If we assume stars are uniformly distributed in space with a constant density (let's call it ρ), the number of stars (dN) within a thin spherical shell of radius 'r' and thickness 'dr' is proportional to the volume of that shell. The volume of such a shell is given by dV = 4πr²dr. Therefore, the number of stars in this shell is dN = ρ * 4πr²dr.\n\n2.  **Parallax and Distance:** Stellar parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (r) to the star. This relationship can be expressed as r = 1/plx.\n\n3.  **Relating Differentials:** To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax (dN/d(plx)), we need to express 'r' and 'dr' in terms of 'plx' and 'd(plx)'. From r = 1/plx, we can find the derivative of 'r' with respect to 'plx':\n\n    dr/d(plx) = -1/plx²\n\n    Therefore, dr = -(1/plx²) * d(plx). The negative sign simply indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. For our purposes, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can say that a small interval in distance 'dr' corresponds to a small interval in parallax 'd(plx)' by the relation dr ∝ (1/plx²) * d(plx).\n\n4.  **Substituting into the Number of Stars Equation:** Now we substitute the expressions for 'r' and 'dr' in terms of 'plx' into our equation for the number of stars:\n\n    dN ∝ (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)\n\n    dN ∝ (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)\n\n5.  **Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** The number of stars per unit range of parallax is therefore:\n\n    dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴\n\nThis result shows that for a uniform distribution of stars, the number of stars per unit of parallax is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the parallax. This is a foundational concept in statistical astronomy and is related to the Lutz-Kelker bias, which accounts for the fact that in a magnitude-limited survey, there are more distant stars than nearby ones, and measurement uncertainties can systematically affect distance estimates.\n\nBased on this derivation, the correct answer is that the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx as approximately 1/plx⁴.\n\n<<<D>>>"
