    "To determine the speed of light in the moving glass relative to a stationary observer in the laboratory, we must use Einstein's relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Define the reference frames:**\n    *   The laboratory is the stationary reference frame (S).\n    *   The moving glass is the moving reference frame (S').\n\n2.  **Identify the velocities:**\n    *   **v:** The velocity of the moving glass (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S).\n    *   **u':** The speed of the light beam within the glass, as measured from the glass's own reference frame (S'). In a medium with a refractive index *n*, the speed of light is c/n. Since the problem states the speed of light in a vacuum *c* is 1, the speed of light within the glass is **u' = 1/n**.\n    *   **u:** The speed of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory (frame S). This is the quantity we need to find.\n\n3.  **Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula:**\n    The formula for adding velocities in special relativity is:\n    u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c²)\n\n4.  **Substitute the known values into the formula:**\n    *   u' = 1/n\n    *   v = v\n    *   c = 1\n\n    u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n * v) / 1²)\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)\n\n    To eliminate the fractions within the numerator and denominator, multiply the top and bottom of the expression by *n*:\n\n    u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)\n    u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
