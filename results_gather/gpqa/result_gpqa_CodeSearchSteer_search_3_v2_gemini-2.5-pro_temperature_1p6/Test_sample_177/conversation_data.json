    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ and the renormalizability of the theory.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Mass Dimension of Each Component\n\nIn natural units (where ħ = c = 1), the action `S` is dimensionless. The action is the integral of the Lagrangian density over four-dimensional spacetime: `S = ∫d⁴x L`.\n\n1.  **Lagrangian Density (`L`):** Since the spacetime volume element `d⁴x` has a mass dimension of `[d⁴x] = M⁻⁴`, the Lagrangian density `L` must have a mass dimension of `[L] = M⁴` to ensure the action `S` is dimensionless.\n\n2.  **Fermion Field (`ψ`):** The kinetic term for a fermion field is `L_fermion = iψ̄γ^μ∂_μψ`. This term must have a mass dimension of `M⁴`.\n    *   The derivative `∂μ` has a mass dimension of `[∂μ] = M¹`.\n    *   The gamma matrices `γ^μ` are dimensionless.\n    *   Therefore, `[ψ̄][∂_μ][ψ] = [ψ]² * M¹ = M⁴`.\n    *   This implies `[ψ]² = M³`, so the mass dimension of the fermion field is `[ψ] = M^(3/2)`.\n\n3.  **Field Strength Tensor (`F^μν`):** The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is `L_EM = -1/4 * F_μν * F^μν`. This term must also have a mass dimension of `M⁴`.\n    *   This means `[F^μν]² = M⁴`.\n    *   So, the mass dimension of the field strength tensor is `[F^μν] = M²`.\n\n4.  **Sigma Matrix (`σ_μν`):** The matrix `σ_μν` is defined as `(i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]`. Since the gamma matrices `γ_μ` are dimensionless constants, `σ_μν` is also dimensionless, so `[σ_μν] = M⁰`.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Mass Dimension of κ\n\nNow, we use the interaction Lagrangian `L_int = κψ̄σ_μνψF^μν` and the fact that its dimension must be `[L_int] = M⁴`.\n\n*   `[L_int] = [κ] * [ψ̄] * [σ_μν] * [ψ] * [F^μν]`\n*   `M⁴ = [κ] * M^(3/2) * M⁰ * M^(3/2) * M²`\n*   `M⁴ = [κ] * M^(3/2 + 3/2 + 2)`\n*   `M⁴ = [κ] * M^(3 + 2)`\n*   `M⁴ = [κ] * M⁵`\n*   Solving for `[κ]`, we get: `[κ] = M⁴ / M⁵ = M⁻¹`.\n\nThe mass dimension of κ is -1.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Renormalizability of the Theory\n\nThe renormalizability of a theory can be determined by power counting, which relates to the mass dimensions of its coupling constants.\n\n*   If a coupling constant has a **positive** mass dimension (`[g] > 0`), the theory is **super-renormalizable**.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **zero** mass dimension (`[g] = 0`), the theory is **renormalizable**.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **negative** mass dimension (`[g] < 0`), the theory is **non-renormalizable**.\n\nSince the mass dimension of the coupling constant `[κ]` is -1, which is negative, the interaction is non-renormalizable. This type of interaction, known as a Pauli term, contributes to the anomalous magnetic moment of the fermion and is typically considered an operator in an effective field theory.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The mass dimension of κ is **-1**.\n*   The theory is **not renormalizable**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
