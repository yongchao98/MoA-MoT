    "This is a quantitative analysis problem in chemistry. Let's break down the information provided step-by-step to identify salts A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the gas treatment process**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful drying agent, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂.\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change. This implies that no acidic gases were present in the mixture, as salts A and B do not contain Carbon or Sulfur.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Red-hot copper is a reducing agent and reacts with oxidizing gases, primarily oxygen (O₂). The problem states CuO was formed.\n    *   Reaction: 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O ≈ 16 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Since oxygen exists as O₂ molecules, moles of O₂ = 0.05 mol / 2 = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Gas C (remaining gas):** This gas passed through all three tubes without reacting.\n    *   Volume at STP = 2.24 liters.\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas must be relatively inert. Given that the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts often produces nitrogen gas (N₂), it is the most likely candidate for Gas C.\n\n**2. Determine the decomposition products and initial composition**\n\nBased on the analysis, the thermal decomposition of the salt mixture produced:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.025 mol O₂\n*   0.10 mol N₂ (assuming Gas C is N₂)\n\nLet's verify the total mass of these products:\n*   Mass of H₂O = 0.20 mol * 18 g/mol = 3.60 g.\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.025 mol * 32 g/mol = 0.80 g.\n*   Mass of N₂ = 0.10 mol * 28 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Total mass = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n\nThis total mass matches the initial mass of the salt mixture perfectly. This confirms that the products of the decomposition were indeed water, oxygen, and nitrogen gas.\n\nThe elements present in the original salts must be Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O). Since they are salts, a likely combination is ammonium (NH₄⁺) salts of nitrogen oxyanions (like NO₃⁻ or NO₂⁻).\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nWe have an equimolar mixture. Let `n` be the number of moles for each salt. So, we have `n` moles of Salt A and `n` moles of Salt B. Let's test possible identities for A and B.\n\n*   **Hypothesis 1: Salt A is Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Salt B is Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃).**\n\nLet's examine their decomposition reactions:\n*   **NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O**\n*   **NH₄NO₃** can decompose in several ways. A known reaction, especially under rapid heating, is **2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O**.\n\nNow, let's see if an equimolar mixture of `n` moles of each matches our experimental results.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂: `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O are produced.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃: `n` moles of N₂, `0.5n` moles of O₂, and `2n` moles of H₂O are produced (based on the 2:2:1:4 ratio).\n\nTotal products from the mixture:\n*   Total moles of N₂ = n (from A) + n (from B) = 2n\n*   Total moles of O₂ = 0.5n (from B)\n*   Total moles of H₂O = 2n (from A) + 2n (from B) = 4n\n\nLet's compare the molar ratios of the products:\n*   Theoretical Ratio (N₂ : O₂ : H₂O) = 2n : 0.5n : 4n = **4 : 1 : 8**\n*   Experimental Moles (N₂ : O₂ : H₂O) = 0.10 mol : 0.025 mol : 0.20 mol\n*   Experimental Ratio = 0.10 / 0.025 : 0.025 / 0.025 : 0.20 / 0.025 = **4 : 1 : 8**\n\nThe ratios match perfectly. Now we can determine `n` using the experimental data.\n*   Moles of O₂ = 0.5n = 0.025 mol  =>  **n = 0.05 mol**\n\nSo, the initial mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\nLet's check the initial mass:\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.0 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.0 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64.0 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80.0 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the given initial mass.\n\n**4. Calculate the total number of atoms**\n\nThe problem asks for the total number of all atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one of salt B.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n<<<A>>>"
