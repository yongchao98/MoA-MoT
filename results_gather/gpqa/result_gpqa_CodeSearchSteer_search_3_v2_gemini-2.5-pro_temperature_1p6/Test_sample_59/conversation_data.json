    "To determine the time it will take for the astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective, we must use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n### 1. Identify Knowns\n*   **Velocity of the spacecraft (v):** 0.99999987 *c*, where *c* is the speed of light.\n*   **Destination:** Earth.\n*   **Starting age of the astronaut:** 22 years.\n*   **Average alien lifespan:** 150 years.\n*   **Distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (D):** Approximately 163,000 light-years.\n\n### 2. Time of Travel in Earth's Reference Frame\nFirst, we calculate the time it would take for the spacecraft to reach Earth from the perspective of an observer on Earth. Since the spacecraft is traveling at a speed very close to the speed of light, this time (Δt) is approximately the distance in light-years.\n\n*   **Time in Earth's frame (Δt):**\n    Δt ≈ Distance / Speed\n    Δt ≈ 163,000 light-years / *c* ≈ 163,000 years\n\n### 3. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)\nThe time experienced by the astronaut (the proper time, Δt₀) is related to the time experienced by the Earth observer (Δt) by the Lorentz factor (γ). The formula for time dilation is: Δt = γ * Δt₀.\n\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated as:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nGiven v = 0.99999987 *c*:\n*   v/c = 0.99999987\n*   (v/c)² ≈ 0.99999974\n*   1 - (v/c)² ≈ 0.00000026\n*   √(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 0.0005099\n*   **γ ≈ 1 / 0.0005099 ≈ 1961.16**\n\n### 4. Time of Travel in the Astronaut's Reference Frame\nNow we can calculate the time that passes for the astronaut (Δt₀).\n\n*   **Time for the astronaut (Δt₀):**\n    Δt₀ = Δt / γ\n    Δt₀ ≈ 163,000 years / 1961.16\n    **Δt₀ ≈ 83.1 years**\n\nThis value is the duration of the trip from the astronaut's point of view.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nThe journey to Earth will take approximately 83.1 years for the traveling astronaut. To see if the astronaut survives, we add this time to their starting age:\n\n*   **Astronaut's age upon arrival:** 22 years + 83.1 years = 105.1 years.\n\nSince the astronaut's age upon arrival (105.1 years) is less than the species' average lifespan of 150 years, the astronaut will survive the journey. The calculated travel time of approximately 83.1 years is closest to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
