    "To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we must first calculate the silicon abundance for each star relative to a common element, which is typically hydrogen. The standard astronomical notation for elemental abundance is `[X/Y] = log10(NX/NY)star - log10(NX/NY)sun`, where N is the number of atoms.\n\nFirst, we determine the silicon abundance for each star, denoted as [Si/H]. A key property of this notation is that for any elements A, B, and H (hydrogen), `[A/B] = [A/H] - [B/H]`.\n\n**For Star_1:**\nWe are given the following abundances:\n*   [Fe/H]₁ = 0 dex\n*   [Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3 dex\n\nUsing the abundance relation, we have `[Si/Fe]₁ = [Si/H]₁ - [Fe/H]₁`.\nSubstituting the given values:\n`0.3 = [Si/H]₁ - 0`\nThis gives us the silicon abundance for Star_1:\n**[Si/H]₁ = 0.3 dex**\n\n**For Star_2:**\nWe are given the following abundances:\n*   [Mg/H]₂ = 0 dex\n*   [Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3 dex\n\nUsing the same abundance relation, we have `[Mg/Si]₂ = [Mg/H]₂ - [Si/H]₂`.\nSubstituting the given values:\n`0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]₂`\nThis gives us the silicon abundance for Star_2:\n**[Si/H]₂ = -0.3 dex**\n\n**Calculating the Ratio**\nThe quantity we want to find is the ratio of the silicon-to-hydrogen number fractions in Star_1 versus Star_2: `(nSi/nH)₁ / (nSi/nH)₂`.\n\nFrom the definition of [Si/H], we can write:\n*   For Star_1: `[Si/H]₁ = log₁₀(nSi/nH)₁ - log₁₀(nSi/nH)sun = 0.3`\n*   For Star_2: `[Si/H]₂ = log₁₀(nSi/nH)₂ - log₁₀(nSi/nH)sun = -0.3`\n\nTo find the ratio, we can take the logarithm of the ratio:\n`log₁₀ [ (nSi/nH)₁ / (nSi/nH)₂ ] = log₁₀(nSi/nH)₁ - log₁₀(nSi/nH)₂`\n\nBy rearranging the previous equations, we can express each term on the right side:\n`log₁₀(nSi/nH)₁ = 0.3 + log₁₀(nSi/nH)sun`\n`log₁₀(nSi/nH)₂ = -0.3 + log₁₀(nSi/nH)sun`\n\nSubstituting these into the ratio equation:\n`log₁₀(Ratio) = (0.3 + log₁₀(nSi/nH)sun) - (-0.3 + log₁₀(nSi/nH)sun)`\n`log₁₀(Ratio) = 0.3 - (-0.3) = 0.6`\n\nFinally, we solve for the ratio:\n`Ratio = 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98`\n\nThus, the ratio of silicon atoms in the photosphere of Star_1 to Star_2 is approximately 3.9. The stellar masses and other details provided were not necessary for this calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
