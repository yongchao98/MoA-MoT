    "The impulse approximation in many-body nuclear calculations is a simplifying assumption that allows the interaction with a complex nucleus to be treated as a sum of interactions with its individual constituent nucleons. This approximation is valid under a specific set of conditions. Analyzing the given options:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons:** This is a core tenet of the impulse approximation, often referred to as the \"one-body\" or \"single-nucleon\" interaction. The probe is assumed to interact with only one nucleon at a time.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon:** This assumption implies that the incoming probe and the outgoing particles do not significantly interact with the other nucleons in the nucleus. In other words, the amplitude of the incoming wave is not significantly reduced as it passes through the nucleus. This neglects the effects of multiple scattering and final-state interactions with the rest of the nucleus.\n\n3.  **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic:** This assumption pertains to the internal structure of the nucleon itself. While the behavior of quarks determines the nucleon's properties and form factors, it is not a primary assumption for the impulse approximation at the nuclear level. The impulse approximation primarily deals with the interactions of nucleons within the nucleus, not the sub-nuclear quark-gluon dynamics. The relativistic nature of the final state particles is a separate consideration from the impulse approximation itself.\n\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces:** This assumption posits that the strong interaction binding the nucleon to the nucleus has a negligible effect during the brief time of the interaction with the probe. The nucleon is treated as being \"free\" during the scattering process, with its initial momentum determined by its state within the nucleus.\n\nBased on this analysis, the impulse approximation is jointly implied by the assumptions that the interaction is with a single nucleon, the rest of the nucleus is essentially transparent to the probe and the ejected nucleon, and the nuclear binding forces are negligible during the interaction.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of assumptions is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
