    "Here is the step-by-step derivation to find the correct equation:\n\n1.  **The Boltzmann Equation**: Since the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), we can use the Boltzmann equation to describe the population of atoms in different energy levels. The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (N₂) to the number of atoms in the ground state (N₁) is given by:\n\n    N₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT)\n\n    where:\n    *   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the energy levels.\n    *   ΔE is the energy difference between the levels.\n    *   k is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n2.  **Applying to Both Stars**: We can write this equation for each star:\n    *   For star 1 (temperature T₁): (N₂/N₁)₁ = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT₁)\n    *   For star 2 (temperature T₂): (N₂/N₁)₂ = (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT₂)\n\n3.  **Using the Given Information**: The problem states that the excitation in star 1 is twice that in star 2. This means the ratio of excited to ground-state atoms in star 1 is double the ratio in star 2:\n\n    (N₂/N₁)₁ = 2 * (N₂/N₁)₂\n\n4.  **Substituting the Boltzmann Equations**: Now, we substitute the expressions from step 2 into the equation from step 3:\n\n    (g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT₁) = 2 * [(g₂/g₁) * exp(-ΔE / kT₂)]\n\n    The term with the statistical weights (g₂/g₁) is the same on both sides and cancels out:\n\n    exp(-ΔE / kT₁) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / kT₂)\n\n5.  **Solving for the Temperatures**: To solve for the relationship between T₁ and T₂, we can rearrange the equation:\n\n    exp(-ΔE / kT₁) / exp(-ΔE / kT₂) = 2\n\n    Using the rule of exponents (eᵃ / eᵇ = eᵃ⁻ᵇ), we get:\n\n    exp[(-ΔE / kT₁) - (-ΔE / kT₂)] = 2\n    exp[(ΔE / kT₂) - (ΔE / kT₁)] = 2\n\n    Factor out the common term ΔE/k:\n\n    exp[(ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁)] = 2\n\n6.  **Taking the Natural Logarithm**: Taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides gives:\n\n    (ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) = ln(2)\n\n7.  **Simplifying the Expression**: Combine the terms in the parenthesis:\n\n    (ΔE / k) * [(T₁ - T₂) / (T₁T₂)] = ln(2)\n\n8.  **Using the Given Physical Constants**: The problem provides the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K.  Let's calculate the ratio ΔE/k:\n\n    ΔE / k = (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) = 1 K\n\n    Substituting this value back into our equation:\n\n    1 * [(T₁ - T₂) / (T₁T₂)] = ln(2)\n    ln(2) = (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁T₂)\n\nThis result matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
