    "Radioactive decay is a process that follows an exponential decay law and is \"memoryless.\" This memoryless property means that the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its future decay probability.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation to determine the decay probability:\n\n**1. Define the Decay and Survival Probabilities**\nThe probability that an atom survives for a time `t` is given by the exponential decay formula: `P_survival(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant. The probability of decay within time `t` is therefore `P_decay(t) = 1 - P_survival(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Decay Constant (λ)**\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or 0.32.\n`P_decay(100) = 0.32`\n`1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n`e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\n**3. Account for the Memoryless Property**\nBecause the decay process is memoryless, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that a new atom would decay in any 150-minute interval. Thus, we need to calculate `P_decay(150)`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability of Decay in 150 Minutes**\nThe desired probability is `P_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`.\nWe can find the value of `e^(-150λ)` from our previous calculation:\nFrom `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`, we can write `(e^(-λ))^100 = 0.68`.\nThis implies `e^(-λ) = 0.68^(1/100)`.\nNow substitute this into the equation for a 150-minute decay:\n`P_decay(150) = 1 - (e^(-λ))^150`\n`P_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68^(1/100))^150`\n`P_decay(150) = 1 - 0.68^(150/100)`\n`P_decay(150) = 1 - 0.68^1.5`\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\nTo find the final numerical answer, we compute `0.68^1.5`:\n`0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\nNow, substitute this value back into the probability equation:\n`P_decay(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n\nThis probability, 0.4393, is approximately 43.93%, which rounds to 44%.\n\n<<<A>>>"
