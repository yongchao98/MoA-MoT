    "The correct compound is identified by a thorough analysis of the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### **FTIR Analysis**\n\n*   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n*   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also typical for a carboxylic acid.\n\nBoth FTIR signals strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. All four potential compounds are carboxylic acids, so this data confirms the class of the compound but does not differentiate between the isomers.\n\n### **¹H NMR Analysis**\n\nThe key to distinguishing between the isomeric structures lies in the complex splitting patterns observed in the ¹H NMR spectrum. The absence of signals for vinyl hydrogens confirms that the compound is saturated, which is consistent with all four options.\n\n1.  **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**\n    This complex signal arises when a single proton is magnetically coupled to three different sets of neighboring, non-equivalent protons. According to the n+1 rule, this proton must be adjacent to:\n    *   One proton (to give a **d**oublet)\n    *   A set of two equivalent protons (to give a **t**riplet)\n    *   A set of three equivalent protons (to give a **q**uartet)\n\n2.  **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**\n    This pattern occurs when a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors:\n    *   One proton (to give a **d**oublet)\n    *   A set of two equivalent protons (to give a **t**riplet)\n    *   Another, different set of two equivalent protons (to give another **t**riplet)\n\n### **Structural Identification**\n\nLet's examine the structure of each option to determine which one would produce both of these specific splitting patterns.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH:** (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid) This molecule has a proton that would result in a `dtq` signal, but it lacks the specific arrangement to produce a `dtt` signal.\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH:** This formula corresponds to **3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**: `COOH-CH₂-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CH₃`. *Correction:* The proper interpretation of the condensed formula is `COOH-CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₃`, which is **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**. Let's analyze this corrected structure.\n    *   **Wait, re-examining the given condensed formula from the prompt.** `CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH`. A valid structure for this formula with C9H18O2 is `COOH-CH₂-CH(C₂H₅)-CH(CH(C₂H₅))-CH₃`. Let's assume the question meant a valid isomer with this formula that provides the given splits. A plausible isomer is 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid. *Let's re-analyze candidate B again based on the most probable valid structure `COOH-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₃`, which is **3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**.\n    Let's check the protons in `COOH-CH₂(α)-C(Hᵃ)(Et)(β)-C(Hᵇ)(Et)(γ)-CH₃(δ)`.\n        *   **Proton Hᵇ:** This proton is on carbon 4. It is coupled to proton Hᵃ (1H, **d**oublet), the methyl group at the end of the chain (3H, **q**uartet), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H, **t**riplet). This combination results in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal.\n        *   **Proton Hᵃ:** This proton is on carbon 3. It is coupled to proton Hᵇ (1H, **d**oublet), the CH₂ group at position 2 (2H, **t**riplet), and the CH₂ of its own ethyl group (2H, **t**riplet). This produces a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches the second signal.\n    This structure is the only one that accounts for both observed splitting patterns.\n*   **C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH:** (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid) This structure would show a `dtt` but not a `dtq`.\n*   **D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH:** (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid) This compound would have a `dtq` signal but not a `dtt` signal.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, only structure B is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic information.\n\n<<<B>>>"
