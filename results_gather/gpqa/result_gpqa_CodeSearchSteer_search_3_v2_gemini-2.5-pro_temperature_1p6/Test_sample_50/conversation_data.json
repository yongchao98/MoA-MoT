    "To determine the net potential energy of the system, we can use the method of images. A charge `q` placed at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`) induces an image charge `q'` inside the sphere.\n\n1.  **Image Charge and its Location**: The image charge `q'` is given by `q' = -qR/d`. It is located at a distance `d'` from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the center to the charge `q`. The distance `d'` is `d' = R^2/d`.\n\n2.  **Potential Energy**: The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d` from the center of the sphere. This can be calculated as half of the interaction energy between the real charge `q` and its image `q'`. The factor of 1/2 arises because the energy is stored in the electric field, which only exists in the space outside the sphere.\n\nThe interaction energy (W) between the charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is calculated as:\n\n   *   Distance between `q` and `q'`: `d - d' = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n   *   Interaction Energy `W = k * q * q' / (distance between them)`\n       `W = k * q * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n       `W = -k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThe net potential energy (U) of the system is half of this interaction energy:\n\n   `U = (1/2) * W`\n   `U = (1/2) * [-k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nAlternatively, the potential energy is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to the distance `d`. This is calculated by integrating the force on the charge `q` due to the image charge `q'`.\n\n*   The force on charge `q` at a distance `x` from the center is `F(x) = k * q * q' / (x - x')^2`, where `q' = -qR/x` and `x' = R^2/x`.\n    `F(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n*   The potential energy `U` is the integral of this force from `d` to infinity:\n    `U = ∫[d, ∞] F(x) dx = -k * q^2 * R ∫[d, ∞] x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx`\n*   Solving the integral:\n    `∫ x / (x^2 - R^2)^2 dx = -1 / (2 * (x^2 - R^2))`\n*   Evaluating the definite integral from `d` to `∞`:\n    `U = -k * q^2 * R * [-1 / (2 * (x^2 - R^2))]` from `d` to `∞`\n    `U = -k * q^2 * R * [0 - (-1 / (2 * (d^2 - R^2)))]`\n    `U = -k * q^2 * R / (2 * (d^2 - R^2))`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. Comparing this with the given options:\n\nA) `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis matches our derived formula.\n\n<<<A>>>"
