    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided ¹H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### Analysis of the ¹H NMR Data\n\n1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   This is a singlet, meaning the protons are not coupled to any neighboring protons.\n    *   It integrates to 3 hydrogens.\n    *   A chemical shift around 2.1 ppm is characteristic of a methyl group (CH₃) attached to a carbonyl group (C=O). This pattern strongly suggests the presence of an acetyl group (CH₃CO-), which is found in all acetate compounds.\n\n2.  **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   This is a doublet, meaning it is coupled to one neighboring proton (n+1 rule, 1+1=2 peaks).\n    *   It integrates to 3 hydrogens, indicating a methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   This methyl group is adjacent to a carbon with one proton. The chemical shift suggests it's attached to an sp² carbon (part of a C=C double bond).\n\n3.  **Signals at 7.0 ppm and 5.5 ppm:**\n    *   These signals are in the vinylic region (5-8 ppm), confirming they are protons attached to a carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n4.  **Signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   This is a doublet, integrating to one hydrogen. It is coupled to one other proton.\n    *   The crucial piece of information is the coupling constant, **J = 16.0 Hz**. Coupling constants between two protons across a double bond are stereochemistry-dependent:\n        *   *trans* coupling constants are typically large, in the range of 11-18 Hz.\n        *   *cis* coupling constants are smaller, usually between 6-15 Hz.\n    *   A J value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates that the two vinylic protons are in a **trans** configuration.\n\n5.  **Signal at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   This signal for one proton is a **doublet of quartets**.\n    *   It is a doublet because it is coupled to the other vinyl proton (at 7.0 ppm).\n    *   It is a quartet because it is also coupled to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (at 1.6 ppm; n+1 rule, 3+1=4 peaks).\n\n### Assembling the Structure\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   We have an acetate group (from the 2.1 ppm singlet).\n*   We have a propenyl group (`CH₃-CH=CH-`) because the vinylic proton at 5.5 ppm is split by a methyl group (the 1.6 ppm doublet). A butenyl group would have an additional CH₂ group, which is not seen in the spectrum.\n*   The vinylic protons are *trans* to each other due to the large coupling constant (16.0 Hz).\n\nThe structure is therefore **Trans-propenyl acetate**:\n\n*   The acetyl methyl protons correspond to the **2.1 ppm (s)** signal.\n*   The propenyl methyl protons (at C3) correspond to the **1.6 ppm (d)** signal.\n*   The vinylic proton at C2 is split by both the C1 proton and the C3 methyl protons, matching the **5.5 ppm (dq)** signal.\n*   The vinylic proton at C1 is adjacent to the oxygen atom, which deshields it, shifting it downfield. It is split only by the C2 proton, matching the **7.0 ppm (d)** signal.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe provided NMR data is fully consistent with the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate. The large coupling constant of 16.0 Hz is the definitive evidence for the *trans* geometry. The other options are incorrect because *cis* isomers would have a smaller J value, and butenyl acetates would show different signals corresponding to a butenyl group.\n\n<<<B>>>"
