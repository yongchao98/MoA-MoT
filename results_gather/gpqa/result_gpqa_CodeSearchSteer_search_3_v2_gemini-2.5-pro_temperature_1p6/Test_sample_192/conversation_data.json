    "To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationship between the number of stars and the distance, based on the given information about parallax.\n\n**1. Understand the relationship between Parallax and Distance:**\nStellar parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`r`) to a star. This relationship can be expressed as:\n`plx ∝ 1/r` or `r ∝ 1/plx`\n\nThis fundamental principle is used to measure the distances to nearby stars. The distance to a star in parsecs is the reciprocal of its parallax angle in arcseconds (`d = 1/p`).\n\n**2. Relate the Number of Stars to Distance:**\nWe are given that the number of stars (`N`) varies with parallax as:\n`N ∝ 1/plx⁵`\n\nNow, we substitute the relationship between parallax and distance into this equation:\nSince `plx ∝ 1/r`, it follows that `plx⁵ ∝ (1/r)⁵ = 1/r⁵`.\n\nTherefore:\n`N ∝ 1 / (1/r⁵)`\n`N ∝ r⁵`\n\nThis equation tells us that the *cumulative* number of stars up to a certain distance `r` is proportional to `r⁵`.\n\n**3. Determine the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:**\nThe question asks how the number of stars changes *per unit range of distance*, which is the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance (`dN/dr`). To find this, we differentiate the expression for `N` with respect to `r`.\n\nIf `N = k * r⁵` (where k is a constant of proportionality), then:\n`dN/dr = d/dr (k * r⁵)`\n`dN/dr = 5 * k * r⁴`\n\nThis shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance is directly proportional to `r⁴`.\n\n`dN/dr ∝ r⁴`\n\nThus, the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance with a proportionality of `r⁴`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
