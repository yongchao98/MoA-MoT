    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4³⁻) in the solution.\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of each component:**\n    *   The molar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol.\n    *   The molar mass of Na2HPO4●2H2O is 177.99 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of KH2PO4 (which provides the H2PO4⁻ ions) = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol.\n    *   Moles of Na2HPO4●2H2O (which provides the HPO4²⁻ ions) = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol.\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial molar concentrations:**\n    *   The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.200 L.\n    *   Concentration of H2PO4⁻ = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M.\n    *   Concentration of HPO4²⁻ = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M.\n\n3.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]:**\n    *   The primary buffer system is the conjugate acid-base pair H2PO4⁻/HPO4²⁻. This corresponds to the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H3PO4).\n    *   The relevant equilibrium is: H2PO4⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO4²⁻, with the acid dissociation constant Ka2 = 6.2x10⁻⁸.\n    *   We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, or the equilibrium constant expression to find the [H⁺].\n    *   Ka2 = [H⁺][HPO4²⁻] / [H2PO4⁻]\n    *   [H⁺] = Ka2 * ([H2PO4⁻] / [HPO4²⁻])\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 / 0.02809)\n    *   [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M.\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion [PO4³⁻] concentration:**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid.\n    *   The relevant equilibrium is: HPO4²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO4³⁻, with the acid dissociation constant Ka3 = 1.8x10⁻¹².\n    *   The equilibrium expression is: Ka3 = [H⁺][PO4³⁻] / [HPO4²⁻].\n    *   We can rearrange this to solve for the orthophosphate concentration [PO4³⁻].\n    *   [PO4³⁻] = Ka3 * ([HPO4²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   Using the values we calculated:\n    *   [PO4³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸)\n    *   [PO4³⁻] ≈ 6.235 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n\n*   A) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\n*   B) 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n*   C) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\n*   D) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated value of 6.235 x 10⁻⁷ M is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
