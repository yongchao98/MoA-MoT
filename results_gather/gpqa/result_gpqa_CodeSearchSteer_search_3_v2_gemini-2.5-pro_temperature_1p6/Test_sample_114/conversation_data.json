    "### Collision of Worlds: Calculating the Angle of Annihilation\n\nWhen an electron and a positron collide, they annihilate each other in a burst of energy, producing two high-energy photons. The principles of special relativity and conservation laws govern the outcome of this subatomic event. In this specific scenario, the angle between the resulting photons can be determined by applying the laws of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nFirst, we determine the total energy of the system before the collision. The energy of a relativistic particle is given by the equation E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light. The rest mass of an electron and a positron are identical (let's denote it as m_e).\n\n*   The electron, with a Lorentz factor of 4, has an energy of E_electron = 4 * m_e * c².\n*   The positron, with a Lorentz factor of 2, has an energy of E_positron = 2 * m_e * c².\n\nAccording to the law of conservation of energy, the total initial energy is the sum of the energies of the electron and the positron. This energy is then equally distributed between the two photons produced after annihilation.\n\n*   **Total Initial Energy:** E_total = (4 + 2) * m_e * c² = 6 * m_e * c²\n*   **Energy per Photon:** E_photon = E_total / 2 = 3 * m_e * c²\n\nNext, we apply the conservation of momentum. The momentum of a relativistic particle can be calculated using the energy-momentum relation E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n\n*   **Electron's Momentum:** Moving from the left (positive direction), its momentum is p_electron = sqrt(γ₁² - 1) * m_e * c = sqrt(4² - 1) * m_e * c = sqrt(15) * m_e * c.\n*   **Positron's Momentum:** Moving from the right (negative direction), its momentum is p_positron = -sqrt(γ₂² - 1) * m_e * c = -sqrt(2² - 1) * m_e * c = -sqrt(3) * m_e * c.\n*   **Total Initial Momentum (x-direction):** P_initial = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c.\nThe initial momentum in the vertical (y) direction is zero.\n\nAfter the collision, the total momentum must be conserved. The momentum of a photon is given by p = E / c. Since both photons have the same energy, they have the same momentum magnitude: p_photon = (3 * m_e * c²) / c = 3 * m_e * c.\n\nBecause the initial momentum in the y-direction is zero, the y-components of the photons' momenta must cancel each other out. This means they are emitted at equal and opposite angles (let's call it θ) to the horizontal axis.\n\nThe x-component of the final momentum is the sum of the x-components of the two photons' momenta: P_final = 2 * p_photon * cos(θ).\n\nBy equating the initial and final momentum in the x-direction:\n(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e * c = 2 * (3 * m_e * c) * cos(θ)\n\nSolving for cos(θ):\ncos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6\n\nUsing the approximate values for the square roots (sqrt(15) ≈ 3.873 and sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732):\ncos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n\nThis gives an angle θ ≈ 69.1 degrees.\n\nThe total angle between the two photons is 2θ, which is approximately 2 * 69.1 = 138.2 degrees.\n\n<<<C>>>"
