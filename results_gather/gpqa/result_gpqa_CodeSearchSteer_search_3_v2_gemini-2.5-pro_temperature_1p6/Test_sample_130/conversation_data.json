    "This is a classic organic chemistry problem that can be solved by dissecting the reaction and the spectroscopic data provided.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Anhydride:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated. The resulting anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons). This chemical signature perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. The two vinyl protons are equivalent due to symmetry, as are the two vinyl carbons and the two carbonyl carbons.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction:** Maleic anhydride (the dienophile) reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (the diene). This is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n\n3.  **Identify the Products:** Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes can produce two stereoisomeric products: the ***endo*** and ***exo*** adducts.\n    *   The **major product** is typically the *endo* adduct, which is formed faster due to favorable secondary orbital interactions (kinetic control).\n    *   The **minor product** is the *exo* adduct, which is generally more stable but forms more slowly (thermodynamic product).\n\n4.  **Analyze the Structures for NOESY:** The NOESY experiment shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å apart). The key is to find a unique spatial relationship in the major (*endo*) product that is absent in the minor (*exo*) product.\n\n    *   **Proton Assignments:** We need to assign the proton signals given in the options to the protons in the product structure. The molecular formula of the product is C13H16O3.\n        *   There are four methyl groups, which fall into two sets of two due to a plane of symmetry in the molecule.\n            *   The two methyl groups on the newly formed double bond (Me_alkene) are in a similar environment. Vinylic methyl protons typically resonate around 1.7 ppm. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n            *   The two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (Me_bridgehead) are also equivalent. These are standard alkyl methyl groups and resonate at a higher field (lower ppm). This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n        *   The two protons that originated from the maleic anhydride's double bond (let's call them H_A) are now methine protons alpha to the anhydride's carbonyl groups. Their chemical shift will be significantly downfield. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**. They are a singlet due to symmetry and the absence of adjacent protons to couple with.\n\n    *   **Spatial Relationships (*endo* vs. *exo*):**\n        *   In the **major (*endo*) product**, the anhydride part of the molecule is tucked \"under\" the bicyclic ring, on the same face as the carbon-carbon double bond. This brings the H_A protons (~3.5 ppm) into close proximity with the methyl groups on that double bond (Me_alkene, ~1.7 ppm).\n        *   In the **minor (*exo*) product**, the anhydride is on the opposite face of the double bond. The H_A protons are far from the Me_alkene groups.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The cross-peak that is present in the major product but absent in the minor product must be due to the spatial proximity of the H_A protons and the Me_alkene protons in the *endo* configuration.\n\nTherefore, the two resonances connected by the NOESY cross-peak in the major product are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
