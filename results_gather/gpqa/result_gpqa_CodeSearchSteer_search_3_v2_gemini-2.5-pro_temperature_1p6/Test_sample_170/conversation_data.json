    "To arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction, we need to consider the directing effects and steric properties of the substituents on the benzene ring.\n\n1.  **С₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is an activating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n2.  **C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate):** The ethyl ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n3.  **C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene):** The chloro group (-Cl) is a deactivating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n4.  **C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene):** The nitro group (-NO₂) is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group.\n5.  **C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is an activating, ortho-, para-directing group.\n6.  **C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid):** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is a deactivating, meta-directing group.\n\n### Analysis of Substituent Effects:\n\n**Meta-Directing Groups (Substances 4, 6, 2):**\nThese substituents direct the incoming electrophile primarily to the meta position, resulting in a very low yield of the para-isomer. The strength of the deactivating effect influences the proportion of meta product. More strongly deactivating groups lead to a higher percentage of the meta-isomer and, consequently, a lower percentage of the para-isomer.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be lowest for nitrobenzene and highest for ethyl benzoate among this group.\n*   **Nitrobenzene (4)**: The -NO₂ group is strongly deactivating, leading to mostly meta-substitution (around 90-95%) and a very small amount of para-isomer (0-5%).\n*   **Benzoic acid (6)**: The -COOH group is also a strong meta-director. Classic bromination often requires harsh conditions. It produces very little para-isomer, but generally more than nitrobenzene.\n*   **Ethyl benzoate (2)**: The -COOC₂H₅ is a meta-director, but it is less deactivating than -COOH and -NO₂. For a similar reaction (nitration), it yields about 5% of the para-isomer.\n\nSo, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for the meta-directing substances is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Ortho-, Para-Directing Groups (Substances 3, 1, 5):**\nThese substituents direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The ratio of the para- to ortho-isomer is primarily influenced by steric hindrance. A bulkier substituent will sterically hinder the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para product.\n\nThe steric bulk of these groups increases in the order:\n-Cl < -CH₃ < -C₂H₅\n\nLet's examine the isomer distribution for each:\n*   **Chlorobenzene (3)**: While -Cl is ortho-, para-directing, its strong inductive effect deactivates the ring. However, bromination yields a very high percentage of the para-isomer relative to the ortho-isomer. Some sources report para-isomer yields as high as 88-95%.\n*   **Toluene (1)**: The -CH₃ group is less sterically demanding than an ethyl group. Standard bromination of toluene yields about 60-67% para-isomer and 30-40% ortho-isomer.\n*   **Ethylbenzene (5)**: The -C₂H₅ group is bulkier than the methyl group, thus favoring para substitution more significantly due to increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions. For bromination, this results in a para-isomer yield higher than that of toluene, around 83% in some conditions.\n\nComparing the para yields: Toluene (~62%), Ethylbenzene (~83%), and Chlorobenzene (~88%). This suggests the order of increasing para yield for these substances is **1 < 5 < 3**.\n\n### Final Combined Ordering:\n\nCombining the two groups, the meta-directors will have significantly lower para-isomer yields than the ortho-, para-directors.\n\nThe established order is:\n*   Meta-directors: **4 < 6 < 2** (all with very low para yields)\n*   Ortho-, para-directors: **1 < 5 < 3** (all with high para yields)\n\nThus, the complete sequence in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\n<<<D>>>"
