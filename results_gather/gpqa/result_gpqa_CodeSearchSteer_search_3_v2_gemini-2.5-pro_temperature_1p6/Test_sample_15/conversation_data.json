    "A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image and lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Here is the analysis of each compound:\n\n*   ***(Z)*-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is an alkene. The double bond prevents rotation, but the plane of the double bond acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule. Therefore, it is achiral and not optically active.\n\n*   ***(3aR,7aS,E)-*8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name of this compound includes stereochemical descriptors (R, S, and E), which specify a particular stereoisomer. The presence of these descriptors indicates that the molecule is chiral and exists as a specific enantiomer. Chiral molecules are optically active.\n\n*   ***(2R,3S)*-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the (2R,3S) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry, which makes it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral and therefore optically inactive because the optical rotation caused by one chiral center is cancelled out by the other.\n\n*   ***(2R,3R)*-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a stereoisomer of the compound above. It has two chiral centers, but in the (2R,3R) configuration, there is no internal plane of symmetry. This molecule is chiral and will rotate plane-polarized light. Thus, it is optically active.\n\n*   ***(R)*-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the (R) configuration at the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group (C1). This carbon is a chiral center. Since a specific enantiomer is named, the compound is chiral and optically active.\n\n*   ***(1s,3s,5s)*-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: In this molecule, the three hydroxyl groups are all on the same side of the cyclohexane ring (cis). This arrangement gives the molecule a plane of symmetry. Synonyms for this compound include cis-1,3,5-Cyclohexanetriol. Due to this symmetry, the compound is achiral and not optically active.\n\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An analysis of the structure of this ketone, (Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2, reveals that it does not contain any chiral centers. The molecule is achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of three optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>"
