    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### **Reaction Analysis**\n\nThe two-step process of treatment with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the starting alkene. This means two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added across the double bond, on opposite faces. The stereochemical outcome depends on the stereochemistry of the starting alkene.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene)**\n    The *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl groups to a trans-alkene results in a single meso compound. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the product is the meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. A meso compound is achiral despite having chiral centers because it possesses an internal plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene)**\n    The *anti*-addition of two hydroxyl groups to a cis-alkene results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers. For (Z)-oct-4-ene, the products are (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, which are a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).\n\n### **Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nCompound 1 (the meso diol) is a diastereomer of compounds 2 and 3. Compounds 2 and 3 are enantiomers of each other.\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis**\n\nThe chemist runs this three-component mixture on two different HPLC columns.\n\n*   **Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC**\n    Standard HPLC columns are achiral and separate compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   **Enantiomers**, like compounds 2 and 3, have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore not be separated. They will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Diastereomers**, such as the meso compound (1) and the enantiomeric pair (2 and 3), have different physical properties and are separable by achiral HPLC.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**: one for the meso compound and one for the co-eluting enantiomeric pair.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC**\n    Chiral HPLC columns have a chiral stationary phase that can differentiate between enantiomers.\n    *   The meso compound (1) is achiral and will elute as a single peak.\n    *   The enantiomers (2 and 3) will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will be separated into two distinct peaks.\n    *   Since the meso compound is a diastereomer of the other two, it will also be separated from them.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **three peaks**: one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R) enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S) enantiomer.\n\n**Conclusion:** The chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<D>>>"
