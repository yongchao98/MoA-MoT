    "To resolve two energy levels, the difference between their energies must be greater than the uncertainty in their energy levels. This is a direct consequence of the energy-time uncertainty principle.\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time is given by the relation:\n\nΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy.\n*   Δt is the uncertainty in time, which in this case is the lifetime of the quantum state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\nA quantum state that exists for only a short time cannot have a definite, sharply defined energy. This uncertainty in energy is also known as the natural linewidth. States that decay quickly have a broad linewidth, while those that decay slowly have a narrow one.\n\nTo clearly distinguish between the two energy levels, the energy separation must be larger than their energy uncertainties (linewidths). The state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy uncertainty, and this larger uncertainty is the primary factor limiting the ability to resolve the two levels.\n\nLet's calculate the energy uncertainty for each state:\n\n1.  **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime (Δt₁) = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   The minimum energy uncertainty (ΔE₁) is approximately ħ / Δt₁.\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n2.  **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime (Δt₂) = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   The minimum energy uncertainty (ΔE₂) is approximately ħ / Δt₂.\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nThe larger energy uncertainty is for State 1, at approximately 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. For the two energy levels to be clearly resolved, their energy difference must be significantly greater than this value.\n\nLet's examine the given options:\n*   A) 10⁻⁸ eV: This is smaller than the uncertainty of the first state.\n*   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV: This is much smaller than the uncertainties of both states.\n*   C) 10⁻⁴ eV: This is more than 100 times larger than the largest uncertainty (6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV), allowing for a clear distinction.\n*   D) 10⁻⁹ eV: This is also much smaller than the uncertainty of the first state.\n\nTherefore, an energy difference of 10⁻⁴ eV is the only option large enough to ensure the two energy levels can be clearly resolved.\n\n<<<C>>>"
