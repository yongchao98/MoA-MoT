    "Here is a step-by-step identification of Compound E based on the provided reaction scheme and hints.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify Compound A**\n\n*   **Hint (a)** describes a Wittig reaction. In this reaction, a ketone (Compound A) reacts with a phosphorus ylide to form an alkene. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The part of the product name \"(propan-2-ylidene)\" corresponds to the ylide, and \"1,2-dimethyl...cyclopentane\" corresponds to the original ketone. To find the structure of Compound A, we replace the C=C(CH₃)₂ group in the product with a carbonyl group (C=O). This identifies **Compound A** as **3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one**.\n\n*   **Hint (b)** provides spectroscopic data. The IR peak for Compound A is at ~1750 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic for the carbonyl stretch of a cyclopentanone (a five-membered ring ketone) due to ring strain. This observation is consistent with the structure determined from the Wittig reaction.\n\n### **Step 2: Follow the Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Compound A → Compound B**\n    *   Compound A (3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one) reacts with hydrogen cyanide (HCN). This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the carbonyl carbon.\n    *   **Compound B** is the resulting cyanohydrin: **1-hydroxy-3,4-dimethylcyclopentane-1-carbonitrile**.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Compound B → Compound C**\n    *   Compound B is reduced with hydrogen gas (H₂) in the presence of a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This reaction, known as catalytic hydrogenation, reduces the nitrile group (-C≡N) to a primary amine (-CH₂NH₂).\n    *   **Compound C** is an aminomethyl alcohol: **1-(aminomethyl)-3,4-dimethylcyclopentan-1-ol**.\n\n*   **Reaction 3: Compound C → Compound D**\n    *   Compound C, a primary amine, reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂). This process, called diazotization, converts the primary amino group (-NH₂) into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺), which is a very good leaving group.\n    *   **Compound D** is the unstable diazonium intermediate: **[(1-hydroxy-3,4-dimethylcyclopentyl)methyl]diazonium ion**.\n\n*   **Reaction 4: Compound D → Compound E**\n    *   Compound D spontaneously eliminates nitrogen gas (N₂), leaving a highly unstable primary carbocation. This intermediate immediately undergoes a rearrangement.\n    *   This specific reaction is known as the **Tiffeneau–Demjanov rearrangement**. It involves the migration of a carbon-carbon bond from the ring to the adjacent carbocation, resulting in a one-carbon ring expansion.\n    *   The five-membered cyclopentane ring expands to a six-membered cyclohexane ring. The carbon atom that was part of the -CH₂N₂⁺ group becomes a new member of the ring. The positive charge relocates to the ring carbon that was originally bonded to both the -OH group and the migrating carbon. This intermediate is stabilized by the oxygen atom, and after loss of a proton, it forms a ketone.\n    *   The methyl groups, which were at positions 3 and 4 relative to the carbonyl in Compound A, will now be at positions 3 and 4 in the newly formed cyclohexanone ring.\n    *   Therefore, **Compound E** is **3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one**.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Verification**\n\n*   The IR spectrum of Compound E is given to have a strong peak around 1715 cm⁻¹. This value is characteristic of a cyclohexanone (a six-membered ring ketone), which has less ring strain than a cyclopentanone. This evidence strongly supports the ring expansion from Compound A (cyclopentanone, ~1750 cm⁻¹) to Compound E (cyclohexanone, ~1715 cm⁻¹).\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, Compound E is identified as 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n<<<B>>>"
