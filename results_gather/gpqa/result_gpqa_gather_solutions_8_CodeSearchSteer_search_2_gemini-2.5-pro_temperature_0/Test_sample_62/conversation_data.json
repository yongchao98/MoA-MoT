Understand the Model and the States**\n\nThe problem describes a diatomic molecule (XY) using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The energy levels of this model are given by:\n$E_{v,J} = (v + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + B J(J+1)$\nwhere:\n*   $v$ is the vibrational quantum number ($v = 0, 1, 2, ...$)\n*   $J$ is the rotational quantum number ($J = 0, 1, 2, ...$)\n*   $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($1.05457 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s)\n*   $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   $B$ is the rotational constant.\n\nThe molecule starts in its **fundamental state**, which is the lowest possible energy state. This corresponds to the quantum numbers $(v, J) = (0, 0)$.\n\nThe molecule then **absorbs a photon** and transitions to a higher energy state. The question asks for the momentum of this photon for the transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\".\n\n**2. Interpreting the Transition**\n\nThe phrase \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" can be ambiguous.\n*   A literal interpretation would mean the state with energy just above the ground state, which is the first rotational state $(v, J) = (0, 1)$. The energy for this transition would be $\\Delta E = E_{0,1} - E_{0,0} = 2B$.\n*   However, the process is specified as **photon absorption**. This physical process is governed by selection rules. For a heteronuclear diatomic molecule (like XY), the infrared absorption selection rules are $\\Delta v = +1$ and $\\Delta J = \\pm 1$.\n\nLet's apply the selection rules to the initial state $(v, J) = (0, 0)$:\n*   $\\Delta v = +1 \\implies v_{final} = 1$.\n*   $\\Delta J = \\pm 1$. Since $J$ cannot be negative, only $\\Delta J = +1$ is possible from $J=0$. This means $J_{final} = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the transition caused by the absorption of a single photon from the ground state is from $(v_i, J_i) = (0, 0)$ to $(v_f, J_f) = (1, 1)$. This is the lowest energy transition allowed by the standard selection rules for photon absorption. The options provided confirm this interpretation, as the purely rotational transition energy is far too small.\n\n**3. Calculate the Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)**\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n$\\Delta E = E_{final} - E_{initial} = E_{1,1} - E_{0,0}$\n\n*   $E_{1,1} = (1 + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + B(1)(1+1) = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega + 2B$\n*   $E_{0,0} = (0 + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + B(0)(0+1) = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\n$\\Delta E = (\\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega + 2B) - (\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega) = \\hbar\\omega + 2B$\n\n**4. Calculate the Necessary Physical Constants**\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the reduced mass ($\\mu$), the moment of inertia ($I$), and the rotational constant ($B$).\n\n*   **Reduced Mass ($\\mu$):**\n    $M_x = 20$ amu, $M_y = 2$ amu. 1 amu = $1.6605 \\times 10^{-27}$ kg.\n    $\\mu = \\frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \\frac{20 \\times 2}{20 + 2} \\text{ amu} = \\frac{40}{22} \\text{ amu} = \\frac{20}{11} \\text{ amu}$\n    $\\mu = \\frac{20}{11} \\times (1.6605 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg}) \\approx 3.019 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg}$\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia ($I$):**\n    $R = 2$ angstroms = $2 \\times 10^{-10}$ m.\n    $I = \\mu R^2 = (3.019 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg}) \\times (2 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m})^2$\n    $I = (3.019 \\times 10^{-27}) \\times (4 \\times 10^{-20}) \\text{ kg m}^2 = 1.2076 \\times 10^{-46} \\text{ kg m}^2$\n\n*   **Rotational Constant ($B$):**\n    $B = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I} = \\frac{(1.05457 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s})^2}{2 \\times (1.2076 \\times 10^{-46} \\text{ kg m}^2)}$\n    $B = \\frac{1.112 \\times 10^{-68}}{2.4152 \\times 10^{-46}} \\text{ J} \\approx 4.604 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J}$\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Transition Energy**\n\nNow we can calculate the two parts of the energy change, $\\hbar\\omega$ and $2B$.\n\n*   **Vibrational Energy Term ($\\hbar\\omega$):**\n    $\\omega = 4 \\times 10^{14}$ rad/s\n    $\\hbar\\omega = (1.05457 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s}) \\times (4 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ rad/s}) = 4.218 \\times 10^{-20} \\text{ J}$\n\n*   **Rotational Energy Term ($2B$):**\n    $2B = 2 \\times (4.604 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J}) = 9.208 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J}$\n\n*   **Total Energy ($\\Delta E$):**\n    $\\Delta E = \\hbar\\omega + 2B = (4.218 \\times 10^{-20} \\text{ J}) + (9.208 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J})$\n    $\\Delta E = 4.218 \\times 10^{-20} + 0.009208 \\times 10^{-20} = 4.227 \\times 10^{-20} \\text{ J}$\n\n**6. Calculate the Photon's Momentum ($p$)**\n\nThe energy of a photon is related to its momentum by the equation $\\Delta E = pc$, where $c$ is the speed of light ($c \\approx 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s).\n\n$p = \\frac{\\Delta E}{c} = \\frac{4.227 \\times 10^{-20} \\text{ J}}{3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}}$\n$p \\approx 1.409 \\times 10^{-28} \\text{ N·s}$\n\nThis value is very close to option D.\n\n$p \\approx 1.4 \\times 10^{-28} \\text{ N·s}$\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we must first identify the initial and final energy states of the molecule and calculate the energy difference between them.\n\n### 1. Energy Levels and State Identification\n\nThe energy of a diatomic molecule in the quantum rotation-vibration model is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n*E(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + B J(J+1)*\n\nWhere:\n*   **v** is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   **J** is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   **ω** is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   **B** is the rotational constant.\n\nThe molecule is initially in its **fundamental state**, which is the ground state with the lowest possible energy. This corresponds to v=0 and J=0.\n*   **Initial State:** (v=0, J=0)\n\nThe \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" that can be reached by absorbing a photon is governed by spectroscopic selection rules. For a rovibrational transition in a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, the selection rules are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1. Starting from J=0, only a ΔJ = +1 transition is possible.\n*   **Selection Rules:** Δv = +1, ΔJ = +1\n*   **Final State:** (v=1, J=1)\n\n### 2. Calculation of Transition Energy (ΔE)\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n*   E_initial = E(0, 0) = (1/2)ħω + B(0)(1) = (1/2)ħω\n*   E_final = E(1, 1) = (1 + 1/2)ħω + B(1)(2) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n*   ΔE = E_final - E_initial = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - (1/2)ħω = ħω + 2B\n\nTo find ΔE, we need to calculate the rotational constant B.\n\n**a. Reduced Mass (μ):**\nThe reduced mass of the X-Y molecule is calculated as:\nμ = (m_X * m_Y) / (m_X + m_Y)\nμ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\nConverting to kilograms (1 amu ≈ 1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg):\nμ ≈ 1.818 * (1.66054 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n**b. Moment of Inertia (I):**\nThe moment of inertia depends on the reduced mass and the bond length (R = 2 Å = 2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m).\nI = μ * R²\nI ≈ (3.019 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\nI ≈ 1.2076 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n**c. Rotational Constant (B):**\nThe rotational constant is given by:\nB = ħ² / (2I)\nB ≈ (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (2 * 1.2076 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²)\nB ≈ 4.604 × 10⁻²³ J\n\n**d. Total Transition Energy (ΔE):**\nNow, we can calculate the total energy change by summing the vibrational and rotational parts.\n*   Vibrational Energy Part: ΔE_vib = ħω = (1.05457 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 × 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.218 × 10⁻²⁰ J\n*   Rotational Energy Part: ΔE_rot = 2B ≈ 2 * (4.604 × 10⁻²³ J) = 9.208 × 10⁻²³ J\n*   Total Energy: ΔE = ΔE_vib + ΔE_rot ≈ 4.218 × 10⁻²⁰ J + 0.0009208 × 10⁻²⁰ J ≈ 4.219 × 10⁻²⁰ J\n\n### 3. Calculation of Photon Momentum (p)\n\nThe energy and momentum of a photon are related by the equation E = pc, where c is the speed of light (c ≈ 3.00 × 10⁸ m/s). Therefore, the photon's momentum is:\np = ΔE / c\np ≈ (4.219 × 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3.00 × 10⁸ m/s)\np ≈ 1.406 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Model and Energy Levels:** The problem uses the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor). The total energy of the molecule in a state defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` and the rotational quantum number `J` is given by:\n    `E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * J(J + 1)`\n    where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration, and `I` is the moment of inertia.\n\n2.  **Determine the Transition:**\n    *   The molecule starts in its fundamental (ground) state, which is the lowest possible energy state. This corresponds to `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n    *   The absorption of a photon causes a transition to a higher energy state. For rovibrational transitions in a diatomic molecule, the selection rules are `Δv = +1` and `ΔJ = +1`.\n    *   Therefore, the transition from the ground state (`v=0, J=0`) to the next state with the lowest possible energy *reachable by photon absorption* is to the state `v = 1`, `J = 1`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy of the Absorbed Photon:** The energy of the absorbed photon (`E_photon`) must equal the energy difference (`ΔE`) between the final and initial states.\n    *   `E_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(1/2)`\n    *   `E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(3/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * 1(1 + 1) = ħω(3/2) + ħ²/I`\n    *   `ΔE = E_final - E_initial = (ħω(3/2) + ħ²/I) - ħω(1/2) = ħω + ħ²/I`\n\n4.  **Calculate Necessary Physical Quantities:**\n    *   **Reduced Mass (μ):** `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)`. We need to convert the masses from atomic mass units (amu) to kilograms (kg).\n    *   **Moment of Inertia (I):** `I = μ * R²`. We need to convert the bond length `R` from angstroms to meters.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Photon's Momentum:** The energy of a photon is related to its momentum (`p`) and the speed of light (`c`) by the equation `E_photon = p * c`. Therefore, the momentum is:\n    `p = E_photon / c = ΔE / c`\n\n6.  **Code Implementation:** Write a Python script to perform these calculations using the given values and physical constants.

The total energy of a state, defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` and the rotational quantum number `J`, is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n    $E_{v,J} = E_{vib} + E_{rot} = (v + 1/2) \\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I} J(J+1)$\n    where:\n    *   `v` = 0, 1, 2, ... (vibrational quantum number)\n    *   `J` = 0, 1, 2, ... (rotational quantum number)\n    *   $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($1.054 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s)\n    *   $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of vibration\n    *   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule\n\n2.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    The molecule is in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the state with the lowest possible energy. This occurs when both the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers are at their minimum values:\n    *   $v_{initial} = 0$\n    *   $J_{initial} = 0$\n    So, the initial state is $(v_i, J_i) = (0, 0)$.\n\n3.  **Identify the Final State (The Most Careful Point):**\n    The molecule absorbs a photon to switch to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" This implies a transition that is allowed by quantum mechanical selection rules for photon absorption. For a diatomic molecule with a permanent dipole moment (like X-Y, where X and Y are different elements), the selection rules for rovibrational transitions are:\n    *   $\\Delta v = +1$ (for absorption)\n    *   $\\Delta J = \\pm 1$\n\n    Starting from the initial state $J_i = 0$, a transition with $\\Delta J = -1$ is not possible (as J cannot be negative). Therefore, the only allowed rotational transition is $\\Delta J = +1$, which means $J_{final} = 1$.\n    Combining the selection rules, the lowest energy transition from the ground state is:\n    *   $v_{final} = v_{initial} + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1$\n    *   $J_{final} = J_{initial} + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1$\n    So, the final state is $(v_f, J_f) = (1, 1)$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy of the Absorbed Photon:**\n    The energy of the absorbed photon ($\\Delta E$) must be equal to the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n    *   Initial Energy: $E_i = E_{0,0} = (0 + 1/2) \\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I} 0(0+1) = \\frac{1}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n    *   Final Energy: $E_f = E_{1,1} = (1 + 1/2) \\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I} 1(1+1) = \\frac{3}{2} \\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}$\n    *   Energy Difference: $\\Delta E = E_f - E_i = (\\frac{3}{2} \\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}) - (\\frac{1}{2} \\hbar \\omega) = \\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Necessary Physical Quantities:**\n    *   **Reduced Mass ($\\mu$):**\n        *   $M_X = 20$ amu, $M_Y = 2$ amu.\n        *   $1 \\text{ amu} = 1.6605 \\times 10^{-27}$ kg.\n        *   $\\mu = \\frac{M_X M_Y}{M_X + M_Y} = \\frac{20 \\times 2}{20 + 2} = \\frac{40}{22} \\approx 1.818$ amu.\n        *   $\\mu = 1.818 \\text{ amu} \\times (1.6605 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg/amu}) \\approx 3.019 \\times 10^{-27}$ kg.\n\n    *   **Moment of Inertia ($I$):**\n        *   $R = 2$ angstroms = $2 \\times 10^{-10}$ m.\n        *   $I = \\mu R^2 = (3.019 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg}) \\times (2 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m})^2$\n        *   $I = (3.019 \\times 10^{-27}) \\times (4 \\times 10^{-20}) = 1.2076 \\times 10^{-46} \\text{ kg m}^2$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Energy Change ($\\Delta E$):**\n    *   **Vibrational Part:** $\\hbar \\omega = (1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J s}) \\times (4 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ rad/s}) = 4.216 \\times 10^{-20}$ J.\n    *   **Rotational Part:** $\\frac{\\hbar^2}{I} = \\frac{(1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J s})^2}{1.2076 \\times 10^{-46} \\text{ kg m}^2} = \\frac{1.1109 \\times 10^{-68}}{1.2076 \\times 10^{-46}} \\approx 9.20 \\times 10^{-23}$ J.\n    *   **Total Energy Change:** $\\Delta E = (4.216 \\times 10^{-20} \\text{ J}) + (9.20 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J}) \\approx 4.225 \\times 10^{-20}$ J. (Note that the rotational energy contribution is very small compared to the vibrational one).\n\n7.  **Calculate the Photon's Momentum:**\n    The momentum `p` of a photon is related to its energy `E` by the equation $p = E/c$, where `c` is the speed of light ($3 \\times 10^8$ m/s).\n    *   $p = \\frac{\\Delta E}{c} = \\frac{4.225 \\times 10^{-20} \\text{ J}}{3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}}$\n    *   $p \\approx 1.408 \\times 10^{-28}$ N·s.\n\n8.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    The calculated momentum, $1.408 \\times 10^{-28}$ N·s, is closest to option B.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   **Model Interpretation:** Correctly use the energy formula for the non-rigid rotor model.\n*   **State Identification:** The \"fundamental state\" is the ground state $(v=0, J=0)$.\n*   **Selection Rules:** The most crucial step is realizing that the transition must be allowed by photon absorption selection rules ($\\Delta v = +1, \\Delta J = \\pm 1$), which dictates the final state is $(v=1, J=1)$, not just the next available energy level in the spectrum.\n*   **Unit Conversion:** Ensure all given values (amu, angstroms) are converted to standard SI units (kg, m) before calculation.\n*   **Final Calculation:** Remember to convert the final calculated energy change ($\\Delta E$) into momentum ($p = \\Delta E / c$).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe reasoning and calculation have been performed.

Finally, we can determine the photon's momentum.\n\n### 1. Identifying the Molecular Transition\n\n*   **Model:** The molecule is described by the quantum rotation-vibration model. Its energy levels are given by the formula:\n    E(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + B J(J+1)\n    where `v` is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2,...), `J` is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2,...), `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, `ω` is the vibrational angular frequency, and `B` is the rotational constant.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its fundamental (ground) state, which corresponds to the lowest possible energy. This occurs when both quantum numbers are at their minimum: v = 0 and J = 0.\n\n*   **Final State and Selection Rules:** A photon is absorbed, causing a transition to a higher energy state. For a diatomic molecule, the selection rules for such a rovibrational transition are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1. Since the molecule starts at J=0, the change in the rotational quantum number must be ΔJ = +1. Therefore, the transition occurs from the initial state (v=0, J=0) to the final state (v=1, J=1). This is the lowest possible energy transition that involves a change in the vibrational state.\n\n### 2.

Understand the Model and Energy Levels\n\nThe problem specifies a diatomic molecule (X-Y) that can be described by the quantum rotation-vibration model. The total energy of the molecule in a given state is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies.\n\nThe energy for a specific rovibrational state, defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` (v = 0, 1, 2, ...) and the rotational quantum number `J` (J = 0, 1, 2, ...), is given by the formula:\n\n**E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + B·J(J + 1)**\n\nWhere:\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant.\n*   **ω** is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   **B** is the rotational constant, defined as B = ħ² / (2I).\n*   **I** is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n\n### 2. Identify the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the ground state with the lowest possible energy. This corresponds to the lowest quantum numbers, so **v = 0** and **J = 0**.\n*   **Final State:** The problem asks for the transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" This phrasing can be ambiguous. It could mean the state with the absolute next-highest energy level, or it could refer to the most common type of transition studied in this context, which is a rovibrational transition.\n\nLet's analyze the possible transitions and their energies:\n*   **Pure Rotational Transition:** (v=0, J=0) → (v=0, J=1). The energy for this would be very low and typically falls in the microwave region of the spectrum.\n*   **Rovibrational Transition:** This involves a change in both `v` and `J`. For infrared absorption, the selection rules for a diatomic molecule are **Δv = +1** and **ΔJ = ±1**. Starting from J=0, a transition with ΔJ = -1 is not possible. Therefore, the only allowed rovibrational transition from the ground state is to a state where **v = 1** and **J = 1**.\n\nBy examining the magnitude of the given options, it becomes clear that the question is referring to a rovibrational transition, as the calculated momentum for a pure rotational transition is several orders of magnitude smaller than any of the choices.\n\nSo, the transition is: **(v=0, J=0) → (v=1, J=1)**.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Photon Energy (ΔE)\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n\n*   **E_initial** = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B·0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω\n*   **E_final** = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B·1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n\nThe energy difference is:\n**ΔE** = E_final - E_initial = [ (3/2)ħω + 2B ] - [ (1/2)ħω ] = **ħω + 2B**\n\nSubstituting B = ħ² / (2I), we get:\n**ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I**\n\n### 4.

The selection rules for an absorption transition in a heteronuclear diatomic molecule are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1.\n    *   Starting from the ground state (v=0, J=0), the only possible transition that adheres to these rules is to the state where v=1 and J=1 (since J cannot be negative).\n    *   Therefore, the transition is from **(v=0, J=0)** to **(v=1, J=1)**.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Transition Energy (ΔE)\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n\n*   **Initial Energy (E_i):**\n    E(0,0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B·0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω\n*   **Final Energy (E_f):**\n    E(1,1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B·1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n*   **Energy Difference (ΔE):**\n    ΔE = E_f - E_i = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - (1/2)ħω = ħω + 2B\n\nSince B = ħ² / (2I), we can write this as:\nΔE = ħω + ħ² / I\n\n### 4. Calculating Physical Constants\n\nFirst, we calculate the reduced mass (μ) and the moment of inertia (I) of the molecule.\n\n*   **Given:**\n    *   Mass of atom X (Mₓ): 20 amu\n    *   Mass of atom Y (Mᵧ): 2 amu\n    *   Bond length (R): 2 Å = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    *   Angular frequency (ω): 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s\n*   **Constants:**\n    *   Atomic mass unit (amu): 1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n    *   Reduced Planck's constant (ħ): 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   Speed of light (c): 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n\n*   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    μ = (Mₓ * Mᵧ) / (Mₓ + Mᵧ) = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n    μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    I = μ * R² = (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\n    I = (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (4 x 10⁻²⁰ m²) ≈ 1.208 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n### 5.

Defining the System and States\n\nThe molecule is described by the quantum rotation-vibration model, where the energy of a state is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n*   **Energy Levels:** E(v, J) = E_vib(v) + E_rot(J)\n    *   Vibrational Energy: E_vib(v) = (v + 1/2)ħω\n    *   Rotational Energy: E_rot(J) = (ħ² / 2I) * J(J + 1)\n\nHere, `v` is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...), `J` is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...), `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration, and `I` is the moment of inertia.\n\n*   **Fundamental State:** The molecule is in its fundamental (or ground) state, which corresponds to the lowest possible quantum numbers: v = 0 and J = 0.\n*   **Selection Rules:** For a photon to be absorbed by a diatomic molecule, the transition must obey specific selection rules. For rovibrational transitions, these are Δv = ±1 and ΔJ = ±1.\n\n### 2. Identifying the Transition\n\nStarting from the ground state (v=0, J=0), we must find the allowed transition that leads to the state with the lowest possible energy. According to the selection rules:\n*   A pure rotational transition (Δv=0, ΔJ=+1) to the state (v=0, J=1) is possible.\n*   A rovibrational transition (Δv=+1, ΔJ=+1) to the state (v=1, J=1) is also possible.\n\nA transition to (v=1, J=0) would be forbidden because ΔJ=0 is not allowed for this type of molecule.\n\nLet's compare the energy of these two possible destination states:\n*   **E(v=0, J=1):** This corresponds to a pure rotational transition. The energy change is ΔE_rot = E(0,1) - E(0,0) = ħ²/I.\n*   **E(v=1, J=1):** This is a rovibrational transition. The energy change is ΔE_rovib = E(1,1) - E(0,0) = (ħω + ħ²/I).\n\nTypically, the vibrational energy change is much larger than the rotational energy change. Therefore, the transition to the (v=0, J=1) state is the one with the lowest energy change. However, calculating the momentum for this transition does not yield any of the provided options. This suggests that the question is likely asking for the lowest-energy *rovibrational* transition, which is a common focus in infrared spectroscopy.\n\nThe lowest-energy allowed rovibrational transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) is to the (v=1, J=1) state.\n\n### 3.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe core of the problem is to calculate the momentum of a photon that can excite a diatomic molecule from its ground state to the next allowed energy state. This requires understanding the energy levels of the molecule and the rules governing transitions between them.\n\n### Careful Points and Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Model and Energy Levels:** The problem specifies the quantum rotation-vibration model (or non-rigid rotor). The energy of a state defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` and the rotational quantum number `J` is given by:\n    E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + B·J(J + 1)\n    where B is the rotational constant, B = ħ² / (2I).\n\n2.  **Identify the Initial State:** The molecule starts in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the ground state with the lowest possible energy. This corresponds to the minimum values for both quantum numbers: **(v=0, J=0)**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Final State (The Most Critical Step):** The molecule absorbs a photon to transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" This transition must be allowed by quantum mechanical selection rules. For a heteronuclear diatomic molecule absorbing a photon, the rovibrational selection rules are:\n    *   **Δv = +1**\n    *   **ΔJ = ±1**\n\n    Starting from the initial state (v=0, J=0), a transition with ΔJ = -1 is impossible, as J cannot be negative. Therefore, the only allowed transition is to a state where **v = 1** and **J = 1**. This is the lowest-energy rovibrational transition possible from the ground state.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Transition Energy (ΔE):** The energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n    *   E_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B·0(1) = (1/2)ħω\n    *   E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B·1(2) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n    *   ΔE = E_final - E_initial = [(3/2)ħω + 2B] - (1/2)ħω = **ħω + 2B**\n\n5.  **Calculate the Necessary Physical Quantities:** All units must be converted to SI units (kg, m, s).\n    *   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n        μ = (Mₓ · Mᵧ) / (Mₓ + Mᵧ) = (20 amu · 2 amu) / (20 + 2) amu = 40/22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n        Using the conversion 1 amu ≈ 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg:\n        μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ **3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg**\n\n    *   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n        R = 2 angstroms = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n        I = μR² ≈ (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)² ≈ **1.2077 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²**\n\n    *   **Rotational Constant (B):**\n        B = ħ² / (2I) ≈ (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (2 * 1.2077 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ **4.604 x 10⁻²³ J**\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Transition Energy (ΔE):**\n    *   Vibrational Term (ħω): (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) ≈ 4.2183 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n    *   Rotational Term (2B): 2 * (4.604 x 10⁻²³ J) ≈ 9.208 x 10⁻²³ J\n    *   ΔE = (4.2183 x 10⁻²⁰ J) + (9.208 x 10⁻²³ J) ≈ **4.2275 x 10⁻²⁰ J**\n\n7.  **Calculate the Photon's Momentum (p):** The energy and momentum of a photon are related by E = pc.\n    *   p = ΔE / c ≈ (4.2275 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.9979 x 10⁸ m/s) ≈ **1.410 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s**\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated momentum, p ≈ 1.41 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s, is closest to the value given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"

Understand the Model and the States**\n\nThe problem describes a diatomic molecule (XY) using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The energy levels of this model are given by:\n$E_{v,J} = (v + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + B J(J+1)$\nwhere:\n*   $v$ is the vibrational quantum number ($v = 0, 1, 2, ...$)\n*   $J$ is the rotational quantum number ($J = 0, 1, 2, ...$)\n*   $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($1.05457 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s)\n*   $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   $B$ is the rotational constant.\n\nThe molecule starts in its **fundamental state**, which is the lowest possible energy state. This corresponds to the quantum numbers $(v, J) = (0, 0)$.\n\nThe molecule then **absorbs a photon** and transitions to a higher energy state. The question asks for the momentum of this photon for the transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\".\n\n**2. Interpreting the Transition**\n\nThe phrase \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" can be ambiguous.\n*   A literal interpretation would mean the state with energy just above the ground state, which is the first rotational state $(v, J) = (0, 1)$. The energy for this transition would be $\\Delta E = E_{0,1} - E_{0,0} = 2B$.\n*   However, the process is specified as **photon absorption**. This physical process is governed by selection rules. For a heteronuclear diatomic molecule (like XY), the infrared absorption selection rules are $\\Delta v = +1$ and $\\Delta J = \\pm 1$.\n\nLet's apply the selection rules to the initial state $(v, J) = (0, 0)$:\n*   $\\Delta v = +1 \\implies v_{final} = 1$.\n*   $\\Delta J = \\pm 1$. Since $J$ cannot be negative, only $\\Delta J = +1$ is possible from $J=0$. This means $J_{final} = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the transition caused by the absorption of a single photon from the ground state is from $(v_i, J_i) = (0, 0)$ to $(v_f, J_f) = (1, 1)$. This is the lowest energy transition allowed by the standard selection rules for photon absorption. The options provided confirm this interpretation, as the purely rotational transition energy is far too small.\n\n**3. Calculate the Transition Energy ($\\Delta E$)**\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n$\\Delta E = E_{final} - E_{initial} = E_{1,1} - E_{0,0}$\n\n*   $E_{1,1} = (1 + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + B(1)(1+1) = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega + 2B$\n*   $E_{0,0} = (0 + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + B(0)(0+1) = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega$\n\n$\\Delta E = (\\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega + 2B) - (\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega) = \\hbar\\omega + 2B$\n\n**4.

This corresponds to `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n    *   The absorption of a photon causes a transition to a higher energy state. For rovibrational transitions in a diatomic molecule, the selection rules are `Δv = +1` and `ΔJ = +1`.\n    *   Therefore, the transition from the ground state (`v=0, J=0`) to the next state with the lowest possible energy *reachable by photon absorption* is to the state `v = 1`, `J = 1`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Energy of the Absorbed Photon:** The energy of the absorbed photon (`E_photon`) must equal the energy difference (`ΔE`) between the final and initial states.\n    *   `E_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(1/2)`\n    *   `E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(3/2) + (ħ² / 2I) * 1(1 + 1) = ħω(3/2) + ħ²/I`\n    *   `ΔE = E_final - E_initial = (ħω(3/2) + ħ²/I) - ħω(1/2) = ħω + ħ²/I`\n\n4.  **Calculate Necessary Physical Quantities:**\n    *   **Reduced Mass (μ):** `μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)`.

The total energy of a state, defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` and the rotational quantum number `J`, is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n    $E_{v,J} = E_{vib} + E_{rot} = (v + 1/2) \\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I} J(J+1)$\n    where:\n    *   `v` = 0, 1, 2, ... (vibrational quantum number)\n    *   `J` = 0, 1, 2, ... (rotational quantum number)\n    *   $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($1.054 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s)\n    *   $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of vibration\n    *   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule\n\n2.  **Identify the Initial State:**\n    The molecule is in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the state with the lowest possible energy. This occurs when both the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers are at their minimum values:\n    *   $v_{initial} = 0$\n    *   $J_{initial} = 0$\n    So, the initial state is $(v_i, J_i) = (0, 0)$.\n\n3.  **Identify the Final State (The Most Careful Point):**\n    The molecule absorbs a photon to switch to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" This implies a transition that is allowed by quantum mechanical selection rules for photon absorption. For a diatomic molecule with a permanent dipole moment (like X-Y, where X and Y are different elements), the selection rules for rovibrational transitions are:\n    *   $\\Delta v = +1$ (for absorption)\n    *   $\\Delta J = \\pm 1$\n\n    Starting from the initial state $J_i = 0$, a transition with $\\Delta J = -1$ is not possible (as J cannot be negative). Therefore, the only allowed rotational transition is $\\Delta J = +1$, which means $J_{final} = 1$.\n    Combining the selection rules, the lowest energy transition from the ground state is:\n    *   $v_{final} = v_{initial} + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1$\n    *   $J_{final} = J_{initial} + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1$\n    So, the final state is $(v_f, J_f) = (1, 1)$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Energy of the Absorbed Photon:**\n    The energy of the absorbed photon ($\\Delta E$) must be equal to the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n    *   Initial Energy: $E_i = E_{0,0} = (0 + 1/2) \\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I} 0(0+1) = \\frac{1}{2} \\hbar \\omega$\n    *   Final Energy: $E_f = E_{1,1} = (1 + 1/2) \\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I} 1(1+1) = \\frac{3}{2} \\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}$\n    *   Energy Difference: $\\Delta E = E_f - E_i = (\\frac{3}{2} \\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}) - (\\frac{1}{2} \\hbar \\omega) = \\hbar \\omega + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{I}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Necessary Physical Quantities:**\n    *   **Reduced Mass ($\\mu$):**\n        *   $M_X = 20$ amu, $M_Y = 2$ amu.\n        *   $1 \\text{ amu} = 1.6605 \\times 10^{-27}$ kg.\n        *   $\\mu = \\frac{M_X M_Y}{M_X + M_Y} = \\frac{20 \\times 2}{20 + 2} = \\frac{40}{22} \\approx 1.818$ amu.\n        *   $\\mu = 1.818 \\text{ amu} \\times (1.6605 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg/amu}) \\approx 3.019 \\times 10^{-27}$ kg.\n\n    *   **Moment of Inertia ($I$):**\n        *   $R = 2$ angstroms = $2 \\times 10^{-10}$ m.\n        *   $I = \\mu R^2 = (3.019 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg}) \\times (2 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m})^2$\n        *   $I = (3.019 \\times 10^{-27}) \\times (4 \\times 10^{-20}) = 1.2076 \\times 10^{-46} \\text{ kg m}^2$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Energy Change ($\\Delta E$):**\n    *   **Vibrational Part:** $\\hbar \\omega = (1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J s}) \\times (4 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ rad/s}) = 4.216 \\times 10^{-20}$ J.\n    *   **Rotational Part:** $\\frac{\\hbar^2}{I} = \\frac{(1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J s})^2}{1.2076 \\times 10^{-46} \\text{ kg m}^2} = \\frac{1.1109 \\times 10^{-68}}{1.2076 \\times 10^{-46}} \\approx 9.20 \\times 10^{-23}$ J.\n    *   **Total Energy Change:** $\\Delta E = (4.216 \\times 10^{-20} \\text{ J}) + (9.20 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J}) \\approx 4.225 \\times 10^{-20}$ J.

Its energy levels are given by the formula:\n    E(v, J) = (v + 1/2)ħω + B J(J+1)\n    where `v` is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2,...), `J` is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2,...), `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, `ω` is the vibrational angular frequency, and `B` is the rotational constant.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its fundamental (ground) state, which corresponds to the lowest possible energy. This occurs when both quantum numbers are at their minimum: v = 0 and J = 0.\n\n*   **Final State and Selection Rules:** A photon is absorbed, causing a transition to a higher energy state. For a diatomic molecule, the selection rules for such a rovibrational transition are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1. Since the molecule starts at J=0, the change in the rotational quantum number must be ΔJ = +1. Therefore, the transition occurs from the initial state (v=0, J=0) to the final state (v=1, J=1). This is the lowest possible energy transition that involves a change in the vibrational state.\n\n### 2.

Understand the Model and Energy Levels\n\nThe problem specifies a diatomic molecule (X-Y) that can be described by the quantum rotation-vibration model. The total energy of the molecule in a given state is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies.\n\nThe energy for a specific rovibrational state, defined by the vibrational quantum number `v` (v = 0, 1, 2, ...) and the rotational quantum number `J` (J = 0, 1, 2, ...), is given by the formula:\n\n**E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + B·J(J + 1)**\n\nWhere:\n*   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant.\n*   **ω** is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   **B** is the rotational constant, defined as B = ħ² / (2I).\n*   **I** is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n\n### 2. Identify the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:** The molecule is in its \"fundamental state,\" which is the ground state with the lowest possible energy. This corresponds to the lowest quantum numbers, so **v = 0** and **J = 0**.\n*   **Final State:** The problem asks for the transition to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy.\" This phrasing can be ambiguous. It could mean the state with the absolute next-highest energy level, or it could refer to the most common type of transition studied in this context, which is a rovibrational transition.\n\nLet's analyze the possible transitions and their energies:\n*   **Pure Rotational Transition:** (v=0, J=0) → (v=0, J=1). The energy for this would be very low and typically falls in the microwave region of the spectrum.\n*   **Rovibrational Transition:** This involves a change in both `v` and `J`. For infrared absorption, the selection rules for a diatomic molecule are **Δv = +1** and **ΔJ = ±1**. Starting from J=0, a transition with ΔJ = -1 is not possible. Therefore, the only allowed rovibrational transition from the ground state is to a state where **v = 1** and **J = 1**.\n\nBy examining the magnitude of the given options, it becomes clear that the question is referring to a rovibrational transition, as the calculated momentum for a pure rotational transition is several orders of magnitude smaller than any of the choices.\n\nSo, the transition is: **(v=0, J=0) → (v=1, J=1)**.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Photon Energy (ΔE)\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n\n*   **E_initial** = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + B·0(0 + 1) = (1/2)ħω\n*   **E_final** = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B·1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n\nThe energy difference is:\n**ΔE** = E_final - E_initial = [ (3/2)ħω + 2B ] - [ (1/2)ħω ] = **ħω + 2B**\n\nSubstituting B = ħ² / (2I), we get:\n**ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I**\n\n### 4.

Calculate the Photon Momentum (p)\n\nThe relationship between a photon's energy (E) and momentum (p) is E = pc, where c is the speed of light (c ≈ 2.998 x 10⁸ m/s).\n\n*   **Momentum (p):**\n    p = ΔE / c\n    p = (4.227 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.998 x 10⁸ m/s)\n    p ≈ 1.410 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis value is very close to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nYou are absolutely correct to point out the discrepancy.

Defining the System and States\n\nThe molecule is described by the quantum rotation-vibration model, where the energy of a state is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n*   **Energy Levels:** E(v, J) = E_vib(v) + E_rot(J)\n    *   Vibrational Energy: E_vib(v) = (v + 1/2)ħω\n    *   Rotational Energy: E_rot(J) = (ħ² / 2I) * J(J + 1)\n\nHere, `v` is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...), `J` is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...), `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration, and `I` is the moment of inertia.\n\n*   **Fundamental State:** The molecule is in its fundamental (or ground) state, which corresponds to the lowest possible quantum numbers: v = 0 and J = 0.\n*   **Selection Rules:** For a photon to be absorbed by a diatomic molecule, the transition must obey specific selection rules. For rovibrational transitions, these are Δv = ±1 and ΔJ = ±1.\n\n### 2. Identifying the Transition\n\nStarting from the ground state (v=0, J=0), we must find the allowed transition that leads to the state with the lowest possible energy. According to the selection rules:\n*   A pure rotational transition (Δv=0, ΔJ=+1) to the state (v=0, J=1) is possible.\n*   A rovibrational transition (Δv=+1, ΔJ=+1) to the state (v=1, J=1) is also possible.\n\nA transition to (v=1, J=0) would be forbidden because ΔJ=0 is not allowed for this type of molecule.\n\nLet's compare the energy of these two possible destination states:\n*   **E(v=0, J=1):** This corresponds to a pure rotational transition. The energy change is ΔE_rot = E(0,1) - E(0,0) = ħ²/I.\n*   **E(v=1, J=1):** This is a rovibrational transition. The energy change is ΔE_rovib = E(1,1) - E(0,0) = (ħω + ħ²/I).\n\nTypically, the vibrational energy change is much larger than the rotational energy change. Therefore, the transition to the (v=0, J=1) state is the one with the lowest energy change. However, calculating the momentum for this transition does not yield any of the provided options. This suggests that the question is likely asking for the lowest-energy *rovibrational* transition, which is a common focus in infrared spectroscopy.\n\nThe lowest-energy allowed rovibrational transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) is to the (v=1, J=1) state.\n\n### 3.
