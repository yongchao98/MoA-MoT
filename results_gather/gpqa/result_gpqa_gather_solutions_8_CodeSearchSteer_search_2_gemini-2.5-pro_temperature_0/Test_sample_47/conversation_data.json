One of the α-hydrogens (on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is replaced by a bromine atom. Since cyclohexanone is symmetrical, both α-positions are equivalent.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n*   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base, with heat.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic example of the **Favorskii rearrangement**. An α-halo ketone with an abstractable proton on the other α-carbon undergoes a rearrangement upon treatment with a base.\n    1.  The hydroxide ion (OH-) removes a proton from the other α-carbon (C6), forming an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2) in an intramolecular S_N2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of the cyclopropanone, opening the three-membered ring to form a more stable carbanion on a five-membered ring.\n    4.  Protonation during workup yields a carboxylic acid with a rearranged carbon skeleton. The six-membered ring contracts to a five-membered ring.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *(Note: An alternative E2 elimination to form cyclohex-2-en-1-one is less likely, especially given the next reaction step which is specific for carboxylic acids).*\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagent:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl). Pyridine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)3)**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, a bulky and mild reducing agent.\n*   **Reaction:** This reagent is specifically used for the selective reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is not strong enough to reduce the resulting aldehyde further to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring with a formyl group (-CHO) attached.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the carbon it's attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1. This plane bisects the bond between C3 and C4 of the cyclopentane ring.\n\nLet's count the sets of chemically equivalent hydrogens based on this symmetry:\n\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is unique. (1 type)\n2.  **The proton on C1 (the ring carbon attached to the CHO group):** This proton lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (one is *cis* and one is *trans* to the aldehyde group). The same is true for C5. The two *cis* protons (one on C2, one on C5) are equivalent to each other. The two *trans* protons (one on C2, one on C5) are also equivalent to each other. But the *cis* set is not equivalent to the *trans* set. This gives two distinct types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic, as are the two on C4. This results in one set of equivalent \"inner\" protons and one set of equivalent \"outer\" protons. These two sets are distinct from each other and from the protons on C2/C5. This gives another two distinct types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n\n**Total Count:**\n*   Type 1: Aldehyde H (1H)\n*   Type 2: C1-H (1H)\n*   Type 3: C2/C5 H (*cis*) (2H)\n*   Type 4: C2/C5 H (*trans*) (2H)\n*   Type 5: C3/C4 H (\"inner\") (2H)\n*   Type 6: C3/C4 H (\"outer\") (2H)\n\nSumming these up, there are **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in product 4.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is my step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction Sequence:** I will trace the chemical transformations step by step to identify the final product.\n    *   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1.** This is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. The bromine atom will add to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the alpha-carbon). The product is 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n    *   **Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) + NaOH (heated) → Product 2.** This is a reaction of an alpha-halo ketone with a strong base. This set of reagents is characteristic of the **Favorskii rearrangement**. In this reaction, the six-membered ring contracts to a five-membered ring, forming a carboxylic acid derivative. The product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *   **Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and Pyridine → Product 3.** Thionyl chloride is a standard reagent for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. The product is cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n    *   **Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) → Product 4.** This is a bulky, mild reducing agent specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to an alcohol. The final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Final Product (Product 4):** Based on the analysis, Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. Its structure consists of a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n3.  **Count the Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms:** Now, I will examine the structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde to count the number of unique hydrogen environments, considering the molecule's symmetry.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the C-C bond connecting it to the ring, the carbon atom it's attached to (C1), and the C1-H bond.\n    *   Let's count the distinct types of hydrogens:\n        1.  **The aldehyde proton (H in -CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n        2.  **The proton on C1:** This is the single proton on the ring carbon directly attached to the aldehyde group. It lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type)\n        3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** These are the carbons adjacent to C1. The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, on each of these carbons, there are two protons. These two protons are diastereotopic because C1 is a stereocenter. Therefore, they are chemically distinct from each other. This gives us two more types of hydrogens (one set of two equivalent protons, and another set of two equivalent protons). (2 types)\n        4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** These are the carbons beta to C1. The plane of symmetry also makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 protons, the two protons on C3 (and C4) are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct from each other. This gives us another two types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n\n4.  **Sum the types:** Total distinct types = 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = 6.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1.

The reaction proceeds via an enol or enolate intermediate. One of the α-hydrogens (on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is replaced by a bromine atom. Since cyclohexanone is symmetrical, both α-positions (C2 and C6) are equivalent.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n*   **Starting Material:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydroxide (a strong base) and heat.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic reaction of an α-halo ketone with a base. While elimination to form an α,β-unsaturated ketone is possible, the presence of an abstractable proton on the other α-carbon (the α'-position, C6) strongly favors a **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n    1.  The base (OH⁻) removes the acidic α'-proton from C6 to form an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate undergoes an intramolecular S_N2 reaction: the carbanion at C6 attacks C2, displacing the bromide ion (Br⁻) to form a strained bicyclic ketone intermediate (bicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this intermediate.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, and the ring opens by cleaving the bond between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the α'-carbon (C6). This relieves the strain of the three-membered ring and results in the formation of a five-membered ring with a carboxylate group.\n    5.  Upon acidic workup (which is implied before the next step), the carboxylate is protonated.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *   *Note:* If simple elimination had occurred, the product would be cyclohex-2-en-1-one. However, this compound would not react with thionyl chloride in the next step, making the Favorskii rearrangement the only logical pathway consistent with the entire reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n*   **Starting Material:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagents:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl gas produced during the reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\n*   **Starting Material:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a selective reduction. LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ is a sterically hindered and less reactive hydride donor than LiAlH₄. It is known to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes, stopping at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to the primary alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. We can do this by analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring with a formyl group (-CHO) attached.\n*   **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclopentane ring undergoes rapid conformational changes (puckering). On the NMR time scale, this results in an effective plane of symmetry that passes through the C-CHO bond, the carbon it's attached to (C1), and the midpoint of the opposite C-C bond (the C3-C4 bond).\n*   **Counting Distinct Hydrogens:**\n    1.  **Aldehyde Hydrogen:** The hydrogen atom of the -CHO group is in a unique chemical environment. This is **1** type.\n    2.  **C1 Hydrogen:** The hydrogen atom on the carbon of the ring attached to the aldehyde group (C1) lies on the plane of symmetry and is unique. This is a **2nd** type.\n    3.  **C2 and C5 Hydrogens:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, on each of these carbons, the two hydrogen atoms are diastereotopic (one is cis to the -CHO group, the other is trans). They are not chemically equivalent to each other. Therefore, the two hydrogens on C2/C5 constitute two different sets of equivalent protons. This gives **2** more types.\n    4.  **C3 and C4 Hydrogens:** The plane of symmetry also makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two hydrogens on each of these carbons are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. This gives another **2** types.\n\n*   **Total Count:**\n    *   Type 1: Aldehyde-H (1H)\n    *   Type 2: C1-H (1H)\n    *   Type 3: C2-H & C5-H (cis) (2H total)\n    *   Type 4: C2-H & C5-H (trans) (2H total)\n    *   Type 5: C3-H & C4-H (one set) (2H total)\n    *   Type 6: C3-H & C4-H (the other set) (2H total)\n\nIn total, there are **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 4 and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone, a six-membered cyclic ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br2).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the α-halogenation of a ketone. In this reaction, a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom. Since cyclohexanone is symmetric, both α-positions are equivalent.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n*   **Reactant:** 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base, with heat.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents with an α-halo ketone that has protons on the other α-carbon (the C6 position) leads to a **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n    1.  The base (OH⁻) abstracts the most acidic proton, which is on the α-carbon not bearing the halogen (C6). This forms an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, where the carbanion attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion. This forms a bicyclic intermediate: bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one.\n    3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this strained bicyclic ketone.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, and the cyclopropane ring opens. The ring opening occurs to form the more stable carbanion. Cleavage of the C1-C6 bond results in a carbanion on a five-membered ring, which is more stable than the alternative.\n    5.  Protonation upon workup yields a carboxylic acid with a rearranged carbon skeleton.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagent:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is a standard reagent for converting carboxylic acids into acyl chlorides. Pyridine is a weak base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Reaction:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl).\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky, mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to alcohols.\n*   **Reaction:** The acyl chloride is reduced to an aldehyde.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclopentane ring undergoes rapid conformational changes (ring flipping). On the NMR timescale, this results in an effective plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the carbon it is attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the ring.\n*   **Counting Distinct Hydrogens:** We can use this plane of symmetry to identify equivalent and non-equivalent hydrogens.\n    *   **H_aldehyde:** The single proton of the aldehyde group (-CHO) is in a unique chemical environment. This is **Set 1**.\n    *   **H1:** The single proton on the carbon atom C1 (the one bonded to the aldehyde group) is also unique. This is **Set 2**.\n    *   **H2 and H5:** The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to the protons on C5. However, the two protons on C2 itself are not equivalent. They are diastereotopic because of their fixed, different spatial relationships to the aldehyde group (one is \"cis\" and one is \"trans\" to it in any given conformation). Therefore, they represent two distinct sets of protons.\n        *   The two \"cis-like\" protons (one on C2, one on C5) are equivalent to each other. This is **Set 3**.\n        *   The two \"trans-like\" protons (one on C2, one on C5) are equivalent to each other. This is **Set 4**.\n    *   **H3 and H4:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes the protons on C3 equivalent to the protons on C4. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic.\n        *   The two \"cis-like\" protons (one on C3, one on C4) are equivalent. This is **Set 5**.\n        *   The two \"trans-like\" protons (one on C3, one on C4) are equivalent. This is **Set 6**.\n\nIn total, there are 6 sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n1.  Aldehyde H (1H)\n2.  C1-H (1H)\n3.  C2/C5 H's (2H)\n4.  C2/C5 H's (2H)\n5.  C3/C4 H's (2H)\n6.  C3/C4 H's (2H)\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe synthesis described proceeds through the following steps:\n\n1.  **Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂) forms 2-bromocyclohexanone (Product 1).** This is a standard alpha-halogenation of a ketone.\n2.  **2-bromocyclohexanone is heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), forming a ring-contracted product (Product 2).** This reaction is a Favorskii rearrangement. In cyclic α-halo ketones, this rearrangement leads to a contraction of the ring. Thus, the six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to form cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n3.  **Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine, forming cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3).** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride.\n4.  **Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H), forming cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde (Product 4).** This reagent is a mild reducing agent known for the selective reduction of acyl chlorides to aldehydes.\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\nCyclopentanecarboxaldehyde has a plane of symmetry that includes the aldehyde group (CHO), the carbon it's attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1. This plane bisects the rest of the five-membered ring. Due to this symmetry:\n\n*   The **aldehyde proton** is unique. (1)\n*   The **proton on C1** (the carbon attached to the aldehyde) is unique. (1)\n*   The two protons on the adjacent carbons (C2 and C5) are equivalent to each other. However, the two protons on C2 itself are diastereotopic (not equivalent). This gives **two distinct signals** for the C2/C5 positions.\n*   Similarly, the two protons on the next set of carbons (C3 and C4) are equivalent. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. This results in another **two distinct signals** for the C3/C4 positions.\n\nCounting these up: 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (C2/C5-H's) + 2 (C3/C4-H's) = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe search results confirm my revised reaction pathway.\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine → 2-bromocyclohexanone (Product 1)**. This is a standard alpha-halogenation of a ketone.\n\n*   **Step 2: 2-bromocyclohexanone + heated NaOH → Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2)**. The search results confirm that α-halo ketones, especially cyclic ones, undergo a Favorskii rearrangement in the presence of a base like NaOH to give a ring-contracted carboxylic acid. For 2-bromocyclohexanone, this yields cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Step 3: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) → Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3)**. This is a standard conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acid chloride.\n\n*   **Step 4: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H) → Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (Product 4)**. The search results confirm that LiAl(OtBu)₃H is a specific, mild reducing agent used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to the alcohol.\n\nTherefore, the final product (Product 4) is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\nNow, I will determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring bonded to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n1.  **Aldehyde Hydrogen**: The hydrogen atom of the aldehyde group (-CHO) is unique. (1 distinct H)\n2.  **Alpha Hydrogen**: The hydrogen atom on the carbon of the ring that is directly attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is also unique. (1 distinct H)\n3.  **Beta Hydrogens**: The hydrogens on the two carbons adjacent to C1 (let's call them C2 and C5) are equivalent to each other due to the molecule having a plane of symmetry that passes through the C1-CHO bond and the C3-C4 bond (assuming rapid conformational averaging). However, on each of these carbons (C2 and C5), the two hydrogens are diastereotopic because of the chiral center at C1. One hydrogen is *cis* to the aldehyde group and the other is *trans*. The two *cis* hydrogens (one on C2, one on C5) are chemically equivalent to each other. The two *trans* hydrogens (one on C2, one on C5) are also chemically equivalent to each other, but distinct from the *cis* hydrogens. This gives two more sets of distinct hydrogens. (2 distinct sets of H)\n4.  **Gamma Hydrogens**: The hydrogens on the remaining two carbons of the ring (C3 and C4) are also equivalent to each other by the same plane of symmetry. Similar to the beta hydrogens, the two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic, as are the two on C4. The two \"upper\" hydrogens are equivalent, and the two \"lower\" hydrogens are equivalent. This gives another two sets of distinct hydrogens. (2 distinct sets of H)\n\nTotaling these up:\n*   Set 1: Aldehyde H (1H)\n*   Set 2: Alpha H (1H)\n*   Set 3: Beta-cis H's (2H)\n*   Set 4: Beta-trans H's (2H)\n*   Set 5: Gamma-cis H's (2H)\n*   Set 6: Gamma-trans H's (2H)\n\nThere are a total of **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\nFinal check of the logic.\n- Reaction sequence confirmed by searches.\n- Final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n- Symmetry analysis of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde:\n    - H(aldehyde) - unique\n    - H(alpha) - unique\n    - H(beta) - 4 hydrogens, but in 2 sets of 2 due to diastereotopicity.\n    - H(gamma) - 4 hydrogens, but in 2 sets of 2 due to diastereotopicity.\n- Total = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6 distinct sets.\n\nThe reasoning is sound.\n\nThe reaction sequence is as follows:\n1.  Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine to form 2-bromocyclohexanone (Product 1).\n2.  Product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide, undergoing a Favorskii rearrangement to form cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2).\n3.  Product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine to form cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3).\n4.  Product 3 is treated with the mild reducing agent Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, which reduces the acid chloride to an aldehyde, forming cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (Product 4).\n\nThe final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde, has the following hydrogen environments:\n*   The single aldehyde proton.\n*   The single proton on the carbon to which the aldehyde is attached (the alpha-carbon).\n*   The four protons on the two beta-carbons. These are divided into two sets of two equivalent protons because of their diastereotopic relationship to the alpha-carbon.\n*   The four protons on the two gamma-carbons. These are also divided into two sets of two equivalent protons.\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\nFinal answer is 6. This matches option C.\n\nFinal answer is C.\nThe reaction sequence leads to the formation of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n1.  **Cyclohexanone + Br₂ → 2-Bromocyclohexanone (Product 1)**: This is an α-bromination of a ketone.\n2.  **2-Bromocyclohexanone + NaOH, heat → Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2)**: This is a Favorskii rearrangement, a characteristic reaction of α-halo ketones with a base, resulting in ring contraction.\n3.  **Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid + SOCl₂/Pyridine → Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3)**: Thionyl chloride converts the carboxylic acid into an acid chloride.\n4.  **Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride + LiAl(OtBu)₃H → Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (Product 4)**: Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a selective reducing agent that converts an acid chloride to an aldehyde.\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we analyze its structure:\n*   **H1**: The aldehyde proton (-CHO). This is a unique environment.\n*   **H2**: The proton on the carbon atom of the ring attached to the aldehyde group (Cα). This is also a unique environment.\n*   **H3 & H4**: The four protons on the two carbons adjacent to Cα (the β-carbons). Due to the chiral center at Cα, the two protons on each β-carbon are diastereotopic (not equivalent). However, due to a plane of symmetry in the time-averaged structure, the two β-carbons are equivalent. Therefore, the four β-protons are split into two sets of two equivalent protons.\n*   **H5 & H6**: The four protons on the two γ-carbons. Similar to the β-protons, these are split into two sets of two equivalent protons.\n\nCounting the distinct sets: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (alpha) + 2 (beta sets) + 2 (gamma sets) = 6.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n1.  **Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂):** This reaction is an α-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine to form 2-bromocyclohexanone, which is **Product 1**.\n\n2.  **Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH):** When an α-halo ketone, like 2-bromocyclohexanone, is treated with a strong base such as NaOH, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a cyclopropanone intermediate, which then undergoes ring contraction. The six-membered ring of cyclohexanone contracts to a five-membered ring, forming cyclopentanecarboxylic acid as **Product 2**.\n\n3.  **Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2) reacts with thionyl chloride in a standard conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acyl chloride. Pyridine is used to neutralize the HCl gas produced during the reaction. This yields cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride as **Product 3**.\n\n4.  **Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H):** This reagent is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce highly reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes, and the reaction can be stopped at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to an alcohol. Therefore, cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3) is reduced to **Product 4**, which is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n### Analysis of Product 4\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must examine its structure and symmetry.\n\nThe structure consists of a cyclopentane ring bonded to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n1.  **Aldehyde Hydrogen:** The single hydrogen atom of the aldehyde group (-CHO) is chemically unique. (1 type)\n2.  **C1 Hydrogen:** The hydrogen atom on the carbon of the ring directly attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is also unique. (1 type)\n3.  **C2 and C5 Hydrogens:** The cyclopentane ring has a plane of symmetry passing through C1 and the aldehyde group. This makes the hydrogens on C2 equivalent to the hydrogens on C5. However, on each of these carbons, the two hydrogens are diastereotopic (one is *cis* to the aldehyde group, and one is *trans*). Therefore, the two *cis* hydrogens (on C2 and C5) form one set, and the two *trans* hydrogens form another set. (2 types)\n4.  **C3 and C4 Hydrogens:** Similarly, the hydrogens on C3 are equivalent to the hydrogens on C4 due to the plane of symmetry. Again, the two hydrogens on each of these carbons are diastereotopic. This gives two more sets of equivalent hydrogens. (2 types)\n\nCounting the distinct types:\n*   1 aldehyde hydrogen\n*   1 hydrogen on C1\n*   2 types of hydrogens on C2/C5\n*   2 types of hydrogens on C3/C4\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\n\nThis is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. In this reaction, one of the alpha-hydrogens (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is replaced by a bromine atom. The product is an α-haloketone.\n\n*   **Reactant**: Cyclohexanone\n*   **Reagent**: Br2\n*   **Product 1**: 2-bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\nProduct 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is an α-haloketone. When treated with a strong base like sodium hydroxide, it can undergo two possible reactions: elimination or Favorskii rearrangement.\n\n*   **Possibility A (Elimination)**: The base removes a proton from C3, and bromide is eliminated from C2 to form an α,β-unsaturated ketone, cyclohex-2-en-1-one.\n*   **Possibility B (Favorskii Rearrangement)**: This is a characteristic reaction for α-haloketones that have a proton on the other alpha-carbon (the α'-position, C6). The base (OH-) removes a proton from C6 to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2) in an intramolecular S_N2 reaction, forming a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one (a cyclopropanone intermediate). The hydroxide then attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the opening of the strained cyclopropanone ring. This results in ring contraction. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring with a carboxylate group. After protonation (during workup), the product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\nGiven the typical course of organic synthesis problems, the more unique and named reaction, the Favorskii rearrangement, is the intended pathway. We will proceed with this assumption and check if it leads to one of the given answers.\n\n*   **Reactant**: 2-bromocyclohexanone (Product 1)\n*   **Reagent**: NaOH, heat\n*   **Reaction**: Favorskii Rearrangement\n*   **Product 2**: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine**\n\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride (SOCl2) is the reagent for this transformation, and pyridine is a weak base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n\n*   **Reactant**: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2)\n*   **Reagent**: SOCl2, pyridine\n*   **Product 3**: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)3)**\n\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is well-known for the selective reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is not strong enough to reduce the aldehyde further to an alcohol.\n\n*   **Reactant**: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3)\n*   **Reagent**: LiAlH(O-t-Bu)3\n*   **Product 4**: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. We can do this by analyzing the symmetry of the molecule.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\nLet's label the carbons:\n*   C1 is the ring carbon bonded to the -CHO group.\n*   C2 and C5 are the adjacent ring carbons.\n*   C3 and C4 are the remaining two ring carbons.\n\nThe molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C1 carbon, its attached hydrogen, the entire aldehyde group, and bisects the C3-C4 bond. This symmetry makes certain positions equivalent.\n\n1.  **Aldehydic Proton**: The single hydrogen in the -CHO group is in a unique chemical environment. This is **1** distinct type of hydrogen.\n2.  **Methine Proton**: The single hydrogen on C1 is also in a unique environment, situated on the symmetry plane. This is a **2nd** distinct type of hydrogen.\n3.  **Alpha Protons (on C2 and C5)**: The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two hydrogens on C2 are diastereotopic (one is *cis* to the aldehyde group, one is *trans*). They are not chemically equivalent to each other. The same applies to C5. The *cis* proton on C2 is equivalent to the *cis* proton on C5, and the *trans* proton on C2 is equivalent to the *trans* proton on C5. This gives us **2** more distinct types of hydrogens. (Total so far: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4)\n4.  **Beta Protons (on C3 and C4)**: The plane of symmetry also makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the alpha protons, the two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic and not equivalent to each other. The protons on C3 are equivalent to their corresponding partners on C4. This gives us another **2** distinct types of hydrogens. (Total: 4 + 2 = 6)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCounting all the distinct sets of hydrogen atoms:\n*   Set 1: Aldehyde H (1H)\n*   Set 2: C1-H (1H)\n*   Set 3: C2-H & C5-H (*cis* to CHO) (2H)\n*   Set 4: C2-H & C5-H (*trans* to CHO) (2H)\n*   Set 5: C3-H & C4-H (one diastereotopic position) (2H)\n*   Set 6: C3-H & C4-H (the other diastereotopic position) (2H)\n\nThere are a total of **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone, a six-membered ring with a ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br2).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. In the presence of an acid or base catalyst, one of the alpha-hydrogens (on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n*   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone, an alpha-haloketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base, with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** These conditions are characteristic of the **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n    1.  A strong base (OH-) removes an acidic proton from the other alpha-carbon (C6), forming an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate performs an intramolecular S_N2 attack on the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion. This forms a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of the strained cyclopropanone.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, cleaving the bond between the carbonyl carbon and the more substituted alpha-carbon to form the more stable carbanion. In this case, the ring opens to form a carbanion on a five-membered ring.\n    5.  Protonation (during workup) of the resulting carboxylate gives a carboxylic acid. The six-membered ring has contracted to a five-membered ring.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *   *Alternative consideration:* An E2 elimination to form cyclohex-2-enone is also possible. However, the reagent in the next step (SOCl2) strongly suggests the product is a carboxylic acid, making the Favorskii rearrangement the correct pathway.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagent:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl2) with pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard and efficient method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl). Pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)3)**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)3).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a mild reducing agent. Unlike the more powerful LiAlH4 which would reduce an acyl chloride to a primary alcohol, LiAlH(OtBu)3 is sterically hindered and less reactive. It is selective for the reduction of acyl chlorides to aldehydes. The reaction stops at the aldehyde stage.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. \"Chemically distinct\" means the hydrogens are in non-equivalent chemical environments. This corresponds to the number of signals one would expect to see in a high-resolution proton NMR spectrum (assuming no accidental equivalence).\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\nLet's analyze the symmetry of the molecule. Due to rapid conformational changes (ring puckering) at room temperature, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry on the NMR timescale. This plane passes through the aldehyde group, the carbon it's attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the ring.\n\nLet's label the hydrogens and determine their equivalence based on this symmetry:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (CHO):** This proton is unique. It is on the plane of symmetry. (1 type)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This is the single proton on the carbon atom of the ring that is bonded to the aldehyde group. It is also on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 (a methylene group) are not equivalent to each other. They are **diastereotopic** because C1 is a prochiral center in the context of the ring. One proton is *cis* and the other is *trans* to the aldehyde group in any given conformation. They are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation. Therefore, they are chemically distinct. By symmetry, the protons on C5 are equivalent to their counterparts on C2. This gives us two sets of equivalent protons. (2 types)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. By symmetry, the protons on C4 are equivalent to their counterparts on C3. This gives us another two sets of equivalent protons. (2 types)\n\n**Counting the distinct types of hydrogens:**\n*   Type 1: Aldehyde H (1 proton in this set)\n*   Type 2: C1-H (1 proton in this set)\n*   Type 3: One set of H's on C2/C5 (2 protons in this set)\n*   Type 4: The other set of H's on C2/C5 (2 protons in this set)\n*   Type 5: One set of H's on C3/C4 (2 protons in this set)\n*   Type 6: The other set of H's on C3/C4 (2 protons in this set)\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis is a multi-step organic synthesis problem. Let's determine the structure of each product in the sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\nThis reaction is the α-halogenation of a ketone. A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom. Cyclohexanone is symmetrical, so the reaction yields a single major product.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 + Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH), heat → Product 2**\nThis is a classic **Favorskii rearrangement**. An α-halo ketone with an available proton on the other α-carbon (the α'-carbon) rearranges in the presence of a strong base to form a carboxylic acid derivative with a contracted ring.\n1.  The base (OH⁻) removes a proton from the α'-carbon (C6) to form an enolate.\n2.  The enolate performs an intramolecular S_N2 attack, displacing the bromide and forming a strained bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate.\n3.  The hydroxide attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the opening of the strained ring to form a more stable carbanion on a five-membered ring.\n4.  Upon workup (implicit), the resulting carboxylate is protonated.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 + Thionyl Chloride (SOCl₂) and Pyridine → Product 3**\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl).\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃) → Product 4**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is selective for the reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at that stage without further reduction to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow, we must determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. We need to analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond. Hydrogens that can be interchanged by this symmetry operation are chemically equivalent.\n\n1.  **Aldehyde Hydrogen:** The hydrogen atom of the aldehyde group (-C**H**O) is unique. This is **1 type**.\n2.  **C1 Hydrogen:** The single hydrogen on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde group is also in a unique environment. This is a **2nd type**.\n3.  **C2 and C5 Hydrogens:** Due to the plane of symmetry, C2 and C5 are equivalent. However, the two hydrogens on C2 are not equivalent to each other (they are diastereotopic). One is *cis* to the aldehyde group, and one is *trans*. The *cis*-H on C2 is equivalent to the *cis*-H on C5, and the *trans*-H on C2 is equivalent to the *trans*-H on C5. This gives us **two more types** of hydrogens.\n4.  **C3 and C4 Hydrogens:** Similarly, C3 and C4 are equivalent. The two hydrogens on C3 are also diastereotopic. The two hydrogens on C3 and C4 that are closer to C1 are equivalent, and the two that are further away are equivalent. This gives us the final **two types** of hydrogens.\n\nIn total, we have:\n*   1 type (aldehyde H)\n*   1 type (C1 H)\n*   2 types (from C2/C5 hydrogens)\n*   2 types (from C3/C4 hydrogens)\n\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone, a six-membered cyclic ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br2).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the α-halogenation of a ketone. In this reaction, a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom.

The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes the acidic proton from the α'-carbon (C6) to form an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate then performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 attack on the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclic ketone intermediate (bicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this strained intermediate.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, breaking the bond between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the α'-carbon (C6) to relieve the strain of the three-membered ring. This ring-opening step forms a carbanion.\n    5.  Protonation of the carbanion (upon acidic workup, which is implicit) yields a carboxylic acid with a contracted ring system.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. The six-membered ring has contracted to a five-membered ring.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagent:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard and efficient method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride.

A key characteristic of LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ is its ability to selectively reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the primary alcohol. This is a standard transformation taught in organic chemistry.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Final Analysis: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n```\n      O\n     //\n    C — H(a)\n    |\n   /C1\\ — H(b)\nH-C2--C5-H\n| |  | |\nH-C3--C4-H\n  \\----/\n```\n\nTo count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.

This is **1 type**.\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** Due to the plane of symmetry, carbon C2 is equivalent to carbon C5. However, the two protons on C2 are not equivalent to each other. They are **diastereotopic** because of their spatial relationship to the substituent on the prochiral C1 carbon. The same applies to C5. Therefore, the protons on C2 and C5 give rise to **2 distinct types** of hydrogen signals.\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes carbon C3 equivalent to carbon C4.

To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to examine the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the C-H bond on the same carbon (C1), and bisects the bond between C3 and C4. Due to this symmetry, protons that can be reflected onto one another are chemically equivalent.\n\nLet's count the sets of non-equivalent protons:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** The proton on the carbon atom of the ring that is bonded to the aldehyde group is also unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on each of these carbons (one pointing \"up\" and one \"down\" relative to the ring) are diastereotopic, meaning they are not equivalent to each other. Therefore, they represent two distinct types of protons. (2 types)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** These two carbons are also equivalent by symmetry. Similar to the C2/C5 protons, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.

This reaction involves the formation of a cyclopropanone intermediate, which then opens to form a ring-contracted carboxylic acid (or its salt). In this case, the six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to a five-membered ring.\n*   **Product 2 is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.**\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine**\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride.

It is specifically used to reduce highly reactive acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the alcohol.\n*   **Product 4 is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.**\n\n**Determining the Number of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (C₅H₉CHO). To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze the molecule's symmetry. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO) and the C1 carbon of the ring to which it is attached.\n\nLet's count the unique proton environments:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** The hydrogen attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde group is also unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** Due to the plane of symmetry, the protons on C2 are equivalent to the protons on C5. However, the two protons on C2 itself are not equivalent; they are diastereotopic. One is *cis* to the aldehyde group, and the other is *trans*. Therefore, these represent two distinct types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the protons on C3 are equivalent to those on C4. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. This gives another two distinct types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n\nTotaling these up: 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (C2/C5-H's) + 2 (C3/C4-H's) = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\nTherefore, product 4 has 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\nThis reaction is the α-bromination of a ketone.

This is one distinct type of hydrogen.\n2.  **Proton on C1:** The hydrogen atom on the carbon of the ring directly attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is also in a unique environment. This is a second distinct type of hydrogen.\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** The cyclopentane ring has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C1-CHO bond and the C3-C4 bond axis (assuming rapid conformational averaging). This symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to the protons on C5. However, on each of these carbons, the two protons are diastereotopic (one is \"cis\" to the aldehyde group, and one is \"trans\"). Therefore, the two cis protons (on C2 and C5) form one set of equivalent hydrogens, and the two trans protons form another set. This gives us two more distinct types of hydrogens.\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** The same plane of symmetry makes the protons on C3 equivalent to the protons on C4. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic. The two \"cis\" protons (on C3 and C4) are equivalent to each other, and the two \"trans\" protons are equivalent to each other.

However, the two protons on C2 are diastereotopic (one is *cis* and one is *trans* to the aldehyde group). The same is true for C5. The two *cis* protons (one on C2, one on C5) are equivalent to each other. The two *trans* protons (one on C2, one on C5) are also equivalent to each other. But the *cis* set is not equivalent to the *trans* set. This gives two distinct types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic, as are the two on C4. This results in one set of equivalent \"inner\" protons and one set of equivalent \"outer\" protons.

The bromine atom will add to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the alpha-carbon). The product is 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n    *   **Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) + NaOH (heated) → Product 2.** This is a reaction of an alpha-halo ketone with a strong base. This set of reagents is characteristic of the **Favorskii rearrangement**. In this reaction, the six-membered ring contracts to a five-membered ring, forming a carboxylic acid derivative. The product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *   **Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and Pyridine → Product 3.** Thionyl chloride is a standard reagent for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride.

(1 type)\n        3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** These are the carbons adjacent to C1. The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, on each of these carbons, there are two protons. These two protons are diastereotopic because C1 is a stereocenter. Therefore, they are chemically distinct from each other. This gives us two more types of hydrogens (one set of two equivalent protons, and another set of two equivalent protons). (2 types)\n        4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** These are the carbons beta to C1. The plane of symmetry also makes C3 and C4 equivalent.

The reaction proceeds via an enol or enolate intermediate. One of the α-hydrogens (on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is replaced by a bromine atom. Since cyclohexanone is symmetrical, both α-positions (C2 and C6) are equivalent.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n*   **Starting Material:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium hydroxide (a strong base) and heat.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic reaction of an α-halo ketone with a base. While elimination to form an α,β-unsaturated ketone is possible, the presence of an abstractable proton on the other α-carbon (the α'-position, C6) strongly favors a **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n    1.  The base (OH⁻) removes the acidic α'-proton from C6 to form an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate undergoes an intramolecular S_N2 reaction: the carbanion at C6 attacks C2, displacing the bromide ion (Br⁻) to form a strained bicyclic ketone intermediate (bicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this intermediate.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, and the ring opens by cleaving the bond between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the α'-carbon (C6). This relieves the strain of the three-membered ring and results in the formation of a five-membered ring with a carboxylate group.\n    5.  Upon acidic workup (which is implied before the next step), the carboxylate is protonated.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *   *Note:* If simple elimination had occurred, the product would be cyclohex-2-en-1-one. However, this compound would not react with thionyl chloride in the next step, making the Favorskii rearrangement the only logical pathway consistent with the entire reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n*   **Starting Material:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagents:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is the standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl gas produced during the reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\n*   **Starting Material:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a selective reduction. LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ is a sterically hindered and less reactive hydride donor than LiAlH₄. It is known to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes, stopping at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to the primary alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. We can do this by analyzing the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring with a formyl group (-CHO) attached.\n*   **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclopentane ring undergoes rapid conformational changes (puckering). On the NMR time scale, this results in an effective plane of symmetry that passes through the C-CHO bond, the carbon it's attached to (C1), and the midpoint of the opposite C-C bond (the C3-C4 bond).\n*   **Counting Distinct Hydrogens:**\n    1.  **Aldehyde Hydrogen:** The hydrogen atom of the -CHO group is in a unique chemical environment.

This is a **2nd** type.\n    3.  **C2 and C5 Hydrogens:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, on each of these carbons, the two hydrogen atoms are diastereotopic (one is cis to the -CHO group, the other is trans). They are not chemically equivalent to each other. Therefore, the two hydrogens on C2/C5 constitute two different sets of equivalent protons. This gives **2** more types.\n    4.  **C3 and C4 Hydrogens:** The plane of symmetry also makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two hydrogens on each of these carbons are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. This gives another **2** types.\n\n*   **Total Count:**\n    *   Type 1: Aldehyde-H (1H)\n    *   Type 2: C1-H (1H)\n    *   Type 3: C2-H & C5-H (cis) (2H total)\n    *   Type 4: C2-H & C5-H (trans) (2H total)\n    *   Type 5: C3-H & C4-H (one set) (2H total)\n    *   Type 6: C3-H & C4-H (the other set) (2H total)\n\nIn total, there are **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 4 and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone, a six-membered cyclic ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br2).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the α-halogenation of a ketone. In this reaction, a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom.

The base (OH⁻) abstracts the most acidic proton, which is on the α-carbon not bearing the halogen (C6). This forms an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, where the carbanion attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion. This forms a bicyclic intermediate: bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one.\n    3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this strained bicyclic ketone.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, and the cyclopropane ring opens. The ring opening occurs to form the more stable carbanion. Cleavage of the C1-C6 bond results in a carbanion on a five-membered ring, which is more stable than the alternative.\n    5.  Protonation upon workup yields a carboxylic acid with a rearranged carbon skeleton.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagent:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is a standard reagent for converting carboxylic acids into acyl chlorides.

It is specifically used to reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to alcohols.\n*   **Reaction:** The acyl chloride is reduced to an aldehyde.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclopentane ring undergoes rapid conformational changes (ring flipping). On the NMR timescale, this results in an effective plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the carbon it is attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the ring.\n*   **Counting Distinct Hydrogens:** We can use this plane of symmetry to identify equivalent and non-equivalent hydrogens.\n    *   **H_aldehyde:** The single proton of the aldehyde group (-CHO) is in a unique chemical environment. This is **Set 1**.\n    *   **H1:** The single proton on the carbon atom C1 (the one bonded to the aldehyde group) is also unique. This is **Set 2**.\n    *   **H2 and H5:** The plane of symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to the protons on C5. However, the two protons on C2 itself are not equivalent. They are diastereotopic because of their fixed, different spatial relationships to the aldehyde group (one is \"cis\" and one is \"trans\" to it in any given conformation). Therefore, they represent two distinct sets of protons.\n        *   The two \"cis-like\" protons (one on C2, one on C5) are equivalent to each other. This is **Set 3**.\n        *   The two \"trans-like\" protons (one on C2, one on C5) are equivalent to each other. This is **Set 4**.\n    *   **H3 and H4:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes the protons on C3 equivalent to the protons on C4. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic.\n        *   The two \"cis-like\" protons (one on C3, one on C4) are equivalent. This is **Set 5**.\n        *   The two \"trans-like\" protons (one on C3, one on C4) are equivalent. This is **Set 6**.\n\nIn total, there are 6 sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n1.

C3/C4 H's (2H)\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThe synthesis described proceeds through the following steps:\n\n1.  **Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂) forms 2-bromocyclohexanone (Product 1).** This is a standard alpha-halogenation of a ketone.\n2.  **2-bromocyclohexanone is heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), forming a ring-contracted product (Product 2).** This reaction is a Favorskii rearrangement. In cyclic α-halo ketones, this rearrangement leads to a contraction of the ring. Thus, the six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to form cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n3.  **Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine, forming cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3).** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride.\n4.  **Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H), forming cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde (Product 4).** This reagent is a mild reducing agent known for the selective reduction of acyl chlorides to aldehydes.\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\nCyclopentanecarboxaldehyde has a plane of symmetry that includes the aldehyde group (CHO), the carbon it's attached to (C1), and the hydrogen on C1. This plane bisects the rest of the five-membered ring. Due to this symmetry:\n\n*   The **aldehyde proton** is unique. (1)\n*   The **proton on C1** (the carbon attached to the aldehyde) is unique. (1)\n*   The two protons on the adjacent carbons (C2 and C5) are equivalent to each other. However, the two protons on C2 itself are diastereotopic (not equivalent). This gives **two distinct signals** for the C2/C5 positions.\n*   Similarly, the two protons on the next set of carbons (C3 and C4) are equivalent. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. This results in another **two distinct signals** for the C3/C4 positions.\n\nCounting these up: 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (C2/C5-H's) + 2 (C3/C4-H's) = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe search results confirm my revised reaction pathway.\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine → 2-bromocyclohexanone (Product 1)**. This is a standard alpha-halogenation of a ketone.\n\n*   **Step 2: 2-bromocyclohexanone + heated NaOH → Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2)**. The search results confirm that α-halo ketones, especially cyclic ones, undergo a Favorskii rearrangement in the presence of a base like NaOH to give a ring-contracted carboxylic acid. For 2-bromocyclohexanone, this yields cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n*   **Step 3: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) → Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3)**. This is a standard conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acid chloride.\n\n*   **Step 4: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H) → Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (Product 4)**. The search results confirm that LiAl(OtBu)₃H is a specific, mild reducing agent used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to the alcohol.\n\nTherefore, the final product (Product 4) is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\nNow, I will determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring bonded to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n1.  **Aldehyde Hydrogen**: The hydrogen atom of the aldehyde group (-CHO) is unique. (1 distinct H)\n2.  **Alpha Hydrogen**: The hydrogen atom on the carbon of the ring that is directly attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is also unique. (1 distinct H)\n3.  **Beta Hydrogens**: The hydrogens on the two carbons adjacent to C1 (let's call them C2 and C5) are equivalent to each other due to the molecule having a plane of symmetry that passes through the C1-CHO bond and the C3-C4 bond (assuming rapid conformational averaging). However, on each of these carbons (C2 and C5), the two hydrogens are diastereotopic because of the chiral center at C1. One hydrogen is *cis* to the aldehyde group and the other is *trans*. The two *cis* hydrogens (one on C2, one on C5) are chemically equivalent to each other. The two *trans* hydrogens (one on C2, one on C5) are also chemically equivalent to each other, but distinct from the *cis* hydrogens. This gives two more sets of distinct hydrogens. (2 distinct sets of H)\n4.  **Gamma Hydrogens**: The hydrogens on the remaining two carbons of the ring (C3 and C4) are also equivalent to each other by the same plane of symmetry. Similar to the beta hydrogens, the two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic, as are the two on C4. The two \"upper\" hydrogens are equivalent, and the two \"lower\" hydrogens are equivalent. This gives another two sets of distinct hydrogens. (2 distinct sets of H)\n\nTotaling these up:\n*   Set 1: Aldehyde H (1H)\n*   Set 2: Alpha H (1H)\n*   Set 3: Beta-cis H's (2H)\n*   Set 4: Beta-trans H's (2H)\n*   Set 5: Gamma-cis H's (2H)\n*   Set 6: Gamma-trans H's (2H)\n\nThere are a total of **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\nFinal check of the logic.\n- Reaction sequence confirmed by searches.\n- Final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n- Symmetry analysis of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde:\n    - H(aldehyde) - unique\n    - H(alpha) - unique\n    - H(beta) - 4 hydrogens, but in 2 sets of 2 due to diastereotopicity.\n    - H(gamma) - 4 hydrogens, but in 2 sets of 2 due to diastereotopicity.\n- Total = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6 distinct sets.\n\nThe reasoning is sound.\n\nThe reaction sequence is as follows:\n1.  Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine to form 2-bromocyclohexanone (Product 1).\n2.  Product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide, undergoing a Favorskii rearrangement to form cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2).\n3.  Product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine to form cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3).\n4.  Product 3 is treated with the mild reducing agent Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, which reduces the acid chloride to an aldehyde, forming cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (Product 4).\n\nThe final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde, has the following hydrogen environments:\n*   The single aldehyde proton.\n*   The single proton on the carbon to which the aldehyde is attached (the alpha-carbon).\n*   The four protons on the two beta-carbons. These are divided into two sets of two equivalent protons because of their diastereotopic relationship to the alpha-carbon.\n*   The four protons on the two gamma-carbons. These are also divided into two sets of two equivalent protons.\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6 chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\nFinal answer is 6. This matches option C.\n\nFinal answer is C.\nThe reaction sequence leads to the formation of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n1.  **Cyclohexanone + Br₂ → 2-Bromocyclohexanone (Product 1)**: This is an α-bromination of a ketone.\n2.  **2-Bromocyclohexanone + NaOH, heat → Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2)**: This is a Favorskii rearrangement, a characteristic reaction of α-halo ketones with a base, resulting in ring contraction.\n3.  **Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid + SOCl₂/Pyridine → Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3)**: Thionyl chloride converts the carboxylic acid into an acid chloride.\n4.  **Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride + LiAl(OtBu)₃H → Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (Product 4)**: Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a selective reducing agent that converts an acid chloride to an aldehyde.\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we analyze its structure:\n*   **H1**: The aldehyde proton (-CHO). This is a unique environment.\n*   **H2**: The proton on the carbon atom of the ring attached to the aldehyde group (Cα). This is also a unique environment.\n*   **H3 & H4**: The four protons on the two carbons adjacent to Cα (the β-carbons). Due to the chiral center at Cα, the two protons on each β-carbon are diastereotopic (not equivalent). However, due to a plane of symmetry in the time-averaged structure, the two β-carbons are equivalent. Therefore, the four β-protons are split into two sets of two equivalent protons.\n*   **H5 & H6**: The four protons on the two γ-carbons. Similar to the β-protons, these are split into two sets of two equivalent protons.\n\nCounting the distinct sets: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (alpha) + 2 (beta sets) + 2 (gamma sets) = 6.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n1.  **Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂):** This reaction is an α-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine to form 2-bromocyclohexanone, which is **Product 1**.\n\n2.  **Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH):** When an α-halo ketone, like 2-bromocyclohexanone, is treated with a strong base such as NaOH, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a cyclopropanone intermediate, which then undergoes ring contraction. The six-membered ring of cyclohexanone contracts to a five-membered ring, forming cyclopentanecarboxylic acid as **Product 2**.\n\n3.  **Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2) reacts with thionyl chloride in a standard conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acyl chloride. Pyridine is used to neutralize the HCl gas produced during the reaction. This yields cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride as **Product 3**.\n\n4.  **Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)₃H):** This reagent is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce highly reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes, and the reaction can be stopped at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to an alcohol. Therefore, cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3) is reduced to **Product 4**, which is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n### Analysis of Product 4\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must examine its structure and symmetry.\n\nThe structure consists of a cyclopentane ring bonded to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n1.  **Aldehyde Hydrogen:** The single hydrogen atom of the aldehyde group (-CHO) is chemically unique. (1 type)\n2.  **C1 Hydrogen:** The hydrogen atom on the carbon of the ring directly attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is also unique. (1 type)\n3.  **C2 and C5 Hydrogens:** The cyclopentane ring has a plane of symmetry passing through C1 and the aldehyde group. This makes the hydrogens on C2 equivalent to the hydrogens on C5. However, on each of these carbons, the two hydrogens are diastereotopic (one is *cis* to the aldehyde group, and one is *trans*). Therefore, the two *cis* hydrogens (on C2 and C5) form one set, and the two *trans* hydrogens form another set. (2 types)\n4.  **C3 and C4 Hydrogens:** Similarly, the hydrogens on C3 are equivalent to the hydrogens on C4 due to the plane of symmetry. Again, the two hydrogens on each of these carbons are diastereotopic. This gives two more sets of equivalent hydrogens. (2 types)\n\nCounting the distinct types:\n*   1 aldehyde hydrogen\n*   1 hydrogen on C1\n*   2 types of hydrogens on C2/C5\n*   2 types of hydrogens on C3/C4\n\nIn total, there are 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\n\nThis is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. In this reaction, one of the alpha-hydrogens (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is replaced by a bromine atom. The product is an α-haloketone.\n\n*   **Reactant**: Cyclohexanone\n*   **Reagent**: Br2\n*   **Product 1**: 2-bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n\nProduct 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) is an α-haloketone. When treated with a strong base like sodium hydroxide, it can undergo two possible reactions: elimination or Favorskii rearrangement.\n\n*   **Possibility A (Elimination)**: The base removes a proton from C3, and bromide is eliminated from C2 to form an α,β-unsaturated ketone, cyclohex-2-en-1-one.\n*   **Possibility B (Favorskii Rearrangement)**: This is a characteristic reaction for α-haloketones that have a proton on the other alpha-carbon (the α'-position, C6). The base (OH-) removes a proton from C6 to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbon bearing the bromine (C2) in an intramolecular S_N2 reaction, forming a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one (a cyclopropanone intermediate). The hydroxide then attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the opening of the strained cyclopropanone ring. This results in ring contraction. The six-membered ring becomes a five-membered ring with a carboxylate group. After protonation (during workup), the product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\nGiven the typical course of organic synthesis problems, the more unique and named reaction, the Favorskii rearrangement, is the intended pathway. We will proceed with this assumption and check if it leads to one of the given answers.\n\n*   **Reactant**: 2-bromocyclohexanone (Product 1)\n*   **Reagent**: NaOH, heat\n*   **Reaction**: Favorskii Rearrangement\n*   **Product 2**: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine**\n\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride (SOCl2) is the reagent for this transformation, and pyridine is a weak base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n\n*   **Reactant**: Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2)\n*   **Reagent**: SOCl2, pyridine\n*   **Product 3**: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)3)**\n\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is well-known for the selective reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is not strong enough to reduce the aldehyde further to an alcohol.\n\n*   **Reactant**: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3)\n*   **Reagent**: LiAlH(O-t-Bu)3\n*   **Product 4**: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product, cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. We can do this by analyzing the symmetry of the molecule.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\nLet's label the carbons:\n*   C1 is the ring carbon bonded to the -CHO group.\n*   C2 and C5 are the adjacent ring carbons.\n*   C3 and C4 are the remaining two ring carbons.\n\nThe molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C1 carbon, its attached hydrogen, the entire aldehyde group, and bisects the C3-C4 bond. This symmetry makes certain positions equivalent.\n\n1.  **Aldehydic Proton**: The single hydrogen in the -CHO group is in a unique chemical environment. This is **1** distinct type of hydrogen.\n2.  **Methine Proton**: The single hydrogen on C1 is also in a unique environment, situated on the symmetry plane. This is a **2nd** distinct type of hydrogen.\n3.  **Alpha Protons (on C2 and C5)**: The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two hydrogens on C2 are diastereotopic (one is *cis* to the aldehyde group, one is *trans*). They are not chemically equivalent to each other. The same applies to C5. The *cis* proton on C2 is equivalent to the *cis* proton on C5, and the *trans* proton on C2 is equivalent to the *trans* proton on C5. This gives us **2** more distinct types of hydrogens. (Total so far: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4)\n4.  **Beta Protons (on C3 and C4)**: The plane of symmetry also makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the alpha protons, the two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic and not equivalent to each other. The protons on C3 are equivalent to their corresponding partners on C4. This gives us another **2** distinct types of hydrogens. (Total: 4 + 2 = 6)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCounting all the distinct sets of hydrogen atoms:\n*   Set 1: Aldehyde H (1H)\n*   Set 2: C1-H (1H)\n*   Set 3: C2-H & C5-H (*cis* to CHO) (2H)\n*   Set 4: C2-H & C5-H (*trans* to CHO) (2H)\n*   Set 5: C3-H & C4-H (one diastereotopic position) (2H)\n*   Set 6: C3-H & C4-H (the other diastereotopic position) (2H)\n\nThere are a total of **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone, a six-membered ring with a ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br2).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. In the presence of an acid or base catalyst, one of the alpha-hydrogens (on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n*   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone, an alpha-haloketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base, with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** These conditions are characteristic of the **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n    1.  A strong base (OH-) removes an acidic proton from the other alpha-carbon (C6), forming an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate performs an intramolecular S_N2 attack on the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion. This forms a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon of the strained cyclopropanone.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, cleaving the bond between the carbonyl carbon and the more substituted alpha-carbon to form the more stable carbanion. In this case, the ring opens to form a carbanion on a five-membered ring.\n    5.  Protonation (during workup) of the resulting carboxylate gives a carboxylic acid. The six-membered ring has contracted to a five-membered ring.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n    *   *Alternative consideration:* An E2 elimination to form cyclohex-2-enone is also possible. However, the reagent in the next step (SOCl2) strongly suggests the product is a carboxylic acid, making the Favorskii rearrangement the correct pathway.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagent:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl2) with pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard and efficient method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl). Pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)3)**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)3).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a mild reducing agent. Unlike the more powerful LiAlH4 which would reduce an acyl chloride to a primary alcohol, LiAlH(OtBu)3 is sterically hindered and less reactive. It is selective for the reduction of acyl chlorides to aldehydes. The reaction stops at the aldehyde stage.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. \"Chemically distinct\" means the hydrogens are in non-equivalent chemical environments. This corresponds to the number of signals one would expect to see in a high-resolution proton NMR spectrum (assuming no accidental equivalence).\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\nLet's analyze the symmetry of the molecule. Due to rapid conformational changes (ring puckering) at room temperature, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry on the NMR timescale. This plane passes through the aldehyde group, the carbon it's attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond of the ring.\n\nLet's label the hydrogens and determine their equivalence based on this symmetry:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (CHO):** This proton is unique. It is on the plane of symmetry. (1 type)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** This is the single proton on the carbon atom of the ring that is bonded to the aldehyde group. It is also on the plane of symmetry and is unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 (a methylene group) are not equivalent to each other. They are **diastereotopic** because C1 is a prochiral center in the context of the ring. One proton is *cis* and the other is *trans* to the aldehyde group in any given conformation. They are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation. Therefore, they are chemically distinct. By symmetry, the protons on C5 are equivalent to their counterparts on C2. This gives us two sets of equivalent protons. (2 types)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry makes C3 and C4 equivalent. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. By symmetry, the protons on C4 are equivalent to their counterparts on C3. This gives us another two sets of equivalent protons. (2 types)\n\n**Counting the distinct types of hydrogens:**\n*   Type 1: Aldehyde H (1 proton in this set)\n*   Type 2: C1-H (1 proton in this set)\n*   Type 3: One set of H's on C2/C5 (2 protons in this set)\n*   Type 4: The other set of H's on C2/C5 (2 protons in this set)\n*   Type 5: One set of H's on C3/C4 (2 protons in this set)\n*   Type 6: The other set of H's on C3/C4 (2 protons in this set)\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis is a multi-step organic synthesis problem. Let's determine the structure of each product in the sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine (Br₂) → Product 1**\nThis reaction is the α-halogenation of a ketone. A hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom. Cyclohexanone is symmetrical, so the reaction yields a single major product.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 + Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH), heat → Product 2**\nThis is a classic **Favorskii rearrangement**. An α-halo ketone with an available proton on the other α-carbon (the α'-carbon) rearranges in the presence of a strong base to form a carboxylic acid derivative with a contracted ring.\n1.  The base (OH⁻) removes a proton from the α'-carbon (C6) to form an enolate.\n2.  The enolate performs an intramolecular S_N2 attack, displacing the bromide and forming a strained bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate.\n3.  The hydroxide attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the opening of the strained ring to form a more stable carbanion on a five-membered ring.\n4.  Upon workup (implicit), the resulting carboxylate is protonated.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 + Thionyl Chloride (SOCl₂) and Pyridine → Product 3**\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride.

It is selective for the reduction of acid chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at that stage without further reduction to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow, we must determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. We need to analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO), the ring carbon it is attached to (C1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond. Hydrogens that can be interchanged by this symmetry operation are chemically equivalent.\n\n1.  **Aldehyde Hydrogen:** The hydrogen atom of the aldehyde group (-C**H**O) is unique. This is **1 type**.\n2.  **C1 Hydrogen:** The single hydrogen on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde group is also in a unique environment. This is a **2nd type**.\n3.  **C2 and C5 Hydrogens:** Due to the plane of symmetry, C2 and C5 are equivalent. However, the two hydrogens on C2 are not equivalent to each other (they are diastereotopic). One is *cis* to the aldehyde group, and one is *trans*. The *cis*-H on C2 is equivalent to the *cis*-H on C5, and the *trans*-H on C2 is equivalent to the *trans*-H on C5. This gives us **two more types** of hydrogens.\n4.  **C3 and C4 Hydrogens:** Similarly, C3 and C4 are equivalent. The two hydrogens on C3 are also diastereotopic. The two hydrogens on C3 and C4 that are closer to C1 are equivalent, and the two that are further away are equivalent. This gives us the final **two types** of hydrogens.\n\nIn total, we have:\n*   1 type (aldehyde H)\n*   1 type (C1 H)\n*   2 types (from C2/C5 hydrogens)\n*   2 types (from C3/C4 hydrogens)\n\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone, a six-membered cyclic ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br2).\n*   **Reaction:** This is the α-halogenation of a ketone. In this reaction, a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom. Since cyclohexanone is symmetric, the two α-positions are equivalent.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-Bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\n*   **Reactant:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base, with heat.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents applied to an α-halo ketone that has a proton on the other α-carbon (the α'-position) leads to a classic named reaction called the **Favorskii rearrangement**.\n    1.  The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes the acidic proton from the α'-carbon (C6) to form an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate then performs an intramolecular Sₙ2 attack on the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclic ketone intermediate (bicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-one).\n    3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this strained intermediate.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, breaking the bond between the original carbonyl carbon (C1) and the α'-carbon (C6) to relieve the strain of the three-membered ring. This ring-opening step forms a carbanion.\n    5.  Protonation of the carbanion (upon acidic workup, which is implicit) yields a carboxylic acid with a contracted ring system.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. The six-membered ring has contracted to a five-membered ring.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagent:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard and efficient method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. SOCl₂ is the chlorinating agent, and pyridine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl gas produced as a byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃)**\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a bulky, mild reducing agent. A key characteristic of LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ is its ability to selectively reduce acyl chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the primary alcohol. This is a standard transformation taught in organic chemistry.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n**Final Analysis: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde)**\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n```\n      O\n     //\n    C — H(a)\n    |\n   /C1\\ — H(b)\nH-C2--C5-H\n| |  | |\nH-C3--C4-H\n  \\----/\n```\n\nTo count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule. Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (H-C=O), the C1 carbon of the ring, and bisects the C3-C4 bond.\n\n1.  **Aldehyde Proton (H_a):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. It is the only aldehyde proton. This is **1 type**.\n2.  **Methine Proton on C1 (H_b):** This proton is attached to the carbon (C1) that links the ring to the aldehyde group. It is also unique. This is **1 type**.\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** Due to the plane of symmetry, carbon C2 is equivalent to carbon C5. However, the two protons on C2 are not equivalent to each other. They are **diastereotopic** because of their spatial relationship to the substituent on the prochiral C1 carbon. The same applies to C5. Therefore, the protons on C2 and C5 give rise to **2 distinct types** of hydrogen signals.\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the plane of symmetry makes carbon C3 equivalent to carbon C4. The two protons on C3 are also **diastereotopic**. This gives another **2 distinct types** of hydrogen signals.\n\n**Total Count:**\n*   Aldehyde H: 1 type\n*   C1-H: 1 type\n*   C2/C5 Protons: 2 types\n*   C3/C4 Protons: 2 types\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\nThis corresponds to the number of signals one would expect to see in the ¹H NMR spectrum of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n*   **Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\n    This reaction is the alpha-bromination of a ketone.

It is less reactive than lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄), which allows the reaction to stop at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to an alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n### Analysis of Product 4\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to examine the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the C-H bond on the same carbon (C1), and bisects the bond between C3 and C4. Due to this symmetry, protons that can be reflected onto one another are chemically equivalent.\n\nLet's count the sets of non-equivalent protons:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** The proton on the carbon atom of the ring that is bonded to the aldehyde group is also unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on each of these carbons (one pointing \"up\" and one \"down\" relative to the ring) are diastereotopic, meaning they are not equivalent to each other. Therefore, they represent two distinct types of protons. (2 types)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** These two carbons are also equivalent by symmetry. Similar to the C2/C5 protons, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. (2 types)\n\nTallying these up: 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (C2/C5-H's) + 2 (C3/C4-H's) = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\nTherefore, the ¹H NMR spectrum of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde would show 6 distinct signals.\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine**\nThis reaction is the α-bromination of a ketone.

To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze the molecule's symmetry. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (CHO) and the C1 carbon of the ring to which it is attached.\n\nLet's count the unique proton environments:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (-CHO):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **The proton on C1:** The hydrogen attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde group is also unique. (1 type)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** Due to the plane of symmetry, the protons on C2 are equivalent to the protons on C5. However, the two protons on C2 itself are not equivalent; they are diastereotopic. One is *cis* to the aldehyde group, and the other is *trans*. Therefore, these represent two distinct types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, the protons on C3 are equivalent to those on C4. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic. This gives another two distinct types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n\nTotaling these up: 1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (C2/C5-H's) + 2 (C3/C4-H's) = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\nTherefore, product 4 has 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\nThis reaction is the α-bromination of a ketone. One of the hydrogen atoms on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-carbon) is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\nWhen an α-halo ketone, such as 2-bromocyclohexanone, is treated with a strong base like NaOH, it undergoes a ring-contracting rearrangement known as the Favorskii rearrangement.

To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to examine the molecule's structure and symmetry.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring with a -CHO (aldehyde) group attached.\n\n1.  **Aldehyde Proton:** The hydrogen atom in the aldehyde group (-CHO) is in a unique chemical environment. This is one distinct type of hydrogen.\n2.  **Proton on C1:** The hydrogen atom on the carbon of the ring directly attached to the aldehyde group (C1) is also in a unique environment. This is a second distinct type of hydrogen.\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** The cyclopentane ring has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C1-CHO bond and the C3-C4 bond axis (assuming rapid conformational averaging). This symmetry makes the protons on C2 equivalent to the protons on C5. However, on each of these carbons, the two protons are diastereotopic (one is \"cis\" to the aldehyde group, and one is \"trans\"). Therefore, the two cis protons (on C2 and C5) form one set of equivalent hydrogens, and the two trans protons form another set. This gives us two more distinct types of hydrogens.\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** The same plane of symmetry makes the protons on C3 equivalent to the protons on C4. Similar to the C2/C5 positions, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic. The two \"cis\" protons (on C3 and C4) are equivalent to each other, and the two \"trans\" protons are equivalent to each other. This adds another two distinct types of hydrogens.\n\nIn total, we have:\n*   Set 1: Aldehyde H (1H)\n*   Set 2: C1-H (1H)\n*   Set 3: C2/C5 \"cis\" H's (2H)\n*   Set 4: C2/C5 \"trans\" H's (2H)\n*   Set 5: C3/C4 \"cis\" H's (2H)\n*   Set 6: C3/C4 \"trans\" H's (2H)\n\nThis gives a total of **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
