The consensus on the chemical structure is unanimous and correct.\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The formula is **C9H11NO2**.\n    *   The DoU is calculated as: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5`.\n    *   This value strongly indicates the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional pi bond, which corresponds to the carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The two bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch in a **conjugated ester**.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The signals at **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)** and **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)** represent an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The crucial detail is the high chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm), which indicates the methylene group is attached to an oxygen atom, confirming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The **broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H)** confirms the two exchangeable protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corroborating the IR data.\n    *   The two doublets at **7.0 ppm (2H)** and **8.0 ppm (2H)** are a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The upfield doublet (7.0 ppm) is adjacent to the electron-donating amine group, while the downfield doublet (8.0 ppm) is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n### Assembling the Structure\n\nCombining all the evidence leads to a single, unambiguous structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group attached at the 1 and 4 (para) positions. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### Careful Points and Evaluation of Options\n\n*   **Functional Group Identification:** The IR data clearly shows a primary amine and a conjugated ester, ruling out amides (Options A, B) and phenyl esters (Option D).\n*   **Isomer Distinction:** The key to distinguishing between ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (C) and its isomer 4-aminophenyl propionate (D) is the NMR chemical shift of the methylene quartet. In our compound, it's at 4.5 ppm, indicating it's attached to an ester oxygen (-O-CH₂-). In 4-aminophenyl propionate, the methylene group would be next to the carbonyl (-CO-CH₂-), and its signal would appear around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The NMR aromatic region clearly indicates a 1,4-(para) substitution pattern, ruling out any ortho or meta isomers like 3-ethoxybenzamide (B).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe spectral data unequivocally identifies the compound as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Matching this name to the options provided in the question:\n\nA) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide\nB) 3-ethoxybenzamide\n**C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**\nD) 4-aminophenyl propionate\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on the provided candidate answers and a thorough analysis of the spectroscopic data, here is a step-by-step determination of the correct compound.\n\n### **Analysis of Candidate Responses**\n\nAll 15 candidate answers, despite variations in their final letter choice, demonstrate a unanimous and correct interpretation of the chemical data. The discrepancy in the final letter (A, B, C, or D) is due to the options being presented in a different order for each candidate. However, the core chemical conclusion reached by every single one is the same: the compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Spectroscopic Analysis**\n\nHere is a consolidated breakdown of the evidence that all candidates correctly identified:\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n    *   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n    *   **DoU Calculation:** The degree of unsaturation is calculated as `C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`, which for this formula is `9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional pi bond (the 5th degree), which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct bands are a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The two absorptions correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This single piece of data rules out any secondary or tertiary amines/amides.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The frequency of 1720 cm⁻¹ is crucial. It is typical for an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (usually <1700 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (Ar-O-COR, usually >1750 cm⁻¹).\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is a key piece of evidence. This significant downfield shift indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached directly to an electronegative oxygen atom within an **ester group (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. If it were an ether, the shift would be closer to 4.0 ppm. If it were adjacent to a carbonyl (like in 4-aminophenyl propionate), it would be around 2.5 ppm.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group identified in the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in chemical shifts indicates one substituent is electron-donating (the amine), which shields its ortho protons (shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm), and the other is electron-withdrawing (the ester), which deshields its ortho protons (shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm).\n\n### **Conclusion and Evaluation of Options**\n\nAssembling all the fragments deduced from the data—a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring—leads to the unique and unambiguous structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, we evaluate the options provided in the original question:\n\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide.\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all spectral data.\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an isomer, but as noted, its NMR spectrum would be different.\n\nThe comprehensive and consistent analysis across all data points confirms that the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first analyze the reasoning of the provided candidate answers to find a consensus. Then, I will perform my own independent, step-by-step analysis of the spectroscopic data to verify the consensus structure. Finally, I will match this confirmed structure to the specific list of options provided in the original question to determine the correct letter choice.\n\n**Analysis of Candidate Answers**\nA careful review of all 15 candidate answers reveals a critical point: while their final letter choices (`<<<A>>>`, `<<<B>>>`, `<<<C>>>`, or `<<<D>>>`) are inconsistent, their chemical reasoning is unanimous. Every single agent correctly interprets the spectral data and concludes that the unknown compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The discrepancy in the final letter is due to the agents referencing different or randomized option lists. Therefore, the core task is to confirm this chemical conclusion and then map it to the correct letter from the original question's list.\n\n**Step-by-Step Spectroscopic Analysis**\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2) and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The DoU is calculated as: `DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5`.\n    *   A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (4 degrees) plus one additional pi bond (1 degree), which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The two bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, representing the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches. This rules out secondary or tertiary amines/amides.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch in a **conjugated ester**.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The signals at **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)** and **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)** form a classic **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm is crucial, indicating the methylene (-CH₂) is attached to an ester oxygen **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)** signal is a broad singlet for two protons, confirming the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group.\n    *   The signals at **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** indicate a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The upfield doublet (7.0 ppm) is ortho to the electron-donating -NH₂ group, and the downfield doublet (8.0 ppm) is ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n4.  **Structure Assembly and Final Conclusion:**\n    *   Combining the evidence: a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group.\n    *   This uniquely identifies the compound as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    *   Matching this to the original options:\n        *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect isomer.\n        *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect functional groups and substitution.\n        *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect functional groups.\n        *   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.**\n\n```python\ndef solve_spectroscopy_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes spectroscopic data to identify a compound and determines the correct choice from a list.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Data from the Question ---\n    molecular_formula = \"C9H11NO2\"\n    ir_peaks = {\n        \"Primary Amine (N-H stretches)\": \"3420 cm-1, 3325 cm-1\",\n        \"Conjugated Ester (C=O stretch)\": \"1720 cm-1\"\n    }\n    nmr_signals = {\n        \"Ethyl group (-CH3)\": \"1.20 ppm (t, 3H)\",\n        \"Primary Amine (-NH2)\": \"4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)\",\n        \"Ethyl group (-O-CH2-)\": \"4.5 ppm (q, 2H)\",\n        \"Aromatic (ortho to -NH2)\": \"7.0 ppm (d, 2H)\",\n        \"Aromatic (ortho to -COOEt)\": \"8.0 ppm (d, 2H)\"\n    }\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"4-aminophenyl propionate\",\n        \"B\": \"3-ethoxybenzamide\",\n        \"C\": \"N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide\",\n        \"D\": \"ethyl 4-aminobenzoate\"\n    }\n\n    # --- Step-by-Step Analysis ---\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\")\n    # DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2\n    dou = 9 + 1 - (11 / 2) + (1 / 2)\n    print(f\"  - The formula is {molecular_formula}.

Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n*   **Careful Point:** The first step is to calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to get an initial idea of the structure's complexity (rings and pi bonds).\n*   **Step:** The formula for DoU is C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional pi bond (1 degree). Given the two oxygen atoms, this is very likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **Careful Point:** Look for characteristic peaks that identify key functional groups.\n*   **Step:**\n    *   The two bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are a classic signature for the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This rules out secondary amides/amines (one band) and tertiary amides/amines (no bands).\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester** (Ar-COOR). It is too high for a typical amide and too low for a phenyl ester (Ar-O-COR).\n*   **Interpretation:** The molecule contains a primary amine group and a conjugated ester group.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Careful Point:** Analyze each signal's chemical shift, integration (number of protons), and splitting pattern (multiplicity) to piece together the carbon-hydrogen framework.\n*   **Step:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pattern is the unmistakable signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The crucial detail is the high chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm), which indicates the -CH₂- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the IR data.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in chemical shifts indicates one substituent is electron-donating and the other is electron-withdrawing. The amine group (-NH₂) is donating, shifting its ortho protons upfield (to 7.0 ppm). The ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) is withdrawing, shifting its ortho protons downfield (to 8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\n*   **Careful Point:** Combine all the deduced fragments into a single, coherent structure and then compare it against the given choices.\n*   **Step:** The evidence from all spectra points to a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine group (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) attached at the 1 and 4 (para) positions. This structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n*   **Evaluation of Options:**\n    *   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine and an ester.\n    *   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an isomer, but the NMR signal for the methylene group next to the carbonyl (-CO-CH₂CH₃) would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, which contradicts the IR and NMR data.\n    *   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n*   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to determine the number of rings and pi bonds.\n*   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional pi bond (1 degree), which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the two oxygen atoms.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a definitive signature for a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. These correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This rules out secondary amides or amines.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester** (Ar-COOR). It is too high for a typical conjugated amide and too low for a phenyl ester.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The crucial piece of information is the chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm. This highly downfield shift indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached directly to an electronegative oxygen atom, confirming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, which corroborates the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in chemical shifts indicates one substituent is electron-donating and the other is electron-withdrawing. The electron-donating -NH₂ group shields its ortho protons (upfield shift to 7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group deshields its ortho protons (downfield shift to 8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating the Options**\nThe combined evidence from all spectra points to a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine group (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) attached at the 1 and 4 (para) positions. This structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, we match this deduced structure to the provided options:\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide.\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an isomer, but the NMR signal for the methylene group next to the carbonyl (-CO-CH₂-) would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the provided data and a review of the candidate answers, the correct compound can be unequivocally identified.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The formula is **C9H11NO2**.\n    *   The DoU is calculated as `C + 1 - H/2 + N/2`, which equals `9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (4 degrees) plus one additional unit of unsaturation, typically a pi bond like a carbonyl (C=O).\n\n2.  **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The two bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The two distinct peaks represent the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This rules out secondary amines/amides (one peak) and tertiary amines/amides (no peaks).\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The frequency of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an **ester** that is conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for a conjugated amide and too low for a phenyl ester (where the oxygen is directly attached to the ring).\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is a crucial piece of evidence. It indicates the methylene (-CH₂) group is directly attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**. If it were an ether, the shift would be slightly lower (~3.5-4.0 ppm). If it were adjacent to a carbonyl (like in a propionate), it would be much further upfield (~2.2-2.6 ppm).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corroborating the IR data.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in chemical shifts indicates one substituent is electron-donating (shifting its ortho protons upfield to 7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (shifting its ortho protons downfield to 8.0 ppm). This matches the known effects of an amine (-NH₂) and an ester (-COOR) group, respectively.\n\n### **Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\n\nThe combined evidence points to a single, unambiguous structure: an ethyl ester group and a primary amine group attached to a benzene ring in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, we match this correct structure to the options provided in the original question:\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. The NMR for the methylene group next to the carbonyl would be ~2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR and NMR data.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all spectral data.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, contradicting both IR and NMR.\n\n### **Conclusion on Candidate Answers**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly performed the chemical analysis and deduced the structure to be ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The variation in their final lettered answers (A, B, C, or D) stems from referencing different, likely randomized, option lists. The chemical reasoning itself is sound and unanimous. Based on the specific options provided in the problem description, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided candidate answers and the spectroscopic data, the correct compound can be unequivocally identified.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nAll candidate answers correctly interpret the spectroscopic data, and their chemical reasoning is sound and consistent. The discrepancy in their final lettered answers stems from inconsistent labeling of the options in their respective prompts, not from flawed analysis. The consensus analysis is as follows:\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The formula is **C9H11NO2**.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as: `DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5`.\n*   **Careful Point**: A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional pi bond (1 degree), which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   The two bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches.\n*   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch in a **conjugated ester**.\n*   **Careful Point**: The presence of two N-H bands rules out secondary amines/amides. The C=O frequency is too high for a typical amide and points specifically to a conjugated ester.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: This triplet-quartet pattern confirms an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most crucial piece of information here. It indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is directly attached to an ester oxygen (-O-CH₂CH₃). If it were an ether or attached to the carbonyl side of an ester, its shift would be different.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: This broad singlet for two protons confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group seen in the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The chemical shifts reveal the electronic nature of the substituents. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is ortho to the electron-donating amine group, while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAssembling all the structural fragments—a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring—leads to the unique structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this structure to the options provided in the question:\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. The NMR for the methylene group would be ~2.5 ppm.\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all spectral data.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide.\n\nThe evidence from all spectra unequivocally identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided spectroscopic data and a review of the candidate answers, the correct compound is identified as follows.\n\n### **Analysis of Spectroscopic Data**\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the evidence, highlighting the careful points needed for an accurate identification.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The degree of unsaturation is calculated using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n    *   `DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5`.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional pi bond (1 degree). The presence of two oxygen atoms suggests this pi bond is part of a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectrum**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. These correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This single piece of evidence rules out any secondary or tertiary amines or amides.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its specific frequency is typical for an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR).\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is crucial. This significant downfield shift indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**. If it were an ether (-O-CH₂CH₃), the shift would be closer to 4.0 ppm. If it were adjacent to a carbonyl (e.g., in a propionate group), it would be around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **Signal at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, which corroborates the IR data.\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The difference in chemical shifts reveals the electronic nature of the substituents. The upfield doublet (7.0 ppm) is adjacent (ortho) to an electron-donating group (the -NH₂). The downfield doublet (8.0 ppm) is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester, -COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n### **Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\n\nThe combined evidence from all spectra points to a single, unambiguous structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group attached in a para (1,4) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options against this conclusion:\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, which contradicts the IR (primary amine and ester, not amide) and NMR (para-substitution) data.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches every piece of spectral data: the molecular formula, the primary amine, the conjugated ethyl ester, and the 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring with the correct electronic environment.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is an isomer, but the NMR signal for the methylene group of the propionate chain (-COCH₂CH₃) would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR data showing a primary amine.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, considering the provided candidate answers and the spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Consensus Reasoning**\n\nAll 15 candidate answers, despite some concluding with different letters, follow an identical and correct line of chemical reasoning. The unanimous conclusion from their analysis is that the unknown compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The discrepancy in the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) is due to the agents being presented with differently ordered or labeled options, not a disagreement on the chemical structure.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Verification of the Chemical Analysis**\n\nTo confirm the consensus, we will analyze the data independently.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The formula is C9H11NO2.\n    *   The DoU is calculated as: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** A DoU of 5 strongly indicates a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional pi bond (1 degree), likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The two bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch in a **conjugated ester**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule contains a primary amine and a conjugated ester functional group.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This is a classic ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The crucial detail is the high chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm, which indicates the -CH₂- group is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom. This confirms an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet for two protons confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The upfield doublet (7.0 ppm) is adjacent to the electron-donating amine group, while the downfield doublet (8.0 ppm) is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The fragments are an ethyl ester, a primary amine, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n**3. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating the Options**\n\nCombining all the evidence leads to a single, unambiguous structure: **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, we must match this correct structure to the specific list of options provided in the question prompt:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This perfectly matches our deduced structure.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the NMR for the methylene group next to the carbonyl would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted amide, which is inconsistent with the IR (ester, not amide) and NMR (para-substitution) data.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nThe spectroscopic data unequivocally identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Based on the options provided in the question, this corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct compound.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nAll the provided answers follow a consistent and correct line of reasoning, which can be summarized in the following steps:\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula Analysis (C9H11NO2)**\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as: `DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 11/2 + 1/2 = 5`.\n    *   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional pi bond (1 degree), which is consistent with a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n2.  **IR Spectrum Analysis**\n    *   The two bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches. This rules out secondary or tertiary amines/amides.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbonyl group in a **conjugated ester**. The frequency is too high for a typical amide and too low for a phenyl ester.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n    *   The signals at **1.20 ppm (triplet, 3H)** and **4.5 ppm (quartet, 2H)** form the classic pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The key detail is the high chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm), which indicates the methylene group is attached directly to an oxygen atom, confirming an **ethyl ester (-O-CH₂CH₃)** fragment.\n    *   The signal at **4.0 ppm (broad singlet, 2H)** confirms the presence of the two protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corroborating the IR data.\n    *   The signals at **7.0 ppm (doublet, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H)** are a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The upfield doublet (7.0 ppm) is ortho to the electron-donating amine group, while the downfield doublet (8.0 ppm) is ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n4.  **Structure Assembly and Conclusion**\n    *   Combining all the fragments—a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine group, and an ethyl ester group—leads to the unique structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### Careful Points and Evaluation of Options\n\n*   **Distinguishing Isomers**: The chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm is crucial for distinguishing the correct structure from its isomer, 4-aminophenyl propionate (Option A). In the propionate, the methylene group would be adjacent to the carbonyl (`-CO-CH₂-`) and would appear around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **Identifying Functional Groups**: The IR data clearly indicates a primary amine and an ester, which rules out the amide structures in options B and D.\n*   **Determining Substitution Pattern**: The NMR aromatic region clearly shows a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern, ruling out the meta-substituted option B.\n*   **Mapping to the Correct Option**: The unanimous chemical conclusion from all analyses is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Matching this name to the provided list:\n    *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate\n    *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide\n    *   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**\n    *   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide\n\nThe correct choice is C. The discrepancies in the final letter answers from the agents are due to inconsistent labeling of the options in their individual prompts, but their chemical reasoning is sound and points to the same structure.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** First, we calculate the DoU to determine the number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`\n    *   Plugging in the values: `DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5`.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond (which accounts for the 5th degree). Given the two oxygen atoms, this extra double bond is likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is a classic signature for the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. This immediately rules out any structures with secondary or tertiary amines/amides.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. The frequency is typical for a conjugated **ester** (Ar-COOR). It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (which is usually below 1700 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (Ar-O-COR, which is usually above 1750 cm⁻¹).\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet and a quartet is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet (t) at 1.20 ppm is the methyl group (-CH₃) split by the adjacent two protons of the methylene group.\n    *   The quartet (q) at 4.5 ppm is the methylene group (-CH₂) split by the adjacent three protons of the methyl group.\n    *   The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) is a crucial clue. It indicates that the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester group **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) integrating to two protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This confirms the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents have different electronic effects.\n    *   The amine group (-NH₂) is electron-donating, which shields the adjacent (ortho) protons, shifting them upfield. This corresponds to the doublet at **7.0 ppm**.\n    *   The ester group (-COOEt) is electron-withdrawing, which deshields the adjacent (ortho) protons, shifting them downfield. This corresponds to the doublet at **8.0 ppm**.\n\n### **4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating the Options**\n\nBy combining all the pieces of evidence:\n*   We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   The other substituent is an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nThis assembly leads unequivocally to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, we compare this conclusion with the given options:\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is an amide (not an ester) and is meta-substituted (not para).\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all aspects of the provided spectral data.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR data for a primary amine.\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an isomer, but the NMR signal for the methylene group next to the carbonyl (-CO**CH₂**CH₃) would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses and a careful review of the chemical data.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe core task is to identify the structure of the compound C9H11NO2 using the given IR and 1H NMR spectra. All candidate answers correctly follow a logical process of interpreting this data. The consensus reasoning is sound and will be summarized here.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Data Interpretation (Careful Points)**\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n    *   **Formula**: C9H11NO2\n    *   **DoU Calculation**: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n    *   **Interpretation**: A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional pi bond (the 5th degree). Given the two oxygen atoms and the IR data, this is almost certainly a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **IR Spectrum Analysis**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This is a crucial point that rules out secondary amides/amines (which would have one band) and tertiary amides/amines (which would have no bands).\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹**: This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl (C=O) stretch**. The frequency is typical for an **ester that is conjugated** with a benzene ring (Ar-COOR).\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: This is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n        *   **Careful Point**: The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is very downfield. This indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is directly attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This confirms an **ethyl ester** fragment and rules out an isomer like 4-aminophenyl propionate, where the methylene group would be next to the carbonyl (~2.5 ppm).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating to two protons confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corroborating the IR data.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n        *   **Careful Point**: The difference in chemical shifts confirms the electronic nature of the substituents. The electron-donating -NH₂ group shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield (the doublet at 7.0 ppm). The electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield (the doublet at 8.0 ppm).\n\n### **Conclusion and Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **Assembled Structure**: The combined data from all spectra unequivocally points to a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group attached in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers**: All 15 candidate answers correctly perform the chemical analysis and arrive at the same structural conclusion: **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The discrepancy in their final lettered answers (A, B, C, or D) is due to the fact that the options were presented to them in a different, randomized order.\n\n*   **Final Decision**: We must ignore the lettered choices of the candidates and rely on their unanimous chemical reasoning. We then match the correct structure, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, to the original list of options provided in the question.\n\n    *   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide\n    *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide\n    *   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate\n    *   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**\n\nThe correct structure matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided spectroscopic data and a review of the candidate answers, the correct compound can be unequivocally identified. All candidate answers correctly deduce the chemical structure through their analysis, even though their final letter choices vary due to inconsistent option labeling.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis highlighting the critical points:\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The molecular formula is **C9H11NO2**.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional pi bond (the 5th degree), most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   The two bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The two distinct peaks arise from the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This immediately rules out options with secondary amides (like B) or primary amides (like D).\n*   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch.\n*   **Careful Point:** This specific frequency is typical for an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring. It is too high for a typical amide and too low for a phenyl ester (like option C, which would be closer to 1760 cm⁻¹). This strongly suggests an Ar-COOR structure.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   The signals at **1.20 ppm (triplet, 3H)** and **4.5 ppm (quartet, 2H)** represent a classic **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is a crucial piece of evidence. This significant downfield shift indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is directly attached to a highly electronegative oxygen atom, confirming the presence of an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This rules out isomer C (4-aminophenyl propionate), where the methylene group would be adjacent to a carbonyl (-CO-CH₂-) and appear around 2.5-3.0 ppm.\n*   The signal at **4.0 ppm (broad singlet, 2H)** confirms the two exchangeable protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corroborating the IR data.\n*   The two doublets at **7.0 ppm (2H)** and **8.0 ppm (2H)** are a hallmark pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The upfield doublet (7.0 ppm) corresponds to the protons shielded by the electron-donating amine group, while the downfield doublet (8.0 ppm) corresponds to the protons deshielded by the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nAssembling all the pieces of evidence leads to a single, unambiguous structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group attached at the 1 and 4 (para) positions. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this structure to the provided options:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This perfectly matches all spectral data.\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. The NMR for the ethyl group would be different.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound based on the provided data.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The first step is to calculate the DoU to determine the number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) plus one additional degree of unsaturation, which is most likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the two oxygen atoms in the formula.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct, medium-to-strong intensity bands are a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The two bands arise from the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This immediately rules out any structures with secondary or tertiary amines/amides.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong band is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency is crucial. A value of ~1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a conjugated **ester** (Ar-COOR). It is too high for a typical conjugated amide (~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (Ar-O-CO-R, ~1760 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the classic pattern for an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is a key piece of evidence. This significant downfield shift indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester. This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, which corroborates the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The relative chemical shifts confirm the substituent identities. The electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its ortho protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm. The electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its ortho protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating the Options**\n\nThe combined evidence from all analyses points to a single, unambiguous structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options against this conclusion:\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, which contradicts the IR and NMR data.\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect.

This is an isomer, but the NMR signal for the methylene group of the propionate chain (-CO-CH₂CH₃) would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers and the provided spectroscopic data, the following step-by-step process determines the correct compound.\n\nAll candidate answers correctly deduce the chemical structure through sound analysis, even though their final letter choices differ due to variations in the option lists they were given. The consensus on the chemical identity is unanimous.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis and Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n    *   **Formula**: C9H11NO2\n    *   **Calculation**: The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`, which gives `9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5`.\n    *   **Careful Point**: A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional pi bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O), given the presence of two oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis**\n    *   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: These two distinct bands are a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The presence of *two* bands in this region is crucial for identifying the amine as primary, ruling out secondary amines or amides which would only show one band.\n    *   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹**: This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The frequency of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an **ester conjugated with an aromatic ring**. This specific frequency helps differentiate it from a conjugated amide (which would be at a lower frequency, <1700 cm⁻¹) or a phenyl ester (Ar-O-C=O, which would be at a higher frequency, >1750 cm⁻¹).\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n    *   **Signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: This triplet-quartet pattern is the classic signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is a critical piece of evidence. This significant downfield shift indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is directly attached to the highly electronegative oxygen of an ester **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This rules out an isomer like 4-aminophenyl propionate, where the methylene group would be next to a carbonyl and appear around 2.5 ppm.\n    *   **Signal at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group identified in the IR spectrum.\n    *   **Signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The difference in chemical shifts confirms the electronic nature of the substituents. The electron-donating amine group shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm. The electron-withdrawing ester group deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm.\n\n### **Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\n\nCombining all the evidence leads to a single, unambiguous structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, we evaluate the options provided in the question:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate**: This is incorrect. It is a phenyl ester, and the NMR signals for the propionate group would be different.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**: This is incorrect. It is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide**: This is incorrect. It is a meta-substituted amide, which contradicts the IR data (ester, not amide) and the NMR aromatic pattern (para, not meta).\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe spectroscopic data unequivocally identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Based on the provided candidate answers and a systematic analysis of the spectroscopic data, the correct compound can be unequivocally identified. The reasoning across all candidate answers is sound and leads to the same chemical structure; the variation in the final letter choice is due to differing option lists.\n\nHere is a definitive step-by-step analysis:\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The first step is to calculate the DoU to understand the number of rings and/or pi bonds in the molecule.\n    *   The formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   Calculation: DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional pi bond (accounting for the 5th degree). Given the two oxygen atoms in the formula, this pi bond is very likely part of a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct, medium-to-strong intensity bands are a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The presence of *two* separate bands in this region is crucial. It corresponds to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations, which uniquely identifies the amine as primary. A secondary amine (-NHR) would show only one band, and a tertiary amine (-NR₂) would show none. This rules out options with secondary amides like C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch.\n*   **Careful Point:** The specific frequency of the carbonyl absorption is key. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR). This frequency is generally too high for a conjugated amide (like option A) and too low for a phenyl ester (Ar-O-CO-R), which would be expected closer to 1760 cm⁻¹.\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is a critical piece of evidence. This significant downfield shift indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached directly to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment and decisively rules out the isomer B) 4-aminophenyl propionate, where the methylene group would be adjacent to the carbonyl (-CO-**CH₂**CH₃) and would appear much further upfield, around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) that integrates to two protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corroborating the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The relative chemical shifts of these doublets confirm the electronic nature of the substituents. The electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its adjacent (ortho) protons, shifting them upfield to the 7.0 ppm signal. The electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOR) deshields its adjacent (ortho) protons, shifting them downfield to the 8.0 ppm signal. This confirms the para arrangement of these specific groups.\n\n### **Step 4: Assembling the Structure and Final Conclusion**\n\nCombining all the evidence leads to a single, unambiguous structure:\n1.  A 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring.\n2.  One substituent is a primary amine (-NH₂).\n3.  The other substituent is an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nThis structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this confirmed structure to the original list of options:\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide.\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an isomer with a different NMR spectrum.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide.\n*   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches every piece of spectral data.\n\n<<<D>>>"

The consensus on the chemical structure is unanimous and correct.\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The formula is **C9H11NO2**.\n    *   The DoU is calculated as: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5`.\n    *   This value strongly indicates the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional pi bond, which corresponds to the carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The two bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch in a **conjugated ester**.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The signals at **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)** and **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)** represent an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The crucial detail is the high chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm), which indicates the methylene group is attached to an oxygen atom, confirming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The **broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H)** confirms the two exchangeable protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corroborating the IR data.\n    *   The two doublets at **7.0 ppm (2H)** and **8.0 ppm (2H)** are a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The upfield doublet (7.0 ppm) is adjacent to the electron-donating amine group, while the downfield doublet (8.0 ppm) is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n### Assembling the Structure\n\nCombining all the evidence leads to a single, unambiguous structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group attached at the 1 and 4 (para) positions. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### Careful Points and Evaluation of Options\n\n*   **Functional Group Identification:** The IR data clearly shows a primary amine and a conjugated ester, ruling out amides (Options A, B) and phenyl esters (Option D).\n*   **Isomer Distinction:** The key to distinguishing between ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (C) and its isomer 4-aminophenyl propionate (D) is the NMR chemical shift of the methylene quartet. In our compound, it's at 4.5 ppm, indicating it's attached to an ester oxygen (-O-CH₂-). In 4-aminophenyl propionate, the methylene group would be next to the carbonyl (-CO-CH₂-), and its signal would appear around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The NMR aromatic region clearly indicates a 1,4-(para) substitution pattern, ruling out any ortho or meta isomers like 3-ethoxybenzamide (B).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe spectral data unequivocally identifies the compound as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Matching this name to the options provided in the question:\n\nA) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide\nB) 3-ethoxybenzamide\n**C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**\nD) 4-aminophenyl propionate\n\nThe correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on the provided candidate answers and a thorough analysis of the spectroscopic data, here is a step-by-step determination of the correct compound.\n\n### **Analysis of Candidate Responses**\n\nAll 15 candidate answers, despite variations in their final letter choice, demonstrate a unanimous and correct interpretation of the chemical data. The discrepancy in the final letter (A, B, C, or D) is due to the options being presented in a different order for each candidate. However, the core chemical conclusion reached by every single one is the same: the compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Spectroscopic Analysis**\n\nHere is a consolidated breakdown of the evidence that all candidates correctly identified:\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n    *   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n    *   **DoU Calculation:** The degree of unsaturation is calculated as `C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`, which for this formula is `9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional pi bond (the 5th degree), which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct bands are a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The two absorptions correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This single piece of data rules out any secondary or tertiary amines/amides.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The frequency of 1720 cm⁻¹ is crucial. It is typical for an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (usually <1700 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (Ar-O-COR, usually >1750 cm⁻¹).\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is a key piece of evidence. This significant downfield shift indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached directly to an electronegative oxygen atom within an **ester group (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. If it were an ether, the shift would be closer to 4.0 ppm. If it were adjacent to a carbonyl (like in 4-aminophenyl propionate), it would be around 2.5 ppm.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group identified in the IR spectrum.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in chemical shifts indicates one substituent is electron-donating (the amine), which shields its ortho protons (shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm), and the other is electron-withdrawing (the ester), which deshields its ortho protons (shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm).\n\n### **Conclusion and Evaluation of Options**\n\nAssembling all the fragments deduced from the data—a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring—leads to the unique and unambiguous structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, we evaluate the options provided in the original question:\n\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide.\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all spectral data.\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an isomer, but as noted, its NMR spectrum would be different.\n\nThe comprehensive and consistent analysis across all data points confirms that the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to first analyze the reasoning of the provided candidate answers to find a consensus. Then, I will perform my own independent, step-by-step analysis of the spectroscopic data to verify the consensus structure. Finally, I will match this confirmed structure to the specific list of options provided in the original question to determine the correct letter choice.\n\n**Analysis of Candidate Answers**\nA careful review of all 15 candidate answers reveals a critical point: while their final letter choices (`<<<A>>>`, `<<<B>>>`, `<<<C>>>`, or `<<<D>>>`) are inconsistent, their chemical reasoning is unanimous. Every single agent correctly interprets the spectral data and concludes that the unknown compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The discrepancy in the final letter is due to the agents referencing different or randomized option lists. Therefore, the core task is to confirm this chemical conclusion and then map it to the correct letter from the original question's list.\n\n**Step-by-Step Spectroscopic Analysis**\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2) and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The DoU is calculated as: `DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5`.\n    *   A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (4 degrees) plus one additional pi bond (1 degree), which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The two bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, representing the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches.

The significant downfield shift of the quartet to 4.5 ppm is crucial, indicating the methylene (-CH₂) is attached to an ester oxygen **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)** signal is a broad singlet for two protons, confirming the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group.\n    *   The signals at **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** indicate a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The upfield doublet (7.0 ppm) is ortho to the electron-donating -NH₂ group, and the downfield doublet (8.0 ppm) is ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n4.  **Structure Assembly and Final Conclusion:**\n    *   Combining the evidence: a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group.\n    *   This uniquely identifies the compound as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n    *   Matching this to the original options:\n        *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect isomer.\n        *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect functional groups and substitution.\n        *   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect functional groups.\n        *   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.**\n\n```python\ndef solve_spectroscopy_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes spectroscopic data to identify a compound and determines the correct choice from a list.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Data from the Question ---\n    molecular_formula = \"C9H11NO2\"\n    ir_peaks = {\n        \"Primary Amine (N-H stretches)\": \"3420 cm-1, 3325 cm-1\",\n        \"Conjugated Ester (C=O stretch)\": \"1720 cm-1\"\n    }\n    nmr_signals = {\n        \"Ethyl group (-CH3)\": \"1.20 ppm (t, 3H)\",\n        \"Primary Amine (-NH2)\": \"4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)\",\n        \"Ethyl group (-O-CH2-)\": \"4.5 ppm (q, 2H)\",\n        \"Aromatic (ortho to -NH2)\": \"7.0 ppm (d, 2H)\",\n        \"Aromatic (ortho to -COOEt)\": \"8.0 ppm (d, 2H)\"\n    }\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"4-aminophenyl propionate\",\n        \"B\": \"3-ethoxybenzamide\",\n        \"C\": \"N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide\",\n        \"D\": \"ethyl 4-aminobenzoate\"\n    }\n\n    # --- Step-by-Step Analysis ---\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\")\n    # DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2\n    dou = 9 + 1 - (11 / 2) + (1 / 2)\n    print(f\"  - The formula is {molecular_formula}.

Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n*   **Careful Point:** The first step is to calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to get an initial idea of the structure's complexity (rings and pi bonds).\n*   **Step:** The formula for DoU is C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional pi bond (1 degree). Given the two oxygen atoms, this is very likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **Careful Point:** Look for characteristic peaks that identify key functional groups.\n*   **Step:**\n    *   The two bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are a classic signature for the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This rules out secondary amides/amines (one band) and tertiary amides/amines (no bands).\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester** (Ar-COOR). It is too high for a typical amide and too low for a phenyl ester (Ar-O-COR).\n*   **Interpretation:** The molecule contains a primary amine group and a conjugated ester group.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Careful Point:** Analyze each signal's chemical shift, integration (number of protons), and splitting pattern (multiplicity) to piece together the carbon-hydrogen framework.\n*   **Step:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pattern is the unmistakable signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The crucial detail is the high chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm), which indicates the -CH₂- group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, confirming the IR data.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, are a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in chemical shifts indicates one substituent is electron-donating and the other is electron-withdrawing. The amine group (-NH₂) is donating, shifting its ortho protons upfield (to 7.0 ppm). The ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) is withdrawing, shifting its ortho protons downfield (to 8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\n*   **Careful Point:** Combine all the deduced fragments into a single, coherent structure and then compare it against the given choices.\n*   **Step:** The evidence from all spectra points to a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine group (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) attached at the 1 and 4 (para) positions. This structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n*   **Evaluation of Options:**\n    *   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, not a primary amine and an ester.\n    *   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an isomer, but the NMR signal for the methylene group next to the carbonyl (-CO-CH₂CH₃) would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   C) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, which contradicts the IR and NMR data.\n    *   D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n*   First, we calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to determine the number of rings and pi bonds.\n*   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional pi bond (1 degree), which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the two oxygen atoms.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a definitive signature for a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. These correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This rules out secondary amides or amines.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. The frequency is characteristic of a conjugated **ester** (Ar-COOR). It is too high for a typical conjugated amide and too low for a phenyl ester.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The crucial piece of information is the chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm. This highly downfield shift indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached directly to an electronegative oxygen atom, confirming an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, which corroborates the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in chemical shifts indicates one substituent is electron-donating and the other is electron-withdrawing. The electron-donating -NH₂ group shields its ortho protons (upfield shift to 7.0 ppm), while the electron-withdrawing ester group deshields its ortho protons (downfield shift to 8.0 ppm).\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating the Options**\nThe combined evidence from all spectra points to a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine group (-NH₂) and an ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) attached at the 1 and 4 (para) positions. This structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, we match this deduced structure to the provided options:\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide.\n*   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an isomer, but the NMR signal for the methylene group next to the carbonyl (-CO-CH₂-) would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the provided data and a review of the candidate answers, the correct compound can be unequivocally identified.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The formula is **C9H11NO2**.\n    *   The DoU is calculated as `C + 1 - H/2 + N/2`, which equals `9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (4 degrees) plus one additional unit of unsaturation, typically a pi bond like a carbonyl (C=O).\n\n2.  **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The two bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The two distinct peaks represent the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This rules out secondary amines/amides (one peak) and tertiary amines/amides (no peaks).\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The frequency of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an **ester** that is conjugated with an aromatic ring. It is generally too high for a conjugated amide and too low for a phenyl ester (where the oxygen is directly attached to the ring).\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is a crucial piece of evidence. It indicates the methylene (-CH₂) group is directly attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**. If it were an ether, the shift would be slightly lower (~3.5-4.0 ppm). If it were adjacent to a carbonyl (like in a propionate), it would be much further upfield (~2.2-2.6 ppm).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group, corroborating the IR data.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The difference in chemical shifts indicates one substituent is electron-donating (shifting its ortho protons upfield to 7.0 ppm) and the other is electron-withdrawing (shifting its ortho protons downfield to 8.0 ppm). This matches the known effects of an amine (-NH₂) and an ester (-COOR) group, respectively.\n\n### **Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\n\nThe combined evidence points to a single, unambiguous structure: an ethyl ester group and a primary amine group attached to a benzene ring in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, we match this correct structure to the options provided in the original question:\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. The NMR for the methylene group next to the carbonyl would be ~2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR and NMR data.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all spectral data.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, contradicting both IR and NMR.\n\n### **Conclusion on Candidate Answers**\n\nAll candidate answers correctly performed the chemical analysis and deduced the structure to be ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The variation in their final lettered answers (A, B, C, or D) stems from referencing different, likely randomized, option lists. The chemical reasoning itself is sound and unanimous. Based on the specific options provided in the problem description, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided candidate answers and the spectroscopic data, the correct compound can be unequivocally identified.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nAll candidate answers correctly interpret the spectroscopic data, and their chemical reasoning is sound and consistent. The discrepancy in their final lettered answers stems from inconsistent labeling of the options in their respective prompts, not from flawed analysis. The consensus analysis is as follows:\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The formula is **C9H11NO2**.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as: `DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5`.\n*   **Careful Point**: A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional pi bond (1 degree), which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   The two bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches.\n*   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch in a **conjugated ester**.\n*   **Careful Point**: The presence of two N-H bands rules out secondary amines/amides. The C=O frequency is too high for a typical amide and points specifically to a conjugated ester.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: This triplet-quartet pattern confirms an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is the most crucial piece of information here. It indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is directly attached to an ester oxygen (-O-CH₂CH₃). If it were an ether or attached to the carbonyl side of an ester, its shift would be different.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: This broad singlet for two protons confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group seen in the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The chemical shifts reveal the electronic nature of the substituents. The upfield doublet at 7.0 ppm is ortho to the electron-donating amine group, while the downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm is ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAssembling all the structural fragments—a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring—leads to the unique structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this structure to the options provided in the question:\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. The NMR for the methylene group would be ~2.5 ppm.\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all spectral data.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide.\n\nThe evidence from all spectra unequivocally identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided spectroscopic data and a review of the candidate answers, the correct compound is identified as follows.\n\n### **Analysis of Spectroscopic Data**\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the evidence, highlighting the careful points needed for an accurate identification.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2\n*   **DoU Calculation:** The degree of unsaturation is calculated using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`.\n    *   `DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5`.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional pi bond (1 degree). The presence of two oxygen atoms suggests this pi bond is part of a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectrum**\n*   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. These correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This single piece of evidence rules out any secondary or tertiary amines or amides.\n*   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Its specific frequency is typical for an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring (Ar-COOR).\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is crucial. This significant downfield shift indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**. If it were an ether (-O-CH₂CH₃), the shift would be closer to 4.0 ppm. If it were adjacent to a carbonyl (e.g., in a propionate group), it would be around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **Signal at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, which corroborates the IR data.\n*   **Signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The difference in chemical shifts reveals the electronic nature of the substituents. The upfield doublet (7.0 ppm) is adjacent (ortho) to an electron-donating group (the -NH₂). The downfield doublet (8.0 ppm) is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester, -COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n### **Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\n\nThe combined evidence from all spectra points to a single, unambiguous structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group attached in a para (1,4) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options against this conclusion:\n\n*   **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, which contradicts the IR (primary amine and ester, not amide) and NMR (para-substitution) data.\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches every piece of spectral data: the molecular formula, the primary amine, the conjugated ethyl ester, and the 1,4-disubstituted aromatic ring with the correct electronic environment.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Incorrect. This is an isomer, but the NMR signal for the methylene group of the propionate chain (-COCH₂CH₃) would appear around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR data showing a primary amine.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, considering the provided candidate answers and the spectroscopic data.\n\n**1.

The unanimous conclusion from their analysis is that the unknown compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The discrepancy in the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) is due to the agents being presented with differently ordered or labeled options, not a disagreement on the chemical structure.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Verification of the Chemical Analysis**\n\nTo confirm the consensus, we will analyze the data independently.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The formula is C9H11NO2.\n    *   The DoU is calculated as: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** A DoU of 5 strongly indicates a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional pi bond (1 degree), likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The two bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch in a **conjugated ester**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule contains a primary amine and a conjugated ester functional group.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This is a classic ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The crucial detail is the high chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm, which indicates the -CH₂- group is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom. This confirms an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This broad singlet for two protons confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The upfield doublet (7.0 ppm) is adjacent to the electron-donating amine group, while the downfield doublet (8.0 ppm) is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The fragments are an ethyl ester, a primary amine, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n**3. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating the Options**\n\nCombining all the evidence leads to a single, unambiguous structure: **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, we must match this correct structure to the specific list of options provided in the question prompt:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This perfectly matches our deduced structure.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but the NMR for the methylene group next to the carbonyl would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which is inconsistent with the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted amide, which is inconsistent with the IR (ester, not amide) and NMR (para-substitution) data.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nThe spectroscopic data unequivocally identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Based on the options provided in the question, this corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct compound.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nAll the provided answers follow a consistent and correct line of reasoning, which can be summarized in the following steps:\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula Analysis (C9H11NO2)**\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as: `DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 11/2 + 1/2 = 5`.\n    *   A DoU of 5 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional pi bond (1 degree), which is consistent with a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n2.  **IR Spectrum Analysis**\n    *   The two bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches. This rules out secondary or tertiary amines/amides.\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbonyl group in a **conjugated ester**. The frequency is too high for a typical amide and too low for a phenyl ester.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n    *   The signals at **1.20 ppm (triplet, 3H)** and **4.5 ppm (quartet, 2H)** form the classic pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**. The key detail is the high chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm), which indicates the methylene group is attached directly to an oxygen atom, confirming an **ethyl ester (-O-CH₂CH₃)** fragment.\n    *   The signal at **4.0 ppm (broad singlet, 2H)** confirms the presence of the two protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corroborating the IR data.\n    *   The signals at **7.0 ppm (doublet, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H)** are a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The upfield doublet (7.0 ppm) is ortho to the electron-donating amine group, while the downfield doublet (8.0 ppm) is ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n4.  **Structure Assembly and Conclusion**\n    *   Combining all the fragments—a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, a primary amine group, and an ethyl ester group—leads to the unique structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n### Careful Points and Evaluation of Options\n\n*   **Distinguishing Isomers**: The chemical shift of the quartet at 4.5 ppm is crucial for distinguishing the correct structure from its isomer, 4-aminophenyl propionate (Option A). In the propionate, the methylene group would be adjacent to the carbonyl (`-CO-CH₂-`) and would appear around 2.5 ppm.\n*   **Identifying Functional Groups**: The IR data clearly indicates a primary amine and an ester, which rules out the amide structures in options B and D.\n*   **Determining Substitution Pattern**: The NMR aromatic region clearly shows a 1,4- (para) substitution pattern, ruling out the meta-substituted option B.\n*   **Mapping to the Correct Option**: The unanimous chemical conclusion from all analyses is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Matching this name to the provided list:\n    *   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate\n    *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide\n    *   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**\n    *   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide\n\nThe correct choice is C. The discrepancies in the final letter answers from the agents are due to inconsistent labeling of the options in their individual prompts, but their chemical reasoning is sound and points to the same structure.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** First, we calculate the DoU to determine the number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`\n    *   Plugging in the values: `DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5`.\n*   **Interpretation:** A DoU of 5 is a very strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond (which accounts for the 5th degree). Given the two oxygen atoms, this extra double bond is likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### **2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct, medium-to-strong bands in this region is a classic signature for the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**. This immediately rules out any structures with secondary or tertiary amines/amides.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) region. The frequency is typical for a conjugated **ester** (Ar-COOR). It is generally too high for a conjugated amide (which is usually below 1700 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (Ar-O-COR, which is usually above 1750 cm⁻¹).\n\n### **3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This combination of a triplet and a quartet is the unmistakable pattern of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The triplet (t) at 1.20 ppm is the methyl group (-CH₃) split by the adjacent two protons of the methylene group.\n    *   The quartet (q) at 4.5 ppm is the methylene group (-CH₂) split by the adjacent three protons of the methyl group.\n    *   The significant downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) is a crucial clue. It indicates that the methylene group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester group **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) integrating to two protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This confirms the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two substituents have different electronic effects.\n    *   The amine group (-NH₂) is electron-donating, which shields the adjacent (ortho) protons, shifting them upfield. This corresponds to the doublet at **7.0 ppm**.\n    *   The ester group (-COOEt) is electron-withdrawing, which deshields the adjacent (ortho) protons, shifting them downfield. This corresponds to the doublet at **8.0 ppm**.\n\n### **4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating the Options**\n\nBy combining all the pieces of evidence:\n*   We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   One substituent is a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   The other substituent is an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nThis assembly leads unequivocally to the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, we compare this conclusion with the given options:\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is an amide (not an ester) and is meta-substituted (not para).\n*   **B) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches all aspects of the provided spectral data.\n*   C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR data for a primary amine.\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an isomer, but the NMR signal for the methylene group next to the carbonyl (-CO**CH₂**CH₃) would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses and a careful review of the chemical data.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe core task is to identify the structure of the compound C9H11NO2 using the given IR and 1H NMR spectra. All candidate answers correctly follow a logical process of interpreting this data. The consensus reasoning is sound and will be summarized here.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Data Interpretation (Careful Points)**\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n    *   **Formula**: C9H11NO2\n    *   **DoU Calculation**: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n    *   **Interpretation**: A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional pi bond (the 5th degree). Given the two oxygen atoms and the IR data, this is almost certainly a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n2.  **IR Spectrum Analysis**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. This is a crucial point that rules out secondary amides/amines (which would have one band) and tertiary amides/amines (which would have no bands).\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹**: This strong absorption is characteristic of a **carbonyl (C=O) stretch**. The frequency is typical for an **ester that is conjugated** with a benzene ring (Ar-COOR).\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: This is the classic pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n        *   **Careful Point**: The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is very downfield. This indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is directly attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This confirms an **ethyl ester** fragment and rules out an isomer like 4-aminophenyl propionate, where the methylene group would be next to the carbonyl (~2.5 ppm).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating to two protons confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corroborating the IR data.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n        *   **Careful Point**: The difference in chemical shifts confirms the electronic nature of the substituents. The electron-donating -NH₂ group shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield (the doublet at 7.0 ppm). The electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield (the doublet at 8.0 ppm).\n\n### **Conclusion and Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **Assembled Structure**: The combined data from all spectra unequivocally points to a single structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group attached in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers**: All 15 candidate answers correctly perform the chemical analysis and arrive at the same structural conclusion: **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. The discrepancy in their final lettered answers (A, B, C, or D) is due to the fact that the options were presented to them in a different, randomized order.\n\n*   **Final Decision**: We must ignore the lettered choices of the candidates and rely on their unanimous chemical reasoning. We then match the correct structure, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, to the original list of options provided in the question.\n\n    *   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide\n    *   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide\n    *   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate\n    *   **D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**\n\nThe correct structure matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided spectroscopic data and a review of the candidate answers, the correct compound can be unequivocally identified. All candidate answers correctly deduce the chemical structure through their analysis, even though their final letter choices vary due to inconsistent option labeling.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis highlighting the critical points:\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The molecular formula is **C9H11NO2**.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5.\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional pi bond (the 5th degree), most likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n**2. IR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   The two bands at **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹** are a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The two distinct peaks arise from the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This immediately rules out options with secondary amides (like B) or primary amides (like D).\n*   The strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch.\n*   **Careful Point:** This specific frequency is typical for an **ester that is conjugated** with an aromatic ring. It is too high for a typical amide and too low for a phenyl ester (like option C, which would be closer to 1760 cm⁻¹). This strongly suggests an Ar-COOR structure.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n*   The signals at **1.20 ppm (triplet, 3H)** and **4.5 ppm (quartet, 2H)** represent a classic **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is a crucial piece of evidence. This significant downfield shift indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is directly attached to a highly electronegative oxygen atom, confirming the presence of an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This rules out isomer C (4-aminophenyl propionate), where the methylene group would be adjacent to a carbonyl (-CO-CH₂-) and appear around 2.5-3.0 ppm.\n*   The signal at **4.0 ppm (broad singlet, 2H)** confirms the two exchangeable protons of the **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corroborating the IR data.\n*   The two doublets at **7.0 ppm (2H)** and **8.0 ppm (2H)** are a hallmark pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The upfield doublet (7.0 ppm) corresponds to the protons shielded by the electron-donating amine group, while the downfield doublet (8.0 ppm) corresponds to the protons deshielded by the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nAssembling all the pieces of evidence leads to a single, unambiguous structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group attached at the 1 and 4 (para) positions. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nMatching this structure to the provided options:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This perfectly matches all spectral data.\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide.\n*   C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. The NMR for the ethyl group would be different.\n*   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound based on the provided data.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Formula (C9H11NO2)**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The first step is to calculate the DoU to determine the number of rings and pi bonds.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   **Careful Point:** A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) plus one additional degree of unsaturation, which is most likely a carbonyl group (C=O) given the two oxygen atoms in the formula.\n\n**2. Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** These two distinct, medium-to-strong intensity bands are a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**. The two bands arise from the asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretching vibrations. This immediately rules out any structures with secondary or tertiary amines/amides.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong band is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region.\n*   **Careful Point:** The frequency is crucial. A value of ~1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a conjugated **ester** (Ar-COOR). It is too high for a typical conjugated amide (~1680 cm⁻¹) and too low for a phenyl ester (Ar-O-CO-R, ~1760 cm⁻¹).\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet pair is the classic pattern for an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **Careful Point:** The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is a key piece of evidence. This significant downfield shift indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester. This confirms the presence of an **ethyl ester fragment (-O-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the exchangeable protons of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, which corroborates the IR data.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The relative chemical shifts confirm the substituent identities. The electron-donating amine group (-NH₂) shields its ortho protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm. The electron-withdrawing ester group (-COOEt) deshields its ortho protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure and Evaluating the Options**\n\nThe combined evidence from all analyses points to a single, unambiguous structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options against this conclusion:\n*   A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect. This is a meta-substituted amide, which contradicts the IR and NMR data.\n*   B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect. This is a secondary amide, which contradicts the primary amine evidence from both IR and NMR.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** **Correct.** This structure perfectly matches every piece of spectral data.\n*   D) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect. This is an isomer, but the NMR signal for the methylene group of the propionate chain (-CO-CH₂CH₃) would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers and the provided spectroscopic data, the following step-by-step process determines the correct compound.\n\nAll candidate answers correctly deduce the chemical structure through sound analysis, even though their final letter choices differ due to variations in the option lists they were given. The consensus on the chemical identity is unanimous.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis and Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n    *   **Formula**: C9H11NO2\n    *   **Calculation**: The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)`, which gives `9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 5`.\n    *   **Careful Point**: A DoU of 5 is a strong indicator of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and one additional pi bond, most likely a carbonyl group (C=O), given the presence of two oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis**\n    *   **Bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: These two distinct bands are a definitive signature of a **primary amine (-NH₂)**, corresponding to its asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The presence of *two* bands in this region is crucial for identifying the amine as primary, ruling out secondary amines or amides which would only show one band.\n    *   **Band at 1720 cm⁻¹**: This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The frequency of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an **ester conjugated with an aromatic ring**. This specific frequency helps differentiate it from a conjugated amide (which would be at a lower frequency, <1700 cm⁻¹) or a phenyl ester (Ar-O-C=O, which would be at a higher frequency, >1750 cm⁻¹).\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis**\n    *   **Signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: This triplet-quartet pattern is the classic signature of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is a critical piece of evidence. This significant downfield shift indicates the methylene (-CH₂-) group is directly attached to the highly electronegative oxygen of an ester **(-O-CH₂CH₃)**. This rules out an isomer like 4-aminophenyl propionate, where the methylene group would be next to a carbonyl and appear around 2.5 ppm.\n    *   **Signal at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: This broad singlet, integrating to two protons, confirms the presence of the **primary amine (-NH₂)** group identified in the IR spectrum.\n    *   **Signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The difference in chemical shifts confirms the electronic nature of the substituents. The electron-donating amine group shields its adjacent protons, shifting them upfield to 7.0 ppm. The electron-withdrawing ester group deshields its adjacent protons, shifting them downfield to 8.0 ppm.\n\n### **Assembling the Structure and Evaluating Options**\n\nCombining all the evidence leads to a single, unambiguous structure: a benzene ring with a primary amine group and an ethyl ester group in a 1,4 (para) arrangement. This compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nNow, we evaluate the options provided in the question:\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate**: This is incorrect. It is a phenyl ester, and the NMR signals for the propionate group would be different.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**: This is incorrect. It is a secondary amide, which contradicts the IR and NMR data for a primary amine.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide**: This is incorrect. It is a meta-substituted amide, which contradicts the IR data (ester, not amide) and the NMR aromatic pattern (para, not meta).\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe spectroscopic data unequivocally identifies the compound as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
