Understanding the Transition Process**\n\nThe problem describes a cascade decay from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ (the 3s state) to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (the 1s state) through an intermediate state via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n**2. Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules**\n\nFor an E1 transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following selection rules:\n*   The change in the principal quantum number, $\\Delta n$, can be any integer.\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l$, must be $\\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m$, must be $0, \\pm 1$.\n\n**3. First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n\nLet's apply the selection rules to the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$:\n*   **Initial state:** $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** Since $l=0$, the only possibility is $l' = l+1 = 1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** Since $m=0$, the possible values for $m'$ are $m' = m + \\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta n$:** For a decay process (emission of a photon), the energy of the atom must decrease, so the principal quantum number must decrease, i.e., $n' < 3$. The possible values are $n'=2$ or $n'=1$. However, for $n'=1$, the only possible value for $l'$ is $l'=0$. This contradicts the requirement that $l'=1$. Therefore, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n\nCombining these results, the possible intermediate states are:\n$|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$. These correspond to the three degenerate $2p$ orbitals.\n\n**4. Second Transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\nNow, let's check if a transition from these intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n*   **Intermediate state:** $n'=2, l'=1, m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$.\n*   **Final state:** $n_{f}=1, l_{f}=0, m_{f}=0$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed transition.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$.\n    *   If $m'=0$, $\\Delta m = 0$ (allowed).\n    *   If $m'=1$, $\\Delta m = -1$ (allowed).\n    *   If $m'=-1$, $\\Delta m = 1$ (allowed).\n\nSo, all three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The possible transition routes are:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nAll routes listed in the options are physically possible. We now need to determine the probability.\n\n**5. Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n\n*   **Step 1: Branching Ratio for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$**\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (an s-orbital). In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the probability of decaying into any of the three degenerate $2p$ states ($|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$) must be equal. Since these are the only allowed E1 decay channels (we assume decay to higher $p$ states is negligible, which is standard), the total probability of decaying to the $2p$ level is 1. The probability is distributed equally among the three possible final states.\n    \n    Branching Ratio ($BR_1$) for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$ for each $m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$.\n\n*   **Step 2: Branching Ratio for $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    Once the atom is in one of the $2p$ states (e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle$), it will decay to a lower energy state. The only state it can decay to via an E1 transition is the $1s$ state ($|1,0,0\\rangle$). Decay to the $2s$ state is forbidden by the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule. Therefore, any atom that reaches a $2p$ state is certain to decay to the $1s$ state.\n    \n    Branching Ratio ($BR_2$) for $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is 1.\n\n*   **Total Probability for a specific route**\n    The total probability for the route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is:\n    $P = BR_1 \\times BR_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThe transition route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is a valid path, and its probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$. Let's check this against the given options:\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct route and probability)\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability, should be $\\frac{1}{3}$)\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability, should be $\\frac{1}{3}$)\n\nOnly option B provides a correct combination of a valid transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two dipole transitions is governed by the electric dipole selection rules. These rules dictate how the quantum numbers *n*, *l*, and *m* can change during a transition.\n\n### 1. Dipole Selection Rules\n\nFor an electric dipole transition, the selection rules are:\n*   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n\nThe principal quantum number *n* must decrease for a decay (emission of a photon). The question specifies a two-step transition, implying the existence of an intermediate state.\n\n### 2. First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$\n\n*   **Initial State:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **Change in *l***: Since the initial orbital quantum number *l* is 0, the only possible change is $\\Delta l = +1$. Therefore, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n*   **Change in *m***: The initial magnetic quantum number *m* is 0. The selection rule allows $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, so the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1,$ or $-1$.\n*   **Change in *n***: The transition must be to a lower energy level, so $n' < 3$. A decay to the $n'=2$ level is a common pathway.\n\nThus, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n### 3. Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n*   **Final State:** $|n'',l'',m''\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **Change in *l***: The intermediate state has $l'=1$ and the final state has $l''=0$. The change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed by the selection rules.\n*   **Change in *m***: The final state has $m''=0$. The change is $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. Since the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, the possible changes are $\\Delta m \\in \\{+1, 0, -1\\}$, all of which are allowed.\n\nAll three potential pathways are valid according to the selection rules:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 4. Transition Probabilities\n\nThe probability of a specific decay path depends on the transition rates, which are proportional to the square of the matrix elements of the electric dipole operator. Using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, it can be shown that the angular part of the transition probability is determined by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\n*   **For the first transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$):** The transition rates are found to be equal for all three possible intermediate states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n*   **For the second transition ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):** Similarly, the transition rates from each of the three intermediate states to the final ground state are also equal.\n\nSince the probabilities for each of the three possible cascade routes are equal, and they are the only routes for this two-dipole transition process via the n=2 shell, the total probability is distributed evenly among them. Therefore, the probability of any single specific route is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n\nOption A correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe user wants me to solve a quantum mechanics problem about the decay of a hydrogen atom state and provide the answer as Python code.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Physics:**\n    *   **Initial State:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. This is a spherically symmetric state ($l=0$).\n    *   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   **Process:** Two consecutive electric dipole transitions. This means there must be an intermediate state.\n    *   **Selection Rules:** For a dipole transition, the selection rules are $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ and $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n2.  **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ to $l=0$ gives $l'=1$.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ to $m=0$ gives $m' = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   The problem options specify the intermediate state has $n'=2$.\n    *   So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Second Transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ to $l'=1$ allows for a final state with $l_{final}=0$ or $l_{final}=2$. The target state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ has $l_{final}=0$, so this is allowed.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ to $m'$ must result in $m_{final}=0$. This is possible for all three intermediate states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n    *   Conclusion: All three routes proposed in options A, B, and C are physically possible.\n\n4.  **Calculate Probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    *   The core of the problem is to determine the probability of taking a specific path.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric. When it decays, there is no preferred direction in space.\n    *   This means the emission of the first photon is isotropic, and the atom is left in one of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states.\n    *   Because of the initial symmetry, the probability of ending up in any of the possible $m'$ sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) must be equal.\n    *   Since there are three possible, equally likely intermediate states, the total probability is split three ways.\n    *   Therefore, the probability (or branching ratio) for any one of these specific routes is $1/3$.\n\n5.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   Route A: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. Probability should be $1/3$. Option says $1/4$. Incorrect.\n    *   Route B: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. Probability should be $1/3$. Option says $1/3$. **Correct.**\n    *   Route C: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. Probability should be $1/3$. Option says $1/4$. Incorrect.\n    *   Route D: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. Probability should be $1/3$. Option says $2/3$. Incorrect.\n\n6.  **Construct Python Code:**\n    *   The code will formalize the argument that the probabilities are equal by using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, which relates the transition probabilities to the square of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n    *   I will use the `sympy.physics.wigner.clebsch_gordan` function to calculate these coefficients for the three possible transitions.\n    *   The code will show that the squared coefficients are equal, confirming the branching ratio is $1/3$ for each path.\n    *   Finally, the code will select and print the correct option based on this result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import Rational\n\ndef solve_hydrogen_decay():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the correct transition route and probability for the H-atom decay\n    from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The problem describes a two-step decay: |3,0,0> -> |2,1,m'> -> |1,0,0>.\n    # We need to find the probability (branching ratio) for a specific path.\n\n    # The key insight is that the initial state |3,0,0> is spherically symmetric (l=0).\n    # Therefore, the decay to the intermediate |2,1,m'> states must be isotropic,\n    # meaning the probability is distributed equally among the possible m' sublevels.\n    # The possible m' values are -1, 0, and 1.

Understand the Process**\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs not in a single step, but via a two-step process involving two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there must be an intermediate state, let's call it $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. The overall process is:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**2. Apply Dipole Transition Selection Rules**\nFor an electric dipole transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following selection rules:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer. Since this is a decay process (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n**3. Determine the Intermediate State(s)**\nWe apply the selection rules to both steps of the transition.\n\n*   **First transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   Initial state: $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l_i = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, we must have $l'=1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m_i = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta n = n' - n_i = n' - 3 < 0$, so $n' < 3$.\n\n*   **Second transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   Final state: $|n_f, l_f, m_f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - l' = \\pm 1$. This requires $l'=1$, which is consistent with the first transition.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m' = 0, \\pm 1$. This requires $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, which is also consistent.\n    *   $\\Delta n = n_f - n' = 1 - n' < 0$, so $n' > 1$.\n\n*   **Combining the conditions for the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$:**\n    *   From the first step: $n'<3$, $l'=1$, $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   From the second step: $n'>1$, $l'=1$, $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The only integer value for $n'$ that satisfies both $n'<3$ and $n'>1$ is $n'=2$.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\nThis means there are three possible routes for the two-step decay:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This probability is the branching ratio of the first transition, i.e., the probability that the atom, starting in $|3,0,0\\rangle$, will decay into a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe probability of a transition to a specific state is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle \\text{final} | \\vec{d} | \\text{initial} \\rangle|^2$, where $\\vec{d} = -e\\vec{r}$ is the electric dipole operator. The transition rate is proportional to $|\\langle n',l',m' | \\vec{r} | n,l,m \\rangle|^2$.\n\nWe need to find the relative rates for the decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to each of the three possible intermediate states:\n*   Rate to $|2,1,-1\\rangle$: $W_{-1} \\propto |\\langle 2,1,-1 | \\vec{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n*   Rate to $|2,1,0\\rangle$: $W_{0} \\propto |\\langle 2,1,0 | \\vec{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n*   Rate to $|2,1,1\\rangle$: $W_{+1} \\propto |\\langle 2,1,1 | \\vec{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has orbital angular momentum $l=0$, which means its wavefunction is spherically symmetric. When a spherically symmetric system decays, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. Consequently, the decay populates each of the magnetic sublevels ($m'$) of the final state equally.\n\nTherefore, the transition rates to the states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ must be equal:\n$W_{-1} = W_{0} = W_{+1}$\n\nThe total rate of decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the $n=2, l=1$ level is $W_{total} = W_{-1} + W_{0} + W_{+1} = 3W_{0}$.\n\nThe probability (branching ratio) for the atom to take the path through the intermediate state $|2,1,0\\rangle$ is:\n$P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{W_{0}}{W_{total}} = \\frac{W_{0}}{W_{-1} + W_{0} + W_{+1}} = \\frac{W_{0}}{3W_{0}} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nSimilarly, the probabilities for the paths through $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are also both $1/3$.\n\nOnce the atom is in an intermediate state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$, it will decay to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Since this is the only allowed decay channel to the $n=1$ level, the probability of this second step is 1. Thus, the probability of the entire cascade is determined by the branching ratio of the first step.\n\n**5. Match with the Options**\nWe are looking for an option that lists a valid route and the correct probability.\n*   A) Route: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$.

(Correct route and probability)\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Process and Selection Rules:**\n    The problem describes a two-step cascade decay from the hydrogen atom state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Each step is an electric dipole (E1) transition. The selection rules for E1 transitions are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ (change in orbital angular momentum quantum number)\n    *   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ (change in magnetic quantum number)\n    *   Parity must change, which is guaranteed by $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ since parity is given by $(-1)^l$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Possible Transition Routes:**\n    The decay proceeds from the initial state $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$ via an intermediate state $|k\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **First Transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |k\\rangle$):**\n        *   Initial state: $|3,0,0\\rangle$ ($n=3, l=0, m=0$).\n        *   Applying selection rules:\n            *   $\\Delta l = +1$ is required, since $l=0$ cannot decrease. So, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n            *   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$. Since the initial $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, \\pm 1$.\n        *   The problem implies the intermediate state has the principal quantum number $n'=2$.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states $|k\\rangle$ are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second Transition ($|k\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n        *   Initial state: $|k\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n        *   Final state: $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   Let's check if this transition is allowed for all possible intermediate states:\n            *   $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n            *   $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. Since $m'$ can be $0, \\pm 1$, this condition is satisfied for all three intermediate states.\n        *   So, all three paths are possible:\n            *   Path 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,1\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$\n            *   Path 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,0\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$\n            *   Path 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,-1\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability of Each Route:**\n    The probability of a specific cascade route is given by the product of the branching ratios for each step.\n    Probability(route) = BranchingRatio(step 1) $\\times$ BranchingRatio(step 2).\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio for the First Step:**\n        The branching ratio for the transition to a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ is the ratio of the partial decay rate to that state to the total decay rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$.\n        The transition rate $\\Gamma_{i \\to k}$ is proportional to the square of the matrix element $|\\langle k | e\\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$.\n        We need to compare the rates $\\Gamma_{300 \\to 21m'}$ for $m' = -1, 0, 1$.\n\n        A powerful symmetry argument can be used here: The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has $l=0$, which means its wavefunction is spherically symmetric. There is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the decay must be isotropic, meaning the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the magnetic sublevels $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n        This implies that the transition rates are equal:\n        $\\Gamma_{300 \\to 21,-1} = \\Gamma_{300 \\to 21,0} = \\Gamma_{300 \\to 21,1}$.\n\n        Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first step, the branching ratio for each is $1/3$.\n        BranchingRatio($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle$) = $1/3$ for each $m'$.\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio for the Second Step:**\n        For the second step, the atom is in one of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (a $2p$ state). The only lower-energy state it can decay to via an E1 transition is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the $1s$ state). Decay to the $|2,0,0\\rangle$ state is also possible in principle, but the energy difference is tiny (Lamb shift), and the $\\omega^3$ dependence of the transition rate makes the decay to $1s$ overwhelmingly dominant. Therefore, we can assume the decay from any $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state proceeds to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of 1.\n        BranchingRatio($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$) = 1.\n\n    *   **Total Probability:**\n        The total probability for any of the three specific routes is:\n        Probability(route) = $(1/3) \\times 1 = 1/3$.\n\n4.  **Compare with Options:**\n    Let's examine the given options:\n    A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect, probability should be 1/3)\n    B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct, both the route and the probability match our calculation)\n    C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect, probability is wrong)\n    D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect, probability should be 1/3)\n\nThe only option consistent with the principles of quantum mechanics is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the correct transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Transitions and Selection Rules\n\nThe problem describes a cascade decay from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ through an intermediate state via two electric dipole transitions. The selection rules for an electric dipole transition are:\n*   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n\n**First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Initial state:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. Here, $l=0$ and $m=0$.\n*   **Selection rule for $l$:** Since the initial $l=0$, we must have $\\Delta l = +1$, which means the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   **Selection rule for $m$:** Since the initial $m=0$, we can have $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$. This means the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1, \\text{ or } -1$.\n*   **Intermediate state:** The problem implies the intermediate state has a principal quantum number $n'=2$. Thus, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n**Second Transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\nLet's check if the transitions from the possible intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ are allowed.\n*   **Initial state:** $|n',l',m'\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$. Here, $l'=1$.\n*   **Final state:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Here, the final angular momentum quantum number is $l_{final}=0$.\n*   **Selection rule for $l$:** $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed transition.\n*   **Selection rule for $m$:** The change $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m' = 0 - m'$ must be $0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible intermediate states ($m' = 0, \\pm 1$).\n\nAll three routes, via $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, are permitted by the selection rules.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Probabilities\n\nThe overall probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n**Probability of the First Step: $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)$**\n\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (the 3s orbital) is spherically symmetric. This means there is no preferred direction in space for the emission of the first photon. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate sub-levels of the $|2,1\\rangle$ state. The total probability of transitioning from the 3s state to the 2p manifold is 1 (as it's the only significant decay channel). Therefore, the probability of populating each specific intermediate state is:\n$P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n$P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n$P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n**Probability of the Second Step: $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$**\n\nOnce the atom is in one of the intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ (the 2p orbital), it will decay to a lower energy level. According to the dipole selection rules, a transition from $l=1$ can only go to $l=0$ or $l=2$. Since the only available lower energy level is $n=1$, which has $l=0$, the only possible decay channel is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the 1s orbital). Therefore, the probability of this second transition is 1, regardless of the value of $m'$.\n$P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$ for $m' = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n**Total Probability of the Cascade Route**\n\nThe total probability for a specific route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n$P(\\text{route via } m') = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n\n*   For the route via $|2,1,1\\rangle$: Probability = $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n*   For the route via $|2,1,0\\rangle$: Probability = $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n*   For the route via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$: Probability = $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n### 3. Compare with the Options\n\nLet's evaluate the given options based on our findings:\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$.

The probability is incorrect.\nD) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The transition route is valid, and the calculated probability is correct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from an initial state to a final state via two dipole transitions is governed by a set of selection rules. These rules dictate which transitions are possible based on the change in the quantum numbers *n*, *l*, and *m*.\n\nThe process in question is a cascade decay from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state. This cannot happen in a single step because the orbital angular momentum quantum number, *l*, would have to remain 0, which violates the dipole selection rule that requires Δ*l* = ±1. Therefore, the decay must proceed through an intermediate state.\n\n**Step 1: Transition from |3,0,0⟩ to an intermediate state |*n'*,*l'*,*m'*⟩**\n\n*   **Initial State:** |*n*=3, *l*=0, *m*=0⟩.\n*   **Selection Rules for Dipole Transitions:**\n    *   Δ*l* = *l'* - *l* = ±1. Since the initial *l* is 0, the intermediate state must have *l'* = 1.\n    *   Δ*m* = *m'* - *m* = 0, ±1. Since the initial *m* is 0, the intermediate state can have *m'* = 0, +1, or -1.\n*   The principal quantum number *n* must decrease, so *n'* < 3. A common intermediate state is *n'*=2.\n\nBased on these rules, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.\n\n**Step 2: Transition from the intermediate state to the final state |1,0,0⟩**\n\n*   **Final State:** |*n*=1, *l*=0, *m*=0⟩.\n*   Let's check the transitions from the possible intermediate states:\n    *   From |2,1,*m'*⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.\n    *   Δ*l* = *l*<sub>final</sub> - *l'* = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies the selection rule for all possible intermediate states.\n    *   Δ*m* = *m*<sub>final</sub> - *m'* = 0 - *m'*. This must be 0 or ±1. This condition is met for *m'* = 0, +1, and -1.\n\nThus, all three decay routes are physically possible:\n1.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n2.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n3.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n**Step 3: Determining the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric (*l*=0). This means there is no preferred direction in space for the emission of the first photon. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the allowed magnetic sublevels (*m'*) of the *l'*=1 state.\n\nThe total transition probability is the sum of the probabilities to each of the three intermediate states: |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩. Because of the initial state's symmetry, the probabilities for transitioning to each of these three states are equal.\n\nP(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩)\n\nSince these are the only three possible paths for the first step of the cascade, the sum of their probabilities must be 1. Therefore, the probability for any single path is 1/3.\n\nThe question asks for the transition route and its corresponding probability. Let's examine the options provided:\n*   **A) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/3:** This route is valid, and the calculated probability for this specific path is 1/3.\n*   **B) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 2/3:** The probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/4:** The probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/4:** The probability is incorrect.\n\nThe probability of the entire cascade is determined by the probability of the first step, as the second transition (e.g., from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩) is the only allowed dipole decay path to a lower energy level and thus has a probability of 1. Therefore, the probability of the specific cascade |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is 1/3.\n\nThe correct answer is the one that identifies a valid route with the correct probability.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe problem asks for a valid decay route and its probability for the transition of a hydrogen atom from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the selection rules for E1 transitions.\nAn electric dipole transition between an initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ and a final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ is governed by the following selection rules:\n1.  The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  The principal quantum number $n$ can change by any integer value ($\\Delta n = \\text{any integer}$), but for emission, the energy must decrease, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the possible intermediate states.\nThe process is a two-step cascade:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**First transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   Initial state: $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: Since $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n*   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: Since $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, 1, -1$.\n*   Applying $\\Delta n < 0$: The intermediate state must have $n' < 3$. For a cascade to the $n=1$ state, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Second transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   Final state: $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   Let's check if our possible intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ can decay to the final state.\n*   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: The change is $l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: The change is $m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This is allowed for all possible intermediate $m'$ values ($-1, 0, 1$).\n*   So, all three routes are physically possible:\n    1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the probability of each route.\nThe \"probability\" of a specific route is its branching ratio.\n*   **Second Step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the $2p$ subshell), its only allowed E1 decay channel is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the $1s$ state). Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1 for all three routes.\n*   **First Step:** We need to find the relative probabilities of the transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to each of the three possible intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an $s$-state, which is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred direction in space.\n    *   The decay process (spontaneous emission), when averaged over all photon emission directions and polarizations, is an isotropic process.\n    *   The three possible final states for this step, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, are degenerate in energy (in the absence of external fields) and only differ by their spatial orientation (the value of $m'$).\n    *   Because the initial state and the interaction are both isotropic, there can be no preference for producing one orientation ($m'$) over another. Therefore, the three degenerate $m'$ sub-levels must be populated with equal probability.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since there are three equally likely routes, and the total probability must sum to 1, the probability for each specific route is $1/3$.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the given options.\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. The route is valid, and the probability is correct.\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that presents a valid route with the correct corresponding probability is C. The Python code execution confirms that the branching ratio for each of the three possible decay paths is indeed $1/3$.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Process:** The problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions, which means it's a cascade process involving an intermediate state.\n\n2.  **Recall Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:** For an E1 transition to occur, the quantum numbers must change according to the following rules:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but for a decay (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intermediate State:** Let the intermediate state be $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n    *   **First Transition:** From $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|n', l', m'\\rangle$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta l$ rule: $l' - l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, we must have $l' = 1$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta n$ rule: $n' < 3$.\n        *   The lowest possible energy level with $l=1$ is $n=2$. So, the most probable first transition is to the $n'=2$ level. The options provided in the question confirm that the intermediate state has $n'=2$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule: $m' - m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second Transition:** From the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   Let's check if this transition is allowed by the selection rules.\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m' = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible intermediate $m'$ values (i.e., for $m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n        *   $\\Delta n = n_{final} - n' = 1 - 2 = -1$. This is an allowed decay.\n\n4.  **Identify Possible Transition Routes:** Based on the analysis above, there are three possible cascade routes from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$:\n    *   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) for each Route:**\n    The probability of a specific route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition. The branching ratio is the ratio of the rate of a specific transition to the total transition rate.\n    The transition rate $\\Gamma_{i \\to f}$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | e\\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$.\n    Let's analyze the rate of the first transition: $\\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m')$.\n\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the transitions to the three degenerate sub-levels $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ must be equally probable.\n\n    To formally verify this, we can use the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The transition rate from $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n    $\\Gamma \\propto |\\langle l, m; 1, q | l', m' \\rangle|^2$, where $q = m' - m$.\n    For the first transition: $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ and $|f\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n    So, $l=0, m=0$ and $l'=1, m'=m'$. This gives $q = m' - 0 = m'$.\n    The relevant Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is $\\langle 0, 0; 1, m' | 1, m' \\rangle$. For coupling anything with angular momentum 0, this coefficient is always 1.\n    So, $|\\langle 0, 0; 1, m' | 1, m' \\rangle|^2 = 1$ for all three possible values of $m' (-1, 0, 1)$.\n\n    This confirms that the transition rates are equal:\n    $\\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,-1) = \\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,0) = \\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,1)$.\n\n    The total decay rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is the sum of the rates to all possible final states. Since the only allowed E1 decay is to the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the total rate is:\n    $\\Gamma_{total} = \\sum_{m'=-1,0,1} \\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m')$.\n    Let $\\Gamma_0 = \\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m')$ for any $m'$. Then $\\Gamma_{total} = 3\\Gamma_0$.\n\n    The probability, or branching ratio, for the transition to proceed via a specific intermediate state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$, is:\n    $P(\\text{route via } |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{\\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,0)}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{3\\Gamma_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    Since the rates are equal for all three intermediate $m'$ states, the probability for each of the three routes is $1/3$.\n\n6.  **Consider the Second Transition's Probability:** Once the atom is in an intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$, it must decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Are there other competing decay channels from $|2,1,m'\\rangle$?\n    According to the selection rules, a state with $l=1$ can decay to a state with $l=0$ or $l=2$.\n    *   $l=0$: The only state with $l=0$ and $n<2$ is $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   $l=2$: States with $l=2$ (d-states) only exist for $n \\ge 3$. Since decay requires $n_{final} < n_{initial}$, there are no allowed E1 transitions from $n=2, l=1$ to an $l=2$ state.\n    Therefore, the state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ can only decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via an E1 transition. The probability of this second step, given the atom is in the intermediate state, is 1.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:** The overall probability of a specific cascade route is the probability of the first step (the branching ratio) multiplied by the probability of the second step.\n    Probability = (Branching Ratio of first step) $\\times 1 = 1/3$.\n\n    So, for the route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, the probability is $1/3$.\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    A) Route is $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, probability is $\\frac{2}{3}$.

(Correct route and probability)\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **System:** A non-relativistic Hydrogen atom (H-atom).\n    *   **Initial State:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. This is the 3s state.\n    *   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This is the 1s ground state.\n    *   **Process:** The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means it's a cascade decay through an intermediate state.\n    *   **Goal:** Identify the correct decay path (the intermediate state) and the probability of that specific path.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole (E1) Transitions:**\n    For an atom to transition from an initial state $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$ to a final state $|n_f, l_f, m_f\\rangle$ by emitting a single photon (E1 transition), the following selection rules must be satisfied:\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = l_f - l_i = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m_f - m_i = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   For emission (decay), the energy must decrease, which means the principal quantum number must decrease, $n_f < n_i$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Possible Intermediate States:**\n    The decay happens in two steps:\n    *   **Step 1:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$ (Intermediate State)\n    *   **Step 2:** $|n', l', m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ (Final State)\n\n    Let's apply the selection rules to Step 1:\n    *   Initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n_i=3, l_i=0, m_i=0$.\n    *   **Rule for l:** $\\Delta l = l' - l_i = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, the only possibility is $l' = 1$.\n    *   **Rule for m:** $\\Delta m = m' - m_i = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for the intermediate magnetic quantum number are $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   **Rule for n:** We need $n' < n_i=3$. Also, for any state, we must have $l' \\le n'-1$. Since we found $l'=1$, we need $1 \\le n'-1$, which implies $n' \\ge 2$. Combining $n'<3$ and $n'\\ge2$, the only possible value is $n'=2$.\n\n    So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    Now, let's check if Step 2 is allowed from these intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$:\n    *   Initial state for Step 2 is $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. Final state is $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   **Rule for l:** $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n    *   **Rule for m:** $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. Since $m'$ can be $-1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$, this condition is satisfied for all three possible intermediate states.\n    *   **Rule for n:** $\\Delta n = n_f - n' = 1 - 2 = -1$. This is an allowed decay.\n\n    Conclusion: All three decay paths are possible:\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio):**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first decay step. The total transition rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is the sum of the rates to all possible intermediate states. The probability of one specific channel is the rate of that channel divided by the total rate.\n\n    $P(\\text{route via } |2,1,m'\\rangle) = \\frac{\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)}{\\sum_{m''=-1}^{1} \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m''\\rangle)}$\n\n    We can determine the relative probabilities using a powerful symmetry argument:\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state. Its wave function is spherically symmetric, meaning it has no preferred orientation in space.\n    *   Because the initial state is rotationally invariant, the decay process itself cannot have a preferred direction.\n    *   Therefore, the atom must decay with equal probability into each of the available magnetic sublevels of the intermediate p-state ($l'=1$).\n\n    This means:\n    $P(\\text{to } m'=-1) = P(\\text{to } m'=0) = P(\\text{to } m'=+1)$\n\n    Since these are the only three possible outcomes for the first transition, their probabilities must sum to 1:\n    $P(-1) + P(0) + P(1) = 1$\n    $3 \\times P(\\text{any single } m') = 1$\n    $P(\\text{any single } m') = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n    So, the probability of the decay proceeding through the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ state is $\\frac{1}{3}$. The probability of it proceeding through $|2,1,1\\rangle$ is also $\\frac{1}{3}$, and similarly for $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n5.  **Match with the Options:**\n    *   A) Route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and probability $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   B) Route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and probability $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our findings.\n    *   C) Route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and probability $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n    *   D) Route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and probability $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThe problem asks for the correct decay route and its probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two consecutive electric dipole transitions.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n1.  **Identify the Selection Rules:**\n    Electric dipole transitions are governed by the following selection rules for the quantum numbers $|n,l,m\\rangle$:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but for spontaneous emission (decay), the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n2.  **Determine the First Transition:**\n    The initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$. Let the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n    *   Applying the selection rules for the first transition:\n        *   $l_{initial} = 0$, so we must have $\\Delta l = +1$, which means $l' = 1$.\n        *   $m_{initial} = 0$, so we can have $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, which means $m'$ can be $0, 1,$ or $-1$.\n        *   $n_{initial} = 3$, so $n'$ must be less than 3. The most probable transitions are to the next lowest principal quantum number, so we consider $n'=2$.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Second Transition:**\n    The final state is $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Let's check if a transition from our possible intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state is allowed.\n    *   Applying the selection rules for the second transition:\n        *   $l_{intermediate} = 1$ and $l_{final} = 0$. So, $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n        *   $m_{final} = 0$. So, $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. This is allowed for $m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$.\n    *   This confirms that all three intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The possible decay routes are:\n        *   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio):**\n    We need to find the probability of the specific route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$. The total probability is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio of the First Step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$):**\n        The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. Consequently, the decay to the three degenerate p-sublevels ($|2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle, |2,1,-1\\rangle$) must be equally probable.\n        The total rate of decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the $n=2, l=1$ level is the sum of the rates to the three sub-levels. Since the rates are equal, the probability (or branching ratio) of decaying into any one specific sub-level, such as $|2,1,0\\rangle$, is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n        So, the branching ratio for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio of the Second Step ($|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n        Once the atom is in the state $|2,1,0\\rangle$, it needs to decay to a lower energy state. The only available lower energy state is the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The transition $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed by the dipole selection rules ($\\Delta l = -1, \\Delta m = 0$). Since this is the only possible decay channel, any atom that reaches the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ state will decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of 1.\n        So, the branching ratio for $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is $1$.\n\n    *   **Total Probability:**\n        The total probability for the route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is the product of the individual branching ratios:\n        $P = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The correct transition route is $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and the corresponding probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from an excited state to a lower energy state is governed by quantum mechanical selection rules for dipole transitions. This problem involves a two-step cascade decay from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ ground state.\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing the First Transition\n\nThe initial state is |n,l,m⟩ = |3,0,0⟩. According to the selection rules for electric dipole transitions, the quantum numbers must change as follows:\n*   The orbital angular momentum quantum number *l* must change by ±1 (Δ*l* = ±1).\n*   The magnetic quantum number *m* can change by 0 or ±1 (Δ*m* = 0, ±1).\n*   The principal quantum number *n* is not strictly constrained but must decrease for a decay.\n\nFor the first transition from |3,0,0⟩:\n*   Since the initial *l* is 0, the intermediate state must have *l'* = 1.\n*   Since the initial *m* is 0, the intermediate state can have *m'* = -1, 0, or 1.\n*   The problem specifies a cascade through the n=2 shell, so the intermediate state will have *n'* = 2.\n\nThis means the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Second Transition\n\nThe second transition is from the intermediate state |2,1,m'⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩. Let's check if this is allowed by the selection rules:\n*   Δ*l* = 0 - 1 = -1. This is an allowed change.\n*   For the intermediate state |2,1,0⟩, the change in *m* is Δ*m* = 0 - 0 = 0. This is allowed.\n*   For the intermediate state |2,1,1⟩, the change in *m* is Δ*m* = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n*   For the intermediate state |2,1,-1⟩, the change in *m* is Δ*m* = 0 - (-1) = +1. This is allowed.\n\nTherefore, all three potential pathways are valid according to the selection rules:\n1.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n2.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n3.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Transition Probability\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the decay.\n\nFor the first step, the atom decays from a spherically symmetric state (*l*=0). In such cases, the transition probabilities to each of the possible *m'* states of the next *l* level are equal. Since there are three possible intermediate states (|2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩), the probability of transitioning to any single one of them is 1/3.\n\nFor the second step, consider the decay from the intermediate state |2,1,0⟩. The atom must decay to a lower energy level, which is the n=1 ground state. The only possible state in the n=1 shell is |1,0,0⟩ (since *l* must be less than *n*). Therefore, the transition from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ occurs with a probability of 1, as it is the only available decay channel.\n\nThe total probability for the cascade |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is the product of the probabilities of each step:\n*   P(total) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) × P(|2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩)\n*   P(total) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3\n\nThis matches the path and probability given in option A. The other options list either incorrect probabilities for their respective valid paths or an incorrect probability for the path in option A.\n\nThe correct transition route and probability are:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state occurs via a two-step electric dipole transition, which necessitates passing through an intermediate state. The rules governing these transitions, known as selection rules, dictate how the quantum numbers n, l, and m can change.\n\n### Step 1: Transition from |3,0,0⟩ to an intermediate state\n\nThe initial state is |n=3, l=0, m=0⟩, commonly known as the 3s state. According to the electric dipole selection rules, for a transition to be allowed, the orbital angular momentum quantum number *l* must change by ±1 (Δl = ±1), and the magnetic quantum number *m* can change by 0 or ±1 (Δm = 0, ±1).\n\nApplying these rules to the initial state |3,0,0⟩:\n*   **Δl = ±1**: Since the initial *l* is 0, the intermediate state must have *l'* = 1.\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**: Since the initial *m* is 0, the intermediate state can have *m'* = 0, 1, or -1.\n\nThe principal quantum number *n* must decrease for a decay. The options provided suggest an intermediate state with n=2. Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩. These correspond to the 2p subshell.\n\n### Step 2: Transition from the intermediate state to |1,0,0⟩\n\nAll three possible intermediate states |2,1,m'⟩ can transition to the final state |1,0,0⟩, as this step also satisfies the selection rules (Δl = 0-1 = -1, and Δm is 0 or ±1).\n\n### Calculating the Probability\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific transition route. This corresponds to the branching ratio for the first step of the decay. The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric (since *l*=0). Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. Consequently, the transitions to each of the possible intermediate states |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩ are equally probable.\n\nSince there are three equally likely decay channels from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the n=2, l=1 manifold, and these are the only allowed dipole transitions to the n=2 shell, the probability for each channel is 1/3.\n\nThe probability of the entire cascade is determined by this first step, as the subsequent decay from any |2,1,m'⟩ state to |1,0,0⟩ is the only path available and thus has a probability of 1.\n\nTherefore, the three possible decay routes and their probabilities are:\n*   |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a probability of 1/3.\n*   |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a probability of 1/3.\n*   |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a probability of 1/3.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/4 (Incorrect probability)\n*   B) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/3 (Correct route and probability)\n*   C) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/4 (Incorrect probability)\n*   D) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 2/3 (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe correct choice is the one that presents a valid route with the calculated probability of 1/3.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from the state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ is governed by the electric dipole selection rules:\n$\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n$\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n\nThe problem describes a two-step dipole transition from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.

According to the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   **Change in *n***: For a decay (emission of a photon), the principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < 3$. The options provided all suggest an intermediate state with $n'=2$, which is the most probable transition ($3s \\rightarrow 2p$).\n*   **Change in *m***: The initial state has $m=0$.

This gives $\\Delta l = -1$, which is an allowed transition.\n*   **Change in *m***: The final state has $m=0$. The change is $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. For this to be allowed, $m'$ must be $0, +1,$ or $-1$, which is true for all possible intermediate states.\n\nAll three routes, via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$, are permitted by the selection rules.\n\n**Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe probability of a specific decay route is the product of the branching ratios for each step.\n\n1.  **Branching Ratio for the first step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$):**\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (an s-orbital). In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. Therefore, the atom is equally likely to transition to any of the allowed magnetic sublevels of the $l'=1$ state. The three possible final states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. The total probability of transitioning to one of these three states is 1 (assuming the $3s \\rightarrow 2p$ transition is the only one considered). Since the probabilities are equal, the branching ratio for transitioning to any single one of them is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n    So, $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n2.  **Branching Ratio for the second step ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    The intermediate state is a $2p$ state. The only state with a lower principal quantum number that it can decay to via a dipole transition is the $1s$ state ($|1,0,0\\rangle$). Since this is the only possible decay channel for the $2p$ state, the branching ratio for this transition is 1, regardless of the value of $m'$.\n    So, $P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n**Total Probability for the Cascade**\n\nThe total probability for the specific route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is the product of the probabilities of each step:\n$P_{total} = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\nC) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\nD) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct route and probability)\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

Applying the Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules\nThe selection rules for an E1 transition are:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   For a decay process (emission), the principal quantum number must decrease ($n_{final} < n_{initial}$).\n\n### 3. Determining the Intermediate State $|n',l',m'\\rangle$\nWe apply the selection rules to both transitions.\n\n*   **Transition 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   **Initial state:** $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** Since $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** Since $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, 1, \\text{ or } -1$.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta n < 0$:** The intermediate state must have $n' < 3$.\n\n*   **Transition 2: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   **Final state:** $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** The change is $l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is consistent with the requirement that $l'=1$.\n    *   **Applying $\\Delta n < 0$:** The change is $n_f - n' = 1 - n' < 0$, which means $n' > 1$.\n\n*   **Combining the conditions:** We need an intermediate state with $l'=1$, $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, and a principal quantum number $n'$ that satisfies both $n'<3$ and $n'>1$. The only integer value for $n'$ is 2.\n*   **Conclusion:** There are three possible intermediate states, leading to three possible decay routes:\n    1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 4. Calculating the Probability of a Specific Route\nThe question asks for the probability of a single, specific transition route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition.\n\n*   **Symmetry Argument:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred orientation in space. The decay interaction, when averaged over all photon emission directions, is also isotropic. Therefore, there can be no preference for the atom to decay into one of the three degenerate intermediate states ($|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$) over the others.\n*   **Equal Probabilities:** The three possible decay paths for the first step are equally likely. Since these are the only allowed E1 transitions to the $n=2$ shell, their probabilities must sum to 1.\n*   **Branching Ratio:** The probability (branching ratio) for the atom to decay into any single one of these intermediate states is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n*   **Total Cascade Probability:** The probability of the second step (e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$) is 1, as this is the only allowed decay channel to a lower energy level. Therefore, the total probability for any one of the three complete cascade routes is $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n### 5. Evaluating the Options\nWe must find the option that lists a valid route with the correct probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$**: This option presents a valid route and the correct probability.\n*   **B) $\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$**: The probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$**: The route is valid, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, option A is the only one that is fully correct.\n\n<<<A>>>"

Understanding the Transition Process**\n\nThe problem describes a cascade decay from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ (the 3s state) to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ (the 1s state) through an intermediate state via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n**2. Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules**\n\nFor an E1 transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following selection rules:\n*   The change in the principal quantum number, $\\Delta n$, can be any integer.\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l$, must be $\\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m$, must be $0, \\pm 1$.\n\n**3. First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n\nLet's apply the selection rules to the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$:\n*   **Initial state:** $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** Since $l=0$, the only possibility is $l' = l+1 = 1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** Since $m=0$, the possible values for $m'$ are $m' = m + \\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta n$:** For a decay process (emission of a photon), the energy of the atom must decrease, so the principal quantum number must decrease, i.e., $n' < 3$. The possible values are $n'=2$ or $n'=1$. However, for $n'=1$, the only possible value for $l'$ is $l'=0$. This contradicts the requirement that $l'=1$. Therefore, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n\nCombining these results, the possible intermediate states are:\n$|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$. These correspond to the three degenerate $2p$ orbitals.\n\n**4. Second Transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\nNow, let's check if a transition from these intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed.\n*   **Intermediate state:** $n'=2, l'=1, m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$.\n*   **Final state:** $n_{f}=1, l_{f}=0, m_{f}=0$.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$:** $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed transition.\n*   **Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$:** $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$.\n    *   If $m'=0$, $\\Delta m = 0$ (allowed).\n    *   If $m'=1$, $\\Delta m = -1$ (allowed).\n    *   If $m'=-1$, $\\Delta m = 1$ (allowed).\n\nSo, all three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The possible transition routes are:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\nAll routes listed in the options are physically possible. We now need to determine the probability.\n\n**5. Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n\n*   **Step 1: Branching Ratio for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$**\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (an s-orbital). In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the probability of decaying into any of the three degenerate $2p$ states ($|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$) must be equal. Since these are the only allowed E1 decay channels (we assume decay to higher $p$ states is negligible, which is standard), the total probability of decaying to the $2p$ level is 1. The probability is distributed equally among the three possible final states.\n    \n    Branching Ratio ($BR_1$) for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$ for each $m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$.\n\n*   **Step 2: Branching Ratio for $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    Once the atom is in one of the $2p$ states (e.g., $|2,1,0\\rangle$), it will decay to a lower energy state. The only state it can decay to via an E1 transition is the $1s$ state ($|1,0,0\\rangle$). Decay to the $2s$ state is forbidden by the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule. Therefore, any atom that reaches a $2p$ state is certain to decay to the $1s$ state.\n    \n    Branching Ratio ($BR_2$) for $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is 1.\n\n*   **Total Probability for a specific route**\n    The total probability for the route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is:\n    $P = BR_1 \\times BR_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThe transition route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is a valid path, and its probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$. Let's check this against the given options:\n\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct route and probability)\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability, should be $\\frac{1}{3}$)\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability, should be $\\frac{1}{3}$)\n\nOnly option B provides a correct combination of a valid transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two dipole transitions is governed by the electric dipole selection rules. These rules dictate how the quantum numbers *n*, *l*, and *m* can change during a transition.\n\n### 1. Dipole Selection Rules\n\nFor an electric dipole transition, the selection rules are:\n*   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n\nThe principal quantum number *n* must decrease for a decay (emission of a photon). The question specifies a two-step transition, implying the existence of an intermediate state.\n\n### 2. First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$\n\n*   **Initial State:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **Change in *l***: Since the initial orbital quantum number *l* is 0, the only possible change is $\\Delta l = +1$. Therefore, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n*   **Change in *m***: The initial magnetic quantum number *m* is 0. The selection rule allows $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, so the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1,$ or $-1$.\n*   **Change in *n***: The transition must be to a lower energy level, so $n' < 3$. A decay to the $n'=2$ level is a common pathway.\n\nThus, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n### 3. Second Transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n*   **Final State:** $|n'',l'',m''\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$\n*   **Change in *l***: The intermediate state has $l'=1$ and the final state has $l''=0$. The change is $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed by the selection rules.\n*   **Change in *m***: The final state has $m''=0$. The change is $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. Since the intermediate state can have $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, the possible changes are $\\Delta m \\in \\{+1, 0, -1\\}$, all of which are allowed.\n\nAll three potential pathways are valid according to the selection rules:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### 4. Transition Probabilities\n\nThe probability of a specific decay path depends on the transition rates, which are proportional to the square of the matrix elements of the electric dipole operator. Using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, it can be shown that the angular part of the transition probability is determined by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\n*   **For the first transition ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$):** The transition rates are found to be equal for all three possible intermediate states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n*   **For the second transition ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):** Similarly, the transition rates from each of the three intermediate states to the final ground state are also equal.\n\nSince the probabilities for each of the three possible cascade routes are equal, and they are the only routes for this two-dipole transition process via the n=2 shell, the total probability is distributed evenly among them. Therefore, the probability of any single specific route is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n*   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n*   C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$\n*   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$\n\nOption A correctly identifies a valid transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe user wants me to solve a quantum mechanics problem about the decay of a hydrogen atom state and provide the answer as Python code.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Physics:**\n    *   **Initial State:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. This is a spherically symmetric state ($l=0$).\n    *   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   **Process:** Two consecutive electric dipole transitions. This means there must be an intermediate state.\n    *   **Selection Rules:** For a dipole transition, the selection rules are $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ and $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n2.  **First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ to $l=0$ gives $l'=1$.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ to $m=0$ gives $m' = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   The problem options specify the intermediate state has $n'=2$.\n    *   So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Second Transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ to $l'=1$ allows for a final state with $l_{final}=0$ or $l_{final}=2$. The target state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ has $l_{final}=0$, so this is allowed.\n    *   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ to $m'$ must result in $m_{final}=0$. This is possible for all three intermediate states ($m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n    *   Conclusion: All three routes proposed in options A, B, and C are physically possible.\n\n4.  **Calculate Probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    *   The core of the problem is to determine the probability of taking a specific path.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric. When it decays, there is no preferred direction in space.\n    *   This means the emission of the first photon is isotropic, and the atom is left in one of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states.\n    *   Because of the initial symmetry, the probability of ending up in any of the possible $m'$ sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) must be equal.\n    *   Since there are three possible, equally likely intermediate states, the total probability is split three ways.\n    *   Therefore, the probability (or branching ratio) for any one of these specific routes is $1/3$.\n\n5.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   Route A: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. Probability should be $1/3$. Option says $1/4$. Incorrect.\n    *   Route B: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. Probability should be $1/3$. Option says $1/3$. **Correct.**\n    *   Route C: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. Probability should be $1/3$. Option says $1/4$.

Understand the Process**\nThe problem describes the decay of a hydrogen atom from the initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This decay occurs not in a single step, but via a two-step process involving two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means there must be an intermediate state, let's call it $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. The overall process is:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**2. Apply Dipole Transition Selection Rules**\nFor an electric dipole transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following selection rules:\n*   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer. Since this is a decay process (spontaneous emission), the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n**3. Determine the Intermediate State(s)**\nWe apply the selection rules to both steps of the transition.\n\n*   **First transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n    *   Initial state: $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l_i = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, we must have $l'=1$.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m_i = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n    *   $\\Delta n = n' - n_i = n' - 3 < 0$, so $n' < 3$.\n\n*   **Second transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   Final state: $|n_f, l_f, m_f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - l' = \\pm 1$. This requires $l'=1$, which is consistent with the first transition.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m' = 0, \\pm 1$. This requires $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, which is also consistent.\n    *   $\\Delta n = n_f - n' = 1 - n' < 0$, so $n' > 1$.\n\n*   **Combining the conditions for the intermediate state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$:**\n    *   From the first step: $n'<3$, $l'=1$, $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   From the second step: $n'>1$, $l'=1$, $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   The only integer value for $n'$ that satisfies both $n'<3$ and $n'>1$ is $n'=2$.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\nThis means there are three possible routes for the two-step decay:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This probability is the branching ratio of the first transition, i.e., the probability that the atom, starting in $|3,0,0\\rangle$, will decay into a specific intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe probability of a transition to a specific state is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle \\text{final} | \\vec{d} | \\text{initial} \\rangle|^2$, where $\\vec{d} = -e\\vec{r}$ is the electric dipole operator. The transition rate is proportional to $|\\langle n',l',m' | \\vec{r} | n,l,m \\rangle|^2$.\n\nWe need to find the relative rates for the decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to each of the three possible intermediate states:\n*   Rate to $|2,1,-1\\rangle$: $W_{-1} \\propto |\\langle 2,1,-1 | \\vec{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n*   Rate to $|2,1,0\\rangle$: $W_{0} \\propto |\\langle 2,1,0 | \\vec{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n*   Rate to $|2,1,1\\rangle$: $W_{+1} \\propto |\\langle 2,1,1 | \\vec{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$\n\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has orbital angular momentum $l=0$, which means its wavefunction is spherically symmetric. When a spherically symmetric system decays, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. Consequently, the decay populates each of the magnetic sublevels ($m'$) of the final state equally.\n\nTherefore, the transition rates to the states $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ must be equal:\n$W_{-1} = W_{0} = W_{+1}$\n\nThe total rate of decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the $n=2, l=1$ level is $W_{total} = W_{-1} + W_{0} + W_{+1} = 3W_{0}$.\n\nThe probability (branching ratio) for the atom to take the path through the intermediate state $|2,1,0\\rangle$ is:\n$P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{W_{0}}{W_{total}} = \\frac{W_{0}}{W_{-1} + W_{0} + W_{+1}} = \\frac{W_{0}}{3W_{0}} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nSimilarly, the probabilities for the paths through $|2,1,-1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ are also both $1/3$.\n\nOnce the atom is in an intermediate state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$, it will decay to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Since this is the only allowed decay channel to the $n=1$ level, the probability of this second step is 1. Thus, the probability of the entire cascade is determined by the branching ratio of the first step.\n\n**5.

There is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the decay must be isotropic, meaning the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the magnetic sublevels $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n        This implies that the transition rates are equal:\n        $\\Gamma_{300 \\to 21,-1} = \\Gamma_{300 \\to 21,0} = \\Gamma_{300 \\to 21,1}$.\n\n        Since there are three equally probable outcomes for the first step, the branching ratio for each is $1/3$.\n        BranchingRatio($|3,0,0\\rangle \\to |2,1,m'\\rangle$) = $1/3$ for each $m'$.\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio for the Second Step:**\n        For the second step, the atom is in one of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (a $2p$ state). The only lower-energy state it can decay to via an E1 transition is the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the $1s$ state). Decay to the $|2,0,0\\rangle$ state is also possible in principle, but the energy difference is tiny (Lamb shift), and the $\\omega^3$ dependence of the transition rate makes the decay to $1s$ overwhelmingly dominant. Therefore, we can assume the decay from any $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ state proceeds to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of 1.\n        BranchingRatio($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\to |1,0,0\\rangle$) = 1.\n\n    *   **Total Probability:**\n        The total probability for any of the three specific routes is:\n        Probability(route) = $(1/3) \\times 1 = 1/3$.\n\n4.  **Compare with Options:**\n    Let's examine the given options:\n    A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect, probability should be 1/3)\n    B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct, both the route and the probability match our calculation)\n    C) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect, probability is wrong)\n    D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect, probability should be 1/3)\n\nThe only option consistent with the principles of quantum mechanics is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step derivation to determine the correct transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Transitions and Selection Rules\n\nThe problem describes a cascade decay from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ through an intermediate state via two electric dipole transitions. The selection rules for an electric dipole transition are:\n*   $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n*   $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n\n**First Transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Initial state:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. Here, $l=0$ and $m=0$.\n*   **Selection rule for $l$:** Since the initial $l=0$, we must have $\\Delta l = +1$, which means the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   **Selection rule for $m$:** Since the initial $m=0$, we can have $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$. This means the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, +1, \\text{ or } -1$.\n*   **Intermediate state:** The problem implies the intermediate state has a principal quantum number $n'=2$. Thus, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n**Second Transition: $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\nLet's check if the transitions from the possible intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ are allowed.\n*   **Initial state:** $|n',l',m'\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$. Here, $l'=1$.\n*   **Final state:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Here, the final angular momentum quantum number is $l_{final}=0$.\n*   **Selection rule for $l$:** $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed transition.\n*   **Selection rule for $m$:** The change $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m' = 0 - m'$ must be $0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible intermediate states ($m' = 0, \\pm 1$).\n\nAll three routes, via $|2,1,1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, are permitted by the selection rules.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Probabilities\n\nThe overall probability of a specific cascade route is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n\n**Probability of the First Step: $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)$**\n\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (the 3s orbital) is spherically symmetric. This means there is no preferred direction in space for the emission of the first photon. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the three degenerate sub-levels of the $|2,1\\rangle$ state. The total probability of transitioning from the 3s state to the 2p manifold is 1 (as it's the only significant decay channel). Therefore, the probability of populating each specific intermediate state is:\n$P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n$P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n$P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n**Probability of the Second Step: $P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$**\n\nOnce the atom is in one of the intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ (the 2p orbital), it will decay to a lower energy level. According to the dipole selection rules, a transition from $l=1$ can only go to $l=0$ or $l=2$. Since the only available lower energy level is $n=1$, which has $l=0$, the only possible decay channel is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the 1s orbital). Therefore, the probability of this second transition is 1, regardless of the value of $m'$.\n$P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$ for $m' = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\n**Total Probability of the Cascade Route**\n\nThe total probability for a specific route is the product of the probabilities of the two steps:\n$P(\\text{route via } m') = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle)$\n\n*   For the route via $|2,1,1\\rangle$: Probability = $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n*   For the route via $|2,1,0\\rangle$: Probability = $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n*   For the route via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$: Probability = $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n### 3.

These rules dictate which transitions are possible based on the change in the quantum numbers *n*, *l*, and *m*.\n\nThe process in question is a cascade decay from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state. This cannot happen in a single step because the orbital angular momentum quantum number, *l*, would have to remain 0, which violates the dipole selection rule that requires Δ*l* = ±1. Therefore, the decay must proceed through an intermediate state.\n\n**Step 1: Transition from |3,0,0⟩ to an intermediate state |*n'*,*l'*,*m'*⟩**\n\n*   **Initial State:** |*n*=3, *l*=0, *m*=0⟩.\n*   **Selection Rules for Dipole Transitions:**\n    *   Δ*l* = *l'* - *l* = ±1. Since the initial *l* is 0, the intermediate state must have *l'* = 1.\n    *   Δ*m* = *m'* - *m* = 0, ±1. Since the initial *m* is 0, the intermediate state can have *m'* = 0, +1, or -1.\n*   The principal quantum number *n* must decrease, so *n'* < 3. A common intermediate state is *n'*=2.\n\nBased on these rules, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.\n\n**Step 2: Transition from the intermediate state to the final state |1,0,0⟩**\n\n*   **Final State:** |*n*=1, *l*=0, *m*=0⟩.\n*   Let's check the transitions from the possible intermediate states:\n    *   From |2,1,*m'*⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.\n    *   Δ*l* = *l*<sub>final</sub> - *l'* = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies the selection rule for all possible intermediate states.\n    *   Δ*m* = *m*<sub>final</sub> - *m'* = 0 - *m'*. This must be 0 or ±1. This condition is met for *m'* = 0, +1, and -1.\n\nThus, all three decay routes are physically possible:\n1.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n2.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n3.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n**Step 3: Determining the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric (*l*=0). This means there is no preferred direction in space for the emission of the first photon. Consequently, the atom is equally likely to transition into any of the allowed magnetic sublevels (*m'*) of the *l'*=1 state.\n\nThe total transition probability is the sum of the probabilities to each of the three intermediate states: |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩. Because of the initial state's symmetry, the probabilities for transitioning to each of these three states are equal.\n\nP(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩)\n\nSince these are the only three possible paths for the first step of the cascade, the sum of their probabilities must be 1. Therefore, the probability for any single path is 1/3.\n\nThe question asks for the transition route and its corresponding probability. Let's examine the options provided:\n*   **A) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/3:** This route is valid, and the calculated probability for this specific path is 1/3.\n*   **B) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 2/3:** The probability is incorrect.\n*   **C) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/4:** The probability is incorrect.\n*   **D) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/4:** The probability is incorrect.\n\nThe probability of the entire cascade is determined by the probability of the first step, as the second transition (e.g., from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩) is the only allowed dipole decay path to a lower energy level and thus has a probability of 1. Therefore, the probability of the specific cascade |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is 1/3.\n\nThe correct answer is the one that identifies a valid route with the correct probability.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe problem asks for a valid decay route and its probability for the transition of a hydrogen atom from the state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the selection rules for E1 transitions.\nAn electric dipole transition between an initial state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ and a final state $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ is governed by the following selection rules:\n1.  The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = l' - l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  The principal quantum number $n$ can change by any integer value ($\\Delta n = \\text{any integer}$), but for emission, the energy must decrease, so $n$ must decrease.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the possible intermediate states.\nThe process is a two-step cascade:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{E1}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**First transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n*   Initial state: $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: Since $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l' = 1$.\n*   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: Since $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m' = 0, 1, -1$.\n*   Applying $\\Delta n < 0$: The intermediate state must have $n' < 3$. For a cascade to the $n=1$ state, the intermediate state must have $n'=2$.\n*   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Second transition: $|n',l',m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n*   Final state: $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   Let's check if our possible intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ can decay to the final state.\n*   Applying $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$: The change is $l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   Applying $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$: The change is $m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This is allowed for all possible intermediate $m'$ values ($-1, 0, 1$).\n*   So, all three routes are physically possible:\n    1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the probability of each route.\nThe \"probability\" of a specific route is its branching ratio.\n*   **Second Step:** Once the atom is in any of the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states (the $2p$ subshell), its only allowed E1 decay channel is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state (the $1s$ state). Therefore, the probability of this second step is 1 for all three routes.\n*   **First Step:** We need to find the relative probabilities of the transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to each of the three possible intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an $s$-state, which is spherically symmetric. It has no preferred direction in space.\n    *   The decay process (spontaneous emission), when averaged over all photon emission directions and polarizations, is an isotropic process.\n    *   The three possible final states for this step, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, are degenerate in energy (in the absence of external fields) and only differ by their spatial orientation (the value of $m'$).\n    *   Because the initial state and the interaction are both isotropic, there can be no preference for producing one orientation ($m'$) over another. Therefore, the three degenerate $m'$ sub-levels must be populated with equal probability.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since there are three equally likely routes, and the total probability must sum to 1, the probability for each specific route is $1/3$.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the given options.\n*   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$.

Since $l'$ must be non-negative, we must have $l' = 1$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta n$ rule: $n' < 3$.\n        *   The lowest possible energy level with $l=1$ is $n=2$. So, the most probable first transition is to the $n'=2$ level. The options provided in the question confirm that the intermediate state has $n'=2$.\n        *   Applying the $\\Delta m$ rule: $m' - m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second Transition:** From the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   Let's check if this transition is allowed by the selection rules.\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m' = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible intermediate $m'$ values (i.e., for $m'=-1, 0, 1$).\n        *   $\\Delta n = n_{final} - n' = 1 - 2 = -1$. This is an allowed decay.\n\n4.  **Identify Possible Transition Routes:** Based on the analysis above, there are three possible cascade routes from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$:\n    *   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio) for each Route:**\n    The probability of a specific route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition. The branching ratio is the ratio of the rate of a specific transition to the total transition rate.\n    The transition rate $\\Gamma_{i \\to f}$ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element, $|\\langle f | e\\mathbf{r} | i \\rangle|^2$.\n    Let's analyze the rate of the first transition: $\\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m')$.\n\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric ($l=0$). In the absence of external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the transitions to the three degenerate sub-levels $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$ must be equally probable.\n\n    To formally verify this, we can use the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The transition rate from $|n,l,m\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n    $\\Gamma \\propto |\\langle l, m; 1, q | l', m' \\rangle|^2$, where $q = m' - m$.\n    For the first transition: $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ and $|f\\rangle = |2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n    So, $l=0, m=0$ and $l'=1, m'=m'$. This gives $q = m' - 0 = m'$.\n    The relevant Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is $\\langle 0, 0; 1, m' | 1, m' \\rangle$. For coupling anything with angular momentum 0, this coefficient is always 1.\n    So, $|\\langle 0, 0; 1, m' | 1, m' \\rangle|^2 = 1$ for all three possible values of $m' (-1, 0, 1)$.\n\n    This confirms that the transition rates are equal:\n    $\\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,-1) = \\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,0) = \\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,1)$.\n\n    The total decay rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is the sum of the rates to all possible final states. Since the only allowed E1 decay is to the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ states, the total rate is:\n    $\\Gamma_{total} = \\sum_{m'=-1,0,1} \\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m')$.\n    Let $\\Gamma_0 = \\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,m')$ for any $m'$. Then $\\Gamma_{total} = 3\\Gamma_0$.\n\n    The probability, or branching ratio, for the transition to proceed via a specific intermediate state, say $|2,1,0\\rangle$, is:\n    $P(\\text{route via } |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{\\Gamma(3,0,0 \\to 2,1,0)}{\\Gamma_{total}} = \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{3\\Gamma_0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    Since the rates are equal for all three intermediate $m'$ states, the probability for each of the three routes is $1/3$.\n\n6.  **Consider the Second Transition's Probability:** Once the atom is in an intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$, it must decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Are there other competing decay channels from $|2,1,m'\\rangle$?\n    According to the selection rules, a state with $l=1$ can decay to a state with $l=0$ or $l=2$.\n    *   $l=0$: The only state with $l=0$ and $n<2$ is $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   $l=2$: States with $l=2$ (d-states) only exist for $n \\ge 3$. Since decay requires $n_{final} < n_{initial}$, there are no allowed E1 transitions from $n=2, l=1$ to an $l=2$ state.\n    Therefore, the state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ can only decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via an E1 transition. The probability of this second step, given the atom is in the intermediate state, is 1.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:** The overall probability of a specific cascade route is the probability of the first step (the branching ratio) multiplied by the probability of the second step.\n    Probability = (Branching Ratio of first step) $\\times 1 = 1/3$.\n\n    So, for the route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, the probability is $1/3$.\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    A) Route is $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, probability is $\\frac{2}{3}$. (Incorrect probability)\n    B) Route is $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, probability is $\\frac{1}{4}$. (Incorrect probability, should be $1/3$)\n    C) Route is $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, probability is $\\frac{1}{4}$. (Incorrect probability, should be $1/3$)\n    D) Route is $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$, probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$. (Correct route and probability)\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **System:** A non-relativistic Hydrogen atom (H-atom).\n    *   **Initial State:** $|n,l,m\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$. This is the 3s state.\n    *   **Final State:** $|1,0,0\\rangle$. This is the 1s ground state.\n    *   **Process:** The decay occurs via two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This means it's a cascade decay through an intermediate state.\n    *   **Goal:** Identify the correct decay path (the intermediate state) and the probability of that specific path.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Selection Rules for Electric Dipole (E1) Transitions:**\n    For an atom to transition from an initial state $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle$ to a final state $|n_f, l_f, m_f\\rangle$ by emitting a single photon (E1 transition), the following selection rules must be satisfied:\n    *   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = l_f - l_i = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = m_f - m_i = 0, \\pm 1$.\n    *   For emission (decay), the energy must decrease, which means the principal quantum number must decrease, $n_f < n_i$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Possible Intermediate States:**\n    The decay happens in two steps:\n    *   **Step 1:** $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |n', l', m'\\rangle$ (Intermediate State)\n    *   **Step 2:** $|n', l', m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ (Final State)\n\n    Let's apply the selection rules to Step 1:\n    *   Initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n_i=3, l_i=0, m_i=0$.\n    *   **Rule for l:** $\\Delta l = l' - l_i = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, the only possibility is $l' = 1$.\n    *   **Rule for m:** $\\Delta m = m' - m_i = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for the intermediate magnetic quantum number are $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n    *   **Rule for n:** We need $n' < n_i=3$. Also, for any state, we must have $l' \\le n'-1$. Since we found $l'=1$, we need $1 \\le n'-1$, which implies $n' \\ge 2$. Combining $n'<3$ and $n'\\ge2$, the only possible value is $n'=2$.\n\n    So, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    Now, let's check if Step 2 is allowed from these intermediate states to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$:\n    *   Initial state for Step 2 is $|2,1,m'\\rangle$. Final state is $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n    *   **Rule for l:** $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n    *   **Rule for m:** $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. Since $m'$ can be $-1, 0, \\text{ or } 1$, this condition is satisfied for all three possible intermediate states.\n    *   **Rule for n:** $\\Delta n = n_f - n' = 1 - 2 = -1$. This is an allowed decay.\n\n    Conclusion: All three decay paths are possible:\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n    *   $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio):**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the first decay step. The total transition rate from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is the sum of the rates to all possible intermediate states. The probability of one specific channel is the rate of that channel divided by the total rate.\n\n    $P(\\text{route via } |2,1,m'\\rangle) = \\frac{\\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)}{\\sum_{m''=-1}^{1} \\Gamma(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m''\\rangle)}$\n\n    We can determine the relative probabilities using a powerful symmetry argument:\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state. Its wave function is spherically symmetric, meaning it has no preferred orientation in space.\n    *   Because the initial state is rotationally invariant, the decay process itself cannot have a preferred direction.\n    *   Therefore, the atom must decay with equal probability into each of the available magnetic sublevels of the intermediate p-state ($l'=1$).\n\n    This means:\n    $P(\\text{to } m'=-1) = P(\\text{to } m'=0) = P(\\text{to } m'=+1)$\n\n    Since these are the only three possible outcomes for the first transition, their probabilities must sum to 1:\n    $P(-1) + P(0) + P(1) = 1$\n    $3 \\times P(\\text{any single } m') = 1$\n    $P(\\text{any single } m') = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n    So, the probability of the decay proceeding through the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ state is $\\frac{1}{3}$. The probability of it proceeding through $|2,1,1\\rangle$ is also $\\frac{1}{3}$, and similarly for $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n5.  **Match with the Options:**\n    *   A) Route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and probability $\\frac{2}{3}$.

The probability is incorrect.\n    *   D) Route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and probability $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability is incorrect.\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThe problem asks for the correct decay route and its probability for a hydrogen atom transitioning from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state via two consecutive electric dipole transitions.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n1.  **Identify the Selection Rules:**\n    Electric dipole transitions are governed by the following selection rules for the quantum numbers $|n,l,m\\rangle$:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta n$ can be any integer, but for spontaneous emission (decay), the energy must decrease, so $n_{final} < n_{initial}$.\n\n2.  **Determine the First Transition:**\n    The initial state is $|3,0,0\\rangle$. Let the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n    *   Applying the selection rules for the first transition:\n        *   $l_{initial} = 0$, so we must have $\\Delta l = +1$, which means $l' = 1$.\n        *   $m_{initial} = 0$, so we can have $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$, which means $m'$ can be $0, 1,$ or $-1$.\n        *   $n_{initial} = 3$, so $n'$ must be less than 3. The most probable transitions are to the next lowest principal quantum number, so we consider $n'=2$.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,0\\rangle$, $|2,1,1\\rangle$, and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Second Transition:**\n    The final state is $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Let's check if a transition from our possible intermediate states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state is allowed.\n    *   Applying the selection rules for the second transition:\n        *   $l_{intermediate} = 1$ and $l_{final} = 0$. So, $\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1$, which is allowed.\n        *   $m_{final} = 0$. So, $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. This is allowed for $m' \\in \\{0, 1, -1\\}$.\n    *   This confirms that all three intermediate states can decay to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The possible decay routes are:\n        *   Route 1: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Route 2: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        *   Route 3: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability (Branching Ratio):**\n    We need to find the probability of the specific route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$. The total probability is the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio of the First Step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$):**\n        The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is an s-state, which is spherically symmetric. This means it has no preferred orientation in space. Consequently, the decay to the three degenerate p-sublevels ($|2,1,0\\rangle, |2,1,1\\rangle, |2,1,-1\\rangle$) must be equally probable.\n        The total rate of decay from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the $n=2, l=1$ level is the sum of the rates to the three sub-levels. Since the rates are equal, the probability (or branching ratio) of decaying into any one specific sub-level, such as $|2,1,0\\rangle$, is exactly $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n        So, the branching ratio for $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    *   **Branching Ratio of the Second Step ($|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n        Once the atom is in the state $|2,1,0\\rangle$, it needs to decay to a lower energy state. The only available lower energy state is the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. The transition $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is allowed by the dipole selection rules ($\\Delta l = -1, \\Delta m = 0$). Since this is the only possible decay channel, any atom that reaches the $|2,1,0\\rangle$ state will decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of 1.\n        So, the branching ratio for $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is $1$.\n\n    *   **Total Probability:**\n        The total probability for the route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is the product of the individual branching ratios:\n        $P = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The correct transition route is $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and the corresponding probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from an excited state to a lower energy state is governed by quantum mechanical selection rules for dipole transitions. This problem involves a two-step cascade decay from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ ground state.\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing the First Transition\n\nThe initial state is |n,l,m⟩ = |3,0,0⟩. According to the selection rules for electric dipole transitions, the quantum numbers must change as follows:\n*   The orbital angular momentum quantum number *l* must change by ±1 (Δ*l* = ±1).\n*   The magnetic quantum number *m* can change by 0 or ±1 (Δ*m* = 0, ±1).\n*   The principal quantum number *n* is not strictly constrained but must decrease for a decay.\n\nFor the first transition from |3,0,0⟩:\n*   Since the initial *l* is 0, the intermediate state must have *l'* = 1.\n*   Since the initial *m* is 0, the intermediate state can have *m'* = -1, 0, or 1.\n*   The problem specifies a cascade through the n=2 shell, so the intermediate state will have *n'* = 2.\n\nThis means the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Second Transition\n\nThe second transition is from the intermediate state |2,1,m'⟩ to the final state |1,0,0⟩. Let's check if this is allowed by the selection rules:\n*   Δ*l* = 0 - 1 = -1. This is an allowed change.\n*   For the intermediate state |2,1,0⟩, the change in *m* is Δ*m* = 0 - 0 = 0. This is allowed.\n*   For the intermediate state |2,1,1⟩, the change in *m* is Δ*m* = 0 - 1 = -1. This is allowed.\n*   For the intermediate state |2,1,-1⟩, the change in *m* is Δ*m* = 0 - (-1) = +1. This is allowed.\n\nTherefore, all three potential pathways are valid according to the selection rules:\n1.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n2.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n3.  |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Transition Probability\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific route. This is determined by the branching ratio of the decay.\n\nFor the first step, the atom decays from a spherically symmetric state (*l*=0). In such cases, the transition probabilities to each of the possible *m'* states of the next *l* level are equal. Since there are three possible intermediate states (|2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩), the probability of transitioning to any single one of them is 1/3.\n\nFor the second step, consider the decay from the intermediate state |2,1,0⟩. The atom must decay to a lower energy level, which is the n=1 ground state. The only possible state in the n=1 shell is |1,0,0⟩ (since *l* must be less than *n*). Therefore, the transition from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ occurs with a probability of 1, as it is the only available decay channel.\n\nThe total probability for the cascade |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is the product of the probabilities of each step:\n*   P(total) = P(|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩) × P(|2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩)\n*   P(total) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3\n\nThis matches the path and probability given in option A. The other options list either incorrect probabilities for their respective valid paths or an incorrect probability for the path in option A.\n\nThe correct transition route and probability are:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state occurs via a two-step electric dipole transition, which necessitates passing through an intermediate state. The rules governing these transitions, known as selection rules, dictate how the quantum numbers n, l, and m can change.\n\n### Step 1: Transition from |3,0,0⟩ to an intermediate state\n\nThe initial state is |n=3, l=0, m=0⟩, commonly known as the 3s state. According to the electric dipole selection rules, for a transition to be allowed, the orbital angular momentum quantum number *l* must change by ±1 (Δl = ±1), and the magnetic quantum number *m* can change by 0 or ±1 (Δm = 0, ±1).\n\nApplying these rules to the initial state |3,0,0⟩:\n*   **Δl = ±1**: Since the initial *l* is 0, the intermediate state must have *l'* = 1.\n*   **Δm = 0, ±1**: Since the initial *m* is 0, the intermediate state can have *m'* = 0, 1, or -1.\n\nThe principal quantum number *n* must decrease for a decay. The options provided suggest an intermediate state with n=2. Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩. These correspond to the 2p subshell.\n\n### Step 2: Transition from the intermediate state to |1,0,0⟩\n\nAll three possible intermediate states |2,1,m'⟩ can transition to the final state |1,0,0⟩, as this step also satisfies the selection rules (Δl = 0-1 = -1, and Δm is 0 or ±1).\n\n### Calculating the Probability\n\nThe question asks for the probability of a specific transition route. This corresponds to the branching ratio for the first step of the decay. The initial state |3,0,0⟩ is spherically symmetric (since *l*=0). Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. Consequently, the transitions to each of the possible intermediate states |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, and |2,1,1⟩ are equally probable.\n\nSince there are three equally likely decay channels from the |3,0,0⟩ state to the n=2, l=1 manifold, and these are the only allowed dipole transitions to the n=2 shell, the probability for each channel is 1/3.\n\nThe probability of the entire cascade is determined by this first step, as the subsequent decay from any |2,1,m'⟩ state to |1,0,0⟩ is the only path available and thus has a probability of 1.\n\nTherefore, the three possible decay routes and their probabilities are:\n*   |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a probability of 1/3.\n*   |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a probability of 1/3.\n*   |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with a probability of 1/3.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/4 (Incorrect probability)\n*   B) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/3 (Correct route and probability)\n*   C) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 1/4 (Incorrect probability)\n*   D) |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 2/3 (Incorrect probability)\n\nThe correct choice is the one that presents a valid route with the calculated probability of 1/3.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe decay of a hydrogen atom from the state $|n,l,m\\rangle$ is governed by the electric dipole selection rules:\n$\\Delta l = \\pm 1$\n$\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$\n\nThe problem describes a two-step dipole transition from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Let the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 1: Transition from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Change in *l***: The initial state has $l=0$. According to the selection rule $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$, the intermediate state must have $l'=1$.\n*   **Change in *n***: For a decay (emission of a photon), the principal quantum number must decrease, so $n' < 3$. The options provided all suggest an intermediate state with $n'=2$, which is the most probable transition ($3s \\rightarrow 2p$).\n*   **Change in *m***: The initial state has $m=0$. The selection rule $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ allows the intermediate state to have $m' = 0, +1,$ or $-1$.\n\nThus, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Transition from $|n',l',m'\\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Change in *l***: The intermediate state has $l'=1$ and the final state has $l=0$. This gives $\\Delta l = -1$, which is an allowed transition.\n*   **Change in *m***: The final state has $m=0$. The change is $\\Delta m = 0 - m'$. For this to be allowed, $m'$ must be $0, +1,$ or $-1$, which is true for all possible intermediate states.\n\nAll three routes, via $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, or $|2,1,1\\rangle$, are permitted by the selection rules.\n\n**Calculating the Probability (Branching Ratio)**\n\nThe probability of a specific decay route is the product of the branching ratios for each step.\n\n1.  **Branching Ratio for the first step ($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$):**\n    The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (an s-orbital). In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. Therefore, the atom is equally likely to transition to any of the allowed magnetic sublevels of the $l'=1$ state. The three possible final states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$. The total probability of transitioning to one of these three states is 1 (assuming the $3s \\rightarrow 2p$ transition is the only one considered). Since the probabilities are equal, the branching ratio for transitioning to any single one of them is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n    So, $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n2.  **Branching Ratio for the second step ($|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$):**\n    The intermediate state is a $2p$ state. The only state with a lower principal quantum number that it can decay to via a dipole transition is the $1s$ state ($|1,0,0\\rangle$). Since this is the only possible decay channel for the $2p$ state, the branching ratio for this transition is 1, regardless of the value of $m'$.\n    So, $P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\n**Total Probability for the Cascade**\n\nThe total probability for the specific route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is the product of the probabilities of each step:\n$P_{total} = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ (Incorrect probability)\nC) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ (Incorrect probability)\nD) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ (Correct route and probability)\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
