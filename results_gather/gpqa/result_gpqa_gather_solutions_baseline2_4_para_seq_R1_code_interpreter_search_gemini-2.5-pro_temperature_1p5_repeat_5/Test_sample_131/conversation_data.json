All four candidate molecules fit this formula.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (Singlets):** The fact that all signals are singlets is a critical clue. It means there is no spin-spin splitting between adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This immediately rules out any compound containing an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃), as this would produce a characteristic quartet and a triplet.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Integration):** The compounds are isomers (tetramethylbenzenes), each with 12 methyl protons. In a 1:1 mixture, there are a total of 24 alkyl protons. An integration ratio of 2:1:1 (4 parts total) for 24 protons corresponds to three signals with absolute integrations of:\n        *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        So, we are looking for a mixture that produces three alkyl signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are **singlets**, with a **1:1** integration ratio.\n    *   **Careful Point 3 (Aromatic Signals):** This indicates that the two compounds in the mixture each have a different aromatic proton environment. Since the molar ratio of the compounds is 1:1 and the signal integration is 1:1, the number of protons contributing to each of the two aromatic singlets must be identical.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound\nWe will predict the spectrum for each candidate based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** As established in Careful Point 1, the ethyl groups would produce a quartet and a triplet. This contradicts the \"all singlets\" data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be **eliminated**. This immediately rules out **Option D**, which contains 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at positions 3 and 6) are chemically equivalent. They produce **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. They produce **one alkyl singlet (12H)**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at positions 5 and 6) are chemically equivalent. They produce **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2/C3 are also equivalent. This results in **two alkyl singlets (6H each)**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are equivalent. They produce **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the single one at C2 (3H), and the single one at C5 (3H). This results in **three alkyl singlets** with a 6H:3H:3H ratio (a 2:1:1 ratio for this pure compound).\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that gives three alkyl singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Alkyl Signals: Prehnitene contributes two 6H singlets. Isodurene contributes one 6H and two 3H singlets. The combined spectrum would have signals for 6H and 3H protons, but no 12H signal. Incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Alkyl Signals: Durene contributes one 12H singlet. Isodurene contributes one 6H and two 3H singlets. The combined spectrum would show four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), not the three required. Incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB (Durene) contributes **one 12H singlet**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB (Prehnitene) contributes **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   **Combined Result (Alkyl):** The mixture produces exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies perfectly to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Combined Result (Aromatic):** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives another distinct 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture correctly yields two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This is also a perfect match.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly explains all features of the observed ¹H NMR spectrum is the 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided spectral data and candidate compounds.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nFirst, let's translate the information from the ¹H NMR spectrum into a set of strict chemical requirements for the two compounds in the 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₁₀H₁₄. All four candidate molecules fit this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):**\n    *   **Two signals:** The mixture contains two compounds, and they have different aromatic proton environments.\n    *   **Singlets:** The aromatic protons giving rise to these signals are isolated (they have no non-equivalent adjacent proton neighbors).\n    *   **1:1 Integration Ratio:** Since the mixture is 1:1 molar, this ratio means the number of protons contributing to the first aromatic signal is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second one.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):**\n    *   **Three signals:** There are three distinct types of alkyl proton environments in the total mixture.\n    *   **Singlets:** This is a crucial constraint. It indicates that none of the alkyl protons are split by adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This immediately brings any structure with an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) into question, as it would show a quartet and a triplet due to spin-spin splitting.\n    *   **2:1:1 Integration Ratio:** This represents the relative populations of protons in the three different alkyl environments. For a 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers (each with 12 alkyl protons), the total number of alkyl protons is 24. A 2:1:1 ratio (4 total parts) corresponds to absolute integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n### **2. Predict the Spectra of the Individual Candidate Compounds**\n\nThe next step is to accurately predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each individual compound, which depends heavily on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Analysis:** This compound has two ethyl groups. As explained above, an ethyl group produces a **quartet** and a **triplet** in the alkyl region.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This directly contradicts the \"all singlets\" requirement. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be immediately eliminated**. This rules out **Option D**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:**\n        *   Aromatic: One singlet (for the two equivalent protons at C3 and C6), integrating to **2H**.\n        *   Alkyl: One singlet (for all four equivalent methyl groups), integrating to **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:**\n        *   Aromatic: One singlet (for the two equivalent protons at C5 and C6), integrating to **2H**.\n        *   Alkyl: Two singlets (one for the equivalent C1/C4 methyl groups, one for the equivalent C2/C3 methyl groups), each integrating to **6H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule is asymmetric.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:**\n        *   Aromatic: Two distinct protons (at C4 and C6) with no neighbors, giving two singlets, each integrating to **1H**.\n        *   Alkyl: Four distinct methyl groups, giving up to four singlets, each integrating to **3H**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture of the remaining compounds perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n**Aromatic Check:** The experimental spectrum shows two signals with a 1:1 ratio.\n*   Any mixture containing Isodurene would be problematic. For example, a mixture of Durene (one 2H singlet) and Isodurene (two 1H singlets) would show three aromatic signals in total. This rules out options A and B.\n*   Let's check Option C: a mixture of Durene and Prehnitene. Durene contributes one 2H singlet. Prehnitene contributes another distinct 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture would therefore show exactly **two singlets**, and since both come from 2 protons, the integration ratio would be 2H:2H or **1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n**Alkyl Check (the Deciding Factor):** The experimental spectrum requires three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n*   **Option A: Durene + Isodurene:** Would produce one 12H singlet from Durene and up to four 3H singlets from Isodurene. This does not match.\n*   **Option B: Prehnitene + Isodurene:** Would produce two 6H singlets from Prehnitene and up to four 3H singlets from Isodurene. This does not match.\n*   **Option C: Durene + Prehnitene:**\n    *   Durene contributes: **one singlet (12H)**.\n    *   Prehnitene contributes: **two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   Combined, the mixture shows exactly **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This combination directly explains the two 1:1 aromatic singlets and, critically, the three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets, without requiring any assumptions about accidental signal overlaps.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a detailed, step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Spectral Information\n\nFirst, let's establish a clear set of requirements from the provided ¹H NMR data for the 1:1 mixture:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula**: Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄. All four candidate molecules match this.\n*   **Alkyl Region**: The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Singlet Multiplicity**: The most critical clue is that all alkyl signals are singlets. This indicates that the protons giving rise to these signals are not split by adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This immediately allows us to assess the suitability of structures with ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃), which would exhibit characteristic splitting patterns (a quartet and a triplet).\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Absolute Integration**: In a 1:1 mixture of C₁₀H₁₄ isomers, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 (from compound A) + 12 (from compound B) = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio (4 total parts) for 24 protons corresponds to three signals with absolute integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. Our target mixture must produce this specific pattern.\n*   **Aromatic Region**: The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are **singlets**, with a **1:1** integration ratio.\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Aromatic Signals**: Since the mixture and signal ratio are both 1:1, the number of protons that create each of the two aromatic singlets must be identical.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds\n\nNext, we must predict the individual ¹H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds based on its molecular structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**:\n    *   This compound has two ethyl groups. As identified in Careful Point 1, this structure is incompatible with the \"all singlets\" data for the alkyl region.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound can be **immediately ruled out**. Therefore, option B, which contains 1,4-diethylbenzene, is incorrect.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons (at positions 3 and 6) are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons (at positions 5 and 6) are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2/C3 are equivalent. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule also has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique methyl at C2 (3H), and the unique methyl at C5 (3H). This produces **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Mixture Options\n\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture satisfies the spectral data, paying closest attention to the decisive alkyl region requirements (three singlets with 12H, 6H, and 6H integrations).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Durene provides: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene provides: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined Result: Four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   Combined Result: Ruled out because of 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Prehnitene provides: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Isodurene provides: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined Result: This would not produce the required 12H signal. This does not match.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Check**: Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture creates two distinct signals, each from 2 protons, matching the \"two singlets, 1:1 ratio\" requirement.\n    *   **Alkyl Check**:\n        *   Durene provides **one singlet (12H)**.\n        *   Prehnitene provides **two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   **Combined Result**: The mixture has exactly **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches all requirements.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only option that directly and perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct mixture of compounds based on the provided ¹H NMR data.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nFirst, we must interpret the key information provided about the 1:1 molar mixture:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C₁₀H₁₄. All four listed candidates satisfy this condition.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two signals**, both are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **1:1**.\n    *   **Implication:** The mixture contains two compounds whose aromatic protons exist in different chemical environments. Since it's a 1:1 molar mixture with a 1:1 signal ratio, the number of protons contributing to each of the two signals must be identical.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are **three signals**, all are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Key Constraint:** The \"all singlets\" observation is crucial. It means none of the alkyl protons are subject to spin-spin splitting from adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This immediately rules out structures with alkyl chains like ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃), which would exhibit splitting patterns (a quartet and a triplet).\n    *   **Integration Calculation:** The mixture consists of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers. Assuming they are tetramethylbenzenes, each has 12 alkyl (methyl) protons, for a total of 24 alkyl protons in the mixture. A 2:1:1 ratio represents a total of 4 parts (2+1+1). To find the number of protons per \"part\", we calculate 24 protons / 4 parts = 6 protons. Therefore, the three signals correspond to absolute integrations of:\n        *   Signal 1 (2 parts): 2 * 6H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (1 part): 1 * 6H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (1 part): 1 * 6H = **6H**\n\n### **2. Predict the ¹H NMR Spectra for the Individual Candidate Compounds**\n\nNext, we analyze the structure and symmetry of each candidate to predict its individual ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This compound contains ethyl groups. The protons on the adjacent CH₂ and CH₃ carbons will couple, producing a characteristic **quartet** and **triplet** in the alkyl region.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This contradicts the data that all alkyl signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is eliminated as a possibility**. This immediately rules out **Option A**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical (two perpendicular planes of symmetry).\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at positions 3 and 6) are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at positions 5 and 6) are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2/C3 are also equivalent. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at positions 4 and 6) are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with a 6H:3H:3H (or 2:1:1) ratio.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which pair of the remaining compounds produces the required combined spectrum. The deciding factor is the alkyl region, which must have three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB:** one 12H singlet.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB:** two 6H singlets.\n    *   **Combined Result:** This mixture gives exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** Each compound gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this creates two distinct signals, each integrating to 2H, perfectly matching the 1:1 ratio requirement.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This pair is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB (two 6H singlets) + 1,2,3,5-TMB (one 6H, two 3H singlets).\n    *   **Combined Result:** This would produce signals including 3H peaks, which is inconsistent with the required 12H, 6H, and 6H pattern.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB (one 12H singlet) + 1,2,3,5-TMB (one 6H, two 3H singlets).\n    *   **Combined Result:** This mixture would have four alkyl signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which does not match the observed three signals.\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis, the only mixture that accounts for all the spectral data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Spectral Information**\n\nFirst, let's translate the provided ¹H NMR data into a clear set of requirements for the unknown 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄. All four candidates match this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two signals**, both of which are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **1:1**.\n    *   **Implication:** This means the mixture contains two compounds, and each contributes a set of aromatic protons in a different chemical environment. Because the mixture is 1:1 and the signal ratio is 1:1, the number of protons giving rise to each of the two singlets must be identical.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are **three signals**, all of which are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (Singlets):** The fact that all signals are singlets is a crucial clue. It means none of the alkyl protons are subject to spin-spin splitting from adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This immediately rules out structures containing groups like ethyl (-CH₂CH₃), which would produce quartets and triplets.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Integration):** In a 1:1 mixture of C₁₀H₁₄ isomers where the alkyl portion consists of four methyl groups, there are a total of 12 (from compound 1) + 12 (from compound 2) = 24 alkyl protons. A 2:1:1 ratio for 24 protons corresponds to three signals with absolute integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. We must find the mixture that produces exactly these signals.\n\n### **2. Predict the Spectra for the Individual Compounds**\n\nThe key to solving the problem is to accurately predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each candidate based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Analysis:** This compound has two ethyl groups. As identified in Careful Point 1, the adjacent -CH₂- and -CH₃ protons will split each other, producing a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This contradicts the data. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is eliminated**. This immediately rules out **Option D**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent and isolated. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent due to symmetry. They appear as **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2/C3 are also equivalent. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through atoms C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the one at C2 (3H), and the one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with a ratio of 6H:3H:3H (or 2:1:1 for the pure compound).\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test the remaining combinations (Options A, B, and C) to see which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n**Target Spectrum:**\n1.  **Aromatic:** Two 1:1 singlets (this is satisfied by a mixture of any two of the tetramethylbenzene isomers, as they each give one 2H singlet).\n2.  **Alkyl:** Three singlets with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Prehnitene contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   The combined spectrum would not match the {12H, 6H, 6H} requirement. It lacks a 12H signal and contains 3H signals.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Durene contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   The combined spectrum would have four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which contradicts the observation of three signals.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Durene contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   Prehnitene contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   The combined spectrum gives exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n    *   The ratio of these signals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match for the alkyl region data. The aromatic region is also a perfect match.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, precisely accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on a synthesis and validation of the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the ¹H NMR Data**\nFirst, we must establish a clear set of structural requirements based on the experimental data provided for the 1:1 molar mixture.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two signals**, both are **singlets**, with an equal **1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   This implies the mixture contains two compounds with different aromatic proton environments.\n    *   Since it's a 1:1 mixture and the signal ratio is 1:1, the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second signal.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are **three signals**, all are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: The \"singlet\" multiplicity is a critical clue.** All agents correctly recognize this. It means the alkyl protons are not subject to spin-spin splitting from adjacent, non-equivalent protons.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Interpreting the integration.** The total number of alkyl protons in a 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers is 24 (12 from each molecule, since each has 2 aromatic protons). A 2:1:1 ratio represents 4 total parts (2+1+1=4). Therefore, the actual number of protons for each signal is (2/4)×24H = **12H**, (1/4)×24H = **6H**, and (1/4)×24H = **6H**.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the Candidate Compounds**\n\nThe core of the problem, addressed by all candidate answers, is to predict the spectrum of each individual compound and see how they combine.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Analysis:** This compound contains two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). Protons on adjacent carbons in an ethyl group will split each other, producing a characteristic **quartet** and **triplet** in the alkyl region.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This directly contradicts the \"all singlets\" data. There is a unanimous consensus among all provided answers that **1,4-diethylbenzene can be definitively ruled out.** This eliminates option **C**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** One aromatic singlet (2H) and **one alkyl singlet (12H)**. There is a unanimous consensus on this prediction.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** One aromatic singlet (2H) and **two alkyl singlets (6H each)**. There is a unanimous consensus on this prediction.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule is asymmetric.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** Two aromatic singlets (1H each) and four alkyl singlets (3H each).\n    *   **Careful Point 3:** Many agents incorrectly assign a plane of symmetry to this molecule. However, regardless of the fine details, they all correctly conclude that a mixture containing isodurene would not produce the required alkyl signal pattern.\n\n### **3. Evaluation of the Mixture Options**\n\nThe decisive step is to find the pair that combines to form three alkyl singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Options containing 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** (Option A and B)\n    *   Neither Durene nor Prehnitene, when mixed with Isodurene, can produce the required combination of three alkyl signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. For instance, a mixture of Durene (one 12H singlet) and Isodurene (four 3H singlets) would result in five signals. The reasoning across all candidate answers supports this incompatibility.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB (Durene) provides **one singlet of 12H**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB (Prehnitene) provides **two singlets of 6H each**.\n    *   **Combined Result:** The mixture produces exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies perfectly to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** Both compounds give one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this correctly results in two distinct signals with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### **Final Decision Synthesis**\n\nWhile the final letter choices from the agents are scattered, this is due to clear inconsistencies between their reasoning and their final output letter. A systematic analysis of the *reasoning* within all 15 candidate answers reveals a **unanimous logical conclusion**: the only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This pair corresponds to option D in the question prompt.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer by synthesizing the reasoning from the provided agent answers and conducting a rigorous check.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectral Information\n\nFirst, we must establish a clear set of requirements from the provided ¹H NMR data for the 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula**: Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄ isomers. All four candidates fit this description.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm)**:\n    *   **Three signals**: The mixture contains three distinct chemical environments for alkyl protons.\n    *   **All signals are singlets**: This is a critical constraint. It means that none of the alkyl protons are subject to spin-spin splitting from adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This immediately rules out structures with coupled protons, such as ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃), which would produce a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   **Integration ratio of 2:1:1**: Since it is a 1:1 mixture of isomers each containing 12 alkyl protons (4 x CH₃), the total number of alkyl protons in the sample is 24. A 2:1:1 ratio represents a total of 4 parts (2+1+1). Therefore, the absolute number of protons for each signal is:\n        *   (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    The mixture's alkyl spectrum must contain three singlets with integrations corresponding to 12 protons, 6 protons, and 6 protons.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm)**:\n    *   **Two signals**: The two compounds in the mixture have different chemical environments for their aromatic protons.\n    *   **Both signals are singlets**: The aromatic protons in each compound are \"isolated\" and not split by neighbors.\n    *   **Integration ratio of 1:1**: As the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, this means that the number of protons contributing to each of the two aromatic signals is identical.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound\n\nWe must predict the spectrum of each individual compound to understand its contribution to the mixture.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**:\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule contains two ethyl groups. Due to proton-proton coupling, these groups would produce a characteristic **quartet** and a **triplet** in the alkyl region.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This directly contradicts the experimental data stating that all alkyl signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be definitively eliminated**. This immediately rules out **Option C**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: High (two perpendicular planes of symmetry).\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: One plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2/C3 are also equivalent. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: One plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons at C4 and C6 are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This produces **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Mixtures\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that matches the required spectrum: two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets (corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H). The alkyl region is the most decisive.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl Signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Alkyl Signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined Result: **Four** total signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl Signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Alkyl Signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined Result: At least four signals (or more), and does not produce the 12H:6H:6H pattern. This does not match.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Check**: 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this creates **two distinct singlets**, each representing 2 protons, which matches the **1:1 ratio** requirement.\n    *   **Alkyl Check**:\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides: **one singlet (12H)**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides: **two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   **Combined Result**: The mixture has exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches all experimental data.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis overwhelmingly confirms that the only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, precisely accounts for all the features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This combination explains the two 1:1 aromatic singlets and, critically, the three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the ¹H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nFirst, let's establish the requirements based on the experimental data for the 1:1 molar mixture:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C₁₀H₁₄. All four listed compounds meet this requirement.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are **three signals**, all are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n    *   **\"All singlets\"** is a critical constraint. The protons creating these signals do not experience spin-spin splitting from adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This strongly suggests the alkyl groups are methyl groups not adjacent to other non-equivalent protons. It effectively rules out groups like ethyl (-CH₂CH₃), which would produce a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   The **2:1:1 integration ratio** represents the relative number of protons. Since the mixture is 1:1 and each C₁₀H₁₄ isomer has 12 alkyl protons (from four methyl groups), the total alkyl protons in the sample are 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio (4 total parts) for 24 protons corresponds to three signals with absolute integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two signals**, both are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **1:1**.\n    *   Since it is a 1:1 mixture and the signals have a 1:1 ratio, each compound must contribute one signal, and those signals must arise from an equal number of protons (likely 2 protons each, since they are disubstituted benzenes).\n\n### **2. Prediction of the Spectra for the Individual Candidate Compounds**\n\nNext, we must predict the individual ¹H NMR spectrum for each candidate based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has two ethyl groups. As established above, this would produce a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region, not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be **immediately ruled out**. This eliminates **Option A**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one aromatic singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one alkyl singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes protons and methyl groups equivalent in pairs.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one aromatic singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This results in **two alkyl singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule also has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are chemically equivalent, producing **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This produces **three alkyl singlets** (with a 2:1:1 ratio for this pure compound).\n\n### **3. Evaluation of the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which remaining 1:1 mixture (Options B, C, D) fits the spectral data. The alkyl region is the most decisive factor. We are looking for a combination of signals that results in exactly three singlets with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out due to 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   `1,2,4,5-TMB` contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   `1,2,3,5-TMB` contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined Result: This mixture would show four alkyl signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match the observed three signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   `1,2,3,4-TMB` contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   `1,2,3,5-TMB` contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined Result: This mixture would not produce a 12H signal and would contain 3H signals, which is inconsistent with the required 12H, 6H, 6H pattern. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** `1,2,4,5-TMB` provides **one singlet of 12H**. `1,2,3,4-TMB` provides **two singlets of 6H each**.\n    *   **Combined Result:** The mixture produces exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the alkyl region data.\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** Each compound provides one 2H singlet. A mixture gives two distinct 2H singlets, resulting in the correct 1:1 integration ratio. This also matches.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is the 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nFirst, let's establish a clear set of requirements from the provided experimental data for the 1:1 mixture:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄. All four candidate compounds match this.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two signals**, both are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **1:1**.\n    *   **Implication:** This means the mixture contains two compounds, each contributing a distinct aromatic signal. Since the mixture is 1:1 molar and the signal ratio is 1:1, the number of protons giving rise to each signal must be identical.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are **three signals**, all are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Key Constraint:** The signals being all **singlets** is a critical clue. It rules out any structure that would exhibit spin-spin splitting (coupling) in the alkyl region, such as an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃), which produces a characteristic quartet and a triplet.\n    *   **Integration Calculation:** In a 1:1 mixture of C₁₀H₁₄ isomers, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 (from compound A) + 12 (from compound B) = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio (4 total parts) for 24 protons corresponds to three signals with absolute integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Individual Candidate Compounds**\n\nThe core of the problem is to accurately predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each isomer based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This molecule contains two ethyl groups. As established above, this would produce a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region due to proton-proton coupling.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This directly contradicts the \"all singlets\" data. This compound can be **immediately ruled out**, which eliminates **Option D**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at C-3 and C-6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one aromatic singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one alkyl singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at C-5 and C-6) are chemically equivalent. Equivalent protons do not split each other, so they appear as **one aromatic singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are two distinct sets of equivalent methyl groups: the pair at C-1/C-4 and the pair at C-2/C-3. This results in **two alkyl singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C-2 and C-5.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons at C-4 and C-6 are equivalent due to symmetry. They produce **one aromatic singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C-1/C-3 (6H), the unique one at C-2 (3H), and the unique one at C-5 (3H). This results in **three alkyl singlets** with a 6H:3H:3H integration (a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nWe now test which 1:1 mixture of the three remaining tetramethylbenzene isomers matches the required spectral data. The decision will be based on the alkyl region signals, which must combine to give three signals with 12H, 6H, and 6H integrations.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Prehnitene contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   **Result:** This combination would contain 3H signals, which is not consistent with the required 12H, 6H, and 6H pattern. Incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Durene contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   **Result:** This combination would produce four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which contradicts the observation of three signals. Incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signal Check:** Durene provides one 2H singlet. Prehnitene provides another 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this correctly produces **two aromatic singlets** with a **1:1 ratio** (2H:2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Signal Check:**\n        *   Durene provides: **one 12H singlet**.\n        *   Prehnitene provides: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   **Result:** The combination results in exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair that precisely accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct mixture of compounds based on the provided NMR data.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Spectral Information\n\nFirst, we must establish a clear set of requirements from the provided ¹H NMR data for the 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):**\n    *   There are **two signals**, both of which are **singlets**. This means the mixture contains two compounds with different aromatic proton environments, and these protons are isolated (no adjacent, non-equivalent proton neighbors).\n    *   The signals have a **1:1 integration ratio**. Since it's a 1:1 molar mixture, this implies that the number of protons giving rise to each of the two signals is identical.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):**\n    *   There are **three signals**, and critically, all are **singlets**. This is a major clue that rules out structures with alkyl groups that would show spin-spin splitting.\n    *   The signals have a **2:1:1 integration ratio**. In a 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers (assuming they are tetramethylbenzenes), the total number of alkyl protons is 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio (4 total parts) for 24 protons corresponds to three signals with absolute integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n### 2. Analyze Individual Candidate Compounds\n\nThe core of the problem is to accurately predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each isomer based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Eliminating 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Structure:** This compound has two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Prediction:** Protons on the adjacent -CH₂- and -CH₃ groups will split each other, producing a characteristic **quartet** and a **triplet** in the alkyl region.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This directly contradicts the experimental data, which states all alkyl signals are **singlets**. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene can be **immediately ruled out**, and any option containing it is incorrect. This eliminates **Option D**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of equivalent methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This produces three singlets with a 6H:3H:3H integration (a 2:1:1 ratio for this pure compound).\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options\n\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture of the remaining candidates (the three tetramethylbenzene isomers) fits the spectral data. The alkyl region is the most informative, as we are looking for a combination that produces three signals integrating to **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined result: This mixture would produce **four** signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined result: This mixture would not produce the required 12H signal.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB provides **one singlet (12H)**. 1,2,3,4-TMB provides **two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   **Combined Result:** The mixture results in exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** Each compound gives one 2H aromatic singlet. A mixture gives two distinct 2H signals, correctly matching the 1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is the 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct mixture of compounds.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Spectral Data\nThe problem provides key spectral information for a 1:1 molar mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both are singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nThere are two critical constraints derived from this data:\n*   **\"All singlets\" in the alkyl region:** This indicates the absence of proton-proton spin coupling in the alkyl groups. This is a powerful clue for eliminating structures.\n*   **The 2:1:1 alkyl integration ratio:** For a 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers (where the alkyl groups are methyls, having 12 protons each), the total number of alkyl protons is 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio for 24 protons corresponds to three signals with absolute integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. (Calculation: 2x + 1x + 1x = 24 → 4x = 24 → x = 6. The signals are 2x=12H, 1x=6H, 1x=6H).\n\n### 2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds\n\nNext, we must predict the individual ¹H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds based on its structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule contains ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). The protons within an ethyl group are adjacent and non-equivalent, causing spin-spin splitting. This would produce a characteristic **quartet** and **triplet** in the alkyl region.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This directly contradicts the experimental data stating all alkyl signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be definitively ruled out**. This eliminates **Option B**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at positions 3 and 6) are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at positions 5 and 6) are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at positions 4 and 6) are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique methyl at C2 (3H), and the unique methyl at C5 (3H). This produces **three singlets (one 6H and two 3H)**.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Candidate Mixtures\n\nWe must now find which pair of the remaining compounds (the three tetramethylbenzene isomers) combines to produce the required spectrum: three alkyl singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   Combined alkyl signals: (two 6H singlets) + (one 6H and two 3H singlets). This mixture does not produce a 12H signal and contains 3H signals. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   Combined alkyl signals: (one 12H singlet) + (one 6H and two 3H singlets). This results in four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which does not match the observed three signals. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB:** **One 12H singlet**.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB:** **Two 6H singlets**.\n    *   **Combined Result:** The mixture produces exactly **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **This is a perfect match.** The aromatic region also matches, as each compound gives one 2H singlet, leading to two 1:1 signals in the mixture.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only pair of compounds whose 1:1 mixture perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of the ¹H NMR data and a comparison with the predicted spectra for the candidate compounds and their mixtures.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectral Information**\n\nFirst, let's establish a clear set of requirements from the provided ¹H NMR data for the 1:1 mixture:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C₁₀H₁₄. All four candidates fit this.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both are singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Implication:** A 1:1 molar mixture giving two signals with a 1:1 integration ratio means that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and those signals arise from an equal number of protons. Given the structures are all C₁₀H₁₄, this corresponds to two distinct 2H signals.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Key Constraint 1 (Singlets):** The fact that all signals are singlets is critical. It indicates there is no spin-spin coupling between adjacent, non-equivalent protons in the alkyl groups. This rules out structures like ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃), which would produce quartets and triplets.\n    *   **Key Constraint 2 (Integration):** In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 (from compound A) + 12 (from compound B) = 24. A 2:1:1 integration ratio (4 total parts) for 24 protons corresponds to three signals with absolute integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. (Calculation: 2x + 1x + 1x = 24 → 4x = 24 → x = 6).\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nThe core of the problem is accurately predicting the spectrum for each isomer based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has two ethyl groups. As established above, this would produce a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region, not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be **immediately eliminated**. Any option containing it is incorrect. This rules out option **B**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at C-3 and C-6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one aromatic singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one alkyl singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes pairs of protons and methyl groups equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at C-5 and C-6) are chemically equivalent. They will appear as **one aromatic singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are two distinct sets of equivalent methyl groups: the pair at C-1/C-4 and the pair at C-2/C-3. This results in **two alkyl singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C-2 and C-5.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons at C-4 and C-6 are equivalent due to symmetry. They produce **one aromatic singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C-1/C-3 (6H), the unique one at C-2 (3H), and the unique one at C-5 (3H). This results in **three alkyl singlets** with a 6H:3H:3H integration, which simplifies to a 2:1:1 ratio for this single compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture of the remaining compounds (Durene, Prehnitene, Isodurene) satisfies the spectral data, paying close attention to the alkyl signals which must combine to give three peaks integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Alkyl Signals: Durene (one 12H singlet) + Isodurene (one 6H, two 3H singlets).\n    *   Result: This mixture would show four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). **This is incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Result: Already ruled out due to 1,4-diethylbenzene. **This is incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Durene provides one 2H singlet. Prehnitene provides one 2H singlet. The 1:1 mixture correctly produces two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides **one 12H singlet**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   Result: The combination results in exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Alkyl Signals: Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) + Isodurene (one 6H, two 3H singlets).\n    *   Result: This mixture would show multiple signals including 3H peaks and would not match the required 12H, 6H, 6H pattern. **This is incorrect.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe only pair of compounds whose 1:1 mixture precisely accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum (two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets) is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step deduction based on the provided ¹H NMR spectral data.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data and Identify Key Constraints\n\nFirst, we deconstruct the information given for the 1:1 molar mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula**: Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄.\n*   **Aromatic Region**: The spectrum has **two signals**, both are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **1:1**.\n*   **Alkyl Region**: The spectrum has **three signals**, all are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n\nFrom this, we can establish several crucial constraints:\n1.  **Alkyl Signals are Singlets**: This is a powerful clue. The absence of splitting (like quartets or triplets) means the alkyl protons are not coupled to adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This strongly suggests the alkyl groups are methyls on a substituted ring and rules out groups like ethyl (-CH₂CH₃), which exhibit splitting.\n2.  **Alkyl Integration**: In a 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ tetramethylbenzene isomers, there are a total of 12 + 12 = 24 alkyl protons. A 2:1:1 integration ratio (4 total parts) corresponds to signals with absolute integrations of:\n    *   (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n    *   (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    Our target mixture must produce these three specific signals.\n3.  **Aromatic Signals**: A 1:1 mixture producing two singlets in a 1:1 ratio implies that each compound gives one aromatic signal, and those signals arise from an equal number of protons (in this case, 2 protons each).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each Candidate Compound Individually\n\nNext, we predict the individual ¹H NMR spectrum for each candidate based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**: As identified in Step 1, the ethyl groups in this molecule would produce a **quartet** and a **triplet** in the alkyl region due to proton-proton coupling. This contradicts the \"all singlets\" data.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound is immediately eliminated. This rules out option **C**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**: This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: The four methyl groups are all equivalent, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are two distinct sets of methyl groups (the C1/C4 pair and the C2/C3 pair), producing **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**: This molecule also has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups (the C1/C3 pair, the unique C2, and the unique C5), producing **three singlets (one 6H and two 3H)**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Possible Mixture Combinations\n\nWe must find the pair of compounds whose individual spectra combine to match the experimental data (three alkyl singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H).\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Combined alkyl signals: One 12H singlet (from durene) + three singlets of 6H, 3H, 3H (from isodurene). This results in four signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Combined alkyl signals: Two 6H singlets (from prehnitene) + three singlets of 6H, 3H, 3H (from isodurene). This combination results in at least four signals and does not have a 12H signal. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals**:\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes **one singlet of 12H**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes **two singlets of 6H each**.\n    *   **Combined Result**: The mixture has exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies perfectly to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Aromatic Check**: Each compound provides one 2H aromatic singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this creates two distinct singlets, each integrating to 2H, matching the required 1:1 ratio.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only mixture that perfectly accounts for all features of the ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers and a thorough review of the chemical principles involved.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Spectral Data\nThe problem provides crucial information about a 1:1 molar mixture of two isomers with the formula C₁₀H₁₄.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio**. This indicates the two compounds in the mixture have different aromatic proton environments. Because it's a 1:1 mixture with 1:1 signal integration, the number of protons giving rise to each signal must be identical.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are **three singlets** with a **2:1:1 integration ratio**. This is the most informative part of the data.\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (Singlet Multiplicity):** The fact that all signals are singlets is a critical constraint. It means none of the alkyl protons are subject to spin-spin splitting from adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This is characteristic of isolated methyl groups attached to a benzene ring.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Integration Ratio):** Each compound has the formula C₁₀H₁₄. For the tetramethylbenzene isomers, there are 12 alkyl protons (4 x CH₃). In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio (4 total parts) for 24 protons corresponds to signals with absolute integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. Our task is to find a pair of compounds whose signals combine to give this exact pattern.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Individual Candidate Compounds\nWe must predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each potential compound based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound contains ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). The adjacent protons would cause spin-spin splitting, producing a characteristic **quartet** (for the CH₂) and **triplet** (for the CH₃). This contradicts the \"all singlets\" data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be immediately eliminated. Option A, which contains 1,4-diethylbenzene, is incorrect.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons (at C3, C6) are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons (at C5, C6) are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: (the pair at C1/C4) and (the pair at C2/C3). This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons (at C4, C6) are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the C1/C3 pair (6H), the C2 methyl (3H), and the C5 methyl (3H). This results in **three singlets** (integrating to 6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options\nWe must find the pair of compounds from the options that, when mixed 1:1, produces the required spectrum: two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets (with 12H, 6H, and 6H integration).\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out due to 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n*   **Option B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Durene provides: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene provides: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined Result: Four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **Option D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Prehnitene provides: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Isodurene provides: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined Result: This would have signals at 6H and 3H, but it would be missing the required 12H signal.\n\n*   **Option C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture creates two distinct signals, each integrating to 2H. This perfectly matches the **two singlets, 1:1 ratio** requirement.\n    *   **Alkyl Check:**\n        *   Durene provides **one singlet (12H)**.\n        *   Prehnitene provides **two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   Combined Result: The mixture has exactly **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** is the only option that directly and perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct mixture of compounds based on the provided spectral data.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Spectral Information**\n\nFirst, we must translate the information from the ¹H NMR spectrum into a set of concrete requirements for our two-component mixture.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula and Ratio**: We have a 1:1 molar mixture of two isomers with the formula C₁₀H₁₄.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm)**: There are two signals, both are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **1:1**.\n    *   *Careful Point*: A 1:1 mixture giving two signals in a 1:1 ratio means each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and those signals arise from an equal number of protons. Since the candidates are disubstituted benzenes, they have either 2 or 4 aromatic protons. In this case, each signal almost certainly represents 2H.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm)**: There are three signals, all are **singlets**, with a **2:1:1** integration ratio.\n    *   *Careful Point 1*: The fact that all signals are **singlets** is a critical constraint. It rules out any structure that would exhibit spin-spin coupling in the alkyl region, such as an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃), which would produce a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   *Careful Point 2*: We must calculate the absolute number of protons for the 2:1:1 ratio. Since each C₁₀H₁₄ isomer is a tetramethylbenzene, each has 12 alkyl protons. In a 1:1 mixture, the total is 24 alkyl protons. The ratio 2:1:1 has 4 total parts (2+1+1). Therefore, the number of protons per signal is:\n        *   Signal 1 (2 parts): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (1 part): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (1 part): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    The mixture must have three alkyl singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Individual Candidate Compounds**\n\nNext, we predict the individual ¹H NMR spectrum for each isomer based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**:\n    *   This compound contains ethyl groups. As noted above, this would produce a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region, not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound can be **immediately ruled out**. This eliminates **Option C**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule is highly symmetrical with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons**: The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons**: All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons**: The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons**: There are two distinct sets of equivalent methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons**: The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons**: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the single methyl at C2 (3H), and the single methyl at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture fits the spectral data. The deciding factor is the alkyl region, which must produce three singlets corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals**: 1,2,3,4-TMB (two 6H singlets) + 1,2,3,5-TMB (one 6H, two 3H singlets).\n    *   **Result**: The mixture would contain multiple 6H signals and two 3H signals. It would not contain the required 12H signal. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals**:\n        *   From 1,2,4,5-TMB: **one 12H singlet**.\n        *   From 1,2,3,4-TMB: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   **Result**: The combination results in exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is a perfect match**.\n    *   **Aromatic Check**: Each compound produces a distinct 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture gives two 2H singlets, which is the required 1:1 ratio. **This also matches perfectly**.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals**: 1,2,4,5-TMB (one 12H singlet) + 1,2,3,5-TMB (one 6H, two 3H singlets).\n    *   **Result**: The mixture would have four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match the observed three signals. **Incorrect**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair that precisely accounts for all the features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum—two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets (with absolute integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H)—is the 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the ¹H NMR data to identify the correct pair of aromatic compounds from the given options.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectral Information\nFirst, we must establish a clear set of requirements based on the experimental data provided for the 1:1 molar mixture.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄. All four candidate molecules match this.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows **three signals**, all of which are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (Signal Multiplicity):** The most critical piece of information is that all alkyl signals are **singlets**. This means the protons giving rise to these signals are not subject to spin-spin splitting by adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This fact immediately allows us to rule out any structure with ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃), as these would produce a characteristic quartet and a triplet due to splitting.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Absolute Integration):** The two compounds are C₁₀H₁₄ isomers, specifically tetramethylbenzenes, which means each has 12 alkyl protons (4 x CH₃). In a 1:1 molar mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 integration ratio corresponds to a total of 4 parts (2+1+1). Therefore, the number of protons contributing to each signal is:\n        *   Signal 1 (2 parts): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (1 part): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (1 part): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    Our target mixture must produce three alkyl singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows **two signals**, both of which are **singlets**, with a **1:1** integration ratio.\n    *   **Careful Point 3 (Aromatic Signals):** The presence of two distinct signals confirms it is a mixture of at least two different compounds. Since the mixture is 1:1 molar and the signal integration is 1:1, the number of protons that create each of the two aromatic singlets must be identical.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Candidate Compounds\nNext, we must predict the individual ¹H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds based on its molecular structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** As established in Careful Point 1, this structure contains ethyl groups and would produce quartets and triplets in the alkyl region, not just singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound is **eliminated**. This immediately rules out **Option A**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at positions 3 and 6) are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at positions 5 and 6) are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2/C3 are also equivalent. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique methyl at C2 (3H), and the unique methyl at C5 (3H). This produces **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options\nNow, we must find which pair of compounds combines to produce the required spectrum: three alkyl singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out due to 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   `1,2,4,5-TMB` contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   `1,2,3,5-TMB` contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   **Combined Result:** This mixture would show four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which does not match the observed three signals. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   `1,2,3,4-TMB` contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   `1,2,3,5-TMB` contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   **Combined Result:** This mixture would not produce the required 12H signal and contains 3H signals. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals Check:**\n        *   `1,2,4,5-TMB` (Durene) provides **one singlet of 12H**.\n        *   `1,2,3,4-TMB` (Prehnitene) provides **two singlets of 6H each**.\n    *   **Combined Result:** The mixture has exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match for the alkyl region data.\n    *   **Aromatic Signals Check:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives another 2H singlet at a different chemical shift. The 1:1 mixture therefore correctly produces two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio. This is a perfect match for the aromatic region data.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is the 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<D>>>"

All four candidate molecules fit this formula.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (Singlets):** The fact that all signals are singlets is a critical clue. It means there is no spin-spin splitting between adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This immediately rules out any compound containing an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃), as this would produce a characteristic quartet and a triplet.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Integration):** The compounds are isomers (tetramethylbenzenes), each with 12 methyl protons. In a 1:1 mixture, there are a total of 24 alkyl protons. An integration ratio of 2:1:1 (4 parts total) for 24 protons corresponds to three signals with absolute integrations of:\n        *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        So, we are looking for a mixture that produces three alkyl signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are **singlets**, with a **1:1** integration ratio.\n    *   **Careful Point 3 (Aromatic Signals):** This indicates that the two compounds in the mixture each have a different aromatic proton environment.

Isodurene contributes one 6H and two 3H singlets. The combined spectrum would have signals for 6H and 3H protons, but no 12H signal. Incorrect.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Alkyl Signals: Durene contributes one 12H singlet. Isodurene contributes one 6H and two 3H singlets.

Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nFirst, let's translate the information from the ¹H NMR spectrum into a set of strict chemical requirements for the two compounds in the 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₁₀H₁₄. All four candidate molecules fit this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):**\n    *   **Two signals:** The mixture contains two compounds, and they have different aromatic proton environments.\n    *   **Singlets:** The aromatic protons giving rise to these signals are isolated (they have no non-equivalent adjacent proton neighbors).\n    *   **1:1 Integration Ratio:** Since the mixture is 1:1 molar, this ratio means the number of protons contributing to the first aromatic signal is equal to the number of protons contributing to the second one.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):**\n    *   **Three signals:** There are three distinct types of alkyl proton environments in the total mixture.\n    *   **Singlets:** This is a crucial constraint. It indicates that none of the alkyl protons are split by adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This immediately brings any structure with an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) into question, as it would show a quartet and a triplet due to spin-spin splitting.\n    *   **2:1:1 Integration Ratio:** This represents the relative populations of protons in the three different alkyl environments. For a 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers (each with 12 alkyl protons), the total number of alkyl protons is 24. A 2:1:1 ratio (4 total parts) corresponds to absolute integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n### **2. Predict the Spectra of the Individual Candidate Compounds**\n\nThe next step is to accurately predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each individual compound, which depends heavily on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Analysis:** This compound has two ethyl groups. As explained above, an ethyl group produces a **quartet** and a **triplet** in the alkyl region.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This directly contradicts the \"all singlets\" requirement. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be immediately eliminated**. This rules out **Option D**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:**\n        *   Aromatic: One singlet (for the two equivalent protons at C3 and C6), integrating to **2H**.\n        *   Alkyl: One singlet (for all four equivalent methyl groups), integrating to **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:**\n        *   Aromatic: One singlet (for the two equivalent protons at C5 and C6), integrating to **2H**.\n        *   Alkyl: Two singlets (one for the equivalent C1/C4 methyl groups, one for the equivalent C2/C3 methyl groups), each integrating to **6H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule is asymmetric.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:**\n        *   Aromatic: Two distinct protons (at C4 and C6) with no neighbors, giving two singlets, each integrating to **1H**.\n        *   Alkyl: Four distinct methyl groups, giving up to four singlets, each integrating to **3H**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture of the remaining compounds perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n**Aromatic Check:** The experimental spectrum shows two signals with a 1:1 ratio.\n*   Any mixture containing Isodurene would be problematic. For example, a mixture of Durene (one 2H singlet) and Isodurene (two 1H singlets) would show three aromatic signals in total. This rules out options A and B.\n*   Let's check Option C: a mixture of Durene and Prehnitene. Durene contributes one 2H singlet. Prehnitene contributes another distinct 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture would therefore show exactly **two singlets**, and since both come from 2 protons, the integration ratio would be 2H:2H or **1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n**Alkyl Check (the Deciding Factor):** The experimental spectrum requires three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n*   **Option A: Durene + Isodurene:** Would produce one 12H singlet from Durene and up to four 3H singlets from Isodurene. This does not match.\n*   **Option B: Prehnitene + Isodurene:** Would produce two 6H singlets from Prehnitene and up to four 3H singlets from Isodurene. This does not match.\n*   **Option C: Durene + Prehnitene:**\n    *   Durene contributes: **one singlet (12H)**.\n    *   Prehnitene contributes: **two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   Combined, the mixture shows exactly **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This combination directly explains the two 1:1 aromatic singlets and, critically, the three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets, without requiring any assumptions about accidental signal overlaps.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a detailed, step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Spectral Information\n\nFirst, let's establish a clear set of requirements from the provided ¹H NMR data for the 1:1 mixture:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula**: Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄. All four candidate molecules match this.\n*   **Alkyl Region**: The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Singlet Multiplicity**: The most critical clue is that all alkyl signals are singlets. This indicates that the protons giving rise to these signals are not split by adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This immediately allows us to assess the suitability of structures with ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃), which would exhibit characteristic splitting patterns (a quartet and a triplet).\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Absolute Integration**: In a 1:1 mixture of C₁₀H₁₄ isomers, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 (from compound A) + 12 (from compound B) = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio (4 total parts) for 24 protons corresponds to three signals with absolute integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. Our target mixture must produce this specific pattern.\n*   **Aromatic Region**: The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are **singlets**, with a **1:1** integration ratio.\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Aromatic Signals**: Since the mixture and signal ratio are both 1:1, the number of protons that create each of the two aromatic singlets must be identical.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds\n\nNext, we must predict the individual ¹H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds based on its molecular structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**:\n    *   This compound has two ethyl groups. As identified in Careful Point 1, this structure is incompatible with the \"all singlets\" data for the alkyl region.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound can be **immediately ruled out**. Therefore, option B, which contains 1,4-diethylbenzene, is incorrect.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons (at positions 3 and 6) are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: The four methyl groups are all chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons (at positions 5 and 6) are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2/C3 are equivalent. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule also has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique methyl at C2 (3H), and the unique methyl at C5 (3H). This produces **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Mixture Options\n\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture satisfies the spectral data, paying closest attention to the decisive alkyl region requirements (three singlets with 12H, 6H, and 6H integrations).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Durene provides: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene provides: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined Result: Four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   Combined Result: Ruled out because of 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Prehnitene provides: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Isodurene provides: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined Result: This would not produce the required 12H signal. This does not match.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Check**: Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture creates two distinct signals, each from 2 protons, matching the \"two singlets, 1:1 ratio\" requirement.\n    *   **Alkyl Check**:\n        *   Durene provides **one singlet (12H)**.\n        *   Prehnitene provides **two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   **Combined Result**: The mixture has exactly **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches all requirements.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only option that directly and perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct mixture of compounds based on the provided ¹H NMR data.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nFirst, we must interpret the key information provided about the 1:1 molar mixture:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C₁₀H₁₄. All four listed candidates satisfy this condition.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two signals**, both are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **1:1**.\n    *   **Implication:** The mixture contains two compounds whose aromatic protons exist in different chemical environments. Since it's a 1:1 molar mixture with a 1:1 signal ratio, the number of protons contributing to each of the two signals must be identical.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are **three signals**, all are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Key Constraint:** The \"all singlets\" observation is crucial. It means none of the alkyl protons are subject to spin-spin splitting from adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This immediately rules out structures with alkyl chains like ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃), which would exhibit splitting patterns (a quartet and a triplet).\n    *   **Integration Calculation:** The mixture consists of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers. Assuming they are tetramethylbenzenes, each has 12 alkyl (methyl) protons, for a total of 24 alkyl protons in the mixture. A 2:1:1 ratio represents a total of 4 parts (2+1+1). To find the number of protons per \"part\", we calculate 24 protons / 4 parts = 6 protons. Therefore, the three signals correspond to absolute integrations of:\n        *   Signal 1 (2 parts): 2 * 6H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (1 part): 1 * 6H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (1 part): 1 * 6H = **6H**\n\n### **2. Predict the ¹H NMR Spectra for the Individual Candidate Compounds**\n\nNext, we analyze the structure and symmetry of each candidate to predict its individual ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This compound contains ethyl groups. The protons on the adjacent CH₂ and CH₃ carbons will couple, producing a characteristic **quartet** and **triplet** in the alkyl region.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This contradicts the data that all alkyl signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is eliminated as a possibility**. This immediately rules out **Option A**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical (two perpendicular planes of symmetry).\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at positions 3 and 6) are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at positions 5 and 6) are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2/C3 are also equivalent. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has one plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at positions 4 and 6) are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with a 6H:3H:3H (or 2:1:1) ratio.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which pair of the remaining compounds produces the required combined spectrum. The deciding factor is the alkyl region, which must have three singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB:** one 12H singlet.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB:** two 6H singlets.\n    *   **Combined Result:** This mixture gives exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** Each compound gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this creates two distinct signals, each integrating to 2H, perfectly matching the 1:1 ratio requirement.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This pair is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB (two 6H singlets) + 1,2,3,5-TMB (one 6H, two 3H singlets).\n    *   **Combined Result:** This would produce signals including 3H peaks, which is inconsistent with the required 12H, 6H, and 6H pattern.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB (one 12H singlet) + 1,2,3,5-TMB (one 6H, two 3H singlets).\n    *   **Combined Result:** This mixture would have four alkyl signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which does not match the observed three signals.\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis, the only mixture that accounts for all the spectral data is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Spectral Information**\n\nFirst, let's translate the provided ¹H NMR data into a clear set of requirements for the unknown 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄. All four candidates match this formula.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two signals**, both of which are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **1:1**.\n    *   **Implication:** This means the mixture contains two compounds, and each contributes a set of aromatic protons in a different chemical environment. Because the mixture is 1:1 and the signal ratio is 1:1, the number of protons giving rise to each of the two singlets must be identical.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are **three signals**, all of which are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (Singlets):** The fact that all signals are singlets is a crucial clue. It means none of the alkyl protons are subject to spin-spin splitting from adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This immediately rules out structures containing groups like ethyl (-CH₂CH₃), which would produce quartets and triplets.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Integration):** In a 1:1 mixture of C₁₀H₁₄ isomers where the alkyl portion consists of four methyl groups, there are a total of 12 (from compound 1) + 12 (from compound 2) = 24 alkyl protons. A 2:1:1 ratio for 24 protons corresponds to three signals with absolute integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. We must find the mixture that produces exactly these signals.\n\n### **2. Predict the Spectra for the Individual Compounds**\n\nThe key to solving the problem is to accurately predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each candidate based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Analysis:** This compound has two ethyl groups. As identified in Careful Point 1, the adjacent -CH₂- and -CH₃ protons will split each other, producing a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This contradicts the data. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is eliminated**. This immediately rules out **Option D**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent and isolated. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent due to symmetry. They appear as **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2/C3 are also equivalent. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through atoms C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the one at C2 (3H), and the one at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with a ratio of 6H:3H:3H (or 2:1:1 for the pure compound).\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test the remaining combinations (Options A, B, and C) to see which 1:1 mixture matches the experimental data.\n\n**Target Spectrum:**\n1.  **Aromatic:** Two 1:1 singlets (this is satisfied by a mixture of any two of the tetramethylbenzene isomers, as they each give one 2H singlet).\n2.  **Alkyl:** Three singlets with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Prehnitene contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   The combined spectrum would not match the {12H, 6H, 6H} requirement. It lacks a 12H signal and contains 3H signals.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Durene contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   The combined spectrum would have four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which contradicts the observation of three signals.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Durene contributes: **one 12H singlet**.\n    *   Prehnitene contributes: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   The combined spectrum gives exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n    *   The ratio of these signals is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match for the alkyl region data. The aromatic region is also a perfect match.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, precisely accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on a synthesis and validation of the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the ¹H NMR Data**\nFirst, we must establish a clear set of structural requirements based on the experimental data provided for the 1:1 molar mixture.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two signals**, both are **singlets**, with an equal **1:1 integration ratio**.\n    *   This implies the mixture contains two compounds with different aromatic proton environments.\n    *   Since it's a 1:1 mixture and the signal ratio is 1:1, the number of protons creating the first signal is equal to the number of protons creating the second signal.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are **three signals**, all are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: The \"singlet\" multiplicity is a critical clue.** All agents correctly recognize this. It means the alkyl protons are not subject to spin-spin splitting from adjacent, non-equivalent protons.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Interpreting the integration.** The total number of alkyl protons in a 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers is 24 (12 from each molecule, since each has 2 aromatic protons). A 2:1:1 ratio represents 4 total parts (2+1+1=4). Therefore, the actual number of protons for each signal is (2/4)×24H = **12H**, (1/4)×24H = **6H**, and (1/4)×24H = **6H**.\n\n### **2. Analysis of the Candidate Compounds**\n\nThe core of the problem, addressed by all candidate answers, is to predict the spectrum of each individual compound and see how they combine.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Analysis:** This compound contains two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). Protons on adjacent carbons in an ethyl group will split each other, producing a characteristic **quartet** and **triplet** in the alkyl region.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This directly contradicts the \"all singlets\" data. There is a unanimous consensus among all provided answers that **1,4-diethylbenzene can be definitively ruled out.** This eliminates option **C**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** One aromatic singlet (2H) and **one alkyl singlet (12H)**. There is a unanimous consensus on this prediction.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** One aromatic singlet (2H) and **two alkyl singlets (6H each)**. There is a unanimous consensus on this prediction.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Analysis:** This molecule is asymmetric.\n    *   **Predicted Spectrum:** Two aromatic singlets (1H each) and four alkyl singlets (3H each).\n    *   **Careful Point 3:** Many agents incorrectly assign a plane of symmetry to this molecule. However, regardless of the fine details, they all correctly conclude that a mixture containing isodurene would not produce the required alkyl signal pattern.\n\n### **3. Evaluation of the Mixture Options**\n\nThe decisive step is to find the pair that combines to form three alkyl singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Options containing 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** (Option A and B)\n    *   Neither Durene nor Prehnitene, when mixed with Isodurene, can produce the required combination of three alkyl signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. For instance, a mixture of Durene (one 12H singlet) and Isodurene (four 3H singlets) would result in five signals. The reasoning across all candidate answers supports this incompatibility.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB (Durene) provides **one singlet of 12H**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB (Prehnitene) provides **two singlets of 6H each**.\n    *   **Combined Result:** The mixture produces exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies perfectly to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** Both compounds give one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this correctly results in two distinct signals with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### **Final Decision Synthesis**\n\nWhile the final letter choices from the agents are scattered, this is due to clear inconsistencies between their reasoning and their final output letter. A systematic analysis of the *reasoning* within all 15 candidate answers reveals a **unanimous logical conclusion**: the only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This pair corresponds to option D in the question prompt.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer by synthesizing the reasoning from the provided agent answers and conducting a rigorous check.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectral Information\n\nFirst, we must establish a clear set of requirements from the provided ¹H NMR data for the 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula**: Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄ isomers. All four candidates fit this description.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm)**:\n    *   **Three signals**: The mixture contains three distinct chemical environments for alkyl protons.\n    *   **All signals are singlets**: This is a critical constraint. It means that none of the alkyl protons are subject to spin-spin splitting from adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This immediately rules out structures with coupled protons, such as ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃), which would produce a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   **Integration ratio of 2:1:1**: Since it is a 1:1 mixture of isomers each containing 12 alkyl protons (4 x CH₃), the total number of alkyl protons in the sample is 24. A 2:1:1 ratio represents a total of 4 parts (2+1+1). Therefore, the absolute number of protons for each signal is:\n        *   (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    The mixture's alkyl spectrum must contain three singlets with integrations corresponding to 12 protons, 6 protons, and 6 protons.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm)**:\n    *   **Two signals**: The two compounds in the mixture have different chemical environments for their aromatic protons.\n    *   **Both signals are singlets**: The aromatic protons in each compound are \"isolated\" and not split by neighbors.\n    *   **Integration ratio of 1:1**: As the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, this means that the number of protons contributing to each of the two aromatic signals is identical.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound\n\nWe must predict the spectrum of each individual compound to understand its contribution to the mixture.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**:\n    *   **Analysis**: This molecule contains two ethyl groups. Due to proton-proton coupling, these groups would produce a characteristic **quartet** and a **triplet** in the alkyl region.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This directly contradicts the experimental data stating that all alkyl signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be definitively eliminated**. This immediately rules out **Option C**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: High (two perpendicular planes of symmetry).\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: One plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 are equivalent, and the pair at C2/C3 are also equivalent. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: One plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons at C4 and C6 are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This produces **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Mixtures\n\nWe are looking for a 1:1 mixture that matches the required spectrum: two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets (corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H). The alkyl region is the most decisive.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl Signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Alkyl Signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined Result: **Four** total signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl Signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Alkyl Signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined Result: At least four signals (or more), and does not produce the 12H:6H:6H pattern. This does not match.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Check**: 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this creates **two distinct singlets**, each representing 2 protons, which matches the **1:1 ratio** requirement.\n    *   **Alkyl Check**:\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides: **one singlet (12H)**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides: **two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   **Combined Result**: The mixture has exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches all experimental data.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis overwhelmingly confirms that the only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, precisely accounts for all the features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This combination explains the two 1:1 aromatic singlets and, critically, the three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the ¹H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nFirst, let's establish the requirements based on the experimental data for the 1:1 molar mixture:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C₁₀H₁₄. All four listed compounds meet this requirement.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are **three signals**, all are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n    *   **\"All singlets\"** is a critical constraint. The protons creating these signals do not experience spin-spin splitting from adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This strongly suggests the alkyl groups are methyl groups not adjacent to other non-equivalent protons. It effectively rules out groups like ethyl (-CH₂CH₃), which would produce a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   The **2:1:1 integration ratio** represents the relative number of protons. Since the mixture is 1:1 and each C₁₀H₁₄ isomer has 12 alkyl protons (from four methyl groups), the total alkyl protons in the sample are 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio (4 total parts) for 24 protons corresponds to three signals with absolute integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two signals**, both are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **1:1**.\n    *   Since it is a 1:1 mixture and the signals have a 1:1 ratio, each compound must contribute one signal, and those signals must arise from an equal number of protons (likely 2 protons each, since they are disubstituted benzenes).\n\n### **2. Prediction of the Spectra for the Individual Candidate Compounds**\n\nNext, we must predict the individual ¹H NMR spectrum for each candidate based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has two ethyl groups. As established above, this would produce a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region, not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be **immediately ruled out**. This eliminates **Option A**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one aromatic singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one alkyl singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes protons and methyl groups equivalent in pairs.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one aromatic singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This results in **two alkyl singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule also has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are chemically equivalent, producing **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This produces **three alkyl singlets** (with a 2:1:1 ratio for this pure compound).\n\n### **3. Evaluation of the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which remaining 1:1 mixture (Options B, C, D) fits the spectral data. The alkyl region is the most decisive factor. We are looking for a combination of signals that results in exactly three singlets with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out due to 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   `1,2,4,5-TMB` contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   `1,2,3,5-TMB` contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined Result: This mixture would show four alkyl signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match the observed three signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   `1,2,3,4-TMB` contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   `1,2,3,5-TMB` contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined Result: This mixture would not produce a 12H signal and would contain 3H signals, which is inconsistent with the required 12H, 6H, 6H pattern. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** `1,2,4,5-TMB` provides **one singlet of 12H**. `1,2,3,4-TMB` provides **two singlets of 6H each**.\n    *   **Combined Result:** The mixture produces exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the alkyl region data.\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** Each compound provides one 2H singlet. A mixture gives two distinct 2H singlets, resulting in the correct 1:1 integration ratio. This also matches.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is the 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Spectral Data**\n\nFirst, let's establish a clear set of requirements from the provided experimental data for the 1:1 mixture:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄. All four candidate compounds match this.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two signals**, both are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **1:1**.\n    *   **Implication:** This means the mixture contains two compounds, each contributing a distinct aromatic signal. Since the mixture is 1:1 molar and the signal ratio is 1:1, the number of protons giving rise to each signal must be identical.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are **three signals**, all are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Key Constraint:** The signals being all **singlets** is a critical clue. It rules out any structure that would exhibit spin-spin splitting (coupling) in the alkyl region, such as an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃), which produces a characteristic quartet and a triplet.\n    *   **Integration Calculation:** In a 1:1 mixture of C₁₀H₁₄ isomers, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 (from compound A) + 12 (from compound B) = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio (4 total parts) for 24 protons corresponds to three signals with absolute integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Individual Candidate Compounds**\n\nThe core of the problem is to accurately predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each isomer based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This molecule contains two ethyl groups. As established above, this would produce a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region due to proton-proton coupling.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This directly contradicts the \"all singlets\" data. This compound can be **immediately ruled out**, which eliminates **Option D**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at C-3 and C-6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one aromatic singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one alkyl singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at C-5 and C-6) are chemically equivalent. Equivalent protons do not split each other, so they appear as **one aromatic singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are two distinct sets of equivalent methyl groups: the pair at C-1/C-4 and the pair at C-2/C-3. This results in **two alkyl singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C-2 and C-5.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons at C-4 and C-6 are equivalent due to symmetry. They produce **one aromatic singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C-1/C-3 (6H), the unique one at C-2 (3H), and the unique one at C-5 (3H). This results in **three alkyl singlets** with a 6H:3H:3H integration (a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nWe now test which 1:1 mixture of the three remaining tetramethylbenzene isomers matches the required spectral data. The decision will be based on the alkyl region signals, which must combine to give three signals with 12H, 6H, and 6H integrations.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Prehnitene contributes: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   **Result:** This combination would contain 3H signals, which is not consistent with the required 12H, 6H, and 6H pattern. Incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Durene contributes: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene contributes: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   **Result:** This combination would produce four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which contradicts the observation of three signals. Incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signal Check:** Durene provides one 2H singlet. Prehnitene provides another 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this correctly produces **two aromatic singlets** with a **1:1 ratio** (2H:2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Signal Check:**\n        *   Durene provides: **one 12H singlet**.\n        *   Prehnitene provides: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   **Result:** The combination results in exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair that precisely accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct mixture of compounds based on the provided NMR data.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Spectral Information\n\nFirst, we must establish a clear set of requirements from the provided ¹H NMR data for the 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):**\n    *   There are **two signals**, both of which are **singlets**. This means the mixture contains two compounds with different aromatic proton environments, and these protons are isolated (no adjacent, non-equivalent proton neighbors).\n    *   The signals have a **1:1 integration ratio**. Since it's a 1:1 molar mixture, this implies that the number of protons giving rise to each of the two signals is identical.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):**\n    *   There are **three signals**, and critically, all are **singlets**. This is a major clue that rules out structures with alkyl groups that would show spin-spin splitting.\n    *   The signals have a **2:1:1 integration ratio**. In a 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers (assuming they are tetramethylbenzenes), the total number of alkyl protons is 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio (4 total parts) for 24 protons corresponds to three signals with absolute integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n### 2. Analyze Individual Candidate Compounds\n\nThe core of the problem is to accurately predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each isomer based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Eliminating 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Structure:** This compound has two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Prediction:** Protons on the adjacent -CH₂- and -CH₃ groups will split each other, producing a characteristic **quartet** and a **triplet** in the alkyl region.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This directly contradicts the experimental data, which states all alkyl signals are **singlets**. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene can be **immediately ruled out**, and any option containing it is incorrect. This eliminates **Option D**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two distinct sets of equivalent methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique one at C2 (3H), and the unique one at C5 (3H). This produces three singlets with a 6H:3H:3H integration (a 2:1:1 ratio for this pure compound).\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options\n\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture of the remaining candidates (the three tetramethylbenzene isomers) fits the spectral data. The alkyl region is the most informative, as we are looking for a combination that produces three signals integrating to **12H, 6H, and 6H**.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined result: This mixture would produce **four** signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Alkyl signals from 1,2,3,5-TMB: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined result: This mixture would not produce the required 12H signal.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB provides **one singlet (12H)**. 1,2,3,4-TMB provides **two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   **Combined Result:** The mixture results in exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** Each compound gives one 2H aromatic singlet. A mixture gives two distinct 2H signals, correctly matching the 1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is the 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct mixture of compounds.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Spectral Data\nThe problem provides key spectral information for a 1:1 molar mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both are singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nThere are two critical constraints derived from this data:\n*   **\"All singlets\" in the alkyl region:** This indicates the absence of proton-proton spin coupling in the alkyl groups. This is a powerful clue for eliminating structures.\n*   **The 2:1:1 alkyl integration ratio:** For a 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ isomers (where the alkyl groups are methyls, having 12 protons each), the total number of alkyl protons is 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio for 24 protons corresponds to three signals with absolute integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. (Calculation: 2x + 1x + 1x = 24 → 4x = 24 → x = 6. The signals are 2x=12H, 1x=6H, 1x=6H).\n\n### 2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds\n\nNext, we must predict the individual ¹H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds based on its structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule contains ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). The protons within an ethyl group are adjacent and non-equivalent, causing spin-spin splitting. This would produce a characteristic **quartet** and **triplet** in the alkyl region.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This directly contradicts the experimental data stating all alkyl signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be definitively ruled out**. This eliminates **Option B**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at positions 3 and 6) are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to symmetry, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at positions 5 and 6) are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at positions 4 and 6) are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique methyl at C2 (3H), and the unique methyl at C5 (3H). This produces **three singlets (one 6H and two 3H)**.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Candidate Mixtures\n\nWe must now find which pair of the remaining compounds (the three tetramethylbenzene isomers) combines to produce the required spectrum: three alkyl singlets with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   Combined alkyl signals: (two 6H singlets) + (one 6H and two 3H singlets). This mixture does not produce a 12H signal and contains 3H signals. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB**\n    *   Combined alkyl signals: (one 12H singlet) + (one 6H and two 3H singlets). This results in four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H), which does not match the observed three signals. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals from 1,2,4,5-TMB:** **One 12H singlet**.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals from 1,2,3,4-TMB:** **Two 6H singlets**.\n    *   **Combined Result:** The mixture produces exactly **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **This is a perfect match.** The aromatic region also matches, as each compound gives one 2H singlet, leading to two 1:1 signals in the mixture.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only pair of compounds whose 1:1 mixture perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of the ¹H NMR data and a comparison with the predicted spectra for the candidate compounds and their mixtures.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectral Information**\n\nFirst, let's establish a clear set of requirements from the provided ¹H NMR data for the 1:1 mixture:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C₁₀H₁₄. All four candidates fit this.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both are singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Implication:** A 1:1 molar mixture giving two signals with a 1:1 integration ratio means that each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and those signals arise from an equal number of protons. Given the structures are all C₁₀H₁₄, this corresponds to two distinct 2H signals.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Key Constraint 1 (Singlets):** The fact that all signals are singlets is critical. It indicates there is no spin-spin coupling between adjacent, non-equivalent protons in the alkyl groups. This rules out structures like ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃), which would produce quartets and triplets.\n    *   **Key Constraint 2 (Integration):** In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 (from compound A) + 12 (from compound B) = 24. A 2:1:1 integration ratio (4 total parts) for 24 protons corresponds to three signals with absolute integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. (Calculation: 2x + 1x + 1x = 24 → 4x = 24 → x = 6).\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nThe core of the problem is accurately predicting the spectrum for each isomer based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has two ethyl groups. As established above, this would produce a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region, not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be **immediately eliminated**. Any option containing it is incorrect. This rules out option **B**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at C-3 and C-6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one aromatic singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one alkyl singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes pairs of protons and methyl groups equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons (at C-5 and C-6) are chemically equivalent. They will appear as **one aromatic singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are two distinct sets of equivalent methyl groups: the pair at C-1/C-4 and the pair at C-2/C-3. This results in **two alkyl singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C-2 and C-5.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** The two protons at C-4 and C-6 are equivalent due to symmetry. They produce **one aromatic singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C-1/C-3 (6H), the unique one at C-2 (3H), and the unique one at C-5 (3H). This results in **three alkyl singlets** with a 6H:3H:3H integration, which simplifies to a 2:1:1 ratio for this single compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture of the remaining compounds (Durene, Prehnitene, Isodurene) satisfies the spectral data, paying close attention to the alkyl signals which must combine to give three peaks integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Alkyl Signals: Durene (one 12H singlet) + Isodurene (one 6H, two 3H singlets).\n    *   Result: This mixture would show four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). **This is incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Result: Already ruled out due to 1,4-diethylbenzene. **This is incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Durene provides one 2H singlet. Prehnitene provides one 2H singlet. The 1:1 mixture correctly produces two aromatic singlets with a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene provides **one 12H singlet**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene provides **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   Result: The combination results in exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is a perfect match.**\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Alkyl Signals: Prehnitene (two 6H singlets) + Isodurene (one 6H, two 3H singlets).\n    *   Result: This mixture would show multiple signals including 3H peaks and would not match the required 12H, 6H, 6H pattern. **This is incorrect.**\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe only pair of compounds whose 1:1 mixture precisely accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum (two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets) is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step deduction based on the provided ¹H NMR spectral data.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the ¹H NMR Data and Identify Key Constraints\n\nFirst, we deconstruct the information given for the 1:1 molar mixture:\n*   **Molecular Formula**: Both compounds are C₁₀H₁₄.\n*   **Aromatic Region**: The spectrum has **two signals**, both are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **1:1**.\n*   **Alkyl Region**: The spectrum has **three signals**, all are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n\nFrom this, we can establish several crucial constraints:\n1.  **Alkyl Signals are Singlets**: This is a powerful clue. The absence of splitting (like quartets or triplets) means the alkyl protons are not coupled to adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This strongly suggests the alkyl groups are methyls on a substituted ring and rules out groups like ethyl (-CH₂CH₃), which exhibit splitting.\n2.  **Alkyl Integration**: In a 1:1 mixture of two C₁₀H₁₄ tetramethylbenzene isomers, there are a total of 12 + 12 = 24 alkyl protons. A 2:1:1 integration ratio (4 total parts) corresponds to signals with absolute integrations of:\n    *   (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n    *   (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    *   (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    Our target mixture must produce these three specific signals.\n3.  **Aromatic Signals**: A 1:1 mixture producing two singlets in a 1:1 ratio implies that each compound gives one aromatic signal, and those signals arise from an equal number of protons (in this case, 2 protons each).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each Candidate Compound Individually\n\nNext, we predict the individual ¹H NMR spectrum for each candidate based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**: As identified in Step 1, the ethyl groups in this molecule would produce a **quartet** and a **triplet** in the alkyl region due to proton-proton coupling. This contradicts the \"all singlets\" data.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound is immediately eliminated. This rules out option **C**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**: This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: The four methyl groups are all equivalent, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are two distinct sets of methyl groups (the C1/C4 pair and the C2/C3 pair), producing **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**: This molecule also has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum**: The two protons are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum**: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups (the C1/C3 pair, the unique C2, and the unique C5), producing **three singlets (one 6H and two 3H)**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Possible Mixture Combinations\n\nWe must find the pair of compounds whose individual spectra combine to match the experimental data (three alkyl singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H).\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Combined alkyl signals: One 12H singlet (from durene) + three singlets of 6H, 3H, 3H (from isodurene). This results in four signals. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   Combined alkyl signals: Two 6H singlets (from prehnitene) + three singlets of 6H, 3H, 3H (from isodurene). This combination results in at least four signals and does not have a 12H signal. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals**:\n        *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes **one singlet of 12H**.\n        *   1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes **two singlets of 6H each**.\n    *   **Combined Result**: The mixture has exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies perfectly to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Aromatic Check**: Each compound provides one 2H aromatic singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this creates two distinct singlets, each integrating to 2H, matching the required 1:1 ratio.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only mixture that perfectly accounts for all features of the ¹H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate answers and a thorough review of the chemical principles involved.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Spectral Data\nThe problem provides crucial information about a 1:1 molar mixture of two isomers with the formula C₁₀H₁₄.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are **two singlets** with a **1:1 integration ratio**. This indicates the two compounds in the mixture have different aromatic proton environments. Because it's a 1:1 mixture with 1:1 signal integration, the number of protons giving rise to each signal must be identical.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are **three singlets** with a **2:1:1 integration ratio**. This is the most informative part of the data.\n    *   **Careful Point 1 (Singlet Multiplicity):** The fact that all signals are singlets is a critical constraint. It means none of the alkyl protons are subject to spin-spin splitting from adjacent, non-equivalent protons. This is characteristic of isolated methyl groups attached to a benzene ring.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Integration Ratio):** Each compound has the formula C₁₀H₁₄. For the tetramethylbenzene isomers, there are 12 alkyl protons (4 x CH₃). In a 1:1 mixture, the total number of alkyl protons is 12 + 12 = 24. A 2:1:1 ratio (4 total parts) for 24 protons corresponds to signals with absolute integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. Our task is to find a pair of compounds whose signals combine to give this exact pattern.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Individual Candidate Compounds\nWe must predict the ¹H NMR spectrum for each potential compound based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n1.  **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound contains ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). The adjacent protons would cause spin-spin splitting, producing a characteristic **quartet** (for the CH₂) and **triplet** (for the CH₃). This contradicts the \"all singlets\" data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound can be immediately eliminated. Option A, which contains 1,4-diethylbenzene, is incorrect.\n\n2.  **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons (at C3, C6) are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n3.  **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons (at C5, C6) are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** There are two distinct sets of methyl groups: (the pair at C1/C4) and (the pair at C2/C3). This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n4.  **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons (at C4, C6) are chemically equivalent. They produce **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the C1/C3 pair (6H), the C2 methyl (3H), and the C5 methyl (3H). This results in **three singlets** (integrating to 6H, 3H, 3H).\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options\nWe must find the pair of compounds from the options that, when mixed 1:1, produces the required spectrum: two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets (with 12H, 6H, and 6H integration).\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** Ruled out due to 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n*   **Option B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Durene provides: one 12H singlet.\n    *   Isodurene provides: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined Result: Four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match the observed three signals.\n\n*   **Option D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Prehnitene provides: two 6H singlets.\n    *   Isodurene provides: one 6H singlet and two 3H singlets.\n    *   Combined Result: This would have signals at 6H and 3H, but it would be missing the required 12H signal.\n\n*   **Option C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Check:** Durene gives one 2H singlet. Prehnitene gives one 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture creates two distinct signals, each integrating to 2H. This perfectly matches the **two singlets, 1:1 ratio** requirement.\n    *   **Alkyl Check:**\n        *   Durene provides **one singlet (12H)**.\n        *   Prehnitene provides **two singlets (6H each)**.\n    *   Combined Result: The mixture has exactly **three singlets** with integrations of **12H, 6H, and 6H**. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This is a perfect match.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** is the only option that directly and perfectly accounts for all features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct mixture of compounds based on the provided spectral data.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Spectral Information**\n\nFirst, we must translate the information from the ¹H NMR spectrum into a set of concrete requirements for our two-component mixture.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula and Ratio**: We have a 1:1 molar mixture of two isomers with the formula C₁₀H₁₄.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm)**: There are two signals, both are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **1:1**.\n    *   *Careful Point*: A 1:1 mixture giving two signals in a 1:1 ratio means each compound contributes one aromatic signal, and those signals arise from an equal number of protons. Since the candidates are disubstituted benzenes, they have either 2 or 4 aromatic protons. In this case, each signal almost certainly represents 2H.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm)**: There are three signals, all are **singlets**, with a **2:1:1** integration ratio.\n    *   *Careful Point 1*: The fact that all signals are **singlets** is a critical constraint. It rules out any structure that would exhibit spin-spin coupling in the alkyl region, such as an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃), which would produce a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   *Careful Point 2*: We must calculate the absolute number of protons for the 2:1:1 ratio. Since each C₁₀H₁₄ isomer is a tetramethylbenzene, each has 12 alkyl protons. In a 1:1 mixture, the total is 24 alkyl protons. The ratio 2:1:1 has 4 total parts (2+1+1). Therefore, the number of protons per signal is:\n        *   Signal 1 (2 parts): (2/4) * 24H = **12H**\n        *   Signal 2 (1 part): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n        *   Signal 3 (1 part): (1/4) * 24H = **6H**\n    The mixture must have three alkyl singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Individual Candidate Compounds**\n\nNext, we predict the individual ¹H NMR spectrum for each isomer based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**:\n    *   This compound contains ethyl groups. As noted above, this would produce a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region, not singlets.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This compound can be **immediately ruled out**. This eliminates **Option C**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule is highly symmetrical with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons**: The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons**: All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons**: The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons**: There are two distinct sets of equivalent methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This results in **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**:\n    *   **Symmetry**: This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C2 and C5.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons**: The two protons at C4 and C6 are equivalent, producing **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons**: There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the single methyl at C2 (3H), and the single methyl at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture fits the spectral data. The deciding factor is the alkyl region, which must produce three singlets corresponding to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals**: 1,2,3,4-TMB (two 6H singlets) + 1,2,3,5-TMB (one 6H, two 3H singlets).\n    *   **Result**: The mixture would contain multiple 6H signals and two 3H signals. It would not contain the required 12H signal. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals**:\n        *   From 1,2,4,5-TMB: **one 12H singlet**.\n        *   From 1,2,3,4-TMB: **two 6H singlets**.\n    *   **Result**: The combination results in exactly **three alkyl singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This is a perfect match**.\n    *   **Aromatic Check**: Each compound produces a distinct 2H singlet. A 1:1 mixture gives two 2H singlets, which is the required 1:1 ratio. **This also matches perfectly**.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals**: 1,2,4,5-TMB (one 12H singlet) + 1,2,3,5-TMB (one 6H, two 3H singlets).\n    *   **Result**: The mixture would have four signals (12H, 6H, 3H, 3H). This does not match the observed three signals. **Incorrect**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair that precisely accounts for all the features of the described ¹H NMR spectrum—two 1:1 aromatic singlets and three 2:1:1 alkyl singlets (with absolute integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H)—is the 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
