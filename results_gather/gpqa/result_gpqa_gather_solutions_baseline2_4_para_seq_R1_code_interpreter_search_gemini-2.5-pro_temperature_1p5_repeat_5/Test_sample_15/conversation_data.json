A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. For a specific substance to be optically active, it must not only be chiral but also be present as a single enantiomer or as a non-racemic (unequal) mixture of enantiomers. The names provided, which include stereochemical descriptors like (R), (S), or specific isomer names, imply that we are considering a pure sample of that stereoisomer, which will be optically active if the molecule itself is chiral.\n\nThe key condition for chirality is the absence of internal symmetry elements, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n**Analysis of each compound:**\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is an alkene. The atoms of the carbon-carbon double bond and the atoms directly attached to them are coplanar. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule, making it achiral.\n    *   **Verdict**: Optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`, which specify the absolute configuration at two chiral centers. The molecule itself is complex and lacks symmetry. By naming a single, specific enantiomer of a chiral compound, we confirm it is optically active.\n    *   **Verdict**: Optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3) with identical substituents (`-H`, `-CH3`, `-COOH`). When the stereocenters in such a molecule have opposite configurations (`R` and `S`), the result is a *meso* compound. A meso compound has an internal element of symmetry (a plane or center of inversion) and is therefore achiral, despite having stereocenters.\n    *   **Verdict**: Optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` isomer has stereocenters with the same configuration, which breaks the internal symmetry. The molecule is chiral, having a non-superimposable mirror image, the `(2S,3S)` isomer. Since a single enantiomer is named, it is optically active.\n    *   **Verdict**: Optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 (C1) is a stereocenter. It is attached to four different groups: 1) a hydrogen atom, 2) a hydroxyl group (`-OH`), 3) the path around the ring toward the double bond (`-CH2-CH=`), and 4) the path around the ring away from the double bond (`-CH=CH-CH2-`). The name specifies a single enantiomer `(R)` of this chiral molecule.\n    *   **Verdict**: Optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This symmetrically substituted cyclohexane is an achiral molecule. The all-*cis* isomer (implied by the `s` notation for stereorelationship) has three planes of symmetry, each passing through one hydroxyl group and the opposite CH₂ group. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Verdict**: Optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: Examining the structure, `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`, we look for chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. No other chiral centers exist in the molecule. It is achiral.\n    *   **Verdict**: Optically **inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCounting the compounds that were determined to be optically active:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.

Any molecule possessing a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Verdict**: **Optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`, which specify the absolute configuration at two chiral centers. This indicates a single enantiomer of a complex, chiral molecule is being considered. A pure sample of a single enantiomer is by definition optically active.\n    *   **Verdict**: **Optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two identically substituted stereocenters. The `(2R,3S)` configuration describes the *meso* form of the compound. Meso compounds have chiral centers but are achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry (e.g., a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion).\n    *   **Verdict**: **Optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` isomer lacks internal symmetry and is therefore chiral. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the `(2S,3S)` isomer. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is optically active.\n    *   **Verdict**: **Optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is bonded to four different groups: an `-OH` group, an `-H` atom, and the two distinct paths around the ring (`-CH2-CH=` versus `-CH=CH-CH2-`). This makes C1 a stereocenter. The `(R)` in the name specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral molecule.\n    *   **Verdict**: **Optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This molecule has a high degree of symmetry. The 1,3,5 substitution pattern on the ring ensures that, regardless of the chair conformation, the molecule will have a plane of symmetry. For instance, the all-*cis* isomer possesses multiple planes of symmetry. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Verdict**: **Optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An inspection of the structure shows no stereocenters. The carbon atom at position 3 of the butanone chain is bonded to two identical methyl groups (`-CH(CH3)2`), so it is not a chiral center. The molecule as a whole lacks any chiral elements.\n    *   **Verdict**: **Optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCounting the compounds determined to be optically active:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. For a specific substance to be optically active, it must not only be chiral but also be present as a single enantiomer or as a non-racemic (unequal) mixture of enantiomers. The names provided, which include stereochemical descriptors like (R), (S), or specific isomer names, imply that we are considering a pure sample of that stereoisomer, which will be optically active if the molecule itself is chiral.\n\nThe key condition for chirality is the absence of internal symmetry elements, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n**Analysis of each compound:**\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is an alkene. The atoms of the carbon-carbon double bond and the atoms directly attached to them are coplanar. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule, making it achiral.\n    *   **Verdict**: Optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name includes stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`, which specify the absolute configuration at two chiral centers. The molecule itself is complex and lacks symmetry. By naming a single, specific enantiomer of a chiral compound, we confirm it is optically active.\n    *   **Verdict**: Optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two stereocenters (at C2 and C3) with identical substituents (`-H`, `-CH3`, `-COOH`). When the stereocenters in such a molecule have opposite configurations (`R` and `S`), the result is a *meso* compound. A meso compound has an internal element of symmetry (a plane or center of inversion) and is therefore achiral, despite having stereocenters.\n    *   **Verdict**: Optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` isomer has stereocenters with the same configuration, which breaks the internal symmetry. The molecule is chiral, having a non-superimposable mirror image, the `(2S,3S)` isomer. Since a single enantiomer is named, it is optically active.\n    *   **Verdict**: Optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 (C1) is a stereocenter. It is attached to four different groups: 1) a hydrogen atom, 2) a hydroxyl group (`-OH`), 3) the path around the ring toward the double bond (`-CH2-CH=`), and 4) the path around the ring away from the double bond (`-CH=CH-CH2-`). The name specifies a single enantiomer `(R)` of this chiral molecule.\n    *   **Verdict**: Optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This symmetrically substituted cyclohexane is an achiral molecule. The all-*cis* isomer (implied by the `s` notation for stereorelationship) has three planes of symmetry, each passing through one hydroxyl group and the opposite CH₂ group. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Verdict**: Optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: Examining the structure, `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`, we look for chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to two identical methyl groups, so it is not a chiral center. No other chiral centers exist in the molecule. It is achiral.\n    *   **Verdict**: Optically **inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCounting the compounds that were determined to be optically active:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.

A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This generally means the molecule lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. The specific naming conventions used in the question (e.g., (R), (S), (3aR,7aS)) imply that we are considering a pure sample of that specific stereoisomer.\n\n**Analysis of Each Compound:**\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule is an alkene. The atoms of the double bond and the atoms directly attached to them are coplanar. This plane of the molecule serves as a plane of symmetry, which makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically **inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The IUPAC name includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This notation specifies the absolute configuration at specific chiral centers.

Since the name specifies a single, non-meso enantiomer of a chiral molecule, a pure sample is by definition optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically **active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule possesses two stereocenters (at C2 and C3) with identical substituents. The `(2R,3S)` configuration describes a *meso* compound. A meso compound has chiral centers but is achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry (a plane or center of inversion).\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically **inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound. The `(2R,3R)` isomer lacks internal symmetry and is therefore chiral. Its mirror image is the non-superimposable `(2S,3S)` isomer. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically **active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1 is a stereocenter because it is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, and the two different paths around the ring containing the double bond. The name `(R)` specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically **active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This symmetrically substituted cyclohexane molecule possesses a plane of symmetry regardless of its specific stereoisomer. For instance, the all-cis isomer has three planes of symmetry. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically **inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: A structural analysis shows no stereocenters. The carbon in the isopropyl group (`CH(CH₃)₂`) is attached to two identical methyl groups. The molecule is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Optically **inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nCounting the optically active compounds identified:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds.\n\nMatching this count to the provided options:\nA) 4\nB) 2\nC) 5\nD) 3\n\nThe correct answer is 3, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
