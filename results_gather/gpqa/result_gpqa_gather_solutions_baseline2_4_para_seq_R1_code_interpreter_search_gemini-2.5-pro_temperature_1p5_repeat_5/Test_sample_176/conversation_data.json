This links luminosity to the star's radius ($R$) and surface temperature ($T$).\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law**: The surface temperature ($T$) of a black body is inversely proportional to the *intrinsic* wavelength at which it emits most of its light ($\\lambda_{rest}$). Therefore, $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{rest}$.\n    *   **Doppler Effect**: The *observed* wavelength of light ($\\lambda_{obs}$) is shifted from its intrinsic wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$) due to the source's radial velocity ($v$). For a source moving away, the non-relativistic formula is $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest}(1 + v/c)$.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**: Using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, the ratio of luminosities is:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n4.  **Incorporate the Radius Ratio**: The problem states $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$. Substituting this into the formula gives:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio**: This is the most complex step and requires combining Wien's Law and the Doppler Effect.\n    *   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *intrinsic* wavelength ratio: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}}$.\n    *   We are given that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n    *   For Star 1 (stationary, $v_1=0$), there is no Doppler shift: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{rest,1}$.\n    *   For Star 2 (receding, $v_2=700$ km/s), its light is redshifted: $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Equating the observed wavelengths: $\\lambda_{rest,1} = \\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Rearranging this gives the required intrinsic wavelength ratio: $\\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation**: Substitute the derived temperature ratio back into the luminosity equation from Step 4:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $$\n    Using the given values $v_2 = 700$ km/s and the speed of light $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700}{300,000}\\right)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333...)^4} \\approx 2.2291 $$\n    Rounding this result to two decimal places gives **2.23**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The mass ratio ($M_1/M_2 = 1.5$) is irrelevant for calculating the luminosity of black bodies and should be ignored. All successful candidate answers correctly identified this as a distractor.\n*   **Intrinsic vs. Observed Wavelengths**: The central point of the problem is realizing that Wien's law relates temperature to the *intrinsic* (rest-frame) wavelength, while the data given is about the *observed* wavelength. The Doppler effect must be used to connect them.\n*   **Logical Estimation**: The radius ratio contributes a factor of $1.5^2 = 2.25$ to the luminosity ratio. Because Star 2 is moving away, for its observed color to match the stationary Star 1, it must be intrinsically hotter ($T_2 > T_1$). This means the temperature ratio term $(T_1/T_2)^4$ is less than 1, so the final answer must be slightly less than 2.25. This immediately makes answers ~2.32 and ~2.35 incorrect and favors ~2.23.\n*   **Consensus on Numerical Value**: Despite the options being shuffled for different candidate agents, every agent that performed the calculation correctly arrived at the same numerical value of approximately 2.229.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe thorough analysis of the physics confirms that the luminosity ratio is ~2.229, which rounds to **2.23**. This matches option D in the original problem statement.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question based on a synthesis of the provided answers.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Key Information**\nThe question asks for the luminosity ratio, $L_1/L_2$, between two stars.\n*   **Given**:\n    *   Radius Ratio: $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$\n    *   Radial Velocity of Star 1: $v_1 = 0$ km/s\n    *   Radial Velocity of Star 2: $v_2 = 700$ km/s\n    *   Observation: The *observed* wavelengths of peak brightness are the same ($\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$).\n    *   Assumption: The stars radiate as black bodies.\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The mass ratio ($M_1 = 1.5 M_2$) is not relevant for calculating the luminosity of a black body using the Stefan-Boltzmann law and is a distractor.\n\n**2. Identify and Apply Relevant Physical Principles**\nThree core principles of physics are needed, and there is a strong consensus among the candidate answers on their application:\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: A star's luminosity ($L$) is related to its radius ($R$) and temperature ($T$) by the formula $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$. The ratio of luminosities is therefore:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law**: A black body's temperature ($T$) is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$). This means the temperature ratio can be expressed as:\n    $$ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}} $$\n\n*   **Doppler Effect**: The observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) is shifted from the intrinsic wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$) due to radial velocity ($v$). For a source moving away, the shift is given by $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest}(1 + v/c)$.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Derivation**\nThe derivation below is the consensus path from the candidate answers.\n\n*   **Step 1: Incorporate the Radius Ratio.**\n    Substitute the given $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$ into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** At this stage, we can perform a logical check. If the temperatures were the same, the answer would be exactly 2.25. The final answer will be adjusted by the temperature term.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the Temperature Ratio.**\n    This is the most critical part, connecting the Doppler effect with the temperature.\n    1.  The crucial given information is that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n    2.  For Star_1, its velocity is zero, so there's no Doppler shift: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{rest,1}$.\n    3.  For Star_2, its light is redshifted due to its velocity: $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    4.  Setting the observed wavelengths equal gives: $\\lambda_{rest,1} = \\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    5.  We need the ratio $\\lambda_{rest,2}/\\lambda_{rest,1}$ for the temperature calculation. Rearranging the equation gives: $\\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    6.  Substituting this into the temperature ratio equation from Wien's Law gives: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** A common pitfall is to assume the temperatures are the same because the observed colors are the same. This is incorrect. The Doppler effect for Star_2 means that for its redshifted light to appear the same color as the stationary Star_1's light, its original (intrinsic) light must have been bluer, and thus it must be intrinsically hotter ($T_2 > T_1$). Our formula correctly captures this, showing $T_1/T_2 < 1$.\n\n*   **Step 3: Synthesize and Calculate.**\n    Substitute the temperature ratio back into the equation from Step 1:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $$\n    Now, plug in the values ($v_2 = 700$ km/s and $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s):\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700}{300000}\\right)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291 $$\n\n**4.

The strong consensus among all candidate agents on the physical derivation and the final numerical result confirms this conclusion.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate solutions.\n\n### **1. Deconstruction of the Problem and Identification of Core Principles**\n\nThe objective is to calculate the luminosity ratio, $L_1/L_2$, for two stars. A review of the candidate answers reveals a consensus on the three key physical laws required:\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: A star's luminosity ($L$) is given by $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$. This law connects a star's luminosity to its radius ($R$) and surface temperature ($T$).\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law**: A star's temperature ($T$) is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$), the wavelength at which it radiates most intensely in its own rest frame. So, $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$.\n*   **Doppler Effect**: The *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) is shifted from the intrinsic wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) due to the star's radial velocity ($v$). For a star moving away, its light is redshifted according to the formula $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c)$.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Derivation of the Formula**\n\nAll correct derivations follow these logical steps:\n\n1.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**: Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of luminosities is:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n2.  **Incorporate the Radius Ratio**: The problem states $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$. Substituting this into the formula gives:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n3.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio**: This is the most complex step, combining Wien's Law and the Doppler effect.\n    *   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *intrinsic* wavelength ratio: $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}/\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n    *   The crucial piece of information is that the *observed* peak wavelengths are identical: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$.\n    *   Apply the Doppler effect to each star:\n        *   Star 1 ($v_1=0$): No shift, so $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n        *   Star 2 ($v_2=700$ km/s): Light is redshifted, so $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   By equating the observed wavelengths, we get: $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Rearrange this to find the ratio we need for the temperature formula: $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n4.  **Final Formula Synthesis**: Substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity equation:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $$\n\n### **3. Careful Points and Logical Checks**\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The information about the stars' masses ($M_1=1.5M_2$) is irrelevant for calculating black-body luminosity and is correctly ignored in all valid analyses.\n*   **Observed vs. Intrinsic**: It is critical not to assume the temperatures are equal because the observed peak wavelengths are equal. For the receding Star 2 to have the same observed wavelength as the stationary Star 1, its intrinsic emission must be at a shorter wavelength (bluer), meaning it is hotter ($T_2 > T_1$).\n*   **Quick Estimation**: Since Star 1 is cooler than Star 2 ($T_1/T_2 < 1$), the luminosity ratio must be slightly *less* than the factor from the radii alone (2.25). This allows us to immediately disqualify any answers greater than or equal to 2.25.\n\n### **4. Numerical Calculation and Final Answer**\n\nThe formula derived above is computed using the given values ($v_2 = 700$ km/s and $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s).\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700}{300000}\\right)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333...)^4} \\approx 2.2291 $$\nRounding this result to two decimal places gives **2.23**.\n\nThe options provided in the question are:\nA) ~2.35\nB) ~2.23\nC) ~2.25\nD) ~2.32\n\nThe calculated value of ~2.23 matches option B. The candidate answers that selected other letters did so because the options were presented to them in a different order; however, the numerical result they calculated was overwhelmingly the same.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided agents' responses.\n\n### 1. Identify the Goal and Required Physical Principles\nThe objective is to calculate the luminosity ratio, $L_1/L_2$, between two stars. An analysis of the candidate answers confirms that the solution requires a synthesis of three core physical laws:\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity ($L$) of a star radiating as a black body is given by $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$. This links luminosity to a star's radius ($R$) and surface temperature ($T$).\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** A black body's temperature ($T$) is inversely proportional to the *intrinsic* (rest-frame) wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) at which it emits most of its light. So, $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) is shifted from the intrinsic wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) due to the star's radial velocity ($v$). For an object moving away, the non-relativistic formula is $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c)$.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Derivation\n\nThe consensus derivation from the candidate answers is as follows:\n\n*   **Step 1: Formulate the Luminosity Ratio.**\n    From the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the two luminosities is:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n*   **Step 2: Substitute the Radius Ratio.**\n    We are given $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$. Plugging this in gives $(R_1/R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$. The equation becomes:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the Temperature Ratio.** This is the most critical part of the problem.\n    1.  From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *intrinsic* wavelength ratio: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}}$.\n    2.  The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$.\n    3.  We apply the Doppler effect to each star:\n        *   Star_1 has $v_1 = 0$, so $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n        *   Star_2 has $v_2 = 700$ km/s, so its light is redshifted: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    4.  By equating the observed wavelengths, we get: $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    5.  Rearranging to find the intrinsic wavelength ratio: $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    6.  Therefore, the temperature ratio is: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n*   **Step 4: Final Calculation.**\n    Substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity equation from Step 2:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $$\n    Using the values $v_2 = 700$ km/s and $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700}{300,000}\\right)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291 $$\n\n### 3. List of Careful Points and Conclusion\n1.  **Extraneous Information:** The given mass ratio ($M_1/M_2 = 1.5$) is irrelevant for calculating the luminosity of a black body and should be ignored. All agents correctly identified this.\n2.  **Observed vs. Intrinsic Wavelength:** It is crucial to distinguish between the *observed* peak wavelength, which is affected by motion, and the *intrinsic* peak wavelength, which is determined by the star's actual temperature. The fact that the observed wavelengths are identical does *not* mean the temperatures are identical.\n3.  **Logical Check:** Since Star_2 is moving away (redshifted), its light must be intrinsically bluer (hotter) for it to appear the same color as the stationary Star_1. This means $T_2 > T_1$. Therefore, the luminosity ratio $L_1/L_2$ must be slightly *less than* the factor from the radii alone (2.25). Of the options, only ~2.23 fits this logic.\n4.  **Numerical Consensus:** All candidate answers that completed the calculation arrived at the same numerical result of approximately 2.229. The different letters they chose (A, B, C, D) are explained by the options being presented to them in a different random order.\n5.  **Final Answer Selection:** The calculated value, rounded to two decimal places, is **2.23**. This corresponds to option B in the problem statement.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a unanimous consensus on the underlying physics and the numerical result. The variations in the final chosen letter are due to the multiple-choice options being presented in a different, randomized order to each agent.\n\nHere is a definitive step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Identify the Goal and Governing Principles**\n\nThe objective is to calculate the luminosity ratio, $L_1/L_2$. This requires combining three fundamental principles of physics, as correctly identified by all agents:\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** A star's luminosity ($L$) is determined by its radius ($R$) and surface temperature ($T$) as $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** A star's temperature is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$).\n*   **Doppler Effect:** A star's *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) is shifted from its intrinsic wavelength due to its radial velocity ($v$).\n\n**2. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\n\nFrom the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the two luminosities is:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n**3. Substitute the Radius Ratio**\n\nThe problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$. Substituting this into the formula gives:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n**4. Determine the Temperature Ratio**\n\nThis is the most critical part, connecting the Doppler effect with temperature.\n*   According to Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *intrinsic* wavelength ratio: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}}$.\n*   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$.\n*   We use the Doppler effect formula, $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c)$, for each star:\n    *   Star 1 ($v_1=0$): $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$ (no shift).\n    *   Star 2 ($v_2=700$ km/s): $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$ (redshift).\n*   Equating the observed wavelengths: $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n*   Rearranging to find the intrinsic ratio needed for the temperature calculation gives: $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n*   Therefore, the temperature ratio is: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n**5. Synthesize and Calculate the Final Ratio**\n\nSubstitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity equation from Step 3:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $$\nUsing the given values ($v_2 = 700$ km/s and $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s):\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700}{300,000}\\right)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291 $$\n\nThe result, rounded to two decimal places, is **2.23**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The information about the stars' masses ($M_1 = 1.5 M_2$) is irrelevant for the calculation of black-body luminosity and should be ignored.\n*   **Observed vs. Intrinsic Wavelength**: The core of the problem lies in distinguishing between the *observed* wavelength (which is the same for both stars) and the *intrinsic* wavelength (which is not). The temperature is determined by the intrinsic wavelength.\n*   **Logical Estimation**: Since Star_2 is moving away, its light is redshifted. For it to appear the same color as the stationary Star_1, it must be intrinsically hotter ($T_2 > T_1$). This means the final luminosity ratio must be less than the 2.25 factor from the radii alone. This logical check immediately eliminates options A (~2.25), B (~2.35), and D (~2.32), leaving only ~2.23 as the possible answer.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe derivation and calculation, which are agreed upon by all the provided candidate solutions, show that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately **2.2291**, which rounds to **2.23**. This corresponds to option C in the question.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers shows a remarkable consensus on the physical derivation and numerical result. The discrepancies in the final letter choices are due to the randomization of the multiple-choice options for each agent, not a disagreement on the physics.\n\nHere is a definitive step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify Core Physical Principles**\nTo solve this problem, we must combine three fundamental laws of astrophysics:\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** A star's total power output, or luminosity ($L$), is proportional to its surface area ($4\\pi R^2$) and the fourth power of its surface temperature ($T^4$). The full equation is $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** A star's surface temperature ($T$) is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$), which is the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation in its own rest frame. So, $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength of light ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) is shifted from the intrinsic wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) due to the star's radial velocity ($v$). For an object moving away, the non-relativistic formula is $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c)$.\n\n**2. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\nFrom the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the two stars' luminosities is:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n**3. Incorporate the Radius and Temperature Ratios**\n*   **Radius:** We are given $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$. Substituting this into the formula gives:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n*   **Temperature:** This is the most complex step.\n    *   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *intrinsic* wavelength ratio: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}}$.\n    *   We are given that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$.\n    *   For Star 1 ($v_1=0$), there is no Doppler shift: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n    *   For Star 2 ($v_2=700$ km/s), its light is Doppler redshifted: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Setting the observed wavelengths equal: $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Rearranging to find the intrinsic wavelength ratio needed: $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n**4. Synthesize and Calculate**\nSubstitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity equation:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $$\nUsing the values $v_2 = 700$ km/s and $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700}{300,000}\\right)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291 $$\nThe calculations performed by the agents using Python confirm this result precisely. Rounding to two decimal places gives **2.23**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The information about the stars' masses ($M_1 = 1.5 M_2$) is not relevant to black-body radiation and must be ignored.\n*   **Observed vs. Intrinsic Properties:** The crucial part of the problem is distinguishing between the *observed* peak wavelength (which is the same for both stars) and the *intrinsic* peak wavelength (which is not). Mistaking them as the same would lead to an incorrect answer of 2.25.\n*   **Logical Check:** Because Star 2 is moving away (redshifted), its intrinsic light must be bluer (i.e., it must be hotter, $T_2 > T_1$) for its observed light to match the stationary Star 1. Since $T_1 < T_2$, the temperature ratio factor $(T_1/T_2)^4$ must be less than 1. Therefore, the final answer must be slightly less than 2.25. This simple check eliminates options A, B, and D from consideration.\n*   **The Power of Four:** The temperature term in the Stefan-Boltzmann law is raised to the fourth power. Forgetting to apply this power to the entire temperature ratio term is a common mistake.\n\nBased on the consistent derivation and calculation, the correct value is ~2.23. Matching this to the provided options:\nA) ~2.25\nB) ~2.32\nC) ~2.23\nD) ~2.35\n\nThe calculated value corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting important considerations.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Identify the Relevant Physical Principles**\nThe solution requires the synthesis of three core laws of physics related to stars and black-body radiation:\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a spherical black body is determined by its radius (R) and surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n    $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The surface temperature (T) of a black body is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$), which is the peak wavelength measured in the star's own reference frame.\n    $T \\propto \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}}$\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) is shifted from the intrinsic wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) due to the star's radial velocity (v). For a star moving away, its light is redshifted to longer wavelengths:\n    $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c)$\n\n**2. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law, we can create a ratio of the luminosities of the two stars. This cancels out the constants ($4\\pi\\sigma$):\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n**3. Substitute the Radius Ratio**\nThe problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$. We can substitute this into our formula:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n**4. Determine the Temperature Ratio**\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis, where the Doppler effect and Wien's law are combined.\n*   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *intrinsic* wavelength ratio:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}}$\n*   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are identical:\n    $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$\n*   We relate these observed wavelengths to their intrinsic values using the Doppler effect:\n    *   For Star 1 ($v_1=0$), there is no shift: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$\n    *   For Star 2 ($v_2=700$ km/s), there is a redshift: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$\n*   By equating the observed wavelengths, we get:\n    $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$\n*   We can now find the ratio needed for our temperature calculation:\n    $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$\n*   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\nSubstitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity equation from Step 3:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $$\nUsing the values $v_2 = 700$ km/s and $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700}{300,000}\\right)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291 $$\nRounding this to two decimal places gives **2.23**.\n\n### **Careful Points and Potential Pitfalls**\n\n1.  **Extraneous Information**: The mass ratio ($M_1/M_2=1.5$) is irrelevant for the calculation of black-body luminosity and must be ignored.\n2.  **Observed vs. Intrinsic Wavelength**: The most common trap is to incorrectly assume that identical *observed* peak wavelengths mean identical temperatures. The Doppler effect for the receding Star 2 means its light has been redshifted (wavelength increased). For it to be *observed* at the same wavelength as the stationary Star 1, it must have started at a shorter, \"bluer\" wavelength, meaning it is intrinsically hotter ($T_2 > T_1$).\n3.  **Logical Check**: Since $T_1 < T_2$, the temperature correction term $(T_1/T_2)^4$ must be less than 1. Therefore, the final answer must be slightly *less* than the 2.25 value from the radii alone. This immediately eliminates options B (~2.35) and D (~2.32) and makes option C (~2.25) highly unlikely.\n4.  **Mathematical Powers**: Ensure the fourth power from the Stefan-Boltzmann law is applied to the entire temperature ratio term, as correctly derived in the formula.\n\nBased on the consistent and correct derivation across the candidate answers, the calculated luminosity ratio is ~2.229, which rounds to ~2.23.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers and the underlying physics problem reveals a clear and consistent method for arriving at the correct solution. Here is a step-by-step breakdown.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    The luminosity (L) of a star that radiates as a black body is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$. The ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is therefore:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n2.  **Incorporate the Radius Ratio:**\n    The problem states that Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2, so $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n3.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio:**\n    This is the most critical step and requires combining Wien's Displacement Law with the Doppler Effect.\n    *   Wien's Law states that a star's surface temperature (T) is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$), i.e., $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$. Therefore, the temperature ratio is $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}}$.\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) are identical for both stars: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$.\n    *   The Doppler Effect relates the observed wavelength to the intrinsic wavelength: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c)$.\n        *   For Star_1, with $v_1=0$, there is no shift: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n        *   For Star_2, with $v_2 = 700$ km/s, its light is redshifted: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set them equal: $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Rearranging to get the required ratio for our temperature calculation gives: $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio formula from step 2:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $$\n    Using the values $v_2 = 700$ km/s and $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700}{300,000}\\right)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333...)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291 $$\n    Rounding this result to two decimal places gives **2.23**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Irrelevant Information**: The information about the stars' masses ($M_1 = 1.5 M_2$) is not relevant to the Stefan-Boltzmann law for black-body radiation and should be ignored. All correct candidate analyses did this.\n*   **Observed vs. Intrinsic Wavelength**: The most common potential mistake is to assume that because the *observed* wavelengths are identical, the temperatures must also be identical. The correct approach, as shown by the candidates, is to use the Doppler effect to find the *intrinsic* wavelengths, which are what truly determine the stars' temperatures.\n*   **Logical Check**: Since Star 2 is receding, its light is redshifted to a longer wavelength. For it to be *observed* at the same wavelength as the stationary Star 1, its *intrinsic* wavelength must be shorter (bluer), meaning it is hotter ($T_2 > T_1$). This implies that the term $(T_1/T_2)^4$ is less than 1. Consequently, the final luminosity ratio must be slightly **less than** 2.25. Of the given choices, only ~2.23 satisfies this condition, providing a quick way to validate the answer.\n*   **Consensus on Calculation**: Every candidate answer that followed the correct physical principles arrived at the same numerical result of ~2.229. The inconsistencies in the final letter chosen (A, B, C, etc.) are due to the different, randomized ordering of the options in each agent's specific prompt. The underlying physics and calculation are unambiguously agreed upon.\n\n### Final Decision\nThe calculation yields a value of ~2.229, which rounds to **2.23**. This must be matched against the options provided in the question:\n\nA) ~2.23\nB) ~2.32\nC) ~2.25\nD) ~2.35\n\nThe calculated value corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting key considerations.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Goal and Required Physics**\n\nThe objective is to find the luminosity ratio ($L_1/L_2$) between two stars. A consensus among the provided solutions correctly identifies three essential laws of physics:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity of a star radiating as a black body is given by $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$. This links luminosity ($L$) to the star's radius ($R$) and surface temperature ($T$).\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** A star's surface temperature is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$). Therefore, the ratio of temperatures is related to the inverse ratio of their intrinsic wavelengths: $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}/\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n3.  **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) is shifted from the intrinsic wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) due to the star's radial velocity ($v$). For a star moving away, the formula is $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c)$.\n\n### **Step 2: Formulate the Luminosity Ratio Equation**\n\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, we can set up the ratio of luminosities, which causes the constants ($4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$) to cancel out:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n### **Step 3: Substitute the Radius Ratio**\n\nThe problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$. We can substitute this into the equation:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n### **Step 4: Determine the Temperature Ratio**\n\nThis is the most critical step, where the Doppler Effect must be accounted for.\n*   We are given that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$.\n*   For Star_1 ($v_1=0$), there is no Doppler shift, so its observed wavelength is its intrinsic wavelength: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n*   For Star_2 ($v_2=700$ km/s), its light is redshifted, so its observed wavelength is longer than its intrinsic wavelength: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n*   By setting the observed wavelengths equal, we get: $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n*   Using Wien's Law, we need the ratio $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}/\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$ to find the temperature ratio. Rearranging the equation above gives:\n    $$ \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c} $$\n*   Since $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}/\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$, the temperature ratio is:\n    $$ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c} $$\n\n### **Step 5: Final Calculation**\n\nNow, we substitute the temperature ratio back into the equation from Step 3:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $$\nPlugging in the values ($v_2 = 700$ km/s and $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s):\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700}{300,000}\\right)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291 $$\n\n### **Careful Points and Logical Checks**\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The given mass ratio ($M_1/M_2=1.5$) is irrelevant for calculating black-body luminosity and is designed to be a distractor.\n*   **Observed vs. Intrinsic:** The core challenge is distinguishing between the observed property (equal wavelengths) and the intrinsic property (different temperatures). A mistake would be to assume equal temperatures, which would incorrectly yield an answer of 2.25.\n*   **Qualitative Check:** Since Star_2 is moving away, its light is redshifted. For its observed wavelength to match that of the stationary Star_1, its intrinsic wavelength must have been shorter (bluer), meaning Star_2 is intrinsically hotter ($T_2 > T_1$). Therefore, the term $(T_1/T_2)^4$ must be less than 1. This logically proves that the final answer must be less than 2.25. Of the options provided, only ~2.23 fits this criteria.\n*   **Consensus:** All the provided candidate answers that show a correct physical derivation arrive at the same numerical result of ~2.229. The variance in their final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) is due to randomized option ordering, not a disagreement on the physics.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculation yields a luminosity ratio of approximately 2.229, which rounds to **2.23**. This result matches option B from the provided list.\n\nA) ~2.35\nB) ~2.23\nC) ~2.32\nD) ~2.25\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers, there is a strong consensus on the correct physical principles and mathematical derivation. The discrepancies in the final letter choices are due to the randomization of the multiple-choice options for each agent, but the underlying numerical result is consistent.\n\nHere is a definitive step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Physical Principles**\nTo determine the luminosity ratio ($L_1/L_2$), we must use three key concepts from astrophysics:\n1.  **The Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: For a spherical object radiating as a perfect black body, its total luminosity ($L$) is related to its radius ($R$) and surface temperature ($T$) by the formula: $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$.\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: The temperature of a black body is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$), which is the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation in its own frame of reference. This can be written as $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$.\n3.  **The Doppler Effect**: The *observed* wavelength of light ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) is shifted from its intrinsic wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) if the source has a radial velocity ($v$) relative to the observer. For velocities much smaller than the speed of light ($c$), this relationship is $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c)$.\n\n### **Step 2: Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law, we can write the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\nThe problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, so the radius term is $(1.5)^2 = 2.25$. The equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Temperature Ratio**\nThis is the most critical step and involves combining Wien's Law and the Doppler effect.\n\n1.  From Wien's Law, the ratio of temperatures is the inverse of the ratio of their *intrinsic* wavelengths:\n    $$ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} $$\n2.  The problem gives a crucial piece of information: the *observed* peak wavelengths are identical: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$.\n3.  We apply the Doppler effect to each star to relate observed and intrinsic wavelengths:\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is $v_1 = 0$, so there is no Doppler shift: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is $v_2 = 700 \\text{ km/s}$. Its light is redshifted (shifted to a longer wavelength): $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n4.  Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the two right-hand sides equal:\n    $$ \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}\\left(1 + \\frac{v_2}{c}\\right) $$\n5.  Now we rearrange this to find the intrinsic wavelength ratio we need for the temperature calculation:\n    $$ \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c} $$\n6.  Finally, we can state the temperature ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c} $$\n\n### **Step 4: Final Calculation**\nSubstitute the expression for the temperature ratio back into our luminosity ratio equation from Step 2:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $$\nNow, we plug in the numerical values, using $v_2 = 700 \\text{ km/s}$ and $c \\approx 300,000 \\text{ km/s}$:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700}{300,000}\\right)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333...)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291 $$\nRounding this result to two decimal places gives **2.23**.\n\n### **Careful Points & Summary**\n*   **Irrelevant Information**: The fact that the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2 is a distractor. Mass-Luminosity relations exist, but they are not needed here since the problem specifies the stars are black bodies and provides information about their radii and temperatures (via their peak wavelengths).\n*   **Intrinsic vs. Observed Wavelengths**: The key is recognizing that while the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same, the Doppler effect on Star_2 implies its *intrinsic* wavelength is shorter (bluer). This means Star_2 is actually hotter than Star_1 ($T_2 > T_1$).\n*   **Logical Check**: Because Star_1 is cooler than Star_2, the temperature ratio term $(T_1/T_2)^4$ is a number slightly less than 1. This means the final answer for the luminosity ratio must be slightly less than the contribution from the radii alone, which was 2.25. Our calculated answer of ~2.23 fits this check perfectly, whereas options like ~2.32 or ~2.35 do not.\n\nThe final calculated value is ~2.23. Matching this to the provided options:\nA) ~2.25\nB) ~2.23\nC) ~2.35\nD) ~2.32\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe problem asks for the luminosity ratio ($L_1/L_2$) between two stars. A review of all candidate answers shows a remarkable consensus on the correct physical principles and derivation.\n\n1.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:**\n    The luminosity ($L$) of a star radiating as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$. The ratio of luminosities for two stars is therefore:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n2.  **Incorporate the Radius Ratio:**\n    We are given that Star_1's radius is 1.5 times Star_2's ($R_1 = 1.5 R_2$). Plugging this into the formula gives:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n3.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio:**\n    This is the most critical step, requiring the combination of Wien's Displacement Law and the Doppler effect.\n    *   From Wien's Law, a star's temperature is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak wavelength ($T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$). Therefore, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the intrinsic wavelength ratio: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest,2}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}}$.\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$).\n    *   We must relate these observed wavelengths to the intrinsic wavelengths using the Doppler effect formula, $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c)$.\n        *   For Star_1 ($v_1=0$ km/s): $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n        *   For Star_2 ($v_2=700$ km/s): $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Setting the observed wavelengths equal: $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Rearranging to find the intrinsic wavelength ratio needed for our temperature equation gives: $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Substitute the derived temperature ratio back into the luminosity equation from Step 2:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $$\n    Using the given values ($v_2 = 700$ km/s and the speed of light $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s):\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700}{300,000}\\right)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291 $$\n    Rounding the result to two decimal places gives **2.23**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Extraneous Information:** The problem states that the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. For a black-body radiation model, mass is not a factor in the Stefan-Boltzmann law. This information is a distracter and should be ignored.\n2.  **Observed vs. Intrinsic Properties:** The most common potential mistake is to assume that since the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same, the stars' temperatures must also be the same. This ignores the Doppler effect. For the redshifted Star_2 to have the same observed wavelength as the stationary Star_1, its intrinsic wavelength must be shorter (bluer), meaning Star_2 is intrinsically hotter.\n3.  **Logical Check:** Since Star_1 is cooler than Star_2 ($T_1 < T_2$), the temperature ratio term $(T_1/T_2)^4$ must be less than 1. This means the final luminosity ratio must be less than the 2.25 factor from the radii alone. Of the choices provided, only ~2.23 fits this logical constraint.\n4.  **Option Discrepancy:** The candidate answers show confusion regarding which letter option (A, B, C, or D) corresponds to the value 2.23. This is because the options were likely presented in a different random order for each agent. The calculation itself is unambiguous. The final choice must be based on matching the calculated value to the specific option list in the question.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe step-by-step derivation, which has a strong consensus among all provided candidate answers, leads to a numerical value of approximately 2.229. Rounding this to two decimal places gives 2.23. Matching this value to the options presented in the problem statement:\n\nA) ~2.35\nB) ~2.25\nC) ~2.32\nD) ~2.23\n\nThe correct answer is ~2.23.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the careful points needed to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Key Physical Principles**\nThe objective is to find the ratio of luminosities ($L_1/L_2$) for two stars. The solution relies on three fundamental laws of physics for stars treated as black-body radiators:\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The total power radiated (luminosity, $L$) by a black body is proportional to its surface area and the fourth power of its surface temperature ($T$). The formula is $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The surface temperature ($T$) of a black body is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$), which is the wavelength at which it radiates most intensely in its own rest frame. So, $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) of light is shifted from its intrinsic wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) due to the star's radial velocity ($v$). For an object moving away, the light is redshifted: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c)$.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Derivation of the Luminosity Ratio**\n\n*   **Step 1: Formulate the Ratio using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law.**\n    The ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n*   **Step 2: Incorporate the Radius Ratio.**\n    We are given $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, so $(R_1/R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\n    The equation now becomes:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the Temperature Ratio.**\n    This is the most critical part, as it connects the observed brightness with the intrinsic temperatures via the Doppler effect.\n    1.  From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *intrinsic* wavelength ratio: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}}$.\n    2.  The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are identical: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$.\n    3.  For Star_1 ($v_1=0$), there is no Doppler shift: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n    4.  For Star_2 ($v_2=700$ km/s), its light is redshifted: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    5.  Equating the observed wavelengths: $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    6.  Rearranging to find the intrinsic wavelength ratio needed for the temperature formula gives: $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    7.  Therefore, the temperature ratio is: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n*   **Step 4: Combine Formulas and Calculate the Final Value.**\n    Substitute the temperature ratio from Step 3 into the luminosity equation from Step 2:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $$\n    Using the given values ($v_2 = 700$ km/s and $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s):\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700}{300,000}\\right)^4} = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + 0.002333...)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291 $$\n\n**3. Careful Points and Logical Checks**\n\n*   **Observed vs. Intrinsic:** The most common mistake is failing to distinguish between observed properties (which are affected by motion) and intrinsic properties (which determine temperature and luminosity). The problem's statement that the stars \"appeared brightest\" at the same wavelength refers to the observed wavelength.\n*   **Doppler Effect Implication:** Because Star 2 is moving away (redshifted), its light appears redder than it actually is. For it to appear the same color as the stationary Star 1, its intrinsic color must be \"bluer,\" meaning it must be hotter ($T_2 > T_1$).\n*   **Logical Estimation:** Since $T_1 < T_2$, the temperature ratio term $(T_1/T_2)^4$ must be less than 1. This means the final answer must be slightly *less than* the 2.25 factor from the radii alone. This immediately rules out options C (~2.25), A (~2.32), and D (~2.35). Only option B (~2.23) is logically possible.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The given mass ratio ($M_1/M_2 = 1.5$) is a distractor and is not used in the black-body luminosity calculation.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe detailed derivation and calculation give a luminosity ratio of approximately 2.2291. Rounding this to two decimal places yields **2.23**. This result is consistent with the logical check that the ratio must be less than 2.25. Comparing this to the provided options:\n\nA) ~2.32\nB) ~2.23\nC) ~2.25\nD) ~2.35\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers and the underlying physics, here is a definitive step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Principles:** All valid analyses correctly identify that the solution requires a combination of three physical laws:\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity ($L$) of a star radiating as a black body is given by $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$. This law relates luminosity to a star's radius ($R$) and surface temperature ($T$).\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The temperature ($T$) of a black body is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$). Thus, $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) of light is shifted from its intrinsic wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) due to the star's radial velocity ($v$). For an object moving away, the non-relativistic formula is $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c)$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** From the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n3.  **Incorporate the Radius Ratio:** The problem states $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$. Substituting this into the formula gives:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n4.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio:** This is the most complex step, combining Wien's Law and the Doppler effect.\n    *   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the intrinsic wavelength ratio: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}}$.\n    *   We are given that the *observed* peak wavelengths are identical: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$.\n    *   For Star_1 ($v_1=0$), there is no Doppler shift: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n    *   For Star_2 ($v_2=700$ km/s), its light is Doppler redshifted: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   By equating the observed wavelengths, we get: $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Rearranging to find the intrinsic wavelength ratio needed gives: $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Result:** Substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity equation from Step 3:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{v_2}{c}\\right)^4} $$\n    Using the values $v_2 = 700$ km/s and $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s, the calculation yields:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700}{300000}\\right)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333...)^4} \\approx 2.2291 $$\n    Rounding this result to two decimal places gives **2.23**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The fact that the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 is irrelevant to the calculation of luminosity from black body radiation laws and must be ignored.\n*   **Observed vs. Intrinsic Wavelength:** The core of the problem lies in distinguishing between the observed wavelength (which is the same for both stars) and the intrinsic wavelength (which is not). This distinction necessitates the use of the Doppler effect.\n*   **Logical Check:** Since Star_2 is moving away, its light is redshifted. For its observed color to be the same as the stationary Star_1, it must be intrinsically hotter (i.e., its intrinsic peak wavelength is shorter/bluer). Therefore, $T_2 > T_1$, which means the ratio $(T_1/T_2)^4$ must be less than 1. This confirms that the final answer must be slightly less than the 2.25 value derived from the radii alone, ruling out options like ~2.32 and ~2.35.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThere is an overwhelming consensus among all the provided candidate answers that performed the calculation. They all correctly derived the same formula and arrived at the same numerical result of approximately 2.229, which rounds to 2.23. The variance in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) is due to the multiple-choice options being presented in a different, randomized order to each agent.\n\nBased on the definitive physical analysis and calculation, the correct value is **~2.23**.

Deconstruction of the Problem and Identification of Key Principles**\n\nThe objective is to find the luminosity ratio ($L_1/L_2$) between two stars. A consensus among the provided answers correctly identifies three essential laws of physics:\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity ($L$) of a star radiating as a black body is proportional to its radius squared ($R^2$) and its surface temperature to the fourth power ($T^4$). The ratio is given by:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** A star's surface temperature ($T$) is inversely proportional to the peak wavelength of its *intrinsic* emission ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$). This allows us to relate the temperatures of the stars:\n    $$ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} $$\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The wavelength we observe ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) is shifted from the intrinsic wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) due to the star's motion. For a star receding at velocity $v$, the formula is:\n    $$ \\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c) $$\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n*   **Step A: Incorporate the Radius Ratio**\n    The problem states $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$. Plugging this into the Stefan-Boltzmann ratio gives:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n*   **Step B: Determine the Temperature Ratio**\n    This is the most critical part of the analysis.\n    1.  We are told the *observed* peak wavelengths are identical: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$.\n    2.  For Star_1, with $v_1 = 0$, there is no Doppler shift, so $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n    3.  For Star_2, with $v_2 = 700$ km/s, its light is redshifted, so $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    4.  Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the expressions equal: $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    5.  To use Wien's law, we need the ratio $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}}$. Rearranging the equation gives: $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    6.  Therefore, the temperature ratio is: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n*   **Step C: Final Calculation**\n    Substitute the temperature ratio from Step B into the luminosity equation from Step A:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $$\n    Now, we insert the numerical values ($v_2 = 700$ km/s, $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s):\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700}{300,000}\\right)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291 $$\n\n**3. Analysis of Careful Points and Conclusion**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Extraneous Data):** The problem provides the mass ratio ($M_1 = 1.5 M_2$). As demonstrated in the derivation, this information is not needed for calculating luminosity based on the black body model and must be ignored.\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Observed vs. Intrinsic Properties):** The most significant potential error is confusing *observed* wavelength with *intrinsic* temperature. The problem states observed wavelengths are equal, not temperatures. The Doppler effect on Star_2 means it must be intrinsically hotter ($T_2 > T_1$) for its observed (redshifted) wavelength to match the stationary Star_1's.\n*   **Careful Point 3 (Logical Check):** Because Star_1 is slightly cooler than Star_2, the luminosity ratio must be slightly *less* than the ratio derived from the radii alone (2.25). Of the options provided, A (~2.32) and B (~2.35) are greater than 2.25. Option D (~2.25) represents the case where the Doppler effect is ignored. Only C (~2.23) is consistent with the physics.\n*   **Final Answer Synthesis:** The calculated value is ~2.229, which rounds to **2.23**. This numerical result is consistently obtained across all candidate answers that performed the derivation correctly. The variation in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) among the candidates is due to randomized option ordering, but the underlying physical result is the same. Matching the calculated value of ~2.23 to the provided option list:\n\n    A) ~2.32\n    B) ~2.35\n    C) ~2.23\n    D) ~2.25\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers and the underlying physics, here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Task and Physical Principles**: The goal is to find the luminosity ratio ($L_1/L_2$) between two stars. A review of the candidate answers confirms that the solution requires combining three fundamental laws of physics:\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity of a star as a black body is $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$. This relates luminosity to the star's radius ($R$) and surface temperature ($T$).\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law**: A black body's temperature is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$), so $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$.\n    *   **Doppler Effect**: The *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) is shifted from the intrinsic wavelength due to radial velocity ($v$). For a source moving away, $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c)$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**: Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the two luminosities is:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n3.  **Incorporate Given Ratios and Derive Temperature Ratio**:\n    *   We are given that $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$. Substituting this into the formula gives a factor of $(1.5)^2 = 2.25$. The equation becomes:\n        $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n    *   To find the temperature ratio, we must relate it to the observed wavelengths. From Wien's Law, we know $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}}$.\n    *   The problem states the *observed* peak wavelengths are identical ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$).\n    *   Using the Doppler effect for each star:\n        *   Star_1 ($v_1=0$): $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$\n        *   Star_2 ($v_2=700$ km/s): $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$\n    *   Setting the observed wavelengths equal: $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Rearranging gives us the intrinsic wavelength ratio: $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**: We substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity formula:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $$\n    Plugging in the numerical values ($v_2 = 700$ km/s and $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s):\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + \\frac{700}{300,000})^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333)^4} \\approx 2.2291 $$\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The calculated ratio is ~2.229, which rounds to **2.23**. This numerical result is confirmed by every candidate who performed the calculation. The discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) among the candidates are due to the randomization of options, not a flaw in the physics.

This information should be disregarded.\n*   **Observed vs. Intrinsic Properties**: The most critical step is understanding the difference between the observed and intrinsic wavelengths. Because Star_2 is moving away (redshifted), its intrinsic wavelength must be shorter (bluer) than Star_1's for their *observed* wavelengths to match. This implies Star_2 is intrinsically hotter ($T_2 > T_1$).\n*   **Logical Check**: Since the radius ratio gives a factor of 2.25 and the temperature ratio $(T_1/T_2)^4$ is less than 1 (because $T_1 < T_2$), the final answer must be less than 2.25.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThere is an overwhelming consensus among all candidate agents regarding the physical principles, the mathematical derivation, and the final numerical result. The discrepancy in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) among the agents is due to the multiple-choice options being presented to them in a different, randomized order. The core physics and calculation are consistently correct.\n\n**1. Identify Necessary Physical Principles**\nThe solution requires the synthesis of three fundamental laws of astrophysics:\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** A star's luminosity ($L$) is given by $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$. This links luminosity to its radius ($R$) and surface temperature ($T$).\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** A star's temperature ($T$) is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$), the peak wavelength in its own reference frame. Thus, $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) is shifted from the intrinsic wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) due to the star's radial velocity ($v$). For a source moving away from the observer, its light is redshifted: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c)$.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Derivation**\nThe derivation, unanimously agreed upon by all agents, proceeds as follows:\n\n*   **Step 1: Formulate the Luminosity Ratio.**\n    From the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the two luminosities is:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n*   **Step 2: Substitute the Radius Ratio.**\n    We are given $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$. Plugging this in gives a factor of $(1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the Temperature Ratio.**\n    This is the most critical step, where the observational data is translated into a temperature ratio using the Doppler effect.\n    1.  From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *intrinsic* wavelength ratio: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}}$.\n    2.  We are told the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$.\n    3.  Apply the Doppler effect to each star:\n        *   Star_1 has $v_1 = 0$, so there's no shift: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n        *   Star_2 has $v_2 = 700$ km/s, so its light is redshifted: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    4.  By equating the observed wavelengths, we get: $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    5.  Rearranging to find the intrinsic wavelength ratio needed gives: $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    6.  Therefore, the temperature ratio is: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n*   **Step 4: Synthesize and Calculate.**\n    Substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity equation from Step 2:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $$\n    Using the values $v_2 = 700$ km/s and the speed of light $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700}{300,000}\\right)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291 $$\n    Rounding this to two decimal places gives **2.23**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Extraneous Information:** The problem provides the mass ratio ($M_1/M_2 = 1.5$). For a calculation of luminosity based on black-body laws (radius and temperature), mass is irrelevant. This is a distractor and was correctly ignored by all agents.\n2.  **Observed vs. Intrinsic Properties:** This is the central challenge. A common mistake is to assume that identical *observed* peak wavelengths imply identical temperatures. The Doppler effect for the receding Star 2 means its light has been shifted to a longer (redder) wavelength. For it to be observed at the same wavelength as the stationary Star 1, it must have originated at a shorter (bluer) wavelength, which means it is intrinsically hotter ($T_2 > T_1$).\n3.  **Logical Check:** Since Star 1 is cooler than Star 2 ($T_1 < T_2$), the temperature correction term $(T_1/T_2)^4$ must be a factor less than 1. Therefore, the final answer must be slightly *less than* the 2.25 factor that comes from the radii alone. This logical check immediately rules out options B, C, and D, making A the only plausible answer.\n\nThe definitive calculation results in a luminosity ratio of ~2.23.\n\n<<<A>>>"

This links luminosity to the star's radius ($R$) and surface temperature ($T$).\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law**: The surface temperature ($T$) of a black body is inversely proportional to the *intrinsic* wavelength at which it emits most of its light ($\\lambda_{rest}$). Therefore, $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{rest}$.\n    *   **Doppler Effect**: The *observed* wavelength of light ($\\lambda_{obs}$) is shifted from its intrinsic wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$) due to the source's radial velocity ($v$). For a source moving away, the non-relativistic formula is $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest}(1 + v/c)$.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**: Using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, the ratio of luminosities is:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n4.  **Incorporate the Radius Ratio**: The problem states $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$. Substituting this into the formula gives:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n5.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio**: This is the most complex step and requires combining Wien's Law and the Doppler Effect.\n    *   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *intrinsic* wavelength ratio: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}}$.\n    *   We are given that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n    *   For Star 1 (stationary, $v_1=0$), there is no Doppler shift: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{rest,1}$.\n    *   For Star 2 (receding, $v_2=700$ km/s), its light is redshifted: $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Equating the observed wavelengths: $\\lambda_{rest,1} = \\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Rearranging this gives the required intrinsic wavelength ratio: $\\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation**: Substitute the derived temperature ratio back into the luminosity equation from Step 4:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $$\n    Using the given values $v_2 = 700$ km/s and the speed of light $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700}{300,000}\\right)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333...)^4} \\approx 2.2291 $$\n    Rounding this result to two decimal places gives **2.23**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The mass ratio ($M_1/M_2 = 1.5$) is irrelevant for calculating the luminosity of black bodies and should be ignored. All successful candidate answers correctly identified this as a distractor.\n*   **Intrinsic vs. Observed Wavelengths**: The central point of the problem is realizing that Wien's law relates temperature to the *intrinsic* (rest-frame) wavelength, while the data given is about the *observed* wavelength. The Doppler effect must be used to connect them.\n*   **Logical Estimation**: The radius ratio contributes a factor of $1.5^2 = 2.25$ to the luminosity ratio. Because Star 2 is moving away, for its observed color to match the stationary Star 1, it must be intrinsically hotter ($T_2 > T_1$). This means the temperature ratio term $(T_1/T_2)^4$ is less than 1, so the final answer must be slightly less than 2.25. This immediately makes answers ~2.32 and ~2.35 incorrect and favors ~2.23.\n*   **Consensus on Numerical Value**: Despite the options being shuffled for different candidate agents, every agent that performed the calculation correctly arrived at the same numerical value of approximately 2.229.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe thorough analysis of the physics confirms that the luminosity ratio is ~2.229, which rounds to **2.23**. This matches option D in the original problem statement.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question based on a synthesis of the provided answers.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Key Information**\nThe question asks for the luminosity ratio, $L_1/L_2$, between two stars.\n*   **Given**:\n    *   Radius Ratio: $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$\n    *   Radial Velocity of Star 1: $v_1 = 0$ km/s\n    *   Radial Velocity of Star 2: $v_2 = 700$ km/s\n    *   Observation: The *observed* wavelengths of peak brightness are the same ($\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$).\n    *   Assumption: The stars radiate as black bodies.\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The mass ratio ($M_1 = 1.5 M_2$) is not relevant for calculating the luminosity of a black body using the Stefan-Boltzmann law and is a distractor.\n\n**2. Identify and Apply Relevant Physical Principles**\nThree core principles of physics are needed, and there is a strong consensus among the candidate answers on their application:\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: A star's luminosity ($L$) is related to its radius ($R$) and temperature ($T$) by the formula $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$. The ratio of luminosities is therefore:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law**: A black body's temperature ($T$) is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$). This means the temperature ratio can be expressed as:\n    $$ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}} $$\n\n*   **Doppler Effect**: The observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) is shifted from the intrinsic wavelength ($\\lambda_{rest}$) due to radial velocity ($v$). For a source moving away, the shift is given by $\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_{rest}(1 + v/c)$.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Derivation**\nThe derivation below is the consensus path from the candidate answers.\n\n*   **Step 1: Incorporate the Radius Ratio.**\n    Substitute the given $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$ into the luminosity ratio formula:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** At this stage, we can perform a logical check. If the temperatures were the same, the answer would be exactly 2.25. The final answer will be adjusted by the temperature term.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the Temperature Ratio.**\n    This is the most critical part, connecting the Doppler effect with the temperature.\n    1.  The crucial given information is that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{obs,2}$.\n    2.  For Star_1, its velocity is zero, so there's no Doppler shift: $\\lambda_{obs,1} = \\lambda_{rest,1}$.\n    3.  For Star_2, its light is redshifted due to its velocity: $\\lambda_{obs,2} = \\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    4.  Setting the observed wavelengths equal gives: $\\lambda_{rest,1} = \\lambda_{rest,2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    5.  We need the ratio $\\lambda_{rest,2}/\\lambda_{rest,1}$ for the temperature calculation. Rearranging the equation gives: $\\frac{\\lambda_{rest,2}}{\\lambda_{rest,1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    6.  Substituting this into the temperature ratio equation from Wien's Law gives: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** A common pitfall is to assume the temperatures are the same because the observed colors are the same. This is incorrect. The Doppler effect for Star_2 means that for its redshifted light to appear the same color as the stationary Star_1's light, its original (intrinsic) light must have been bluer, and thus it must be intrinsically hotter ($T_2 > T_1$). Our formula correctly captures this, showing $T_1/T_2 < 1$.\n\n*   **Step 3: Synthesize and Calculate.**\n    Substitute the temperature ratio back into the equation from Step 1:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $$\n    Now, plug in the values ($v_2 = 700$ km/s and $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s):\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700}{300000}\\right)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291 $$\n\n**4.

Deconstruction of the Problem and Identification of Core Principles**\n\nThe objective is to calculate the luminosity ratio, $L_1/L_2$, for two stars. A review of the candidate answers reveals a consensus on the three key physical laws required:\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: A star's luminosity ($L$) is given by $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$. This law connects a star's luminosity to its radius ($R$) and surface temperature ($T$).\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law**: A star's temperature ($T$) is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$), the wavelength at which it radiates most intensely in its own rest frame. So, $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$.\n*   **Doppler Effect**: The *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) is shifted from the intrinsic wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) due to the star's radial velocity ($v$). For a star moving away, its light is redshifted according to the formula $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c)$.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Derivation of the Formula**\n\nAll correct derivations follow these logical steps:\n\n1.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**: Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of luminosities is:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n2.  **Incorporate the Radius Ratio**: The problem states $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$. Substituting this into the formula gives:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n3.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio**: This is the most complex step, combining Wien's Law and the Doppler effect.\n    *   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *intrinsic* wavelength ratio: $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}/\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n    *   The crucial piece of information is that the *observed* peak wavelengths are identical: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$.\n    *   Apply the Doppler effect to each star:\n        *   Star 1 ($v_1=0$): No shift, so $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n        *   Star 2 ($v_2=700$ km/s): Light is redshifted, so $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   By equating the observed wavelengths, we get: $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Rearrange this to find the ratio we need for the temperature formula: $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n4.  **Final Formula Synthesis**: Substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity equation:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $$\n\n### **3. Careful Points and Logical Checks**\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The information about the stars' masses ($M_1=1.5M_2$) is irrelevant for calculating black-body luminosity and is correctly ignored in all valid analyses.\n*   **Observed vs. Intrinsic**: It is critical not to assume the temperatures are equal because the observed peak wavelengths are equal. For the receding Star 2 to have the same observed wavelength as the stationary Star 1, its intrinsic emission must be at a shorter wavelength (bluer), meaning it is hotter ($T_2 > T_1$).\n*   **Quick Estimation**: Since Star 1 is cooler than Star 2 ($T_1/T_2 < 1$), the luminosity ratio must be slightly *less* than the factor from the radii alone (2.25). This allows us to immediately disqualify any answers greater than or equal to 2.25.\n\n### **4.

The candidate answers that selected other letters did so because the options were presented to them in a different order; however, the numerical result they calculated was overwhelmingly the same.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided agents' responses.\n\n### 1. Identify the Goal and Required Physical Principles\nThe objective is to calculate the luminosity ratio, $L_1/L_2$, between two stars. An analysis of the candidate answers confirms that the solution requires a synthesis of three core physical laws:\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity ($L$) of a star radiating as a black body is given by $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$. This links luminosity to a star's radius ($R$) and surface temperature ($T$).\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** A black body's temperature ($T$) is inversely proportional to the *intrinsic* (rest-frame) wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) at which it emits most of its light. So, $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) is shifted from the intrinsic wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) due to the star's radial velocity ($v$). For an object moving away, the non-relativistic formula is $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c)$.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Derivation\n\nThe consensus derivation from the candidate answers is as follows:\n\n*   **Step 1: Formulate the Luminosity Ratio.**\n    From the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the two luminosities is:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n*   **Step 2: Substitute the Radius Ratio.**\n    We are given $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$. Plugging this in gives $(R_1/R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$. The equation becomes:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the Temperature Ratio.** This is the most critical part of the problem.\n    1.  From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *intrinsic* wavelength ratio: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}}$.\n    2.  The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$.\n    3.  We apply the Doppler effect to each star:\n        *   Star_1 has $v_1 = 0$, so $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n        *   Star_2 has $v_2 = 700$ km/s, so its light is redshifted: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    4.  By equating the observed wavelengths, we get: $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    5.

List of Careful Points and Conclusion\n1.  **Extraneous Information:** The given mass ratio ($M_1/M_2 = 1.5$) is irrelevant for calculating the luminosity of a black body and should be ignored. All agents correctly identified this.\n2.  **Observed vs. Intrinsic Wavelength:** It is crucial to distinguish between the *observed* peak wavelength, which is affected by motion, and the *intrinsic* peak wavelength, which is determined by the star's actual temperature. The fact that the observed wavelengths are identical does *not* mean the temperatures are identical.\n3.  **Logical Check:** Since Star_2 is moving away (redshifted), its light must be intrinsically bluer (hotter) for it to appear the same color as the stationary Star_1. This means $T_2 > T_1$. Therefore, the luminosity ratio $L_1/L_2$ must be slightly *less than* the factor from the radii alone (2.25). Of the options, only ~2.23 fits this logic.\n4.  **Numerical Consensus:** All candidate answers that completed the calculation arrived at the same numerical result of approximately 2.229. The different letters they chose (A, B, C, D) are explained by the options being presented to them in a different random order.\n5.  **Final Answer Selection:** The calculated value, rounded to two decimal places, is **2.23**. This corresponds to option B in the problem statement.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a unanimous consensus on the underlying physics and the numerical result. The variations in the final chosen letter are due to the multiple-choice options being presented in a different, randomized order to each agent.\n\nHere is a definitive step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Identify the Goal and Governing Principles**\n\nThe objective is to calculate the luminosity ratio, $L_1/L_2$. This requires combining three fundamental principles of physics, as correctly identified by all agents:\n\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** A star's luminosity ($L$) is determined by its radius ($R$) and surface temperature ($T$) as $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** A star's temperature is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$).\n*   **Doppler Effect:** A star's *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) is shifted from its intrinsic wavelength due to its radial velocity ($v$).\n\n**2. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\n\nFrom the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the two luminosities is:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n**3. Substitute the Radius Ratio**\n\nThe problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$. Substituting this into the formula gives:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n**4. Determine the Temperature Ratio**\n\nThis is the most critical part, connecting the Doppler effect with temperature.\n*   According to Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *intrinsic* wavelength ratio: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}}$.\n*   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$.\n*   We use the Doppler effect formula, $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c)$, for each star:\n    *   Star 1 ($v_1=0$): $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$ (no shift).\n    *   Star 2 ($v_2=700$ km/s): $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$ (redshift).\n*   Equating the observed wavelengths: $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n*   Rearranging to find the intrinsic ratio needed for the temperature calculation gives: $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n*   Therefore, the temperature ratio is: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n**5. Synthesize and Calculate the Final Ratio**\n\nSubstitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity equation from Step 3:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $$\nUsing the given values ($v_2 = 700$ km/s and $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s):\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700}{300,000}\\right)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291 $$\n\nThe result, rounded to two decimal places, is **2.23**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The information about the stars' masses ($M_1 = 1.5 M_2$) is irrelevant for the calculation of black-body luminosity and should be ignored.\n*   **Observed vs. Intrinsic Wavelength**: The core of the problem lies in distinguishing between the *observed* wavelength (which is the same for both stars) and the *intrinsic* wavelength (which is not). The temperature is determined by the intrinsic wavelength.\n*   **Logical Estimation**: Since Star_2 is moving away, its light is redshifted. For it to appear the same color as the stationary Star_1, it must be intrinsically hotter ($T_2 > T_1$). This means the final luminosity ratio must be less than the 2.25 factor from the radii alone. This logical check immediately eliminates options A (~2.25), B (~2.35), and D (~2.32), leaving only ~2.23 as the possible answer.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe derivation and calculation, which are agreed upon by all the provided candidate solutions, show that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately **2.2291**, which rounds to **2.23**. This corresponds to option C in the question.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers shows a remarkable consensus on the physical derivation and numerical result. The discrepancies in the final letter choices are due to the randomization of the multiple-choice options for each agent, not a disagreement on the physics.\n\nHere is a definitive step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify Core Physical Principles**\nTo solve this problem, we must combine three fundamental laws of astrophysics:\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** A star's total power output, or luminosity ($L$), is proportional to its surface area ($4\\pi R^2$) and the fourth power of its surface temperature ($T^4$). The full equation is $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** A star's surface temperature ($T$) is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$), which is the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation in its own rest frame. So, $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength of light ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) is shifted from the intrinsic wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) due to the star's radial velocity ($v$). For an object moving away, the non-relativistic formula is $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c)$.\n\n**2. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\nFrom the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the two stars' luminosities is:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n**3. Incorporate the Radius and Temperature Ratios**\n*   **Radius:** We are given $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$. Substituting this into the formula gives:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n*   **Temperature:** This is the most complex step.\n    *   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *intrinsic* wavelength ratio: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}}$.\n    *   We are given that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$.\n    *   For Star 1 ($v_1=0$), there is no Doppler shift: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n    *   For Star 2 ($v_2=700$ km/s), its light is Doppler redshifted: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Setting the observed wavelengths equal: $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Rearranging to find the intrinsic wavelength ratio needed: $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n**4. Synthesize and Calculate**\nSubstitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity equation:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $$\nUsing the values $v_2 = 700$ km/s and $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700}{300,000}\\right)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291 $$\nThe calculations performed by the agents using Python confirm this result precisely. Rounding to two decimal places gives **2.23**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The information about the stars' masses ($M_1 = 1.5 M_2$) is not relevant to black-body radiation and must be ignored.\n*   **Observed vs. Intrinsic Properties:** The crucial part of the problem is distinguishing between the *observed* peak wavelength (which is the same for both stars) and the *intrinsic* peak wavelength (which is not). Mistaking them as the same would lead to an incorrect answer of 2.25.\n*   **Logical Check:** Because Star 2 is moving away (redshifted), its intrinsic light must be bluer (i.e., it must be hotter, $T_2 > T_1$) for its observed light to match the stationary Star 1. Since $T_1 < T_2$, the temperature ratio factor $(T_1/T_2)^4$ must be less than 1. Therefore, the final answer must be slightly less than 2.25. This simple check eliminates options A, B, and D from consideration.\n*   **The Power of Four:** The temperature term in the Stefan-Boltzmann law is raised to the fourth power. Forgetting to apply this power to the entire temperature ratio term is a common mistake.\n\nBased on the consistent derivation and calculation, the correct value is ~2.23. Matching this to the provided options:\nA) ~2.25\nB) ~2.32\nC) ~2.23\nD) ~2.35\n\nThe calculated value corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting important considerations.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Identify the Relevant Physical Principles**\nThe solution requires the synthesis of three core laws of physics related to stars and black-body radiation:\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a spherical black body is determined by its radius (R) and surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n    $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$\n    where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The surface temperature (T) of a black body is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$), which is the peak wavelength measured in the star's own reference frame.\n    $T \\propto \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}}$\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) is shifted from the intrinsic wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) due to the star's radial velocity (v). For a star moving away, its light is redshifted to longer wavelengths:\n    $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c)$\n\n**2. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law, we can create a ratio of the luminosities of the two stars. This cancels out the constants ($4\\pi\\sigma$):\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n**3. Substitute the Radius Ratio**\nThe problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$. We can substitute this into our formula:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n**4. Determine the Temperature Ratio**\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis, where the Doppler effect and Wien's law are combined.\n*   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *intrinsic* wavelength ratio:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}}$\n*   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are identical:\n    $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$\n*   We relate these observed wavelengths to their intrinsic values using the Doppler effect:\n    *   For Star 1 ($v_1=0$), there is no shift: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$\n    *   For Star 2 ($v_2=700$ km/s), there is a redshift: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$\n*   By equating the observed wavelengths, we get:\n    $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$\n*   We can now find the ratio needed for our temperature calculation:\n    $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$\n*   Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n    $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\nSubstitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity equation from Step 3:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $$\nUsing the values $v_2 = 700$ km/s and $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700}{300,000}\\right)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291 $$\nRounding this to two decimal places gives **2.23**.\n\n### **Careful Points and Potential Pitfalls**\n\n1.  **Extraneous Information**: The mass ratio ($M_1/M_2=1.5$) is irrelevant for the calculation of black-body luminosity and must be ignored.\n2.  **Observed vs. Intrinsic Wavelength**: The most common trap is to incorrectly assume that identical *observed* peak wavelengths mean identical temperatures. The Doppler effect for the receding Star 2 means its light has been redshifted (wavelength increased). For it to be *observed* at the same wavelength as the stationary Star 1, it must have started at a shorter, \"bluer\" wavelength, meaning it is intrinsically hotter ($T_2 > T_1$).\n3.  **Logical Check**: Since $T_1 < T_2$, the temperature correction term $(T_1/T_2)^4$ must be less than 1. Therefore, the final answer must be slightly *less* than the 2.25 value from the radii alone. This immediately eliminates options B (~2.35) and D (~2.32) and makes option C (~2.25) highly unlikely.\n4.  **Mathematical Powers**: Ensure the fourth power from the Stefan-Boltzmann law is applied to the entire temperature ratio term, as correctly derived in the formula.\n\nBased on the consistent and correct derivation across the candidate answers, the calculated luminosity ratio is ~2.229, which rounds to ~2.23.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers and the underlying physics problem reveals a clear and consistent method for arriving at the correct solution. Here is a step-by-step breakdown.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:**\n    The luminosity (L) of a star that radiates as a black body is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$. The ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is therefore:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n2.  **Incorporate the Radius Ratio:**\n    The problem states that Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2, so $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n3.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio:**\n    This is the most critical step and requires combining Wien's Displacement Law with the Doppler Effect.\n    *   Wien's Law states that a star's surface temperature (T) is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$), i.e., $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$. Therefore, the temperature ratio is $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}}$.\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) are identical for both stars: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$.\n    *   The Doppler Effect relates the observed wavelength to the intrinsic wavelength: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c)$.\n        *   For Star_1, with $v_1=0$, there is no shift: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n        *   For Star_2, with $v_2 = 700$ km/s, its light is redshifted: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set them equal: $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Rearranging to get the required ratio for our temperature calculation gives: $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio formula from step 2:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $$\n    Using the values $v_2 = 700$ km/s and $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700}{300,000}\\right)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333...)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291 $$\n    Rounding this result to two decimal places gives **2.23**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Irrelevant Information**: The information about the stars' masses ($M_1 = 1.5 M_2$) is not relevant to the Stefan-Boltzmann law for black-body radiation and should be ignored. All correct candidate analyses did this.\n*   **Observed vs. Intrinsic Wavelength**: The most common potential mistake is to assume that because the *observed* wavelengths are identical, the temperatures must also be identical. The correct approach, as shown by the candidates, is to use the Doppler effect to find the *intrinsic* wavelengths, which are what truly determine the stars' temperatures.\n*   **Logical Check**: Since Star 2 is receding, its light is redshifted to a longer wavelength. For it to be *observed* at the same wavelength as the stationary Star 1, its *intrinsic* wavelength must be shorter (bluer), meaning it is hotter ($T_2 > T_1$). This implies that the term $(T_1/T_2)^4$ is less than 1. Consequently, the final luminosity ratio must be slightly **less than** 2.25. Of the given choices, only ~2.23 satisfies this condition, providing a quick way to validate the answer.\n*   **Consensus on Calculation**: Every candidate answer that followed the correct physical principles arrived at the same numerical result of ~2.229. The inconsistencies in the final letter chosen (A, B, C, etc.) are due to the different, randomized ordering of the options in each agent's specific prompt. The underlying physics and calculation are unambiguously agreed upon.\n\n### Final Decision\nThe calculation yields a value of ~2.229, which rounds to **2.23**. This must be matched against the options provided in the question:\n\nA) ~2.23\nB) ~2.32\nC) ~2.25\nD) ~2.35\n\nThe calculated value corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting key considerations.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Goal and Required Physics**\n\nThe objective is to find the luminosity ratio ($L_1/L_2$) between two stars. A consensus among the provided solutions correctly identifies three essential laws of physics:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity of a star radiating as a black body is given by $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$. This links luminosity ($L$) to the star's radius ($R$) and surface temperature ($T$).\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law:** A star's surface temperature is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$). Therefore, the ratio of temperatures is related to the inverse ratio of their intrinsic wavelengths: $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}/\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n3.  **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) is shifted from the intrinsic wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) due to the star's radial velocity ($v$). For a star moving away, the formula is $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c)$.\n\n### **Step 2: Formulate the Luminosity Ratio Equation**\n\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, we can set up the ratio of luminosities, which causes the constants ($4\\pi$ and $\\sigma$) to cancel out:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n### **Step 3: Substitute the Radius Ratio**\n\nThe problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$. We can substitute this into the equation:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n### **Step 4: Determine the Temperature Ratio**\n\nThis is the most critical step, where the Doppler Effect must be accounted for.\n*   We are given that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$.\n*   For Star_1 ($v_1=0$), there is no Doppler shift, so its observed wavelength is its intrinsic wavelength: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n*   For Star_2 ($v_2=700$ km/s), its light is redshifted, so its observed wavelength is longer than its intrinsic wavelength: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n*   By setting the observed wavelengths equal, we get: $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n*   Using Wien's Law, we need the ratio $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}/\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$ to find the temperature ratio. Rearranging the equation above gives:\n    $$ \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c} $$\n*   Since $T_1/T_2 = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}/\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$, the temperature ratio is:\n    $$ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c} $$\n\n### **Step 5: Final Calculation**\n\nNow, we substitute the temperature ratio back into the equation from Step 3:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $$\nPlugging in the values ($v_2 = 700$ km/s and $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s):\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700}{300,000}\\right)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291 $$\n\n### **Careful Points and Logical Checks**\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The given mass ratio ($M_1/M_2=1.5$) is irrelevant for calculating black-body luminosity and is designed to be a distractor.\n*   **Observed vs. Intrinsic:** The core challenge is distinguishing between the observed property (equal wavelengths) and the intrinsic property (different temperatures). A mistake would be to assume equal temperatures, which would incorrectly yield an answer of 2.25.\n*   **Qualitative Check:** Since Star_2 is moving away, its light is redshifted. For its observed wavelength to match that of the stationary Star_1, its intrinsic wavelength must have been shorter (bluer), meaning Star_2 is intrinsically hotter ($T_2 > T_1$). Therefore, the term $(T_1/T_2)^4$ must be less than 1. This logically proves that the final answer must be less than 2.25. Of the options provided, only ~2.23 fits this criteria.\n*   **Consensus:** All the provided candidate answers that show a correct physical derivation arrive at the same numerical result of ~2.229. The variance in their final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) is due to randomized option ordering, not a disagreement on the physics.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculation yields a luminosity ratio of approximately 2.229, which rounds to **2.23**. This result matches option B from the provided list.\n\nA) ~2.35\nB) ~2.23\nC) ~2.32\nD) ~2.25\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers, there is a strong consensus on the correct physical principles and mathematical derivation. The discrepancies in the final letter choices are due to the randomization of the multiple-choice options for each agent, but the underlying numerical result is consistent.\n\nHere is a definitive step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Physical Principles**\nTo determine the luminosity ratio ($L_1/L_2$), we must use three key concepts from astrophysics:\n1.  **The Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: For a spherical object radiating as a perfect black body, its total luminosity ($L$) is related to its radius ($R$) and surface temperature ($T$) by the formula: $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$.\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: The temperature of a black body is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$), which is the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation in its own frame of reference. This can be written as $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$.\n3.  **The Doppler Effect**: The *observed* wavelength of light ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) is shifted from its intrinsic wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) if the source has a radial velocity ($v$) relative to the observer. For velocities much smaller than the speed of light ($c$), this relationship is $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c)$.\n\n### **Step 2: Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law, we can write the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\nThe problem states that $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, so the radius term is $(1.5)^2 = 2.25$. The equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Temperature Ratio**\nThis is the most critical step and involves combining Wien's Law and the Doppler effect.\n\n1.  From Wien's Law, the ratio of temperatures is the inverse of the ratio of their *intrinsic* wavelengths:\n    $$ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} $$\n2.  The problem gives a crucial piece of information: the *observed* peak wavelengths are identical: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$.\n3.  We apply the Doppler effect to each star to relate observed and intrinsic wavelengths:\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is $v_1 = 0$, so there is no Doppler shift: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is $v_2 = 700 \\text{ km/s}$. Its light is redshifted (shifted to a longer wavelength): $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n4.  Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the two right-hand sides equal:\n    $$ \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}\\left(1 + \\frac{v_2}{c}\\right) $$\n5.  Now we rearrange this to find the intrinsic wavelength ratio we need for the temperature calculation:\n    $$ \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c} $$\n6.  Finally, we can state the temperature ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c} $$\n\n### **Step 4: Final Calculation**\nSubstitute the expression for the temperature ratio back into our luminosity ratio equation from Step 2:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $$\nNow, we plug in the numerical values, using $v_2 = 700 \\text{ km/s}$ and $c \\approx 300,000 \\text{ km/s}$:\n$$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700}{300,000}\\right)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333...)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291 $$\nRounding this result to two decimal places gives **2.23**.\n\n### **Careful Points & Summary**\n*   **Irrelevant Information**: The fact that the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2 is a distractor. Mass-Luminosity relations exist, but they are not needed here since the problem specifies the stars are black bodies and provides information about their radii and temperatures (via their peak wavelengths).\n*   **Intrinsic vs. Observed Wavelengths**: The key is recognizing that while the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same, the Doppler effect on Star_2 implies its *intrinsic* wavelength is shorter (bluer). This means Star_2 is actually hotter than Star_1 ($T_2 > T_1$).\n*   **Logical Check**: Because Star_1 is cooler than Star_2, the temperature ratio term $(T_1/T_2)^4$ is a number slightly less than 1. This means the final answer for the luminosity ratio must be slightly less than the contribution from the radii alone, which was 2.25. Our calculated answer of ~2.23 fits this check perfectly, whereas options like ~2.32 or ~2.35 do not.\n\nThe final calculated value is ~2.23. Matching this to the provided options:\nA) ~2.25\nB) ~2.23\nC) ~2.35\nD) ~2.32\n\nThe correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe problem asks for the luminosity ratio ($L_1/L_2$) between two stars. A review of all candidate answers shows a remarkable consensus on the correct physical principles and derivation.\n\n1.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:**\n    The luminosity ($L$) of a star radiating as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$. The ratio of luminosities for two stars is therefore:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n2.  **Incorporate the Radius Ratio:**\n    We are given that Star_1's radius is 1.5 times Star_2's ($R_1 = 1.5 R_2$). Plugging this into the formula gives:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n3.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio:**\n    This is the most critical step, requiring the combination of Wien's Displacement Law and the Doppler effect.\n    *   From Wien's Law, a star's temperature is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak wavelength ($T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$). Therefore, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the intrinsic wavelength ratio: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest,2}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}}$.\n    *   The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$).\n    *   We must relate these observed wavelengths to the intrinsic wavelengths using the Doppler effect formula, $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c)$.\n        *   For Star_1 ($v_1=0$ km/s): $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n        *   For Star_2 ($v_2=700$ km/s): $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Setting the observed wavelengths equal: $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Rearranging to find the intrinsic wavelength ratio needed for our temperature equation gives: $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Substitute the derived temperature ratio back into the luminosity equation from Step 2:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $$\n    Using the given values ($v_2 = 700$ km/s and the speed of light $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s):\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700}{300,000}\\right)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291 $$\n    Rounding the result to two decimal places gives **2.23**.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Extraneous Information:** The problem states that the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. For a black-body radiation model, mass is not a factor in the Stefan-Boltzmann law. This information is a distracter and should be ignored.\n2.  **Observed vs. Intrinsic Properties:** The most common potential mistake is to assume that since the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same, the stars' temperatures must also be the same. This ignores the Doppler effect. For the redshifted Star_2 to have the same observed wavelength as the stationary Star_1, its intrinsic wavelength must be shorter (bluer), meaning Star_2 is intrinsically hotter.\n3.  **Logical Check:** Since Star_1 is cooler than Star_2 ($T_1 < T_2$), the temperature ratio term $(T_1/T_2)^4$ must be less than 1. This means the final luminosity ratio must be less than the 2.25 factor from the radii alone. Of the choices provided, only ~2.23 fits this logical constraint.\n4.  **Option Discrepancy:** The candidate answers show confusion regarding which letter option (A, B, C, or D) corresponds to the value 2.23. This is because the options were likely presented in a different random order for each agent. The calculation itself is unambiguous. The final choice must be based on matching the calculated value to the specific option list in the question.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe step-by-step derivation, which has a strong consensus among all provided candidate answers, leads to a numerical value of approximately 2.229. Rounding this to two decimal places gives 2.23. Matching this value to the options presented in the problem statement:\n\nA) ~2.35\nB) ~2.25\nC) ~2.32\nD) ~2.23\n\nThe correct answer is ~2.23.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the careful points needed to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Key Physical Principles**\nThe objective is to find the ratio of luminosities ($L_1/L_2$) for two stars. The solution relies on three fundamental laws of physics for stars treated as black-body radiators:\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The total power radiated (luminosity, $L$) by a black body is proportional to its surface area and the fourth power of its surface temperature ($T$). The formula is $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The surface temperature ($T$) of a black body is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$), which is the wavelength at which it radiates most intensely in its own rest frame. So, $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$.\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) of light is shifted from its intrinsic wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) due to the star's radial velocity ($v$). For an object moving away, the light is redshifted: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c)$.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Derivation of the Luminosity Ratio**\n\n*   **Step 1: Formulate the Ratio using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law.**\n    The ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n*   **Step 2: Incorporate the Radius Ratio.**\n    We are given $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$, so $(R_1/R_2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25$.\n    The equation now becomes:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the Temperature Ratio.**\n    This is the most critical part, as it connects the observed brightness with the intrinsic temperatures via the Doppler effect.\n    1.  From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the *intrinsic* wavelength ratio: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}}$.\n    2.  The problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are identical: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$.\n    3.  For Star_1 ($v_1=0$), there is no Doppler shift: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n    4.  For Star_2 ($v_2=700$ km/s), its light is redshifted: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    5.  Equating the observed wavelengths: $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    6.  Rearranging to find the intrinsic wavelength ratio needed for the temperature formula gives: $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    7.  Therefore, the temperature ratio is: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n*   **Step 4: Combine Formulas and Calculate the Final Value.**\n    Substitute the temperature ratio from Step 3 into the luminosity equation from Step 2:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $$\n    Using the given values ($v_2 = 700$ km/s and $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s):\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700}{300,000}\\right)^4} = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + 0.002333...)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291 $$\n\n**3. Careful Points and Logical Checks**\n\n*   **Observed vs. Intrinsic:** The most common mistake is failing to distinguish between observed properties (which are affected by motion) and intrinsic properties (which determine temperature and luminosity). The problem's statement that the stars \"appeared brightest\" at the same wavelength refers to the observed wavelength.\n*   **Doppler Effect Implication:** Because Star 2 is moving away (redshifted), its light appears redder than it actually is. For it to appear the same color as the stationary Star 1, its intrinsic color must be \"bluer,\" meaning it must be hotter ($T_2 > T_1$).\n*   **Logical Estimation:** Since $T_1 < T_2$, the temperature ratio term $(T_1/T_2)^4$ must be less than 1. This means the final answer must be slightly *less than* the 2.25 factor from the radii alone. This immediately rules out options C (~2.25), A (~2.32), and D (~2.35). Only option B (~2.23) is logically possible.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The given mass ratio ($M_1/M_2 = 1.5$) is a distractor and is not used in the black-body luminosity calculation.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe detailed derivation and calculation give a luminosity ratio of approximately 2.2291. Rounding this to two decimal places yields **2.23**. This result is consistent with the logical check that the ratio must be less than 2.25. Comparing this to the provided options:\n\nA) ~2.32\nB) ~2.23\nC) ~2.25\nD) ~2.35\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers and the underlying physics, here is a definitive step-by-step solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Principles:** All valid analyses correctly identify that the solution requires a combination of three physical laws:\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity ($L$) of a star radiating as a black body is given by $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$. This law relates luminosity to a star's radius ($R$) and surface temperature ($T$).\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The temperature ($T$) of a black body is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$). Thus, $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) of light is shifted from its intrinsic wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$) due to the star's radial velocity ($v$). For an object moving away, the non-relativistic formula is $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c)$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio:** From the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities of the two stars is:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n3.  **Incorporate the Radius Ratio:** The problem states $R_1 = 1.5 R_2$. Substituting this into the formula gives:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n4.  **Determine the Temperature Ratio:** This is the most complex step, combining Wien's Law and the Doppler effect.\n    *   From Wien's Law, the temperature ratio is the inverse of the intrinsic wavelength ratio: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}}$.\n    *   We are given that the *observed* peak wavelengths are identical: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$.\n    *   For Star_1 ($v_1=0$), there is no Doppler shift: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n    *   For Star_2 ($v_2=700$ km/s), its light is Doppler redshifted: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   By equating the observed wavelengths, we get: $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Rearranging to find the intrinsic wavelength ratio needed gives: $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Result:** Substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity equation from Step 3:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{v_2}{c}\\right)^4} $$\n    Using the values $v_2 = 700$ km/s and $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s, the calculation yields:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700}{300000}\\right)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333...)^4} \\approx 2.2291 $$\n    Rounding this result to two decimal places gives **2.23**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The fact that the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2 is irrelevant to the calculation of luminosity from black body radiation laws and must be ignored.\n*   **Observed vs. Intrinsic Wavelength:** The core of the problem lies in distinguishing between the observed wavelength (which is the same for both stars) and the intrinsic wavelength (which is not). This distinction necessitates the use of the Doppler effect.\n*   **Logical Check:** Since Star_2 is moving away, its light is redshifted. For its observed color to be the same as the stationary Star_1, it must be intrinsically hotter (i.e., its intrinsic peak wavelength is shorter/bluer). Therefore, $T_2 > T_1$, which means the ratio $(T_1/T_2)^4$ must be less than 1. This confirms that the final answer must be slightly less than the 2.25 value derived from the radii alone, ruling out options like ~2.32 and ~2.35.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThere is an overwhelming consensus among all the provided candidate answers that performed the calculation.

We are told the *observed* peak wavelengths are identical: $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$.\n    2.  For Star_1, with $v_1 = 0$, there is no Doppler shift, so $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$.\n    3.  For Star_2, with $v_2 = 700$ km/s, its light is redshifted, so $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    4.  Since the observed wavelengths are equal, we can set the expressions equal: $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    5.  To use Wien's law, we need the ratio $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}}$. Rearranging the equation gives: $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    6.  Therefore, the temperature ratio is: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n*   **Step C: Final Calculation**\n    Substitute the temperature ratio from Step B into the luminosity equation from Step A:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $$\n    Now, we insert the numerical values ($v_2 = 700$ km/s, $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s):\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{\\left(1 + \\frac{700}{300,000}\\right)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333)^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{1.00937} \\approx 2.2291 $$\n\n**3. Analysis of Careful Points and Conclusion**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Extraneous Data):** The problem provides the mass ratio ($M_1 = 1.5 M_2$). As demonstrated in the derivation, this information is not needed for calculating luminosity based on the black body model and must be ignored.\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Observed vs. Intrinsic Properties):** The most significant potential error is confusing *observed* wavelength with *intrinsic* temperature. The problem states observed wavelengths are equal, not temperatures. The Doppler effect on Star_2 means it must be intrinsically hotter ($T_2 > T_1$) for its observed (redshifted) wavelength to match the stationary Star_1's.\n*   **Careful Point 3 (Logical Check):** Because Star_1 is slightly cooler than Star_2, the luminosity ratio must be slightly *less* than the ratio derived from the radii alone (2.25). Of the options provided, A (~2.32) and B (~2.35) are greater than 2.25. Option D (~2.25) represents the case where the Doppler effect is ignored. Only C (~2.23) is consistent with the physics.\n*   **Final Answer Synthesis:** The calculated value is ~2.229, which rounds to **2.23**. This numerical result is consistently obtained across all candidate answers that performed the derivation correctly. The variation in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) among the candidates is due to randomized option ordering, but the underlying physical result is the same. Matching the calculated value of ~2.23 to the provided option list:\n\n    A) ~2.32\n    B) ~2.35\n    C) ~2.23\n    D) ~2.25\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers and the underlying physics, here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Task and Physical Principles**: The goal is to find the luminosity ratio ($L_1/L_2$) between two stars. A review of the candidate answers confirms that the solution requires combining three fundamental laws of physics:\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity of a star as a black body is $L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$. This relates luminosity to the star's radius ($R$) and surface temperature ($T$).\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law**: A black body's temperature is inversely proportional to its *intrinsic* peak emission wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$), so $T \\propto 1/\\lambda_{\\text{rest}}$.\n    *   **Doppler Effect**: The *observed* wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) is shifted from the intrinsic wavelength due to radial velocity ($v$). For a source moving away, $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest}}(1 + v/c)$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**: Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the two luminosities is:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{4\\pi R_1^2 \\sigma T_1^4}{4\\pi R_2^2 \\sigma T_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n\n3.  **Incorporate Given Ratios and Derive Temperature Ratio**:\n    *   We are given that $R_1/R_2 = 1.5$. Substituting this into the formula gives a factor of $(1.5)^2 = 2.25$. The equation becomes:\n        $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_2}\\right)^4 $$\n    *   To find the temperature ratio, we must relate it to the observed wavelengths. From Wien's Law, we know $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}}$.\n    *   The problem states the *observed* peak wavelengths are identical ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{obs},2}$).\n    *   Using the Doppler effect for each star:\n        *   Star_1 ($v_1=0$): $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}$\n        *   Star_2 ($v_2=700$ km/s): $\\lambda_{\\text{obs},2} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$\n    *   Setting the observed wavelengths equal: $\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1} = \\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}(1 + v_2/c)$.\n    *   Rearranging gives us the intrinsic wavelength ratio: $\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},2}}{\\lambda_{\\text{rest},1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is: $\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}$.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**: We substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity formula:\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + v_2/c}\\right)^4 = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + v_2/c)^4} $$\n    Plugging in the numerical values ($v_2 = 700$ km/s and $c \\approx 300,000$ km/s):\n    $$ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\frac{2.25}{(1 + \\frac{700}{300,000})^4} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{(1.002333)^4} \\approx 2.2291 $$\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The calculated ratio is ~2.229, which rounds to **2.23**. This numerical result is confirmed by every candidate who performed the calculation. The discrepancies in the final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) among the candidates are due to the randomization of options, not a flaw in the physics. Matching our result to the original question's options:\n    *   A) ~2.32\n    *   B) ~2.23\n    *   C) ~2.35\n    *   D) ~2.25\n\nOur calculated value matches option B.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Extraneous Information**: The mass ratio ($M_1/M_2 = 1.5$) is irrelevant for calculating the luminosity of a black body based on its radius and temperature. This information should be disregarded.\n*   **Observed vs. Intrinsic Properties**: The most critical step is understanding the difference between the observed and intrinsic wavelengths. Because Star_2 is moving away (redshifted), its intrinsic wavelength must be shorter (bluer) than Star_1's for their *observed* wavelengths to match. This implies Star_2 is intrinsically hotter ($T_2 > T_1$).\n*   **Logical Check**: Since the radius ratio gives a factor of 2.25 and the temperature ratio $(T_1/T_2)^4$ is less than 1 (because $T_1 < T_2$), the final answer must be less than 2.25. This check immediately eliminates options A, C, and D, leaving only B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
