This anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, was reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product).

This part of the analysis is straightforward.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Major and Minor Products**\n\n*   **This is the most critical decision point of the problem.** The Diels-Alder reaction can form two stereoisomers: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n*   **The General Rule vs. The Exception:** While the general \"Alder-endo rule\" predicts the *endo* isomer to be the major product due to electronic stabilization, this rule can be overridden by steric factors.\n*   **Analysis:** The diene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. In an *endo* approach, the maleic anhydride ring would tuck underneath the diene system, causing severe steric repulsion with the methyl groups at positions C1 and C4. The *exo* approach avoids this steric clash.\n*   **Conclusion for Step 2:** The reaction pathway with the lower energy transition state is the one that avoids steric hindrance. Therefore, this reaction is a classic example of an exception to the endo rule. The stereochemical outcome is:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n*   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to recognize and correctly apply this steric hindrance exception. The most thorough candidate answers correctly identified this point.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the 2D NOESY NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   A **NOESY** spectrum reveals protons that are close in three-dimensional space (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product but absent (or very weak) in the minor product.**\n*   Based on Step 2, we must look for a spatial proximity that is **unique to the *exo* adduct**.\n\n### **Step 4: Assign ¹H NMR Signals and Identify the Key Spatial Interaction**\n\n*   **Signal Assignment:**\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** The two equivalent protons on the anhydride part of the molecule (`H_anhydride`). Their chemical shift is high due to the strong deshielding effect of the adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** One of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7 methylene bridge (`H_bridge`).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (`Me_vinyl`).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\n*   **Structural Analysis of Proximity:**\n    *   **In the Major (*Exo*) Adduct:** The anhydride ring is on the *exo* face, which is on the same side as the C7 methylene bridge. This geometry places the `H_anhydride` protons (~3.5 ppm) very close in space to the `H_bridge` protons (~1.5 ppm). **A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between these two signals.**\n    *   **In the Minor (*Endo*) Adduct:** The anhydride ring is on the *endo* face, tucked underneath the double bond. Here, the `H_anhydride` protons are far from the `H_bridge` protons (so the cross-peak is absent). In this isomer, `H_anhydride` protons are instead close to the `Me_vinyl` protons (~1.7 ppm).\n\n*   **Conclusion for Step 4:** The NOESY cross-peak that distinguishes the major product connects the anhydride protons and a C7 bridge proton.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe key interaction that is present in the major product but absent in the minor product connects:\n*   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (`H_anhydride`)\n*   and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** (`H_bridge`).\n\nThis corresponds directly to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis is a multi-step organic chemistry problem that requires careful analysis of reactants, reaction stereochemistry, and NMR spectroscopy. The solution can be broken down into four main steps.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed by dehydrating a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. The given NMR data—a single ¹H peak at 7 ppm (vinylic protons) and two ¹³C peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons)—are characteristic of a highly symmetrical molecule. These data points unambiguously identify the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, confirms a direct addition of the reactants has occurred (Diene: C₉H₁₄ + Maleic Anhydride: C₄H₂O₃).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Major Product\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. A Diels-Alder reaction can form two stereoisomers: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct.\n*   **The \"Alder-Endo Rule\"** is a general principle stating that the *endo* isomer is typically the major, kinetically favored product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions.\n*   **Exception due to Steric Hindrance:** This general rule is often overridden by significant steric hindrance. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. For the *endo* product to form, the maleic anhydride ring must approach \"underneath\" the diene system, leading to a severe steric clash with the methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions (which become the bridgehead carbons).\n*   **Conclusion:** To avoid this strong steric repulsion, the reaction preferentially proceeds through the less-hindered **exo** transition state. This is a classic example where steric factors control the stereochemical outcome. Therefore, the **Major Product is the *Exo* Adduct**, and the Minor Product is the *Endo* Adduct.\n\n### Step 3: Assign ¹H NMR Signals and Analyze the NOESY Spectrum\nThe question states a cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the **major product** but absent in the minor product. We must therefore find a spatial interaction (a NOESY cross-peak) that is unique to the **exo adduct**.\n\nFirst, let's assign the signals mentioned in the options to the protons in the product:\n*   **`~3.5 ppm (2H singlet)`:** Corresponds to the two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride part of the molecule. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **`~1.7 ppm (6H singlet)`:** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond. Let's call them **Me_vinyl**.\n*   **`~1.5 ppm (1H doublet)`:** Corresponds to one of the two diastereotopic protons on the C7-methylene bridge. Let's call it **H_bridge**.\n*   **`~1.0 ppm (6H singlet)`:** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\nNow, we analyze the spatial proximity in the two isomers:\n*   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the *opposite* side of the bicyclic system from the double bond, pointing towards the C7-bridge. This geometry forces the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) very close to the **H_bridge** proton (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.\n*   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked underneath the double bond. Here, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons. In this isomer, a cross-peak between **H_anhydride** (~3.5 ppm) and **Me_vinyl** (~1.7 ppm) would be observed instead.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\nThe cross-peak that is present in the major product (*exo*) but absent in the minor product (*endo*) is the one connecting the anhydride protons and a C7-bridge proton. The signals for these protons are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nLet's match this conclusion to the provided options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (bridgehead methyls and vinylic methyls)\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridgehead methyls and bridge proton)\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (vinylic methyls and anhydride protons) - This cross-peak is characteristic of the *minor* (endo) product.\n*   D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (bridge proton and anhydride protons) - This cross-peak is characteristic of the *major* (exo) product.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer by synthesizing the provided reasoning from multiple agents.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction\nThere is a unanimous and correct consensus among all provided answers on the identities of the reactants and the nature of the reaction.\n*   **Dienophile:** The spectroscopic data (`¹H NMR`: single peak at 7 ppm; `¹³C NMR`: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) combined with the description (\"anhydride of a cis-dicarboxylic acid\") unambiguously identifies the reactant as **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The molecular formula of the product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) confirms that a simple addition has occurred.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Major and Minor Products\nThis is the most critical step of the problem, as it dictates the structure whose NMR spectrum we must analyze.\n*   A Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct.\n*   **The Alder-Endo Rule vs. Steric Hindrance:** While the general \"endo rule\" predicts the *endo* product as the major kinetic product due to electronic factors (secondary orbital overlap), this rule is often superseded by steric effects. The vast majority of the candidate answers correctly identify that this specific reaction is a classic exception. The diene is extremely bulky due to the four methyl groups. The methyl groups at positions C1 and C4 create severe steric hindrance for the incoming anhydride ring during the *endo* approach.\n*   **Conclusion:** The reaction preferentially proceeds via the less sterically hindered *exo* transition state. Therefore, the stereochemical outcome is:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### Step 3: Assign Proton NMR Signals\nBased on standard chemical shifts, integrations, and multiplicities given in the options, we can assign the key proton signals in the product:\n*   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride part of the bicyclic system (**H_anhydride**). They are highly deshielded by the two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n*   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This is one of the two diastereotopic protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** These are the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** These are the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the 2D NOESY Spectrum\nA NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). The problem states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product**. Based on our analysis, we must look for a spatial proximity that is unique to the **exo adduct**.\n\n*   **In the *Exo* isomer (Major Product):** In this geometry, the anhydride ring is oriented on the same side as the C7-methylene bridge. This arrangement forces the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) into close proximity with the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between these two signals is expected.\n*   **In the *Endo* isomer (Minor Product):** In this geometry, the anhydride ring is tucked underneath the C=C double bond. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far away from the **H_bridge** protons. Instead, they become close to the **Me_vinyl** protons (~1.7 ppm). The cross-peak between H_anhydride and H_bridge would be absent.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major (*exo*) product but absent in the minor (*endo*) product is the one that connects the anhydride protons and a C7-bridge proton. The resonances for these two groups are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nMatching this conclusion to the given options:\n\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n**C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (This interaction is characteristic of the *minor* endo product)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided solutions and applying fundamental chemical principles.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants and the Reaction\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed by dehydrating a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. The spectroscopic data provided (`¹H NMR`: one peak at 7 ppm; `¹³C NMR`: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) are characteristic of a highly symmetrical molecule. This information, including the vinylic and carbonyl chemical shifts, unambiguously identifies the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly stated to be **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The molecular formula of the product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) confirms that a simple addition has occurred.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Major and Minor Products\n\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. A Diels-Alder reaction can form two stereoisomers: the *endo* and the *exo* adduct.\n\n*   **The \"Endo Rule\" vs. Steric Hindrance:** While the Alder-Endo rule generally predicts the *endo* isomer to be the major product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions, this rule is often overridden by significant steric hindrance.\n*   **Application to this Reaction:** The diene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. For the *endo* product to form, the maleic anhydride ring must approach \"underneath\" the diene system, which would cause a severe steric clash between the anhydride and the two methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions of the diene. The *exo* approach avoids this steric repulsion and therefore has a lower activation energy.\n*   **Conclusion:** This is a classic textbook case where steric hindrance controls the outcome, reversing the usual preference.\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### Step 3: Assign ¹H NMR Signals and Analyze the 2D NOESY Spectrum\n\nThe question asks for a NOESY cross-peak that is **present in the major product but absent in the minor one**. Based on our conclusion from Step 2, we must look for a spatial interaction that is unique to the ***exo*** isomer.\n\n*   **Signal Assignment:** From the options provided and general chemical shift knowledge of the symmetrical product:\n    *   `~3.5 ppm (2H singlet)`: The two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride part of the molecule (**H_anhydride**). They are highly deshielded by the two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   `~1.7 ppm (6H singlet)`: The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n    *   `~1.5 ppm (1H doublet)`: One of the two diastereotopic protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n    *   `~1.0 ppm (6H singlet)`: The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n\n*   **Spatial Analysis of Isomers:**\n    *   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the *same side* (*syn*) as the C7-methylene bridge. This rigid geometry holds the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) very close in space to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between these two signals is expected.\n    *   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"underneath\" the C=C double bond, on the opposite side from the C7-bridge. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far away from the **H_bridge** protons, and this NOESY cross-peak would be absent. (Instead, a cross-peak between **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl** would appear in this minor isomer).\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons with a C7-bridge proton. The resonances for these protons are:\n*   A **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   A **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**\n\nThis pair of signals perfectly matches the description in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, highlighting the key points necessary for a correct conclusion.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed by dehydrating a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. The spectroscopic data provided (`¹H NMR`: one peak at 7 ppm; `¹³C NMR`: two peaks at 137 ppm for the alkene carbons and 165 ppm for the carbonyl carbons) indicate a highly symmetrical molecule. This is the classic signature of **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** This is explicitly identified as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The molecular formula of the products, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, is consistent with a direct addition of the two reactants.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Major Product\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. A Diels-Alder reaction can form two stereoisomers: an *endo* and an *exo* adduct.\n*   **The General Endo Rule:** Typically, the *endo* product is the kinetically favored (major) product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions.\n*   **Careful Point: The Steric Hindrance Exception.** The general rule is frequently overridden by significant steric hindrance. In this specific case, the diene is exceptionally bulky due to the four methyl groups. The methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions of the diene create a severe steric clash with the approaching anhydride ring in the transition state that leads to the *endo* product.\n*   **Conclusion:** To avoid this steric repulsion, the reaction preferentially proceeds through the less-hindered **exo** transition state. Therefore, for this specific reaction, the normal stereochemical outcome is reversed:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the 2D NOESY Spectrum\nA NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in three-dimensional space (< 5 Å). The problem states that a cross-peak is **present in the major product but absent in the minor product**. We must therefore identify a spatial proximity that is unique to the **exo isomer**.\n\n### Step 4: Assign ¹H NMR Signals and Visualize the Products\n*   **Careful Point: Assigning Signals.** Based on chemical environment, integration, and the options provided, the signals can be assigned:\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** The two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride part of the molecule (**H_anhydride**). Their high chemical shift is due to the strong deshielding from the two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** One of the two protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\n*   **Careful Point: Visualizing Spatial Proximity.**\n    *   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the *opposite* side (*anti*) of the C7-methylene bridge. In this rigid geometry, the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) are oriented into the concave \"cup\" of the bicyclic system. This brings them very close in space to the *syn*-proton of the C7-bridge (**H_bridge**, ~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between them.\n    *   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the *same* side (*syn*) as the C7-bridge, tucked underneath the double bond. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far from the **H_bridge** protons, and a NOESY cross-peak between them would be absent. (In this minor product, a cross-peak would instead appear between H_anhydride and Me_vinyl).\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons with a bridge proton. This corresponds to the interaction between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**. This pair of resonances directly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the most chemically sound arguments from the provided answers and identifying critical points.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\n\n**Step 1: Identification of Reactants and Reaction**\n*   **Reactant 1 (Dienophile):** The anhydride is formed from a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid and has characteristic NMR data: a single ¹H peak at 7 ppm (two equivalent vinylic protons) and two ¹³C peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons). This high symmetry and these chemical shifts unambiguously identify the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**. There is a unanimous consensus on this point across all candidate answers.\n*   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** The diene is explicitly stated to be **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) confirms that a simple addition has occurred.\n\n**Step 2: Determination of Major and Minor Products (The Most Critical Step)**\n*   A Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   The **Alder-endo rule** is a general principle suggesting that the *endo* product is usually the major, kinetically favored product due to secondary orbital interactions. Several agents based their conclusions on this general rule.\n*   However, the rule is frequently superseded by **steric hindrance**. The diene in this problem is exceptionally bulky. The methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions create a severe steric clash with the maleic anhydride ring during the *endo* approach.\n*   **Conclusion:** The reaction will preferentially proceed via the less-hindered *exo* transition state. This is a classic textbook exception to the endo rule. Therefore, the stereochemical outcome is:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n    This is the most chemically sound conclusion and is supported by the reasoning in the majority of the provided answers, even if some of them failed to select the correct final letter.\n\n**Step 3: Assignment of ¹H NMR Signals and Analysis of NOESY Data**\n*   The question asks for a NOESY cross-peak that is **present in the major product but absent in the minor product**. Based on our analysis, we must find a spatial interaction unique to the *exo* isomer.\n*   The signals in the options can be assigned as follows:\n    *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** Protons on the anhydride ring (**H_anhydride**). They are highly deshielded by the adjacent carbonyls.\n    *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** Vinylic methyl protons (**Me_vinyl**).\n    *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** A proton on the C7 methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n    *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** Bridgehead methyl protons.\n*   Let's analyze the spatial proximities in the two isomers:\n    *   **Major (*Exo*) Isomer:** In this structure, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7-methylene bridge. The anhydride protons (**H_anhydride**) are located in the \"cup\" of the bicyclic system, which brings them very close to the bridge proton (**H_bridge**). A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between them.\n    *   **Minor (*Endo*) Isomer:** Here, the anhydride ring is tucked under the C=C double bond. In this arrangement, **H_anhydride** protons are far from **H_bridge** protons, so the corresponding cross-peak would be absent. Instead, a cross-peak between **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl** (~1.7 ppm) would be characteristic of this minor isomer.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n*   The NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons with a C7-bridge proton.\n*   This corresponds to an interaction between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n*   Reviewing the options:\n    *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n    *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm *(This is the peak for the MINOR product)*\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n    *   D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm *(This perfectly matches the interaction for the MAJOR product)*\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem by evaluating the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of Reactants and Reaction\n*   **Reactant 1 (Dienophile):** An anhydride is formed by dehydrating a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. The NMR data show high symmetry: a single proton peak at 7 ppm (¹H NMR) and two carbon peaks at 137 ppm (alkene) and 165 ppm (carbonyl) in the ¹³C NMR. This is the classic spectroscopic signature of **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** The problem explicitly identifies the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. This is confirmed by the molecular formula of the product, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which is the sum of the reactants' formulas (C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃).\n\n### Step 2: Determination of the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry)\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. A Diels-Alder reaction can form two stereoisomeric products: *endo* and *exo*.\n*   **The General Principle (Alder-Endo Rule):** In many cases, the *endo* product is favored kinetically due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n*   **The Overriding Factor (Steric Hindrance):** This general rule is not absolute and is frequently overridden by severe steric hindrance. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is extremely bulky. The methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions (which become the bridgehead carbons in the product) create a significant steric clash with the maleic anhydride ring as it approaches in the *endo* orientation.\n*   **Conclusion:** The reaction will preferentially proceed through the sterically less-hindered *exo* transition state. This is a classic textbook example where steric effects control the stereochemical outcome. Therefore:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the 2D NOESY Spectrum\nA Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY) experiment identifies protons that are close to each other in three-dimensional space (< 5 Å). The problem asks us to find a cross-peak that is **present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product**. Based on Step 2, this means we must find a spatial interaction that is unique to the ***exo*** **isomer**.\n\n### Step 4: Assignment of NMR Signals and Structural Analysis\nFirst, let's assign the proton signals mentioned in the options based on their typical chemical environments and integrations in the product, which has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** Corresponds to the two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring (**H_anhydride**). Their high chemical shift is due to being adjacent to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n*   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** Corresponds to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\nNext, we analyze the spatial proximity in each isomer:\n*   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the *same side* of the bicyclic system as the C7-methylene bridge. In this rigid geometry, the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) are physically close to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.\n*   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the *opposite side* of the C7 bridge, tucked underneath the double bond. Here, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons, and a cross-peak between them would be absent. (In this isomer, the H_anhydride protons are instead close to the Me_vinyl protons at ~1.7 ppm).\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons and a C7-bridge proton. The signals for these two protons are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nMatching this to the options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n*   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (This cross-peak identifies the minor product)\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n\nThe correct option is B, as it accurately describes the interaction between the bridge proton and the anhydride protons in the major exo product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Careful Point 1: Identify the Reactants Correctly**\n\n*   **The Dienophile:** The starting material is an anhydride formed by dehydrating a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. Its spectroscopic data (`¹H` NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm; `¹³C` NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) are crucial. The high symmetry (one proton signal, two carbon signals) and characteristic chemical shifts (vinylic and carbonyl regions) unambiguously identify the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **The Diene:** This reactant is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n### **Careful Point 2: Determine the Major Product (Stereochemistry)**\n\n*   This is the most critical step of the analysis. The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**, which can produce two stereoisomers: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct.\n*   The general guiding principle is the **Alder-Endo Rule**, which suggests the *endo* product is usually the major, kinetically favored product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n*   **Crucial Exception:** This rule is frequently overridden by severe **steric hindrance**. The diene used here is exceptionally bulky due to its four methyl groups. During the approach to form the *endo* product, the methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions would sterically clash with the incoming maleic anhydride ring. The *exo* approach avoids this clash, making its transition state lower in energy and thus kinetically favored.\n*   **Conclusion on Stereochemistry:** The **Major Product is the *Exo* Adduct**, and the Minor Product is the *Endo* Adduct. This is a well-known exception and a common \"trick\" in problems of this type.\n\n### **Careful Point 3: Assign NMR Signals and Analyze the NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   A **2D NOESY** spectrum reveals which protons are close to each other in 3D space (< 5 Å), generating a \"cross-peak\" between their signals.\n*   We are looking for a cross-peak that is **present in the major product (*exo*) but absent (or very weak) in the minor product (*endo*)**.\n*   We must first assign the signals described in the options to the protons in the product:\n    *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** The two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride part of the molecule. Let's call these **H_anhydride**.\n    *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** The protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the product's double bond. Let's call these **Me_vinyl**.\n    *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** One of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7-methylene bridge. Let's call this **H_bridge**.\n    *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** The protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n\n### **Careful Point 4: Correlate Structure with NOESY Data**\n\n*   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C=C bond bridge. This rigid geometry points the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) towards the C7-methylene bridge, bringing them into very close proximity with the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between them.\n*   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is \"tucked under\" the C=C bond bridge. In this arrangement, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons, and the corresponding NOESY cross-peak would be absent. (Instead, a new cross-peak between **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl** at ~1.7 ppm would appear in the minor product's spectrum).\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons with a bridge proton. The resonances for these protons are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**. This description matches option C precisely.\n\n*   A) `6H singlet (~1 ppm)` & `6H singlet (~1.7 ppm)`: Bridgehead methyls & vinylic methyls. Not the key distinguishing peak.\n*   B) `6H singlet (~1.7 ppm)` & `2H singlet (~3.5 ppm)`: Vinylic methyls & anhydride protons. This peak is characteristic of the **minor** *endo* product.\n*   C) `1H doublet (~1.5 ppm)` & `2H singlet (~3.5 ppm)`: Bridge proton & anhydride protons. This peak is characteristic of the **major** *exo* product.\n*   D) The original prompt contains a typo where D is identical to B. If it were a unique option (e.g., bridgehead methyls and a bridge proton), it would also not be the correct answer.\n\nThe most chemically sound reasoning path leads directly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of a Diels-Alder reaction, focusing on stereochemistry and its correlation with 2D NMR spectroscopy.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis and Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Reactant Identification:** The first step is to identify the reactants from the information given.\n    *   **Dienophile:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. The resulting anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm (vinylic protons) and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons). This high degree of symmetry and the characteristic chemical shifts unambiguously identify the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   **Diene:** This is explicitly stated as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n\n2.  **Stereochemistry (The Most Critical Point):** The next step is to determine the stereochemical outcome of the reaction, which will dictate which product is major and which is minor.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can form two stereoisomers: *endo* and *exo*.\n    *   **The General Endo Rule:** Under electronic control, the *endo* product is typically favored kinetically due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions. A naive analysis would incorrectly assign the *endo* product as major.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Recognizing Exceptions.** This reaction is a classic textbook exception to the endo rule due to severe **steric hindrance**. The diene is extremely bulky. During the *endo* approach, the two methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions of the diene would clash with the approaching anhydride ring. The reaction, therefore, proceeds preferentially through the sterically less-hindered *exo* transition state.\n    *   **Conclusion on Stereochemistry:** The **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the minor product is the *endo* adduct.\n\n3.  **Proton NMR Signal Assignment:** We need to assign the signals given in the options to specific protons in the product. The product is symmetrical.\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** Protons on the anhydride ring, deshielded by two adjacent carbonyl groups. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** One of the two diastereotopic protons on the C7 methylene bridge. Let's call it **H_bridge**.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** The protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond. Let's call them **Me_vinyl**.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** The protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\n4.  **2D NOESY Spectrum Analysis:** A NOESY cross-peak appears between protons that are close in 3D space (< 5 Å). We are looking for a cross-peak that is **present in the major (*exo*) product** but absent in the minor (*endo*) product.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Visualizing 3D Structures.**\n        *   **Major (*exo*) Product:** The anhydride ring is on the *same side* (*syn*) as the C7-methylene bridge. In this rigid bicyclic system, the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) are spatially very close to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOE between them is expected.\n        *   **Minor (*endo*) Product:** The anhydride ring is on the *opposite side* (*anti*) of the C7-methylene bridge, tucked underneath the double bond. In this isomer, **H_anhydride** protons are far from **H_bridge** protons, so this specific NOE would be absent. (An NOE between **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl** would appear instead).\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The distinguishing cross-peak that is present in the major product but not the minor one is the interaction between the anhydride protons and a bridge proton.\n    *   This corresponds to the signals: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Accurately Mapping to Options.** We must carefully match our conclusion to the given options. The option describing this interaction is D.\n\n        *   A) ~1.7 ppm & ~3.5 ppm -> This is `Me_vinyl` and `H_anhydride`, characteristic of the *minor* (endo) product.\n        *   B) ~1.0 ppm & ~1.5 ppm -> Bridgehead methyl and bridge proton.\n        *   C) ~1.0 ppm & ~1.7 ppm -> Bridgehead methyl and vinylic methyl.\n        *   D) ~1.5 ppm & ~3.5 ppm -> This is `H_bridge` and `H_anhydride`, characteristic of the **major** (*exo*) product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and reaching a final conclusion.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of Reactants and Reaction\nThis initial step is foundational and is correctly identified by all candidate agents.\n*   **Dienophile:** A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to an anhydride with a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. The high symmetry and characteristic chemical shifts (vinylic and carbonyl regions) unambiguously identify this molecule as **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly stated as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, is the sum of the reactants' formulas (C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃), confirming a direct addition has occurred.\n\n### Step 2: Determination of the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry)\nThis is the most critical decision point of the problem and requires careful consideration of competing factors.\n*   A Diels-Alder reaction can form two stereoisomers: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct.\n*   The **\"Alder-Endo Rule\"** is a general guideline predicting that the *endo* product is usually favored kinetically due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n*   However, this rule is frequently overridden by significant **steric hindrance**. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is extremely bulky. During the *endo* approach, where the anhydride ring tucks underneath the diene system, a severe steric clash occurs between the anhydride and the methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions of the diene.\n*   The alternative *exo* approach avoids this steric clash, making its transition state lower in energy and therefore kinetically favored. This is a classic, well-documented exception to the endo rule.\n*   **Conclusion:** All 15 candidate answers correctly conclude in their reasoning that steric effects are dominant. Therefore:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of NMR Signals and NOESY Data\nWe must identify a cross-peak in the 2D NOESY spectrum that is **present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product**. This requires identifying a spatial proximity unique to the *exo* isomer.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Signal Assignments:** Based on the integrations and chemical shifts provided in the options, we can assign the signals to protons in the symmetrical product:\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** The two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring (**H_anhydride**).\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** One of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\n*   **Spatial Proximity Analysis:**\n    *   **In the *exo* adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the same side of the bicyclic system as the C7-methylene bridge.

Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning.\n\n### **Step 1: Identification of Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from dehydrating a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid containing an alkene. The provided NMR data is key:\n    *   ¹H NMR: A single peak at ~7 ppm. This indicates two chemically equivalent vinylic protons.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: Two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons).\n    *   This high degree of symmetry and the characteristic chemical shifts unambiguously identify the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, is the sum of the reactants' formulas (C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃), confirming a direct addition has occurred.\n\n### **Step 2: Determination of the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry)**\nThis is the most critical step of the problem, as it determines which structure's NOESY spectrum we must analyze.\n*   A Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and the *exo* adducts.\n*   **The \"Alder-Endo Rule\" vs. Steric Hindrance:** The general endo rule predicts that the *endo* adduct is the kinetically favored major product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions. However, this rule is often overridden by significant steric hindrance.\n*   **Analysis:** The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. During the *endo* approach, the two methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions of the diene create a severe steric clash with the approaching maleic anhydride ring. The alternative *exo* approach avoids this clash. Consequently, the transition state for the *exo* product is lower in energy, making it the major kinetic product. This is a classic textbook example where steric effects control the stereochemical outcome.\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of the 2D NOESY Spectrum and Signal Assignment**\n*   **Principle:** A NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in three-dimensional space (< 5 Å). We are looking for a cross-peak that is **present in the major product (*exo*) but absent in the minor product (*endo*)**.\n*   **Signal Assignment:** We can assign the signals from the options based on their chemical environment and integration:\n    *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring of the bicyclic system (**H_anhydride**). Their high chemical shift is due to being deshielded by two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This represents one of the two diastereotopic protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n    *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** The protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n    *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** The protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\n*   **Structural Analysis (Spatial Proximity):**\n    *   **Major (*Exo*) Adduct:** In this structure, the anhydride ring is on the *same* side of the bicyclic system as the C7-methylene bridge. In this rigid geometry, the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) are physically close to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between them.\n    *   **Minor (*Endo*) Adduct:** In this structure, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side, tucked underneath the double bond. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far away from the **H_bridge** protons, and a cross-peak would be absent. (Instead, a cross-peak between H_anhydride and the vinylic methyls, Me_vinyl at ~1.7 ppm, would be characteristic of this minor product).\n\n### **Step 4: Final Conclusion**\nThe NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*exo*) product is the one connecting the anhydride protons and a C7-bridge proton.\n*   These protons correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n*   This combination exactly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer by synthesizing the provided candidate responses and applying core chemical principles.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Reactants and the Reaction**\n\nThere is unanimous agreement among all candidate answers on this point.\n*   **Dienophile:** The starting material is described as an anhydride formed from a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. The NMR data—a single ¹H peak at 7 ppm (vinylic H) and two ¹³C peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl C)—are the classic spectroscopic signature of **maleic anhydride**. Its high symmetry accounts for the simplicity of the spectra.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, confirms it is a direct sum of the reactants' formulas (C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃).\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry)**\n\nThis is the most critical decision point of the problem and the source of divergence among the candidate answers.\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   **The \"Alder-Endo Rule\":** As a general principle, the *endo* product is often the kinetically favored (and therefore major) product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions. Some of the candidate answers incorrectly applied only this general rule.\n*   **The Steric Hindrance Exception:** This rule is frequently overridden by severe steric hindrance. The diene in this problem is extremely bulky due to the four methyl groups. The methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions (which become the bridgehead carbons) create a significant steric clash with the anhydride ring as it approaches in the *endo* orientation (tucked under the diene). The *exo* approach avoids this steric repulsion and therefore has a lower activation energy.\n*   **Conclusion on Stereochemistry:** The chemically sound conclusion, supported by the reasoning in the majority of the candidate answers, is that steric effects dominate in this specific reaction. Therefore:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the 2D NOESY NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   A **NOESY** spectrum reveals which protons are close to each other in three-dimensional space (< 5 Å).\n*   The problem asks to identify the resonances for a cross-peak that is **present in the major product** but **absent (or very weak) in the minor product**.\n*   Based on Step 2, we must look for a spatial proximity that is unique to the **exo isomer**.\n\n### **Step 4: Assign Proton Signals and Visualize the Key Spatial Interaction**\n\nThe proton signals described in the options can be assigned based on their chemical environment in the product:\n*   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** The two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride part of the molecule (**H_anhydride**). Their high chemical shift is due to the strong deshielding effect of the adjacent carbonyl groups.\n*   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** Corresponds to one of the two diastereotopic protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\nNow we analyze the 3D structures:\n*   **In the *Exo* isomer (Major Product):** In the exo adduct, the anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7-methylene bridge. This rigid bicyclic geometry forces the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) into close proximity with the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between these two signals is expected.\n*   **In the *Endo* isomer (Minor Product):** In the endo adduct, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7-methylene bridge. In this orientation, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons. Instead, they are close to the **Me_vinyl** protons (~1.7 ppm). The cross-peak between H_anhydride and H_bridge would be absent.\n\n### **Step 5: Conclude and Select the Final Answer**\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is characteristic of the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons and a C7-bridge proton. The corresponding resonances are:\n*   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**\n\nMatching this pair with the given options:\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\nB) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n\nThe pair of resonances identified through our step-by-step analysis is described in **Option B**.\n\nA review of the candidate answers shows that while the final lettered choices vary, the majority of the detailed reasoning sections correctly identify the key chemical principles (Exo product is major, NOE is between bridge and anhydride protons). The discrepancies in the final answers arise from errors in matching this correct reasoning to the specific letters of the options. The sound chemical argument points unequivocally to B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer by synthesizing and critically evaluating the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction\nThis is the most straightforward part of the problem, and there is a universal consensus among the candidate answers.\n*   **Dienophile:** The description is of an anhydride formed from a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid with highly symmetrical NMR spectra (`¹H`: one singlet at 7 ppm; `¹³C`: two signals at 137 ppm and 165 ppm). This unambiguously identifies the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, confirms a direct addition has occurred.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Major and Minor Products\nThis is the most critical decision point. A correct analysis here is essential for solving the problem.\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct.\n*   **The \"Alder-Endo Rule\" vs. Steric Hindrance:** While the general *endo rule* predicts the *endo* product to be the major kinetic product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions, this rule can be overridden by steric effects.\n*   **Correct Analysis:** The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. The methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions create a severe steric clash with the maleic anhydride ring during the *endo* approach (where the anhydride is tucked \"under\" the diene). To avoid this significant steric repulsion, the reaction proceeds preferentially through the less-hindered *exo* transition state. This is a classic and well-documented exception to the endo rule.\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n    The vast majority of the candidate answers correctly identified this critical exception, establishing a strong foundation for the subsequent steps.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the 2D NOESY NMR Spectrum\n*   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in three-dimensional space (< 5 Å), regardless of their bonding connections.\n*   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product but absent (or very weak) in the minor product**.\n*   Based on our conclusion from Step 2, we must look for a spatial proximity that is unique to the **exo isomer**.\n\n### Step 4: Assign NMR Signals and Visualize the Products\nFirst, let's assign the signals described in the options to the protons in the product. The product has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** Corresponds to the two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride part of the molecule (**H_anhydride**). Their high chemical shift is due to being adjacent to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** Corresponds to one of the two diastereotopic protons on the C7 methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n*   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\nNow, let's analyze the 3D structures to identify the unique NOE interaction:\n*   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring points *away* from the larger C=C bridge and *towards* the smaller C7 methylene bridge. This geometry forces the anhydride protons (**H_anhydride**, ~3.5 ppm) into close proximity with the protons on the C7 bridge (**H_bridge**, ~1.5 ppm). **A strong NOESY cross-peak between these two signals is expected.**\n*   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"underneath\" the C=C bridge. In this arrangement, the **H_anhydride** protons are very far from the **H_bridge** protons, and the corresponding NOESY cross-peak would be absent. (In this minor isomer, a strong NOE would instead be seen between **H_anhydride** and the vinylic methyl protons, **Me_vinyl**, at ~1.7 ppm).\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major (*exo*) product but absent in the minor (*endo*) product is the one connecting the anhydride protons and a C7 bridge proton.\n*   These are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nMatching this finding with the provided options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (This is the characteristic interaction of the *minor* endo product).\n*   C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (**This perfectly matches the characteristic interaction of the *major* exo product**).\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n\nThe most consistent and chemically sound line of reasoning points directly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points required to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identification of the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Careful Point**: The first step is to correctly identify the starting materials from the provided spectroscopic data and chemical description.\n*   **Dienophile**: An anhydride is formed by dehydrating a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. Its NMR spectra show extreme simplicity: a single ¹H peak at 7 ppm and only two ¹³C peaks at 137 ppm (alkene) and 165 ppm (carbonyl). This high degree of symmetry and the characteristic chemical shifts are definitive for **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene**: This reactant is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction Type**: The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, confirms a simple addition of the two reactants has occurred without any loss of atoms.\n\n**2. Determination of the Major Product's Stereochemistry**\n*   **Careful Point**: This is the most critical decision in the entire problem. The outcome of the NOESY analysis depends entirely on correctly identifying the major stereoisomer.\n*   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: *endo* and *exo*.\n*   **The General \"Endo Rule\"**: For most Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is favored kinetically due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the diene's π-system and the dienophile's substituents. A naive analysis would assume the major product is *endo*.\n*   **The Overriding Factor: Steric Hindrance**: This problem presents a classic exception to the endo rule. The diene is exceptionally bulky, with four methyl groups. The methyl groups at positions C1 and C4 create a severe steric clash with the maleic anhydride ring during the *endo* approach. The alternative *exo* approach avoids this steric repulsion and is therefore faster (kinetically favored).\n*   **Conclusion**: Due to overwhelming steric hindrance, the **Major Product is the *Exo* Adduct**, and the Minor Product is the *Endo* Adduct.\n\n**3. Interpretation of the 2D NOESY Spectrum**\n*   **Careful Point**: Understanding what a NOESY spectrum shows is key. A cross-peak indicates that two protons are physically close to each other in 3D space (< 5 Å), regardless of how many bonds separate them.\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**.\n*   Based on our conclusion from Step 2, we must look for a proton-proton interaction that is present **only in the *exo* adduct**.\n\n**4. Correlating Structure with Specific NMR Signals**\n*   **Careful Point**: We must correctly assign the proton signals described in the options and then visualize their positions in the 3D structures of the *exo* and *endo* products.\n*   **Signal Assignments**:\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**: These are the two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring, which we can label `H_anhydride`. They are strongly deshielded by the adjacent carbonyls.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**: This is one of the protons on the C7-methylene bridge, labeled `H_bridge`.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**: These are the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond, labeled `Me_vinyl`.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**: These are the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n*   **Spatial Analysis**:\n    *   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product)**: The anhydride ring is on the same side of the bicyclic system as the C7-bridge. This rigid geometry places the `H_anhydride` protons (~3.5 ppm) in very close proximity to the `H_bridge` protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.\n    *   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product)**: The anhydride ring is on the opposite side, tucked \"under\" the double bond. Here, the `H_anhydride` protons are far from the `H_bridge` protons, and no cross-peak would appear between them. Instead, in this isomer, a cross-peak would be seen between `H_anhydride` (~3.5 ppm) and `Me_vinyl` (~1.7 ppm).\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is uniquely present in the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons with a bridge proton. The corresponding NMR signals are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**. This description matches option A perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem based on fundamental chemical principles and evaluating the candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of the Reactants and Reaction\nThis part is straightforward and consistently identified correctly by all candidate answers.\n*   **Dienophile:** A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to an anhydride. The spectroscopic data for this anhydride (`¹H NMR`: one peak at 7 ppm; `¹³C NMR`: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) are the classic signature of **maleic anhydride**. Its C₂ᵥ symmetry explains why the two chemically equivalent vinylic protons give a single peak, and the two sets of equivalent carbons (vinylic and carbonyl) give two peaks.\n*   **Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, confirms it is a direct addition of the reactants (C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃).\n\n### Step 2: Determination of the Major Product (Stereochemistry)\nThis is the most critical step of the problem, as it dictates the rest of the analysis.\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct.\n*   **The \"Alder-Endo Rule\"** is a general principle that predicts the *endo* isomer to be the major, kinetically favored product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n*   **The Exception (Steric Hindrance):** This rule is a guideline and is often overridden by significant steric effects. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. In the transition state leading to the *endo* product, the anhydride ring must approach from \"underneath\" the diene, leading to a severe steric clash with the methyl groups at positions C1 and C4.\n*   To avoid this significant steric repulsion, the reaction preferentially proceeds through the less-hindered **exo** transition state. This is a classic textbook example where steric hindrance dictates the stereochemical outcome.\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### Step 3: Assignment of NMR Signals and Analysis of NOESY Spectrum\nThe question asks to identify a NOESY cross-peak that is **present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product**. Based on our conclusion from Step 2, we must find a spatial proximity that is unique to the **exo** isomer.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Signal Assignments:** Based on the integrations, multiplicities, and typical chemical shifts provided in the options, we can assign the proton signals in the symmetrical product:\n    *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** Corresponds to the two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n    *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond. Let's call them **Me_vinyl**.\n    *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** Corresponds to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7-methylene bridge. Let's call it **H_bridge**.\n    *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n\n*   **Spatial Proximity in the Isomers:**\n    *   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the *same side (syn)* of the bicyclic system as the C7-methylene bridge. This rigid geometry places the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) close in space to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.\n    *   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the *opposite side (anti)* of the C7-methylene bridge, tucked \"under\" the C=C double bond. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far away from the **H_bridge** protons, and the corresponding NOESY cross-peak would be absent. (In this isomer, a different strong NOE would appear between **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl**).\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\nThe NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*exo*) product is the one that connects the anhydride protons and a C7-bridge proton.\n*   The resonances for these interacting protons are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nMatching this conclusion to the options provided in the question:\n*   **A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** - This perfectly matches our analysis for the major (*exo*) product.\n*   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** - This interaction is characteristic of the minor (*endo*) product.\n*   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** - This connects a bridgehead methyl to a bridge proton. While possible, it is not the key interaction that distinguishes the *exo* and *endo* isomers based on the anhydride ring's position.\n*   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** - This connects a bridgehead methyl to a vinylic methyl.\n\nThe reasoning points unequivocally to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

In an *endo* approach, the maleic anhydride ring would tuck underneath the diene system, causing severe steric repulsion with the methyl groups at positions C1 and C4. The *exo* approach avoids this steric clash.\n*   **Conclusion for Step 2:** The reaction pathway with the lower energy transition state is the one that avoids steric hindrance.

This geometry places the `H_anhydride` protons (~3.5 ppm) very close in space to the `H_bridge` protons (~1.5 ppm). **A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between these two signals.**\n    *   **In the Minor (*Endo*) Adduct:** The anhydride ring is on the *endo* face, tucked underneath the double bond. Here, the `H_anhydride` protons are far from the `H_bridge` protons (so the cross-peak is absent). In this isomer, `H_anhydride` protons are instead close to the `Me_vinyl` protons (~1.7 ppm).\n\n*   **Conclusion for Step 4:** The NOESY cross-peak that distinguishes the major product connects the anhydride protons and a C7 bridge proton.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe key interaction that is present in the major product but absent in the minor product connects:\n*   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (`H_anhydride`)\n*   and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** (`H_bridge`).\n\nThis corresponds directly to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis is a multi-step organic chemistry problem that requires careful analysis of reactants, reaction stereochemistry, and NMR spectroscopy. The solution can be broken down into four main steps.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed by dehydrating a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. The given NMR data—a single ¹H peak at 7 ppm (vinylic protons) and two ¹³C peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons)—are characteristic of a highly symmetrical molecule. These data points unambiguously identify the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, confirms a direct addition of the reactants has occurred (Diene: C₉H₁₄ + Maleic Anhydride: C₄H₂O₃).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Major Product\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. A Diels-Alder reaction can form two stereoisomers: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct.\n*   **The \"Alder-Endo Rule\"** is a general principle stating that the *endo* isomer is typically the major, kinetically favored product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions.\n*   **Exception due to Steric Hindrance:** This general rule is often overridden by significant steric hindrance. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. For the *endo* product to form, the maleic anhydride ring must approach \"underneath\" the diene system, leading to a severe steric clash with the methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions (which become the bridgehead carbons).\n*   **Conclusion:** To avoid this strong steric repulsion, the reaction preferentially proceeds through the less-hindered **exo** transition state. This is a classic example where steric factors control the stereochemical outcome. Therefore, the **Major Product is the *Exo* Adduct**, and the Minor Product is the *Endo* Adduct.\n\n### Step 3: Assign ¹H NMR Signals and Analyze the NOESY Spectrum\nThe question states a cross-peak is present in the spectrum of the **major product** but absent in the minor product. We must therefore find a spatial interaction (a NOESY cross-peak) that is unique to the **exo adduct**.\n\nFirst, let's assign the signals mentioned in the options to the protons in the product:\n*   **`~3.5 ppm (2H singlet)`:** Corresponds to the two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride part of the molecule. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n*   **`~1.7 ppm (6H singlet)`:** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond. Let's call them **Me_vinyl**.\n*   **`~1.5 ppm (1H doublet)`:** Corresponds to one of the two diastereotopic protons on the C7-methylene bridge. Let's call it **H_bridge**.\n*   **`~1.0 ppm (6H singlet)`:** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\nNow, we analyze the spatial proximity in the two isomers:\n*   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the *opposite* side of the bicyclic system from the double bond, pointing towards the C7-bridge. This geometry forces the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) very close to the **H_bridge** proton (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.\n*   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked underneath the double bond. Here, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons. In this isomer, a cross-peak between **H_anhydride** (~3.5 ppm) and **Me_vinyl** (~1.7 ppm) would be observed instead.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\nThe cross-peak that is present in the major product (*exo*) but absent in the minor product (*endo*) is the one connecting the anhydride protons and a C7-bridge proton. The signals for these protons are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nLet's match this conclusion to the provided options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (bridgehead methyls and vinylic methyls)\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (bridgehead methyls and bridge proton)\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (vinylic methyls and anhydride protons) - This cross-peak is characteristic of the *minor* (endo) product.\n*   D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (bridge proton and anhydride protons) - This cross-peak is characteristic of the *major* (exo) product.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer by synthesizing the provided reasoning from multiple agents.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction\nThere is a unanimous and correct consensus among all provided answers on the identities of the reactants and the nature of the reaction.\n*   **Dienophile:** The spectroscopic data (`¹H NMR`: single peak at 7 ppm; `¹³C NMR`: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) combined with the description (\"anhydride of a cis-dicarboxylic acid\") unambiguously identifies the reactant as **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The molecular formula of the product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) confirms that a simple addition has occurred.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Major and Minor Products\nThis is the most critical step of the problem, as it dictates the structure whose NMR spectrum we must analyze.\n*   A Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct.\n*   **The Alder-Endo Rule vs. Steric Hindrance:** While the general \"endo rule\" predicts the *endo* product as the major kinetic product due to electronic factors (secondary orbital overlap), this rule is often superseded by steric effects. The vast majority of the candidate answers correctly identify that this specific reaction is a classic exception. The diene is extremely bulky due to the four methyl groups. The methyl groups at positions C1 and C4 create severe steric hindrance for the incoming anhydride ring during the *endo* approach.\n*   **Conclusion:** The reaction preferentially proceeds via the less sterically hindered *exo* transition state. Therefore, the stereochemical outcome is:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### Step 3: Assign Proton NMR Signals\nBased on standard chemical shifts, integrations, and multiplicities given in the options, we can assign the key proton signals in the product:\n*   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride part of the bicyclic system (**H_anhydride**). They are highly deshielded by the two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n*   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This is one of the two diastereotopic protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** These are the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** These are the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the 2D NOESY Spectrum\nA NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (< 5 Å). The problem states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product**. Based on our analysis, we must look for a spatial proximity that is unique to the **exo adduct**.\n\n*   **In the *Exo* isomer (Major Product):** In this geometry, the anhydride ring is oriented on the same side as the C7-methylene bridge. This arrangement forces the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) into close proximity with the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between these two signals is expected.\n*   **In the *Endo* isomer (Minor Product):** In this geometry, the anhydride ring is tucked underneath the C=C double bond. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far away from the **H_bridge** protons. Instead, they become close to the **Me_vinyl** protons (~1.7 ppm). The cross-peak between H_anhydride and H_bridge would be absent.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major (*exo*) product but absent in the minor (*endo*) product is the one that connects the anhydride protons and a C7-bridge proton. The resonances for these two groups are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nMatching this conclusion to the given options:\n\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n**C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (This interaction is characteristic of the *minor* endo product)\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided solutions and applying fundamental chemical principles.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants and the Reaction\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed by dehydrating a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. The spectroscopic data provided (`¹H NMR`: one peak at 7 ppm; `¹³C NMR`: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) are characteristic of a highly symmetrical molecule. This information, including the vinylic and carbonyl chemical shifts, unambiguously identifies the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly stated to be **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The molecular formula of the product (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) confirms that a simple addition has occurred.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Major and Minor Products\n\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. A Diels-Alder reaction can form two stereoisomers: the *endo* and the *exo* adduct.\n\n*   **The \"Endo Rule\" vs. Steric Hindrance:** While the Alder-Endo rule generally predicts the *endo* isomer to be the major product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions, this rule is often overridden by significant steric hindrance.\n*   **Application to this Reaction:** The diene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. For the *endo* product to form, the maleic anhydride ring must approach \"underneath\" the diene system, which would cause a severe steric clash between the anhydride and the two methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions of the diene. The *exo* approach avoids this steric repulsion and therefore has a lower activation energy.\n*   **Conclusion:** This is a classic textbook case where steric hindrance controls the outcome, reversing the usual preference.\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### Step 3: Assign ¹H NMR Signals and Analyze the 2D NOESY Spectrum\n\nThe question asks for a NOESY cross-peak that is **present in the major product but absent in the minor one**. Based on our conclusion from Step 2, we must look for a spatial interaction that is unique to the ***exo*** isomer.\n\n*   **Signal Assignment:** From the options provided and general chemical shift knowledge of the symmetrical product:\n    *   `~3.5 ppm (2H singlet)`: The two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride part of the molecule (**H_anhydride**). They are highly deshielded by the two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   `~1.7 ppm (6H singlet)`: The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n    *   `~1.5 ppm (1H doublet)`: One of the two diastereotopic protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n    *   `~1.0 ppm (6H singlet)`: The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n\n*   **Spatial Analysis of Isomers:**\n    *   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the *same side* (*syn*) as the C7-methylene bridge. This rigid geometry holds the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) very close in space to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between these two signals is expected.\n    *   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"underneath\" the C=C double bond, on the opposite side from the C7-bridge. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far away from the **H_bridge** protons, and this NOESY cross-peak would be absent. (Instead, a cross-peak between **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl** would appear in this minor isomer).\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons with a C7-bridge proton. The resonances for these protons are:\n*   A **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   A **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**\n\nThis pair of signals perfectly matches the description in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, highlighting the key points necessary for a correct conclusion.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed by dehydrating a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. The spectroscopic data provided (`¹H NMR`: one peak at 7 ppm; `¹³C NMR`: two peaks at 137 ppm for the alkene carbons and 165 ppm for the carbonyl carbons) indicate a highly symmetrical molecule. This is the classic signature of **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** This is explicitly identified as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The molecular formula of the products, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, is consistent with a direct addition of the two reactants.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Major Product\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. A Diels-Alder reaction can form two stereoisomers: an *endo* and an *exo* adduct.\n*   **The General Endo Rule:** Typically, the *endo* product is the kinetically favored (major) product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions.\n*   **Careful Point: The Steric Hindrance Exception.** The general rule is frequently overridden by significant steric hindrance. In this specific case, the diene is exceptionally bulky due to the four methyl groups. The methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions of the diene create a severe steric clash with the approaching anhydride ring in the transition state that leads to the *endo* product.\n*   **Conclusion:** To avoid this steric repulsion, the reaction preferentially proceeds through the less-hindered **exo** transition state. Therefore, for this specific reaction, the normal stereochemical outcome is reversed:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the 2D NOESY Spectrum\nA NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in three-dimensional space (< 5 Å). The problem states that a cross-peak is **present in the major product but absent in the minor product**. We must therefore identify a spatial proximity that is unique to the **exo isomer**.\n\n### Step 4: Assign ¹H NMR Signals and Visualize the Products\n*   **Careful Point: Assigning Signals.** Based on chemical environment, integration, and the options provided, the signals can be assigned:\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** The two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride part of the molecule (**H_anhydride**). Their high chemical shift is due to the strong deshielding from the two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** One of the two protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\n*   **Careful Point: Visualizing Spatial Proximity.**\n    *   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the *opposite* side (*anti*) of the C7-methylene bridge. In this rigid geometry, the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) are oriented into the concave \"cup\" of the bicyclic system. This brings them very close in space to the *syn*-proton of the C7-bridge (**H_bridge**, ~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between them.\n    *   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the *same* side (*syn*) as the C7-bridge, tucked underneath the double bond. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far from the **H_bridge** protons, and a NOESY cross-peak between them would be absent. (In this minor product, a cross-peak would instead appear between H_anhydride and Me_vinyl).\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons with a bridge proton. This corresponds to the interaction between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**. This pair of resonances directly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the most chemically sound arguments from the provided answers and identifying critical points.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\n\n**Step 1: Identification of Reactants and Reaction**\n*   **Reactant 1 (Dienophile):** The anhydride is formed from a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid and has characteristic NMR data: a single ¹H peak at 7 ppm (two equivalent vinylic protons) and two ¹³C peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons). This high symmetry and these chemical shifts unambiguously identify the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**. There is a unanimous consensus on this point across all candidate answers.\n*   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** The diene is explicitly stated to be **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula (C₁₃H₁₆O₃) confirms that a simple addition has occurred.\n\n**Step 2: Determination of Major and Minor Products (The Most Critical Step)**\n*   A Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   The **Alder-endo rule** is a general principle suggesting that the *endo* product is usually the major, kinetically favored product due to secondary orbital interactions. Several agents based their conclusions on this general rule.\n*   However, the rule is frequently superseded by **steric hindrance**. The diene in this problem is exceptionally bulky. The methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions create a severe steric clash with the maleic anhydride ring during the *endo* approach.\n*   **Conclusion:** The reaction will preferentially proceed via the less-hindered *exo* transition state. This is a classic textbook exception to the endo rule. Therefore, the stereochemical outcome is:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n    This is the most chemically sound conclusion and is supported by the reasoning in the majority of the provided answers, even if some of them failed to select the correct final letter.\n\n**Step 3: Assignment of ¹H NMR Signals and Analysis of NOESY Data**\n*   The question asks for a NOESY cross-peak that is **present in the major product but absent in the minor product**. Based on our analysis, we must find a spatial interaction unique to the *exo* isomer.\n*   The signals in the options can be assigned as follows:\n    *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** Protons on the anhydride ring (**H_anhydride**). They are highly deshielded by the adjacent carbonyls.\n    *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** Vinylic methyl protons (**Me_vinyl**).\n    *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** A proton on the C7 methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n    *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** Bridgehead methyl protons.\n*   Let's analyze the spatial proximities in the two isomers:\n    *   **Major (*Exo*) Isomer:** In this structure, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7-methylene bridge. The anhydride protons (**H_anhydride**) are located in the \"cup\" of the bicyclic system, which brings them very close to the bridge proton (**H_bridge**). A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between them.\n    *   **Minor (*Endo*) Isomer:** Here, the anhydride ring is tucked under the C=C double bond. In this arrangement, **H_anhydride** protons are far from **H_bridge** protons, so the corresponding cross-peak would be absent. Instead, a cross-peak between **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl** (~1.7 ppm) would be characteristic of this minor isomer.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n*   The NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons with a C7-bridge proton.\n*   This corresponds to an interaction between the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n*   Reviewing the options:\n    *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n    *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm *(This is the peak for the MINOR product)*\n    *   C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n    *   D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm *(This perfectly matches the interaction for the MAJOR product)*\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem by evaluating the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of Reactants and Reaction\n*   **Reactant 1 (Dienophile):** An anhydride is formed by dehydrating a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. The NMR data show high symmetry: a single proton peak at 7 ppm (¹H NMR) and two carbon peaks at 137 ppm (alkene) and 165 ppm (carbonyl) in the ¹³C NMR. This is the classic spectroscopic signature of **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Reactant 2 (Diene):** The problem explicitly identifies the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. This is confirmed by the molecular formula of the product, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, which is the sum of the reactants' formulas (C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃).\n\n### Step 2: Determination of the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry)\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. A Diels-Alder reaction can form two stereoisomeric products: *endo* and *exo*.\n*   **The General Principle (Alder-Endo Rule):** In many cases, the *endo* product is favored kinetically due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n*   **The Overriding Factor (Steric Hindrance):** This general rule is not absolute and is frequently overridden by severe steric hindrance. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is extremely bulky. The methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions (which become the bridgehead carbons in the product) create a significant steric clash with the maleic anhydride ring as it approaches in the *endo* orientation.\n*   **Conclusion:** The reaction will preferentially proceed through the sterically less-hindered *exo* transition state. This is a classic textbook example where steric effects control the stereochemical outcome. Therefore:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the 2D NOESY Spectrum\nA Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY) experiment identifies protons that are close to each other in three-dimensional space (< 5 Å). The problem asks us to find a cross-peak that is **present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product**. Based on Step 2, this means we must find a spatial interaction that is unique to the ***exo*** **isomer**.\n\n### Step 4: Assignment of NMR Signals and Structural Analysis\nFirst, let's assign the proton signals mentioned in the options based on their typical chemical environments and integrations in the product, which has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** Corresponds to the two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring (**H_anhydride**). Their high chemical shift is due to being adjacent to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n*   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** Corresponds to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\nNext, we analyze the spatial proximity in each isomer:\n*   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the *same side* of the bicyclic system as the C7-methylene bridge. In this rigid geometry, the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) are physically close to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.\n*   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the *opposite side* of the C7 bridge, tucked underneath the double bond. Here, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons, and a cross-peak between them would be absent. (In this isomer, the H_anhydride protons are instead close to the Me_vinyl protons at ~1.7 ppm).\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons and a C7-bridge proton. The signals for these two protons are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nMatching this to the options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n*   **B) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   C) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (This cross-peak identifies the minor product)\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n\nThe correct option is B, as it accurately describes the interaction between the bridge proton and the anhydride protons in the major exo product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Careful Point 1: Identify the Reactants Correctly**\n\n*   **The Dienophile:** The starting material is an anhydride formed by dehydrating a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. Its spectroscopic data (`¹H` NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm; `¹³C` NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) are crucial. The high symmetry (one proton signal, two carbon signals) and characteristic chemical shifts (vinylic and carbonyl regions) unambiguously identify the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **The Diene:** This reactant is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n### **Careful Point 2: Determine the Major Product (Stereochemistry)**\n\n*   This is the most critical step of the analysis. The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**, which can produce two stereoisomers: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct.\n*   The general guiding principle is the **Alder-Endo Rule**, which suggests the *endo* product is usually the major, kinetically favored product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n*   **Crucial Exception:** This rule is frequently overridden by severe **steric hindrance**. The diene used here is exceptionally bulky due to its four methyl groups. During the approach to form the *endo* product, the methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions would sterically clash with the incoming maleic anhydride ring. The *exo* approach avoids this clash, making its transition state lower in energy and thus kinetically favored.\n*   **Conclusion on Stereochemistry:** The **Major Product is the *Exo* Adduct**, and the Minor Product is the *Endo* Adduct. This is a well-known exception and a common \"trick\" in problems of this type.\n\n### **Careful Point 3: Assign NMR Signals and Analyze the NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   A **2D NOESY** spectrum reveals which protons are close to each other in 3D space (< 5 Å), generating a \"cross-peak\" between their signals.\n*   We are looking for a cross-peak that is **present in the major product (*exo*) but absent (or very weak) in the minor product (*endo*)**.\n*   We must first assign the signals described in the options to the protons in the product:\n    *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** The two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride part of the molecule. Let's call these **H_anhydride**.\n    *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** The protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the product's double bond. Let's call these **Me_vinyl**.\n    *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** One of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7-methylene bridge. Let's call this **H_bridge**.\n    *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** The protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n\n### **Careful Point 4: Correlate Structure with NOESY Data**\n\n*   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C=C bond bridge. This rigid geometry points the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) towards the C7-methylene bridge, bringing them into very close proximity with the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between them.\n*   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is \"tucked under\" the C=C bond bridge. In this arrangement, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons, and the corresponding NOESY cross-peak would be absent. (Instead, a new cross-peak between **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl** at ~1.7 ppm would appear in the minor product's spectrum).\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons with a bridge proton. The resonances for these protons are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**. This description matches option C precisely.\n\n*   A) `6H singlet (~1 ppm)` & `6H singlet (~1.7 ppm)`: Bridgehead methyls & vinylic methyls. Not the key distinguishing peak.\n*   B) `6H singlet (~1.7 ppm)` & `2H singlet (~3.5 ppm)`: Vinylic methyls & anhydride protons. This peak is characteristic of the **minor** *endo* product.\n*   C) `1H doublet (~1.5 ppm)` & `2H singlet (~3.5 ppm)`: Bridge proton & anhydride protons. This peak is characteristic of the **major** *exo* product.\n*   D) The original prompt contains a typo where D is identical to B. If it were a unique option (e.g., bridgehead methyls and a bridge proton), it would also not be the correct answer.\n\nThe most chemically sound reasoning path leads directly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of a Diels-Alder reaction, focusing on stereochemistry and its correlation with 2D NMR spectroscopy.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis and Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Reactant Identification:** The first step is to identify the reactants from the information given.\n    *   **Dienophile:** A dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. The resulting anhydride has a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm (vinylic protons) and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons). This high degree of symmetry and the characteristic chemical shifts unambiguously identify the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   **Diene:** This is explicitly stated as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**.\n\n2.  **Stereochemistry (The Most Critical Point):** The next step is to determine the stereochemical outcome of the reaction, which will dictate which product is major and which is minor.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can form two stereoisomers: *endo* and *exo*.\n    *   **The General Endo Rule:** Under electronic control, the *endo* product is typically favored kinetically due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions. A naive analysis would incorrectly assign the *endo* product as major.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Recognizing Exceptions.** This reaction is a classic textbook exception to the endo rule due to severe **steric hindrance**. The diene is extremely bulky. During the *endo* approach, the two methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions of the diene would clash with the approaching anhydride ring. The reaction, therefore, proceeds preferentially through the sterically less-hindered *exo* transition state.\n    *   **Conclusion on Stereochemistry:** The **major product is the *exo* adduct**, and the minor product is the *endo* adduct.\n\n3.  **Proton NMR Signal Assignment:** We need to assign the signals given in the options to specific protons in the product. The product is symmetrical.\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** Protons on the anhydride ring, deshielded by two adjacent carbonyl groups. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** One of the two diastereotopic protons on the C7 methylene bridge. Let's call it **H_bridge**.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** The protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond. Let's call them **Me_vinyl**.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** The protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\n4.  **2D NOESY Spectrum Analysis:** A NOESY cross-peak appears between protons that are close in 3D space (< 5 Å). We are looking for a cross-peak that is **present in the major (*exo*) product** but absent in the minor (*endo*) product.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Visualizing 3D Structures.**\n        *   **Major (*exo*) Product:** The anhydride ring is on the *same side* (*syn*) as the C7-methylene bridge. In this rigid bicyclic system, the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) are spatially very close to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOE between them is expected.\n        *   **Minor (*endo*) Product:** The anhydride ring is on the *opposite side* (*anti*) of the C7-methylene bridge, tucked underneath the double bond. In this isomer, **H_anhydride** protons are far from **H_bridge** protons, so this specific NOE would be absent. (An NOE between **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl** would appear instead).\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The distinguishing cross-peak that is present in the major product but not the minor one is the interaction between the anhydride protons and a bridge proton.\n    *   This corresponds to the signals: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Accurately Mapping to Options.** We must carefully match our conclusion to the given options. The option describing this interaction is D.\n\n        *   A) ~1.7 ppm & ~3.5 ppm -> This is `Me_vinyl` and `H_anhydride`, characteristic of the *minor* (endo) product.\n        *   B) ~1.0 ppm & ~1.5 ppm -> Bridgehead methyl and bridge proton.\n        *   C) ~1.0 ppm & ~1.7 ppm -> Bridgehead methyl and vinylic methyl.\n        *   D) ~1.5 ppm & ~3.5 ppm -> This is `H_bridge` and `H_anhydride`, characteristic of the **major** (*exo*) product.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and reaching a final conclusion.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of Reactants and Reaction\nThis initial step is foundational and is correctly identified by all candidate agents.\n*   **Dienophile:** A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to an anhydride with a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. The high symmetry and characteristic chemical shifts (vinylic and carbonyl regions) unambiguously identify this molecule as **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly stated as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, is the sum of the reactants' formulas (C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃), confirming a direct addition has occurred.\n\n### Step 2: Determination of the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry)\nThis is the most critical decision point of the problem and requires careful consideration of competing factors.\n*   A Diels-Alder reaction can form two stereoisomers: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct.\n*   The **\"Alder-Endo Rule\"** is a general guideline predicting that the *endo* product is usually favored kinetically due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n*   However, this rule is frequently overridden by significant **steric hindrance**. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is extremely bulky. During the *endo* approach, where the anhydride ring tucks underneath the diene system, a severe steric clash occurs between the anhydride and the methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions of the diene.\n*   The alternative *exo* approach avoids this steric clash, making its transition state lower in energy and therefore kinetically favored. This is a classic, well-documented exception to the endo rule.\n*   **Conclusion:** All 15 candidate answers correctly conclude in their reasoning that steric effects are dominant. Therefore:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of NMR Signals and NOESY Data\nWe must identify a cross-peak in the 2D NOESY spectrum that is **present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product**. This requires identifying a spatial proximity unique to the *exo* isomer.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Signal Assignments:** Based on the integrations and chemical shifts provided in the options, we can assign the signals to protons in the symmetrical product:\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** The two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring (**H_anhydride**).\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** One of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\n*   **Spatial Proximity Analysis:**\n    *   **In the *exo* adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the same side of the bicyclic system as the C7-methylene bridge. In this rigid geometry, the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) are located in the \"cup\" of the bicyclic structure, bringing them very close in space to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between these signals is expected.\n    *   **In the *endo* adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the C7 bridge, tucked underneath the double bond. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far from the **H_bridge** protons, and their corresponding NOESY cross-peak would be absent. (In this isomer, a strong NOE between **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl** at ~1.7 ppm would appear instead).\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is characteristic of the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons and a bridge proton.\n*   The signals for these interacting protons are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n*   This pair of signals precisely matches the description in option D. While many candidate answers correctly reasoned this, several made transcription errors matching their reasoning to the final option letter. The chemical reasoning is sound and points unequivocally to option D.\n\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (Bridgehead methyl & Bridge proton)\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Vinylic methyl & Anhydride proton - characteristic of MINOR product)\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Bridgehead methyl & Vinylic methyl)\n**D) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (Bridge proton & Anhydride proton - characteristic of MAJOR product)**\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires a detailed analysis of a Diels-Alder reaction, focusing on stereochemistry and the interpretation of 2D NOESY NMR data. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning.\n\n### **Step 1: Identification of Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes an anhydride formed from dehydrating a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid containing an alkene. The provided NMR data is key:\n    *   ¹H NMR: A single peak at ~7 ppm. This indicates two chemically equivalent vinylic protons.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: Two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons).\n    *   This high degree of symmetry and the characteristic chemical shifts unambiguously identify the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, is the sum of the reactants' formulas (C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃), confirming a direct addition has occurred.\n\n### **Step 2: Determination of the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry)**\nThis is the most critical step of the problem, as it determines which structure's NOESY spectrum we must analyze.\n*   A Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and the *exo* adducts.\n*   **The \"Alder-Endo Rule\" vs. Steric Hindrance:** The general endo rule predicts that the *endo* adduct is the kinetically favored major product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions. However, this rule is often overridden by significant steric hindrance.\n*   **Analysis:** The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. During the *endo* approach, the two methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions of the diene create a severe steric clash with the approaching maleic anhydride ring. The alternative *exo* approach avoids this clash. Consequently, the transition state for the *exo* product is lower in energy, making it the major kinetic product. This is a classic textbook example where steric effects control the stereochemical outcome.\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of the 2D NOESY Spectrum and Signal Assignment**\n*   **Principle:** A NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in three-dimensional space (< 5 Å). We are looking for a cross-peak that is **present in the major product (*exo*) but absent in the minor product (*endo*)**.\n*   **Signal Assignment:** We can assign the signals from the options based on their chemical environment and integration:\n    *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** These are the two equivalent protons on the anhydride ring of the bicyclic system (**H_anhydride**). Their high chemical shift is due to being deshielded by two adjacent carbonyl groups.\n    *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This represents one of the two diastereotopic protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n    *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** The protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n    *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** The protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\n*   **Structural Analysis (Spatial Proximity):**\n    *   **Major (*Exo*) Adduct:** In this structure, the anhydride ring is on the *same* side of the bicyclic system as the C7-methylene bridge. In this rigid geometry, the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) are physically close to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between them.\n    *   **Minor (*Endo*) Adduct:** In this structure, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side, tucked underneath the double bond. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far away from the **H_bridge** protons, and a cross-peak would be absent. (Instead, a cross-peak between H_anhydride and the vinylic methyls, Me_vinyl at ~1.7 ppm, would be characteristic of this minor product).\n\n### **Step 4: Final Conclusion**\nThe NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*exo*) product is the one connecting the anhydride protons and a C7-bridge proton.\n*   These protons correspond to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n*   This combination exactly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer by synthesizing the provided candidate responses and applying core chemical principles.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Reactants and the Reaction**\n\nThere is unanimous agreement among all candidate answers on this point.\n*   **Dienophile:** The starting material is described as an anhydride formed from a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. The NMR data—a single ¹H peak at 7 ppm (vinylic H) and two ¹³C peaks at 137 ppm (vinylic C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl C)—are the classic spectroscopic signature of **maleic anhydride**. Its high symmetry accounts for the simplicity of the spectra.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, confirms it is a direct sum of the reactants' formulas (C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃).\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Major and Minor Products (Stereochemistry)**\n\nThis is the most critical decision point of the problem and the source of divergence among the candidate answers.\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* adducts.\n*   **The \"Alder-Endo Rule\":** As a general principle, the *endo* product is often the kinetically favored (and therefore major) product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions. Some of the candidate answers incorrectly applied only this general rule.\n*   **The Steric Hindrance Exception:** This rule is frequently overridden by severe steric hindrance. The diene in this problem is extremely bulky due to the four methyl groups. The methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions (which become the bridgehead carbons) create a significant steric clash with the anhydride ring as it approaches in the *endo* orientation (tucked under the diene). The *exo* approach avoids this steric repulsion and therefore has a lower activation energy.\n*   **Conclusion on Stereochemistry:** The chemically sound conclusion, supported by the reasoning in the majority of the candidate answers, is that steric effects dominate in this specific reaction. Therefore:\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the 2D NOESY NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   A **NOESY** spectrum reveals which protons are close to each other in three-dimensional space (< 5 Å).\n*   The problem asks to identify the resonances for a cross-peak that is **present in the major product** but **absent (or very weak) in the minor product**.\n*   Based on Step 2, we must look for a spatial proximity that is unique to the **exo isomer**.\n\n### **Step 4: Assign Proton Signals and Visualize the Key Spatial Interaction**\n\nThe proton signals described in the options can be assigned based on their chemical environment in the product:\n*   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** The two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride part of the molecule (**H_anhydride**). Their high chemical shift is due to the strong deshielding effect of the adjacent carbonyl groups.\n*   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** Corresponds to one of the two diastereotopic protons on the C7-methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n*   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm:** The six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\nNow we analyze the 3D structures:\n*   **In the *Exo* isomer (Major Product):** In the exo adduct, the anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C7-methylene bridge. This rigid bicyclic geometry forces the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) into close proximity with the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between these two signals is expected.\n*   **In the *Endo* isomer (Minor Product):** In the endo adduct, the anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C7-methylene bridge. In this orientation, the **H_anhydride** protons are far from the **H_bridge** protons. Instead, they are close to the **Me_vinyl** protons (~1.7 ppm). The cross-peak between H_anhydride and H_bridge would be absent.\n\n### **Step 5: Conclude and Select the Final Answer**\n\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is characteristic of the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons and a C7-bridge proton. The corresponding resonances are:\n*   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   The **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**\n\nMatching this pair with the given options:\nA) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\nB) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n\nThe pair of resonances identified through our step-by-step analysis is described in **Option B**.\n\nA review of the candidate answers shows that while the final lettered choices vary, the majority of the detailed reasoning sections correctly identify the key chemical principles (Exo product is major, NOE is between bridge and anhydride protons). The discrepancies in the final answers arise from errors in matching this correct reasoning to the specific letters of the options. The sound chemical argument points unequivocally to B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer by synthesizing and critically evaluating the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction\nThis is the most straightforward part of the problem, and there is a universal consensus among the candidate answers.\n*   **Dienophile:** The description is of an anhydride formed from a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid with highly symmetrical NMR spectra (`¹H`: one singlet at 7 ppm; `¹³C`: two signals at 137 ppm and 165 ppm). This unambiguously identifies the dienophile as **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, confirms a direct addition has occurred.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Major and Minor Products\nThis is the most critical decision point. A correct analysis here is essential for solving the problem.\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct.\n*   **The \"Alder-Endo Rule\" vs. Steric Hindrance:** While the general *endo rule* predicts the *endo* product to be the major kinetic product due to favorable secondary orbital interactions, this rule can be overridden by steric effects.\n*   **Correct Analysis:** The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. The methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions create a severe steric clash with the maleic anhydride ring during the *endo* approach (where the anhydride is tucked \"under\" the diene). To avoid this significant steric repulsion, the reaction proceeds preferentially through the less-hindered *exo* transition state. This is a classic and well-documented exception to the endo rule.\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n    The vast majority of the candidate answers correctly identified this critical exception, establishing a strong foundation for the subsequent steps.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the 2D NOESY NMR Spectrum\n*   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in three-dimensional space (< 5 Å), regardless of their bonding connections.\n*   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product but absent (or very weak) in the minor product**.\n*   Based on our conclusion from Step 2, we must look for a spatial proximity that is unique to the **exo isomer**.\n\n### Step 4: Assign NMR Signals and Visualize the Products\nFirst, let's assign the signals described in the options to the protons in the product. The product has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** Corresponds to the two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride part of the molecule (**H_anhydride**). Their high chemical shift is due to being adjacent to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond (**Me_vinyl**).\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** Corresponds to one of the two diastereotopic protons on the C7 methylene bridge (**H_bridge**).\n*   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n\nNow, let's analyze the 3D structures to identify the unique NOE interaction:\n*   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring points *away* from the larger C=C bridge and *towards* the smaller C7 methylene bridge. This geometry forces the anhydride protons (**H_anhydride**, ~3.5 ppm) into close proximity with the protons on the C7 bridge (**H_bridge**, ~1.5 ppm). **A strong NOESY cross-peak between these two signals is expected.**\n*   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"underneath\" the C=C bridge. In this arrangement, the **H_anhydride** protons are very far from the **H_bridge** protons, and the corresponding NOESY cross-peak would be absent. (In this minor isomer, a strong NOE would instead be seen between **H_anhydride** and the vinylic methyl protons, **Me_vinyl**, at ~1.7 ppm).\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is present in the major (*exo*) product but absent in the minor (*endo*) product is the one connecting the anhydride protons and a C7 bridge proton.\n*   These are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nMatching this finding with the provided options:\n*   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n*   B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (This is the characteristic interaction of the *minor* endo product).\n*   C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (**This perfectly matches the characteristic interaction of the *major* exo product**).\n*   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\n\nThe most consistent and chemically sound line of reasoning points directly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting the crucial points required to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identification of the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Careful Point**: The first step is to correctly identify the starting materials from the provided spectroscopic data and chemical description.\n*   **Dienophile**: An anhydride is formed by dehydrating a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid. Its NMR spectra show extreme simplicity: a single ¹H peak at 7 ppm and only two ¹³C peaks at 137 ppm (alkene) and 165 ppm (carbonyl). This high degree of symmetry and the characteristic chemical shifts are definitive for **maleic anhydride**.\n*   **Diene**: This reactant is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction Type**: The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, confirms a simple addition of the two reactants has occurred without any loss of atoms.\n\n**2. Determination of the Major Product's Stereochemistry**\n*   **Careful Point**: This is the most critical decision in the entire problem. The outcome of the NOESY analysis depends entirely on correctly identifying the major stereoisomer.\n*   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: *endo* and *exo*.\n*   **The General \"Endo Rule\"**: For most Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is favored kinetically due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the diene's π-system and the dienophile's substituents. A naive analysis would assume the major product is *endo*.\n*   **The Overriding Factor: Steric Hindrance**: This problem presents a classic exception to the endo rule. The diene is exceptionally bulky, with four methyl groups. The methyl groups at positions C1 and C4 create a severe steric clash with the maleic anhydride ring during the *endo* approach. The alternative *exo* approach avoids this steric repulsion and is therefore faster (kinetically favored).\n*   **Conclusion**: Due to overwhelming steric hindrance, the **Major Product is the *Exo* Adduct**, and the Minor Product is the *Endo* Adduct.\n\n**3. Interpretation of the 2D NOESY Spectrum**\n*   **Careful Point**: Understanding what a NOESY spectrum shows is key. A cross-peak indicates that two protons are physically close to each other in 3D space (< 5 Å), regardless of how many bonds separate them.\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is **present in the major product** but **absent in the minor product**.\n*   Based on our conclusion from Step 2, we must look for a proton-proton interaction that is present **only in the *exo* adduct**.\n\n**4. Correlating Structure with Specific NMR Signals**\n*   **Careful Point**: We must correctly assign the proton signals described in the options and then visualize their positions in the 3D structures of the *exo* and *endo* products.\n*   **Signal Assignments**:\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**: These are the two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring, which we can label `H_anhydride`. They are strongly deshielded by the adjacent carbonyls.\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**: This is one of the protons on the C7-methylene bridge, labeled `H_bridge`.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**: These are the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond, labeled `Me_vinyl`.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.0 ppm**: These are the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead carbons.\n*   **Spatial Analysis**:\n    *   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product)**: The anhydride ring is on the same side of the bicyclic system as the C7-bridge. This rigid geometry places the `H_anhydride` protons (~3.5 ppm) in very close proximity to the `H_bridge` protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.\n    *   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product)**: The anhydride ring is on the opposite side, tucked \"under\" the double bond. Here, the `H_anhydride` protons are far from the `H_bridge` protons, and no cross-peak would appear between them. Instead, in this isomer, a cross-peak would be seen between `H_anhydride` (~3.5 ppm) and `Me_vinyl` (~1.7 ppm).\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\nThe NOESY cross-peak that is uniquely present in the major (*exo*) product connects the anhydride protons with a bridge proton. The corresponding NMR signals are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**. This description matches option A perfectly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem based on fundamental chemical principles and evaluating the candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of the Reactants and Reaction\nThis part is straightforward and consistently identified correctly by all candidate answers.\n*   **Dienophile:** A *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to an anhydride. The spectroscopic data for this anhydride (`¹H NMR`: one peak at 7 ppm; `¹³C NMR`: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) are the classic signature of **maleic anhydride**. Its C₂ᵥ symmetry explains why the two chemically equivalent vinylic protons give a single peak, and the two sets of equivalent carbons (vinylic and carbonyl) give two peaks.\n*   **Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is a **Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition**. The product's molecular formula, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, confirms it is a direct addition of the reactants (C₉H₁₄ + C₄H₂O₃).\n\n### Step 2: Determination of the Major Product (Stereochemistry)\nThis is the most critical step of the problem, as it dictates the rest of the analysis.\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: an *endo* adduct and an *exo* adduct.\n*   **The \"Alder-Endo Rule\"** is a general principle that predicts the *endo* isomer to be the major, kinetically favored product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions.\n*   **The Exception (Steric Hindrance):** This rule is a guideline and is often overridden by significant steric effects. The diene in this problem, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, is exceptionally bulky. In the transition state leading to the *endo* product, the anhydride ring must approach from \"underneath\" the diene, leading to a severe steric clash with the methyl groups at positions C1 and C4.\n*   To avoid this significant steric repulsion, the reaction preferentially proceeds through the less-hindered **exo** transition state. This is a classic textbook example where steric hindrance dictates the stereochemical outcome.\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   **Major Product = *Exo* Adduct**\n    *   **Minor Product = *Endo* Adduct**\n\n### Step 3: Assignment of NMR Signals and Analysis of NOESY Spectrum\nThe question asks to identify a NOESY cross-peak that is **present in the major product but absent (or weak) in the minor product**. Based on our conclusion from Step 2, we must find a spatial proximity that is unique to the **exo** isomer.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Signal Assignments:** Based on the integrations, multiplicities, and typical chemical shifts provided in the options, we can assign the proton signals in the symmetrical product:\n    *   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** Corresponds to the two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring. Let's call them **H_anhydride**.\n    *   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups on the C=C double bond. Let's call them **Me_vinyl**.\n    *   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** Corresponds to one of the two non-equivalent protons on the C7-methylene bridge. Let's call it **H_bridge**.\n    *   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** Corresponds to the six protons of the two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions.\n\n*   **Spatial Proximity in the Isomers:**\n    *   **In the *Exo* Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is on the *same side (syn)* of the bicyclic system as the C7-methylene bridge. This rigid geometry places the **H_anhydride** protons (~3.5 ppm) close in space to the **H_bridge** protons (~1.5 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.\n    *   **In the *Endo* Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the *opposite side (anti)* of the C7-methylene bridge, tucked \"under\" the C=C double bond. The **H_anhydride** protons are now far away from the **H_bridge** protons, and the corresponding NOESY cross-peak would be absent. (In this isomer, a different strong NOE would appear between **H_anhydride** and **Me_vinyl**).\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\nThe NOESY cross-peak that uniquely identifies the major (*exo*) product is the one that connects the anhydride protons and a C7-bridge proton.\n*   The resonances for these interacting protons are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\nMatching this conclusion to the options provided in the question:\n*   **A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** - This perfectly matches our analysis for the major (*exo*) product.\n*   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** - This interaction is characteristic of the minor (*endo*) product.\n*   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm** - This connects a bridgehead methyl to a bridge proton. While possible, it is not the key interaction that distinguishes the *exo* and *endo* isomers based on the anhydride ring's position.\n*   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** - This connects a bridgehead methyl to a vinylic methyl.\n\nThe reasoning points unequivocally to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
