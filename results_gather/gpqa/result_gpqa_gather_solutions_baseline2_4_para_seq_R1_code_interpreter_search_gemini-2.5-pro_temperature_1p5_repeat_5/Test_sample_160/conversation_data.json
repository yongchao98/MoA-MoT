However, as expected, some gas particles remained inside the compartment, as detected by the mass spectrometer. Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be λ1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules.

Since the environment is the same, the number density (`n`) of the residual gas molecules, which is determined by pressure and temperature, is constant for both calculations.\n\n*   **λ₁**: The mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other identical **gas molecules**.\n*   **λ₂**: The mean free path of a high-energy **electron** scattering off those same gas molecules.\n\nThe difference between λ₁ and λ₂ arises from the fundamental physics of the collision processes in each scenario. The general formula for mean free path is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where `σ` is the collision cross-section. The analysis, therefore, must focus on how `σ` and any other corrective factors differ between the two cases.\n\n### **Step-by-step Derivation and Careful Points**\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the equation for λ₁ (Gas-Molecule MFP)**\n\nThis scenario is described by the kinetic theory of gases.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The effect of moving targets.** In a gas, the \"projectile\" molecule and the \"target\" molecules are all in random thermal motion. To account for their relative velocities, which increases the frequency of collisions compared to a scenario with stationary targets, the standard formula includes a correction factor of `√2`.\n*   The correct formula is:\n    **λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)**\n    where `σ_gg` is the gas-kinetic cross-section, which represents the effective physical area for two molecules to collide.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the equation for λ₂ (Electron-Molecule MFP)**\n\nThis scenario involves a high-energy particle interacting with gas molecules.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The stationary target approximation.** The electrons are accelerated by 1000 kV, giving them relativistic speeds (over 94% the speed of light). This velocity is many orders of magnitude greater than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules. From the perspective of the ultra-fast electron, the gas molecules are effectively stationary targets. Therefore, the `√2` factor from kinetic gas theory is not applicable here.\n*   The correct formula is:\n    **λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)**\n    where `σ_eg` is the electron-gas scattering cross-section.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the collision cross-sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg)**\n\nThis is the most critical physical insight of the problem.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The effect of projectile energy on cross-section.** It is a common misconception to assume that a charged particle like an electron will always interact more strongly (i.e., have a larger cross-section) than a neutral molecule. While this can be true for low-energy electrons, the opposite is true for very high-energy particles. The 1000 keV electron is extremely penetrating. It travels past a target atom so quickly that the interaction time is minuscule, leading to a very low probability of a significant scattering event. In essence, the atom becomes more \"transparent\" to the fast-moving electron.\n*   Therefore, the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron is significantly **smaller** than the gas-kinetic cross-section for two molecules.\n    **σ_eg << σ_gg**\n\n**Step 4: Derive the relationship between λ₁ and λ₂**\n\nNow we can combine the formulas and insights by calculating the ratio of the two mean free paths:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [ 1 / (n * σ_eg) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) ]\n\nThe number density `n` cancels out. By simplifying the fraction, we get:\n\n**λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\n**Step 5: Interpret the final result**\n\nThe ratio `λ₂ / λ₁` is the product of two factors, both of which increase its value:\n1.  **The `√2` factor (≈ 1.414):** This factor arises from the stationary nature of the electron's targets.\n2.  **The cross-section ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)`:** Since we established that `σ_gg` is much larger than `σ_eg`, this ratio is a number significantly greater than 1.\n\nThe product of a number ≈1.414 and another number much greater than 1 means the final ratio `λ₂ / λ₁` must be significantly greater than 1.414.\n\n**Conclusion: λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁**\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate the given options**\n\nWe must choose the option that is consistent with our physical conclusion, `λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁`.\n\n*   A) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: Incorrect. The underlying physics are fundamentally different.\n*   B) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22\\*λ₁: Incorrect. This correctly states that λ₂ is larger, but it imposes an upper bound (`< 1.22*λ₁`) that is contradicted by our finding that the ratio must be greater than 1.414.\n*   C) λ₂ < λ₁: Incorrect. This is the opposite of the physical reality.\n*   D) λ₂ >= 1.22\\*λ₁: **Correct**. Since our physical analysis proves that λ₂ is greater than 1.414 times λ₁, it is certainly and logically true that λ₂ is also greater than or equal to 1.22 times λ₁. This is the only statement consistent with the physics.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers and highlighting all the careful points required for a complete understanding.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Two Mean Free Paths (MFPs)\nThe problem requires comparing two distinct types of mean free path (MFP) within the same physical environment. This means the number density of residual gas molecules, `n`, is the same in both scenarios.\n*   **λ₁**: This is the mean free path for a **gas molecule** traveling through a collection of other identical, **moving** gas molecules. This is the standard scenario described by the kinetic theory of gases.\n*   **λ₂**: This is the mean free path for a **high-energy electron** (from the 1000 kV beam) traveling through the same collection of gas molecules. This is a particle scattering problem.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Equations for Mean Free Path\nThe general formula for MFP is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where `n` is the number density of the target particles and `σ` is the collision cross-section. The specific formula differs based on the relative motion of the projectile and the target.\n\n*   **For λ₁ (Molecule-Molecule Collisions):**\n    The key insight here is that the \"target\" gas molecules are also in random thermal motion, not stationary. Kinetic theory accounts for this relative motion between all particles by introducing a correction factor of `√2` in the denominator.\n    *   **Formula**: `λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)`\n    *   `σ_gg` is the gas-kinetic cross-section, which represents the effective physical area for two molecules to collide.\n\n*   **For λ₂ (Electron-Molecule Collisions):**\n    The projectile is a 1000 kV electron. Electrons accelerated by this voltage travel at relativistic speeds (over 94% the speed of light), which is many orders of magnitude faster than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Stationary Target Approximation.** Because the electron is so much faster than the gas molecules, the molecules can be considered effectively stationary targets from the electron's perspective. In this case, the `√2` correction factor does not apply.\n    *   **Formula**: `λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`\n    *   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron interacting with a gas molecule.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ)\nThis is the most critical physical insight and is often counterintuitive. We must compare the effective \"target area\" a gas molecule presents to another molecule versus the area it presents to a high-energy electron.\n\n*   **`σ_gg` (Gas-Kinetic Cross-Section):** This is related to the physical size of the molecules, describing the area needed for two molecules to have a \"billiard ball\"-like collision.\n*   **`σ_eg` (Electron Scattering Cross-Section):**\n    *   **Careful Point 2: High-Energy Particle Penetration.** A common mistake is to assume a charged particle like an electron will always have a larger interaction cross-section due to the long-range Coulomb force. This is not true for high-energy particles. The 1000 keV electron is extremely energetic and highly penetrating. It travels past a target molecule so quickly that the interaction time is minuscule. This leads to a very low probability of a significant deflection (a \"scattering\" event), making the molecule largely \"transparent\" to the fast-moving electron.\n    *   Therefore, the effective scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron (`σ_eg`) is significantly **smaller** than the kinetic cross-section between two molecules (`σ_gg`).\n    *   **Conclusion**: **σ_eg << σ_gg**\n\n### Step 4: Derive the Relationship Between λ₁ and λ₂\nTo directly compare the two MFPs, we can take the ratio of their respective formulas:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [ 1 / (n * σ_eg) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) ]\n\nThe number density `n` cancels out. By inverting the denominator and multiplying, we get:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg\n**λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\n### Step 5: Interpret the Result and Evaluate the Options\nWe have established two factors that combine to determine the final ratio:\n1.  **The Target Motion Factor:** The presence of `√2` (≈ 1.414) in the numerator makes `λ₂` larger than `λ₁`, all else being equal.\n2.  **The Cross-Section Factor:** The ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)` is a number significantly greater than 1 because `σ_gg` is much larger than `σ_eg`.\n\nThe final ratio is the product of ~1.414 and a number much larger than 1. Therefore, we can definitively conclude that the ratio `λ₂ / λ₁` is significantly greater than 1.414.\n\n**Final Conclusion**: **λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁**\n\nNow we must choose the multiple-choice option that is consistent with this physical fact:\n\n*   **A) λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁**: If `λ₂` is greater than `1.414 * λ₁`, it is certainly also greater than or equal to `1.22 * λ₁`. This statement is **true** and logically consistent with our findings.\n*   **B) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation**: This is false. The underlying physics are fundamentally different, so the MFPs cannot be equal.\n*   **C) λ₂ < λ₁**: This is false. This is the opposite of the physical reality.\n*   **D) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁**: This is false. While it correctly states `λ₂` is larger than `λ₁`, it imposes an upper bound (`< 1.22*λ₁`) that is demonstrably violated by our finding that the ratio must be greater than 1.414.\n\nThe only statement that is consistent with the physical analysis is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on a synthesis of the candidate answers, the problem can be solved by carefully analyzing the physics behind the two different types of mean free paths. All the candidate answers converge on the same physical reasoning.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem and Define the Two Mean Free Paths (MFP)**\n\nThe question asks for a comparison between two MFPs measured in the same environment (the vacuum chamber of a TEM), which means the number density of residual gas molecules, `n`, is constant for both scenarios.\n\n*   **λ₁**: The mean free path of a **gas molecule** colliding with other identical, moving **gas molecules**. This is the standard definition from the kinetic theory of gases.\n*   **λ₂**: The mean free path of a **high-energy electron** from the 1000 kV beam scattering off a **gas molecule**. This is a particle-scattering problem.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Key Physical Differences and Careful Points**\n\nThere are two fundamental physical differences between the calculation of λ₁ and λ₂.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Effect of Target Motion**\n    The formula for the mean free path, `λ`, depends on whether the targets are stationary or moving.\n    *   For **λ₁**, both the projectile molecule and the target molecules are in random thermal motion. Kinetic theory shows that this increases the collision frequency. To account for this, a correction factor of `√2` is placed in the denominator of the MFP formula: `λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)`.\n    *   For **λ₂**, the electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, making them travel at relativistic speeds (over 94% the speed of light). This velocity is vastly greater than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules. From the electron's perspective, the gas molecules are effectively **stationary targets**. In this case, the `√2` factor is not used: `λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`.\n    *   *Conclusion 1*: This difference in target motion alone makes λ₂ larger than λ₁ by a factor of √2 (≈ 1.414), assuming the cross-sections were the same.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Effect of Collision Cross-Section (σ)**\n    The collision cross-section, `σ`, represents the effective \"size\" of the target for an interaction.\n    *   **σ_gg**: This is the gas-kinetic cross-section, representing the effective area for a physical \"hard-sphere\" collision between two relatively large, slow-moving molecules. It is related to the physical dimensions of the molecules' electron shells.\n    *   **σ_eg**: This is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron. It is a common misconception that an electron's charge will always lead to a larger interaction area. At extremely high energies (1000 keV), the electron is a highly penetrating particle. It travels past the gas molecule so quickly that the electromagnetic interaction time is extremely short, leading to a low probability of significant deflection (scattering). In essence, the molecule becomes more \"transparent\" to the fast-moving electron.\n    *   *Conclusion 2*: The scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron is significantly **smaller** than the kinetic cross-section between two molecules (`σ_eg << σ_gg`). A smaller cross-section leads to a longer mean free path.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Effects and Derive the Final Relationship**\n\nWe can combine the formulas for λ₁ and λ₂ to find their ratio:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [ 1 / (n * σ_eg) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) ]\n\nThe number density `n` cancels out. By rearranging the fraction, we get:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\n\nNow, we analyze the value of this ratio based on our careful points:\n1.  The `√2` factor is approximately 1.414.\n2.  The ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)` is a number significantly greater than 1, because σ_gg is much larger than σ_eg.\n\nThe final ratio is the product of `~1.414` and a number much larger than 1. Therefore, we can definitively conclude that the ratio `λ₂ / λ₁` is significantly greater than 1.414.\n\n**λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁**\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nWe must choose the option that is a logical consequence of our derived physical relationship, `λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁`.\n\n*   **A) λ₂ >= 1.22 * λ₁**: This is **correct**. If a value (λ₂) is definitively greater than 1.414 times another value (λ₁), it is certainly also greater than or equal to 1.22 times that value. This is the only statement consistent with the physics.\n*   **B) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22 * λ₁**: This is incorrect. The upper bound of `λ₂ < 1.22 * λ₁` is impossible, as our result shows λ₂ must be greater than 1.414 * λ₁.\n*   **C) λ₂ < λ₁**: This is incorrect. This is the opposite of the physical reality derived from both careful points.\n*   **D) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation**: This is incorrect. There are clear and distinct physical reasons for the mean free paths to be different.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided answers, with a focus on all the careful points required for the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem and Define Physical Quantities\n\nThe question asks for a comparison between two different types of mean free paths (MFP) calculated within the same physical environment—a TEM vacuum chamber. The environment is characterized by a constant temperature and an ultra-high vacuum, which implies that the number density (`n`) of the residual gas molecules is constant for both scenarios.\n\n*   **λ₁**: The mean free path for a **gas molecule** colliding with other identical, moving **gas molecules**. This is the standard scenario described by the kinetic theory of gases.\n*   **λ₂**: The mean free path for a **high-energy electron** (from a 1000 kV beam) scattering off a **gas molecule**. This is a particle physics scattering problem.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Mean Free Path (MFP) Equations\n\nThe general formula for MFP is `λ = 1 / (n * σ)`, where `σ` is the collision cross-section. The specific formulas for λ₁ and λ₂ differ due to the physics of the interactions.\n\n*   **For λ₁ (Molecule-Molecule Collision):**\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Target Motion.** In a gas, all particles are in random thermal motion. Kinetic theory demonstrates that the relative motion between the \"projectile\" molecule and the \"target\" molecules increases the collision frequency. This is accounted for by adding a `√2` factor to the denominator of the MFP formula.\n    *   **Formula:** `λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)`\n    *   Here, `σ_gg` is the gas-kinetic cross-section, which represents the effective physical area for two molecules to collide.\n\n*   **For λ₂ (Electron-Molecule Collision):**\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Stationary Target Approximation.** The electrons are accelerated by 1000 kV, giving them relativistic speeds (over 94% the speed of light). This speed is many orders of magnitude greater than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules. From the perspective of the ultra-fast electron, the gas molecules are effectively stationary targets. Therefore, the `√2` factor from kinetic theory is not used.\n    *   **Formula:** `λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`\n    *   Here, `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron interacting with a gas molecule.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ)\n\nThis step contains the most critical physical insight of the problem. We must compare the effective target \"size\" of a gas molecule as seen by another molecule versus as seen by a high-energy electron.\n\n*   `σ_gg` represents the kinetic cross-section, related to the physical size of the molecules, for a \"hard-sphere\" or billiard-ball-like collision.\n*   `σ_eg` represents the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron.\n    *   **Careful Point 3: The Role of Energy in Scattering.** It is a common misconception that a charged particle (the electron) will always interact more strongly and thus have a larger cross-section. This is highly dependent on the particle's energy. At the extreme energy of 1000 keV, the electron is highly penetrating. It travels past a gas molecule so quickly that the electromagnetic interaction time is extremely short. This results in a very low probability of a significant deflection or scattering event. In effect, the gas becomes largely \"transparent\" to the fast-moving electron.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron (`σ_eg`) is significantly **smaller** than the kinetic cross-section between two molecules (`σ_gg`). Thus, `σ_eg << σ_gg`.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesize the Final Relationship\n\nBy combining the formulas and insights, we can determine the mathematical relationship between λ₁ and λ₂. The most direct method is to calculate their ratio:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [ 1 / (n * σ_eg) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) ]\n\nThe number density `n` cancels out. By inverting the denominator and multiplying, we get:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg\n\nThis can be rearranged to highlight the two contributing factors:\n\n**λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the Result and Evaluate the Options\n\nThe value of the ratio `λ₂ / λ₁` is determined by two factors, both of which are greater than 1:\n\n1.  **The Target Motion Factor (`√2`)**: This term is approximately 1.414. It arises because the electron's targets are stationary, which decreases their collision probability compared to the case where targets are also moving.\n2.  **The Cross-Section Ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)`**: Since `σ_gg` is much larger than `σ_eg`, this ratio is a number significantly greater than 1.\n\nMultiplying a number `≈1.414` by a number `>>1` results in a product that must be significantly greater than 1.414.\n**Therefore, the physical conclusion is: `λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁`**\n\nNow, we must choose the option from the list that is consistent with this conclusion:\n\n*   A) λ₂ < λ₁: False. This contradicts the analysis.\n*   B) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁: False. This is incorrect because our result shows that `λ₂` must be greater than `1.414*λ₁`, so it cannot be less than `1.22*λ₁`.\n*   C) λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁: **True**. If `λ₂` is greater than `1.414*λ₁`, it is logically and mathematically necessary that `λ₂` is also greater than or equal to `1.22*λ₁`. This is the only statement that is consistent with the physical analysis.\n*   D) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: False. There are clear physical reasons (`√2` factor and different cross-sections) for the two mean free paths to be different.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers and highlighting the careful points required to reach the correct conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe question asks us to compare two different mean free paths (MFP) in the same physical environment:\n*   **λ₁**: The MFP of a residual gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules.\n*   **λ₂**: The MFP of a high-energy electron from the TEM beam scattering off those same gas molecules.\n\nThe number density of gas molecules (`n`), which is determined by the constant pressure and temperature, is the same for both calculations. The difference must therefore arise from the physics of the collision process.\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the Mean Free Path Equations**\n\nThe general formula for MFP is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where `σ` is the collision cross-section. This formula must be adapted for each scenario.\n\n*   **For λ₁ (Molecule-Molecule Collision):** This is the standard scenario described by the kinetic theory of gases.\n    *   **Formula:** `λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)`\n    *   **`σ_gg`**: This is the gas-kinetic cross-section, representing the effective area for two molecules to physically collide.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: The `√2` Factor.** This crucial factor is included to account for the relative motion between the \"projectile\" molecule and the \"target\" molecules, which are all moving randomly at thermal speeds. This relative motion increases the effective collision frequency, thus shortening the mean free path compared to a scenario with stationary targets.\n\n*   **For λ₂ (Electron-Molecule Collision):** Here, the projectile is a 1000 kV electron.\n    *   **Formula:** `λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`\n    *   **`σ_eg`**: This is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron with a gas molecule.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: The Absence of the `√2` Factor.** The electrons are accelerated to relativistic speeds (over 94% of the speed of light), making them many orders of magnitude faster than the thermally moving gas molecules. From the electron's perspective, the gas molecules are effectively stationary targets. Therefore, the `√2` correction factor is not used.\n\n**Step 2: Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg)**\n\nThis is the most critical physical insight needed for the solution.\n\n*   `σ_gg` represents the effective area for a physical, \"hard-sphere\" like collision between two molecules, related to their physical size.\n*   `σ_eg` represents the effective area for a high-energy electron to be significantly deflected (scattered).\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Effect of High Energy on Cross-Section.** It is a common misconception to assume that because an electron is charged, it will interact more strongly and thus have a larger cross-section. While this can be true for low-energy electrons, the opposite is true for very high-energy particles. The 1000 keV electron is extremely penetrating. It travels past the gas molecule so rapidly that the interaction time is minuscule, leading to a very low probability of a significant scattering event. In effect, the molecule becomes more \"transparent\" to the fast-moving electron.\n*   **Conclusion**: The scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron is significantly **smaller** than the kinetic cross-section between two molecules. So, **σ_eg << σ_gg**.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the Formulas and Derive the Final Relationship**\n\nWe can now find the ratio of λ₂ to λ₁ by dividing their respective equations:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [ 1 / (n * σ_eg) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) ]\n\nBy canceling the common term `n` and rearranging the fraction, we get:\n\n**λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\n**Step 4: Interpret the Result and Evaluate the Options**\n\nThe final relationship `λ₂ = λ₁ * √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)` tells us everything we need to know.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Analyzing the Two Factors.**\n    1.  The `√2` factor (≈ 1.414) comes from the difference in target motion (moving vs. stationary). This factor alone makes `λ₂` larger than `λ₁`.\n    2.  The ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)` is a number significantly greater than 1, because the electron's scattering cross-section is much smaller than the molecule's kinetic cross-section.\n\nMultiplying a number ≈1.414 by another number `>>1` results in a total ratio that must be significantly greater than 1.414.\nTherefore, our physical conclusion is: **λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁**\n\nNow we evaluate the given options against this conclusion:\n\nA) λ2 < λ1\n   *   Incorrect.

Since our physical analysis proves that `λ₂` must be greater than `1.414 * λ₁`, it is certainly and logically true that `λ₂` must also be greater than or equal to `1.22 * λ₁`. This is the only statement consistent with the physics of the problem.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nAn analysis of the provided answers reveals a unanimous and correct physical reasoning. The solution involves a step-by-step comparison of the two scenarios described in the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe fundamental task is to compare two mean free paths (MFP) in the same physical environment, where the number density of gas molecules (`n`) is constant.\n\n1.  **Define the Two Mean Free Paths:**\n    *   **λ₁**: The mean free path of a **gas molecule** colliding with other identical, moving **gas molecules**. This is the standard MFP described by the kinetic theory of gases.\n    *   **λ₂**: The mean free path of a **high-energy electron** (from the 1000 kV beam) scattering off a **gas molecule**. This is a particle scattering problem.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Correct Equations for Mean Free Path**\n    The general formula for MFP is `λ = 1 / (n * σ)`, where `σ` is the collision cross-section. The specific formulas for λ₁ and λ₂ differ due to the motion of the particles involved.\n\n    *   **Equation for λ₁:**\n        The formula for the mean free path of a gas molecule moving among other identical, moving molecules is:\n        **λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)**\n        where `σ_gg` is the gas-kinetic cross-section.\n    *   **Equation for λ₂:**\n        The formula for a beam of very fast particles hitting effectively stationary targets is:\n        **λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)**\n        where `σ_eg` is the electron-gas scattering cross-section.\n\n3.  **Identify and Explain the Key Differences (Careful Points)**\n    There are two critical physical differences between the calculation for λ₁ and λ₂:\n\n    *   **Careful Point 1: The Stationary Target Approximation (`√2` factor).**\n        The formula for λ₁ includes a `√2` factor (≈ 1.414) in the denominator. This factor accounts for the fact that the target molecules are also in random thermal motion, which increases the relative velocity and thus the collision frequency compared to stationary targets. For λ₂, the electrons are accelerated to relativistic speeds (1000 kV is ~94% the speed of light), making them many orders of magnitude faster than the gas molecules. From the electron's perspective, the gas molecules are effectively stationary. Therefore, the `√2` factor is not used in the formula for λ₂, making its MFP inherently longer.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 2: The Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg).**\n        This is the most significant physical difference. One might mistakenly assume a charged electron interacts more strongly, leading to a larger cross-section. However, the opposite is true for very high-energy particles. A 1000 keV electron is extremely penetrating. It travels past a gas molecule so quickly that the electromagnetic interaction time is minuscule, leading to a very low probability of a significant scattering event. In contrast, `σ_gg` represents the much larger physical area for two molecules to undergo a \"billiard ball\" type collision. Thus, the effective target area for the high-energy electron is much smaller.\n        Conclusion: **σ_eg << σ_gg**.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Result to Compare λ₁ and λ₂**\n    To find the precise relationship, we can calculate the ratio of the two mean free paths:\n\n    λ₂ / λ₁ = [ 1 / (n * σ_eg) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) ]\n\n    After canceling the common term `n` and rearranging the fraction, we get:\n\n    **λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\n    We can now analyze the value of this ratio:\n    *   The `√2` term is approximately 1.414.\n    *   The cross-section ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)` is a number significantly greater than 1, as established in Careful Point 2.\n\n    The total ratio `λ₂ / λ₁` is the product of `~1.414` and a number `>>1`. Therefore, the ratio must be significantly greater than 1.414.\n    Final Conclusion: **λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁**\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given Options**\n    We must choose the option that is consistent with our physical conclusion, `λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁`.\n\n    *   A) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: Incorrect. The underlying physics are fundamentally different.\n    *   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. This sets an upper limit for λ₂ that is smaller than the absolute minimum required by the `√2` factor alone.\n    *   C) **λ2 >= 1.22*λ1**: **Correct**. If λ₂ is definitively greater than 1.414 times λ₁, it is certainly also greater than or equal to 1.22 times λ₁. This is the only statement that is consistent with the physical analysis.\n    *   D) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect. This is the opposite of the physical reality.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting the careful physical points required for the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem is to compare the mean free path (MFP) of a gas molecule with itself (λ₁) against the MFP of a high-energy electron with that same gas molecule (λ₂).\n\n1.  **Define the Scenarios and Formulate the Mean Free Paths**\n    The general formula for mean free path is `λ = 1 / (n * σ)`, where `n` is the number density of target particles and `σ` is the collision cross-section. In this problem, the pressure and temperature are constant, so the number density `n` of gas molecules is the same for both λ₁ and λ₂. The difference lies in the other factors.\n\n    *   **λ₁ (Molecule-Molecule Collision):** This is the MFP of a gas molecule moving through other identical, *moving* gas molecules.\n        *   **Formula:** `λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)`\n        *   `σ_gg` is the gas-kinetic cross-section, related to the physical size of the molecules.\n\n    *   **λ₂ (Electron-Molecule Collision):** This is the MFP of a very high-energy electron (1000 kV) scattering off a gas molecule.\n        *   **Formula:** `λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`\n        *   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron with a gas molecule.\n\n2.  **Identify and Analyze the Critical Differences (Careful Points)**\n    There are two fundamental physical differences that cause λ₁ and λ₂ to be different.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 1: The Effect of Target Motion (The `√2` Factor)**\n        For λ₁, the \"target\" molecules are moving randomly, just like the \"projectile\" molecule. The kinetic theory of gases introduces the `√2` factor to account for the increased collision frequency due to this relative motion. For λ₂, the electrons are moving at relativistic speeds (over 94% the speed of light), vastly faster than the thermal motion of the gas molecules. From the electron's perspective, the gas molecules are effectively **stationary targets**. Therefore, the `√2` factor is absent in the formula for λ₂. This factor alone makes λ₂ larger.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 2: The Difference in Collision Cross-Section (σ)**\n        This is the most crucial physical insight.\n        *   `σ_gg` represents the effective area for two relatively large, slow molecules to \"hit\" each other, a process dominated by their physical size.\n        *   `σ_eg` represents the effective area for a high-energy electron to be significantly scattered. It is a common mistake to assume the electron's charge means it interacts more strongly. At very high energies (1000 keV), the electron is extremely **penetrating**. It travels so fast that the time it spends in the vicinity of a gas molecule is minuscule, leading to a very low probability of a significant scattering event. In essence, the gas becomes more \"transparent\" to the electron. Therefore, the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron is **significantly smaller** than the kinetic cross-section between two molecules.\n        *   Conclusion: **σ_eg << σ_gg**.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Resulting Relationship**\n    To find the direct relationship between λ₁ and λ₂, we can calculate their ratio by dividing their respective formulas:\n    \n    λ₂ / λ₁ = [ 1 / (n * σ_eg) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) ]\n\n    After canceling the common term `n` and rearranging the fraction, we get:\n\n    **λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\n    Let's analyze the value of this ratio:\n    *   The `√2` term is approximately 1.414.\n    *   The cross-section ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)` is a number significantly greater than 1.\n\n    The final ratio (`λ₂ / λ₁`) is the product of `~1.414` and a number much larger than 1. Therefore, the ratio must be significantly greater than 1.414.\n    \n    **Final physical conclusion: λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁**\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given Options**\n    We must now select the option from the question that is consistent with our physical conclusion, `λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁`.\n\n    *   A) `λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation`: Incorrect. The underlying physics is fundamentally different.\n    *   B) `λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1`: Incorrect. This correctly identifies that λ₂ is larger, but it imposes an upper bound (`< 1.22*λ₁`) that is contradicted by our finding that the ratio must be greater than 1.414.\n    *   C) `λ2 < λ1`: Incorrect. This is the opposite of the physical reality.\n    *   D) `λ2 >= 1.22*λ1`: **Correct**. Since our physical analysis proves that `λ₂` is greater than `1.414 * λ₁`, it is certainly and logically true that `λ₂` is also greater than or equal to `1.22 * λ₁`. This is the only option consistent with the physics.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the physical principles governing this problem. The final conclusion can be reached through a step-by-step breakdown that incorporates the key insights shared across the provided analyses.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Define the Two Physical Scenarios**\n\nThe question asks for a comparison between two different types of mean free path (MFP) measured in the same physical environment. The number density of residual gas molecules, `n`, is constant for both cases.\n*   **λ₁**: The mean free path for a **gas molecule** colliding with other identical, moving **gas molecules**.\n*   **λ₂**: The mean free path for a **high-energy electron** from the 1000 kV beam scattering off those same **gas molecules**.\n\n**2. Formulate the Correct Mean Free Path Equations**\n\nThe general formula for MFP is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where `σ` is the collision cross-section. The specific formula changes based on the nature of the collision.\n\n*   **For λ₁ (Molecule-Molecule Collisions):**\n    This scenario is described by the kinetic theory of gases.\n    **Careful Point 1: Target Motion:** Since the projectile molecule is moving through a gas of other molecules that are also in random thermal motion, the relative velocity increases the collision frequency. To account for this, the standard formula includes a factor of `√2`.\n    `λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)`\n    Here, `σ_gg` is the gas-kinetic cross-section between two molecules.\n\n*   **For λ₂ (Electron-Molecule Collisions):**\n    The projectile is a 1000 kV electron.\n    **Careful Point 2: Stationary Target Approximation:** An electron accelerated by 1000 kV is moving at a relativistic speed (~94% the speed of light), which is many orders of magnitude faster than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules. From the electron's perspective, the gas molecules are effectively stationary targets. Therefore, the `√2` factor does not apply.\n    `λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`\n    Here, `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron with a gas molecule.\n\n**3. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ)**\n\nThis is the most critical physical insight of the problem.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Nature of the Cross-Section:** The collision cross-section is a measure of interaction probability. For a very high-energy particle like a 1000 keV electron, it is a common misconception that its charge guarantees a large interaction. The opposite is true. The electron is highly penetrating and travels past a target molecule so quickly that the interaction time is extremely short. This results in a very low probability of a significant deflection (scattering). The gas molecule becomes effectively \"transparent\" to the fast electron. In contrast, `σ_gg` relates to a \"harder\" physical collision between two much larger, slower objects.\n*   **Conclusion:** The high-energy electron scattering cross-section is significantly smaller than the gas-kinetic collision cross-section: **σ_eg << σ_gg**.\n\n**4. Combine the Formulas to Find the Final Relationship**\n\nBy taking the ratio of the two mean free path equations, we can find their relationship:\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [ 1 / (n * σ_eg) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) ]\n\nBy canceling the common `n` term and rearranging the fraction, we get:\n**λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\n**5. Interpret the Result and Evaluate the Options**\n\nWe can now analyze the final ratio.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Analyzing the Factors:** The final ratio `λ₂ / λ₁` is a product of two terms, both of which increase the value of λ₂ relative to λ₁:\n    1.  `√2` (approximately 1.414). This factor comes from the stationary nature of the electron's targets.\n    2.  `(σ_gg / σ_eg)`. Since `σ_gg` is much larger than `σ_eg`, this ratio is a number significantly greater than 1.\n\nMultiplying these two terms together (`~1.414` * `a number >> 1`) means that the total ratio must be significantly greater than 1.414. Therefore, the definitive physical conclusion is:\n**λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁**\n\nBased on this conclusion, we can evaluate the original options:\n*   A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. The upper bound (`< 1.22*λ₁`) contradicts our finding that `λ₂` must be greater than `1.414*λ₁`.\n*   B) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect. This is the opposite of the physical reality.\n*   C) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: Incorrect. The underlying physics are fundamentally different.\n*   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: **Correct.** Since our analysis proves that `λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁`, it is certainly and logically true that `λ₂` must also be greater than or equal to `1.22 * λ₁`.

The key is to understand that while the environment (gas density `n`) is the same, the physics of the collision process is different.\n\n*   **λ₁**: The mean free path of a **gas molecule** traveling through other identical, moving gas molecules.

This factor alone makes λ₂ about 41% larger than λ₁.\n2.  **The Cross-Section Factor:** `(σ_gg / σ_eg)`. Since we established that `σ_gg` is much larger than `σ_eg`, this ratio is a number significantly greater than 1.\n\nThe product of `~1.414` and a number `>>1` means that the total ratio `λ₂ / λ₁` must be significantly greater than 1.414.\n**Conclusion: λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁**\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options based on this physical fact:\n*   A) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22\\*λ₁: This is false.

This is the opposite of the physical reality.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the candidate answers, a consistent physical argument emerges. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning, highlighting the critical points necessary to arrive at the correct conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe question requires a comparison between two different types of mean free paths (MFP) in the same physical environment, where the number density of gas molecules (`n`) is constant.\n\n**1. Define the Mean Free Paths**\n*   **λ₁**: This is the mean free path for a **gas molecule** moving through a collection of other identical, **moving gas molecules**. This is the standard scenario in the kinetic theory of gases.\n*   **λ₂**: This is the mean free path for a **high-energy electron** (accelerated by 1000 kV) scattering off one of the **gas molecules**.\n\n**2. Formulate the Mean Free Path Equations**\nThe general formula for MFP is `λ = 1 / (n * σ)`, where `σ` is the collision cross-section. The specific formulas differ for our two cases.\n\n*   **For λ₁**: When considering collisions between particles that are all in random thermal motion, kinetic theory includes a `√2` correction factor to account for their relative velocities.\n    `λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)`\n    Here, `σ_gg` is the gas-kinetic cross-section between two molecules.\n\n*   **For λ₂**: The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, achieving relativistic speeds that are many orders of magnitude greater than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules. As a result, the gas molecules can be considered effectively stationary targets from the electron's perspective. In this case, the `√2` factor is not used.\n    `λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`\n    Here, `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron interacting with a gas molecule.\n\n**3. Careful Points and Key Physical Insights**\nThere are two critical physical differences that determine the relationship between λ₁ and λ₂, and these are the careful points to consider:\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Target Motion Factor (`√2`)**\n    The `√2` factor is present in the denominator for λ₁ but not for λ₂. It accounts for the fact that for gas-gas collisions, the \"target\" molecules are also moving, increasing the relative speed and collision frequency. For the high-speed electron, the targets are essentially stationary. This absence of the `√2` factor for λ₂ means that, all else being equal, λ₂ would be larger than λ₁ by a factor of `√2` (approximately 1.414).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Collision Cross-Sections (σ)**\n    This is the most significant physical distinction.\n    *   `σ_gg` (Gas-Kinetic Cross-Section) is related to the physical size of the molecules, representing the effective area for a \"hard sphere\" collision.\n    *   `σ_eg` (Electron Scattering Cross-Section) represents the effective area for a high-energy electron to be significantly deflected. A common misconception is to think a charged particle will always interact more strongly. For extremely high-energy (1000 keV) electrons, the opposite is true. The particle is highly penetrating and passes the target atom so quickly that the electromagnetic interaction time is minuscule. This results in a very low probability of a significant scattering event. In essence, the gas becomes largely \"transparent\" to the fast-moving electron.\n    *   Therefore, the electron scattering cross-section is significantly smaller than the gas-kinetic cross-section: **σ_eg << σ_gg**.\n\n**4. Synthesize the Final Relationship**\nWe can directly compare λ₁ and λ₂ by calculating their ratio:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [ 1 / (n * σ_eg) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) ]\n\nAfter canceling the common term `n` and rearranging the fraction, we get:\n\n**λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\nWe can now analyze the final value of this ratio:\n*   The first factor is `√2` (≈ 1.414).\n*   The second factor, the ratio of cross-sections `(σ_gg / σ_eg)`, is a number significantly greater than 1.\n\nThe product of these two factors must be significantly greater than 1.414. Therefore, the definitive physical conclusion is:\n\n**λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁**\n\n**5. Evaluate the Options**\nBased on our conclusion, we check which of the provided options is logically consistent.\n*   A) `λ₂ = λ₁`, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: False. The underlying physics is fundamentally different.\n*   B) `λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁`: **True**. Since our physical analysis proves that λ₂ is greater than 1.414 times λ₁, it is certainly and logically true that it is also greater than or equal to 1.22 times λ₁. This is the only statement consistent with the derived relationship.\n*   C) `λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁`: False. This imposes an upper limit (`< 1.22 * λ₁`) that is impossible, as the ratio must be greater than 1.414.\n*   D) `λ₂ < λ₁`: False. This contradicts the physical reality on two separate counts (target motion and cross-section).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided candidate answers and the underlying physics, here is a detailed, step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe problem requires a comparison between two distinct types of mean free paths (MFP) within the same physical environment, where the temperature, pressure, and thus the number density (`n`) of residual gas molecules are constant.\n\n**1. Define the Two Mean Free Paths**\n*   **λ₁**: This is the mean free path for a gas molecule colliding with other identical, moving gas molecules. This is governed by the kinetic theory of gases.\n*   **λ₂**: This is the mean free path for a high-energy electron (from a 1000 kV beam) scattering off those same gas molecules. This is governed by particle scattering physics.\n\n**2. Formulate the Equations for each MFP**\nThe general formula for the mean free path is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where `σ` is the collision cross-section. The difference between the two scenarios lies in the details of the collision process.\n\n*   **For λ₁ (Molecule-Molecule Collisions):**\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Relative Motion.** In a gas, all particles are in random thermal motion. To account for the relative velocities between the projectile molecule and the target molecules, kinetic theory introduces a correction factor of `√2` in the denominator. This factor increases the collision probability compared to stationary targets, thereby reducing the MFP.\n    *   The formula is: **λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)**\n    *   `σ_gg` is the gas-kinetic cross-section, related to the physical size of the molecules.\n\n*   **For λ₂ (Electron-Molecule Collisions):**\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Stationary Target Approximation.** The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, giving them relativistic speeds (approximately 94% of the speed of light). This velocity is many orders of magnitude greater than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules. From the electron's perspective, the gas molecules are effectively stationary targets. Therefore, the `√2` factor from kinetic theory does not apply.\n    *   The formula is: **λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)**\n    *   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron with a gas molecule.\n\n**3. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ)**\nThis is the most critical physical insight and is essential for solving the problem.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Effect of High Energy on Scattering Cross-Section.** One might incorrectly assume that the electron's charge leads to a stronger interaction and thus a larger cross-section. While this can be true for low-energy electrons, the opposite is true for very high-energy particles. The 1000 keV electron is extremely penetrating. It travels past a molecule so quickly that the interaction time is minuscule, resulting in a very low probability of a significant scattering event. The atom becomes effectively more \"transparent\" to the fast-moving electron.\n*   Therefore, the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron (`σ_eg`) is significantly **smaller** than the gas-kinetic cross-section between two molecules (`σ_gg`).\n*   Conclusion: **σ_eg << σ_gg**\n\n**4. Synthesize the Final Relationship**\nWe can now find the relationship between `λ₁` and `λ₂` by calculating their ratio:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [ 1 / (n * σ_eg) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) ]\n\nBy canceling the constant `n` and rearranging the complex fraction, we get:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg\n**λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\n**5. Interpret the Result and Evaluate the Options**\nThe ratio `λ₂ / λ₁` is the product of two distinct factors, both of which are greater than 1:\n1.  **The `√2` factor (≈ 1.414):** This arises from the difference in target motion (moving vs. stationary).\n2.  **The Cross-Section Ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)`:** Since we established that `σ_gg` is much larger than `σ_eg`, this ratio is a number significantly greater than 1.\n\nThe product of a number ≈ 1.414 and another number significantly greater than 1 must be a final result significantly greater than 1.414.\n**Therefore, our physical conclusion is: λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁**\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options based on this conclusion:\n\n*   A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: **This statement is true.** If λ₂ is proven to be greater than 1.414 times λ₁, it is certainly and logically greater than or equal to 1.22 times λ₁. This is the only option consistent with the physics.\n*   B) λ2 < λ1: This is false. This is the opposite of the physical reality.\n*   C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This is false. While it correctly identifies λ₂ is larger, it imposes an upper limit (`< 1.22*λ₁`) that is contradicted by our finding that the ratio must be greater than 1.414.\n*   D) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: This is false. There are clear and fundamental physical reasons why the two mean free paths are different.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a synthesis of the candidate answers and a step-by-step analysis of the physics, we can determine the correct conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem is to compare two different mean free paths (MFP) within the same physical environment. The number density of gas molecules, `n`, is constant in both scenarios.\n\n*   **λ₁**: The mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules.\n*   **λ₂**: The mean free path of a high-energy electron scattering off gas molecules.\n\nHere are the careful points and steps to reach the solution:\n\n**1. Formulate the Mean Free Path Equations**\n\nThe general formula for MFP is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where `n` is the number density of targets and `σ` is the collision cross-section. The specific formulas differ for our two cases.\n\n*   **For λ₁ (Molecule-Molecule Collision):** In the kinetic theory of gases, when considering collisions between particles that are all in random thermal motion, the formula is modified by a `√2` factor to account for the relative motion.\n    *   **λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)**\n    *   Here, `σ_gg` is the gas-kinetic cross-section between two molecules.\n\n*   **For λ₂ (Electron-Molecule Collision):** The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, giving them relativistic speeds vastly greater than the thermal speed of the gas molecules. From the electron's perspective, the molecules are effectively stationary targets. In this stationary target approximation, the `√2` factor is not used.\n    *   **λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)**\n    *   Here, `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron with a gas molecule.\n\n**2. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ)**\n\nThis is the most critical physical insight.\n\n*   **σ_gg**: This is the kinetic cross-section, related to the physical size of the molecules, which determines their \"billiard ball\"-like interaction probability.\n*   **σ_eg**: This is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron. It is a common misconception to assume the electron's charge automatically leads to a larger interaction. For a highly energetic and penetrating particle like a 1000 keV electron, the opposite is true. The electron travels past the target atom so quickly that the interaction time is extremely short, leading to a low probability of a significant scattering event. Therefore, the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron is **significantly smaller** than the kinetic cross-section between two molecules.\n    *   The key conclusion here is: **σ_eg << σ_gg**.\n\n**3. Combine the Formulas to Compare λ₁ and λ₂**\n\nTo find the relationship between the two mean free paths, we can take the ratio of their equations:\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [ 1 / (n * σ_eg) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) ]\n\nThe number density `n` cancels out. Simplifying the fraction gives:\n**λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\n**4. Interpret the Result and Evaluate the Options**\n\nWe have established two factors that determine the ratio `λ₂ / λ₁`:\n1.  **The Target Motion Factor:** `√2` (approximately 1.414). This factor alone makes λ₂ larger than λ₁.\n2.  **The Cross-Section Factor:** The ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)` is a number significantly greater than 1 because `σ_gg` is much larger than `σ_eg`.\n\nThe final ratio is the product of `√2` and a number significantly greater than 1. Therefore, we can definitively state that the ratio `λ₂ / λ₁` is significantly larger than 1.414.\n*   **λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁**\n\nNow, we must choose the option from the list that is consistent with this conclusion:\n\n*   A) λ2 < λ1: This is false.\n*   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This is false. While it correctly states `λ₂ > λ₁`, it imposes an upper bound (`< 1.22 * λ₁`) that is contradicted by our finding (`> 1.414 * λ₁`).\n*   **C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1**: This is **true**. If a value (λ₂) is definitively greater than 1.414 times another value (λ₁), it is certainly also greater than or equal to 1.22 times that value.\n*   D) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: This is false, as clear physical principles explain the difference.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1.

The analysis, therefore, must focus on how `σ` and any other corrective factors differ between the two cases.\n\n### **Step-by-step Derivation and Careful Points**\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the equation for λ₁ (Gas-Molecule MFP)**\n\nThis scenario is described by the kinetic theory of gases.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The effect of moving targets.** In a gas, the \"projectile\" molecule and the \"target\" molecules are all in random thermal motion. To account for their relative velocities, which increases the frequency of collisions compared to a scenario with stationary targets, the standard formula includes a correction factor of `√2`.\n*   The correct formula is:\n    **λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)**\n    where `σ_gg` is the gas-kinetic cross-section, which represents the effective physical area for two molecules to collide.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the equation for λ₂ (Electron-Molecule MFP)**\n\nThis scenario involves a high-energy particle interacting with gas molecules.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The stationary target approximation.** The electrons are accelerated by 1000 kV, giving them relativistic speeds (over 94% the speed of light). This velocity is many orders of magnitude greater than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules. From the perspective of the ultra-fast electron, the gas molecules are effectively stationary targets. Therefore, the `√2` factor from kinetic gas theory is not applicable here.\n*   The correct formula is:\n    **λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)**\n    where `σ_eg` is the electron-gas scattering cross-section.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the collision cross-sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg)**\n\nThis is the most critical physical insight of the problem.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The effect of projectile energy on cross-section.** It is a common misconception to assume that a charged particle like an electron will always interact more strongly (i.e., have a larger cross-section) than a neutral molecule. While this can be true for low-energy electrons, the opposite is true for very high-energy particles. The 1000 keV electron is extremely penetrating. It travels past a target atom so quickly that the interaction time is minuscule, leading to a very low probability of a significant scattering event. In essence, the atom becomes more \"transparent\" to the fast-moving electron.\n*   Therefore, the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron is significantly **smaller** than the gas-kinetic cross-section for two molecules.\n    **σ_eg << σ_gg**\n\n**Step 4: Derive the relationship between λ₁ and λ₂**\n\nNow we can combine the formulas and insights by calculating the ratio of the two mean free paths:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [ 1 / (n * σ_eg) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) ]\n\nThe number density `n` cancels out. By simplifying the fraction, we get:\n\n**λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\n**Step 5: Interpret the final result**\n\nThe ratio `λ₂ / λ₁` is the product of two factors, both of which increase its value:\n1.  **The `√2` factor (≈ 1.414):** This factor arises from the stationary nature of the electron's targets.\n2.  **The cross-section ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)`:** Since we established that `σ_gg` is much larger than `σ_eg`, this ratio is a number significantly greater than 1.\n\nThe product of a number ≈1.414 and another number much greater than 1 means the final ratio `λ₂ / λ₁` must be significantly greater than 1.414.\n\n**Conclusion: λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁**\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate the given options**\n\nWe must choose the option that is consistent with our physical conclusion, `λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁`.\n\n*   A) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: Incorrect. The underlying physics are fundamentally different.\n*   B) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22\\*λ₁: Incorrect. This correctly states that λ₂ is larger, but it imposes an upper bound (`< 1.22*λ₁`) that is contradicted by our finding that the ratio must be greater than 1.414.\n*   C) λ₂ < λ₁: Incorrect. This is the opposite of the physical reality.\n*   D) λ₂ >= 1.22\\*λ₁: **Correct**. Since our physical analysis proves that λ₂ is greater than 1.414 times λ₁, it is certainly and logically true that λ₂ is also greater than or equal to 1.22 times λ₁. This is the only statement consistent with the physics.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers and highlighting all the careful points required for a complete understanding.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Two Mean Free Paths (MFPs)\nThe problem requires comparing two distinct types of mean free path (MFP) within the same physical environment. This means the number density of residual gas molecules, `n`, is the same in both scenarios.\n*   **λ₁**: This is the mean free path for a **gas molecule** traveling through a collection of other identical, **moving** gas molecules. This is the standard scenario described by the kinetic theory of gases.\n*   **λ₂**: This is the mean free path for a **high-energy electron** (from the 1000 kV beam) traveling through the same collection of gas molecules. This is a particle scattering problem.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Equations for Mean Free Path\nThe general formula for MFP is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where `n` is the number density of the target particles and `σ` is the collision cross-section. The specific formula differs based on the relative motion of the projectile and the target.\n\n*   **For λ₁ (Molecule-Molecule Collisions):**\n    The key insight here is that the \"target\" gas molecules are also in random thermal motion, not stationary. Kinetic theory accounts for this relative motion between all particles by introducing a correction factor of `√2` in the denominator.\n    *   **Formula**: `λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)`\n    *   `σ_gg` is the gas-kinetic cross-section, which represents the effective physical area for two molecules to collide.\n\n*   **For λ₂ (Electron-Molecule Collisions):**\n    The projectile is a 1000 kV electron. Electrons accelerated by this voltage travel at relativistic speeds (over 94% the speed of light), which is many orders of magnitude faster than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Stationary Target Approximation.** Because the electron is so much faster than the gas molecules, the molecules can be considered effectively stationary targets from the electron's perspective. In this case, the `√2` correction factor does not apply.\n    *   **Formula**: `λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`\n    *   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron interacting with a gas molecule.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ)\nThis is the most critical physical insight and is often counterintuitive. We must compare the effective \"target area\" a gas molecule presents to another molecule versus the area it presents to a high-energy electron.\n\n*   **`σ_gg` (Gas-Kinetic Cross-Section):** This is related to the physical size of the molecules, describing the area needed for two molecules to have a \"billiard ball\"-like collision.\n*   **`σ_eg` (Electron Scattering Cross-Section):**\n    *   **Careful Point 2: High-Energy Particle Penetration.** A common mistake is to assume a charged particle like an electron will always have a larger interaction cross-section due to the long-range Coulomb force. This is not true for high-energy particles. The 1000 keV electron is extremely energetic and highly penetrating. It travels past a target molecule so quickly that the interaction time is minuscule. This leads to a very low probability of a significant deflection (a \"scattering\" event), making the molecule largely \"transparent\" to the fast-moving electron.\n    *   Therefore, the effective scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron (`σ_eg`) is significantly **smaller** than the kinetic cross-section between two molecules (`σ_gg`).\n    *   **Conclusion**: **σ_eg << σ_gg**\n\n### Step 4: Derive the Relationship Between λ₁ and λ₂\nTo directly compare the two MFPs, we can take the ratio of their respective formulas:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [ 1 / (n * σ_eg) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) ]\n\nThe number density `n` cancels out. By inverting the denominator and multiplying, we get:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg\n**λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\n### Step 5: Interpret the Result and Evaluate the Options\nWe have established two factors that combine to determine the final ratio:\n1.  **The Target Motion Factor:** The presence of `√2` (≈ 1.414) in the numerator makes `λ₂` larger than `λ₁`, all else being equal.\n2.  **The Cross-Section Factor:** The ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)` is a number significantly greater than 1 because `σ_gg` is much larger than `σ_eg`.\n\nThe final ratio is the product of ~1.414 and a number much larger than 1. Therefore, we can definitively conclude that the ratio `λ₂ / λ₁` is significantly greater than 1.414.\n\n**Final Conclusion**: **λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁**\n\nNow we must choose the multiple-choice option that is consistent with this physical fact:\n\n*   **A) λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁**: If `λ₂` is greater than `1.414 * λ₁`, it is certainly also greater than or equal to `1.22 * λ₁`. This statement is **true** and logically consistent with our findings.\n*   **B) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation**: This is false. The underlying physics are fundamentally different, so the MFPs cannot be equal.\n*   **C) λ₂ < λ₁**: This is false. This is the opposite of the physical reality.\n*   **D) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁**: This is false. While it correctly states `λ₂` is larger than `λ₁`, it imposes an upper bound (`< 1.22*λ₁`) that is demonstrably violated by our finding that the ratio must be greater than 1.414.\n\nThe only statement that is consistent with the physical analysis is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on a synthesis of the candidate answers, the problem can be solved by carefully analyzing the physics behind the two different types of mean free paths. All the candidate answers converge on the same physical reasoning.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem and Define the Two Mean Free Paths (MFP)**\n\nThe question asks for a comparison between two MFPs measured in the same environment (the vacuum chamber of a TEM), which means the number density of residual gas molecules, `n`, is constant for both scenarios.\n\n*   **λ₁**: The mean free path of a **gas molecule** colliding with other identical, moving **gas molecules**. This is the standard definition from the kinetic theory of gases.\n*   **λ₂**: The mean free path of a **high-energy electron** from the 1000 kV beam scattering off a **gas molecule**. This is a particle-scattering problem.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Key Physical Differences and Careful Points**\n\nThere are two fundamental physical differences between the calculation of λ₁ and λ₂.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Effect of Target Motion**\n    The formula for the mean free path, `λ`, depends on whether the targets are stationary or moving.\n    *   For **λ₁**, both the projectile molecule and the target molecules are in random thermal motion. Kinetic theory shows that this increases the collision frequency. To account for this, a correction factor of `√2` is placed in the denominator of the MFP formula: `λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)`.\n    *   For **λ₂**, the electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, making them travel at relativistic speeds (over 94% the speed of light). This velocity is vastly greater than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules. From the electron's perspective, the gas molecules are effectively **stationary targets**. In this case, the `√2` factor is not used: `λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`.\n    *   *Conclusion 1*: This difference in target motion alone makes λ₂ larger than λ₁ by a factor of √2 (≈ 1.414), assuming the cross-sections were the same.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Effect of Collision Cross-Section (σ)**\n    The collision cross-section, `σ`, represents the effective \"size\" of the target for an interaction.\n    *   **σ_gg**: This is the gas-kinetic cross-section, representing the effective area for a physical \"hard-sphere\" collision between two relatively large, slow-moving molecules. It is related to the physical dimensions of the molecules' electron shells.\n    *   **σ_eg**: This is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron. It is a common misconception that an electron's charge will always lead to a larger interaction area. At extremely high energies (1000 keV), the electron is a highly penetrating particle. It travels past the gas molecule so quickly that the electromagnetic interaction time is extremely short, leading to a low probability of significant deflection (scattering). In essence, the molecule becomes more \"transparent\" to the fast-moving electron.\n    *   *Conclusion 2*: The scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron is significantly **smaller** than the kinetic cross-section between two molecules (`σ_eg << σ_gg`). A smaller cross-section leads to a longer mean free path.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Effects and Derive the Final Relationship**\n\nWe can combine the formulas for λ₁ and λ₂ to find their ratio:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [ 1 / (n * σ_eg) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) ]\n\nThe number density `n` cancels out. By rearranging the fraction, we get:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)\n\nNow, we analyze the value of this ratio based on our careful points:\n1.  The `√2` factor is approximately 1.414.\n2.  The ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)` is a number significantly greater than 1, because σ_gg is much larger than σ_eg.\n\nThe final ratio is the product of `~1.414` and a number much larger than 1. Therefore, we can definitively conclude that the ratio `λ₂ / λ₁` is significantly greater than 1.414.\n\n**λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁**\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Given Options**\n\nWe must choose the option that is a logical consequence of our derived physical relationship, `λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁`.\n\n*   **A) λ₂ >= 1.22 * λ₁**: This is **correct**. If a value (λ₂) is definitively greater than 1.414 times another value (λ₁), it is certainly also greater than or equal to 1.22 times that value. This is the only statement consistent with the physics.\n*   **B) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22 * λ₁**: This is incorrect. The upper bound of `λ₂ < 1.22 * λ₁` is impossible, as our result shows λ₂ must be greater than 1.414 * λ₁.\n*   **C) λ₂ < λ₁**: This is incorrect. This is the opposite of the physical reality derived from both careful points.\n*   **D) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation**: This is incorrect. There are clear and distinct physical reasons for the mean free paths to be different.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided answers, with a focus on all the careful points required for the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem and Define Physical Quantities\n\nThe question asks for a comparison between two different types of mean free paths (MFP) calculated within the same physical environment—a TEM vacuum chamber. The environment is characterized by a constant temperature and an ultra-high vacuum, which implies that the number density (`n`) of the residual gas molecules is constant for both scenarios.\n\n*   **λ₁**: The mean free path for a **gas molecule** colliding with other identical, moving **gas molecules**. This is the standard scenario described by the kinetic theory of gases.\n*   **λ₂**: The mean free path for a **high-energy electron** (from a 1000 kV beam) scattering off a **gas molecule**. This is a particle physics scattering problem.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Mean Free Path (MFP) Equations\n\nThe general formula for MFP is `λ = 1 / (n * σ)`, where `σ` is the collision cross-section. The specific formulas for λ₁ and λ₂ differ due to the physics of the interactions.\n\n*   **For λ₁ (Molecule-Molecule Collision):**\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Target Motion.** In a gas, all particles are in random thermal motion. Kinetic theory demonstrates that the relative motion between the \"projectile\" molecule and the \"target\" molecules increases the collision frequency. This is accounted for by adding a `√2` factor to the denominator of the MFP formula.\n    *   **Formula:** `λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)`\n    *   Here, `σ_gg` is the gas-kinetic cross-section, which represents the effective physical area for two molecules to collide.\n\n*   **For λ₂ (Electron-Molecule Collision):**\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Stationary Target Approximation.** The electrons are accelerated by 1000 kV, giving them relativistic speeds (over 94% the speed of light). This speed is many orders of magnitude greater than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules. From the perspective of the ultra-fast electron, the gas molecules are effectively stationary targets. Therefore, the `√2` factor from kinetic theory is not used.\n    *   **Formula:** `λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`\n    *   Here, `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron interacting with a gas molecule.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ)\n\nThis step contains the most critical physical insight of the problem. We must compare the effective target \"size\" of a gas molecule as seen by another molecule versus as seen by a high-energy electron.\n\n*   `σ_gg` represents the kinetic cross-section, related to the physical size of the molecules, for a \"hard-sphere\" or billiard-ball-like collision.\n*   `σ_eg` represents the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron.\n    *   **Careful Point 3: The Role of Energy in Scattering.** It is a common misconception that a charged particle (the electron) will always interact more strongly and thus have a larger cross-section. This is highly dependent on the particle's energy. At the extreme energy of 1000 keV, the electron is highly penetrating. It travels past a gas molecule so quickly that the electromagnetic interaction time is extremely short. This results in a very low probability of a significant deflection or scattering event. In effect, the gas becomes largely \"transparent\" to the fast-moving electron.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron (`σ_eg`) is significantly **smaller** than the kinetic cross-section between two molecules (`σ_gg`). Thus, `σ_eg << σ_gg`.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesize the Final Relationship\n\nBy combining the formulas and insights, we can determine the mathematical relationship between λ₁ and λ₂. The most direct method is to calculate their ratio:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [ 1 / (n * σ_eg) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) ]\n\nThe number density `n` cancels out. By inverting the denominator and multiplying, we get:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg\n\nThis can be rearranged to highlight the two contributing factors:\n\n**λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the Result and Evaluate the Options\n\nThe value of the ratio `λ₂ / λ₁` is determined by two factors, both of which are greater than 1:\n\n1.  **The Target Motion Factor (`√2`)**: This term is approximately 1.414. It arises because the electron's targets are stationary, which decreases their collision probability compared to the case where targets are also moving.\n2.  **The Cross-Section Ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)`**: Since `σ_gg` is much larger than `σ_eg`, this ratio is a number significantly greater than 1.\n\nMultiplying a number `≈1.414` by a number `>>1` results in a product that must be significantly greater than 1.414.\n**Therefore, the physical conclusion is: `λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁`**\n\nNow, we must choose the option from the list that is consistent with this conclusion:\n\n*   A) λ₂ < λ₁: False. This contradicts the analysis.\n*   B) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁: False. This is incorrect because our result shows that `λ₂` must be greater than `1.414*λ₁`, so it cannot be less than `1.22*λ₁`.\n*   C) λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁: **True**. If `λ₂` is greater than `1.414*λ₁`, it is logically and mathematically necessary that `λ₂` is also greater than or equal to `1.22*λ₁`. This is the only statement that is consistent with the physical analysis.\n*   D) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: False. There are clear physical reasons (`√2` factor and different cross-sections) for the two mean free paths to be different.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers and highlighting the careful points required to reach the correct conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe question asks us to compare two different mean free paths (MFP) in the same physical environment:\n*   **λ₁**: The MFP of a residual gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules.\n*   **λ₂**: The MFP of a high-energy electron from the TEM beam scattering off those same gas molecules.\n\nThe number density of gas molecules (`n`), which is determined by the constant pressure and temperature, is the same for both calculations. The difference must therefore arise from the physics of the collision process.\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the Mean Free Path Equations**\n\nThe general formula for MFP is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where `σ` is the collision cross-section. This formula must be adapted for each scenario.\n\n*   **For λ₁ (Molecule-Molecule Collision):** This is the standard scenario described by the kinetic theory of gases.\n    *   **Formula:** `λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)`\n    *   **`σ_gg`**: This is the gas-kinetic cross-section, representing the effective area for two molecules to physically collide.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: The `√2` Factor.** This crucial factor is included to account for the relative motion between the \"projectile\" molecule and the \"target\" molecules, which are all moving randomly at thermal speeds. This relative motion increases the effective collision frequency, thus shortening the mean free path compared to a scenario with stationary targets.\n\n*   **For λ₂ (Electron-Molecule Collision):** Here, the projectile is a 1000 kV electron.\n    *   **Formula:** `λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`\n    *   **`σ_eg`**: This is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron with a gas molecule.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: The Absence of the `√2` Factor.** The electrons are accelerated to relativistic speeds (over 94% of the speed of light), making them many orders of magnitude faster than the thermally moving gas molecules. From the electron's perspective, the gas molecules are effectively stationary targets. Therefore, the `√2` correction factor is not used.\n\n**Step 2: Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg)**\n\nThis is the most critical physical insight needed for the solution.\n\n*   `σ_gg` represents the effective area for a physical, \"hard-sphere\" like collision between two molecules, related to their physical size.\n*   `σ_eg` represents the effective area for a high-energy electron to be significantly deflected (scattered).\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Effect of High Energy on Cross-Section.** It is a common misconception to assume that because an electron is charged, it will interact more strongly and thus have a larger cross-section. While this can be true for low-energy electrons, the opposite is true for very high-energy particles. The 1000 keV electron is extremely penetrating. It travels past the gas molecule so rapidly that the interaction time is minuscule, leading to a very low probability of a significant scattering event. In effect, the molecule becomes more \"transparent\" to the fast-moving electron.\n*   **Conclusion**: The scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron is significantly **smaller** than the kinetic cross-section between two molecules. So, **σ_eg << σ_gg**.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the Formulas and Derive the Final Relationship**\n\nWe can now find the ratio of λ₂ to λ₁ by dividing their respective equations:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [ 1 / (n * σ_eg) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) ]\n\nBy canceling the common term `n` and rearranging the fraction, we get:\n\n**λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\n**Step 4: Interpret the Result and Evaluate the Options**\n\nThe final relationship `λ₂ = λ₁ * √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)` tells us everything we need to know.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Analyzing the Two Factors.**\n    1.  The `√2` factor (≈ 1.414) comes from the difference in target motion (moving vs. stationary). This factor alone makes `λ₂` larger than `λ₁`.\n    2.  The ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)` is a number significantly greater than 1, because the electron's scattering cross-section is much smaller than the molecule's kinetic cross-section.\n\nMultiplying a number ≈1.414 by another number `>>1` results in a total ratio that must be significantly greater than 1.414.\nTherefore, our physical conclusion is: **λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁**\n\nNow we evaluate the given options against this conclusion:\n\nA) λ2 < λ1\n   *   Incorrect.

Since our physical analysis proves that `λ₂` must be greater than `1.414 * λ₁`, it is certainly and logically true that `λ₂` must also be greater than or equal to `1.22 * λ₁`. This is the only statement consistent with the physics of the problem.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nAn analysis of the provided answers reveals a unanimous and correct physical reasoning. The solution involves a step-by-step comparison of the two scenarios described in the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe fundamental task is to compare two mean free paths (MFP) in the same physical environment, where the number density of gas molecules (`n`) is constant.\n\n1.  **Define the Two Mean Free Paths:**\n    *   **λ₁**: The mean free path of a **gas molecule** colliding with other identical, moving **gas molecules**. This is the standard MFP described by the kinetic theory of gases.\n    *   **λ₂**: The mean free path of a **high-energy electron** (from the 1000 kV beam) scattering off a **gas molecule**. This is a particle scattering problem.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Correct Equations for Mean Free Path**\n    The general formula for MFP is `λ = 1 / (n * σ)`, where `σ` is the collision cross-section. The specific formulas for λ₁ and λ₂ differ due to the motion of the particles involved.\n\n    *   **Equation for λ₁:**\n        The formula for the mean free path of a gas molecule moving among other identical, moving molecules is:\n        **λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)**\n        where `σ_gg` is the gas-kinetic cross-section.\n    *   **Equation for λ₂:**\n        The formula for a beam of very fast particles hitting effectively stationary targets is:\n        **λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)**\n        where `σ_eg` is the electron-gas scattering cross-section.\n\n3.  **Identify and Explain the Key Differences (Careful Points)**\n    There are two critical physical differences between the calculation for λ₁ and λ₂:\n\n    *   **Careful Point 1: The Stationary Target Approximation (`√2` factor).**\n        The formula for λ₁ includes a `√2` factor (≈ 1.414) in the denominator. This factor accounts for the fact that the target molecules are also in random thermal motion, which increases the relative velocity and thus the collision frequency compared to stationary targets. For λ₂, the electrons are accelerated to relativistic speeds (1000 kV is ~94% the speed of light), making them many orders of magnitude faster than the gas molecules. From the electron's perspective, the gas molecules are effectively stationary. Therefore, the `√2` factor is not used in the formula for λ₂, making its MFP inherently longer.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 2: The Collision Cross-Sections (σ_gg vs. σ_eg).**\n        This is the most significant physical difference. One might mistakenly assume a charged electron interacts more strongly, leading to a larger cross-section. However, the opposite is true for very high-energy particles. A 1000 keV electron is extremely penetrating. It travels past a gas molecule so quickly that the electromagnetic interaction time is minuscule, leading to a very low probability of a significant scattering event.

This is the opposite of the physical reality.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting the careful physical points required for the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem is to compare the mean free path (MFP) of a gas molecule with itself (λ₁) against the MFP of a high-energy electron with that same gas molecule (λ₂).\n\n1.  **Define the Scenarios and Formulate the Mean Free Paths**\n    The general formula for mean free path is `λ = 1 / (n * σ)`, where `n` is the number density of target particles and `σ` is the collision cross-section. In this problem, the pressure and temperature are constant, so the number density `n` of gas molecules is the same for both λ₁ and λ₂. The difference lies in the other factors.\n\n    *   **λ₁ (Molecule-Molecule Collision):** This is the MFP of a gas molecule moving through other identical, *moving* gas molecules.\n        *   **Formula:** `λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)`\n        *   `σ_gg` is the gas-kinetic cross-section, related to the physical size of the molecules.\n\n    *   **λ₂ (Electron-Molecule Collision):** This is the MFP of a very high-energy electron (1000 kV) scattering off a gas molecule.\n        *   **Formula:** `λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`\n        *   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron with a gas molecule.\n\n2.  **Identify and Analyze the Critical Differences (Careful Points)**\n    There are two fundamental physical differences that cause λ₁ and λ₂ to be different.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 1: The Effect of Target Motion (The `√2` Factor)**\n        For λ₁, the \"target\" molecules are moving randomly, just like the \"projectile\" molecule. The kinetic theory of gases introduces the `√2` factor to account for the increased collision frequency due to this relative motion. For λ₂, the electrons are moving at relativistic speeds (over 94% the speed of light), vastly faster than the thermal motion of the gas molecules. From the electron's perspective, the gas molecules are effectively **stationary targets**. Therefore, the `√2` factor is absent in the formula for λ₂. This factor alone makes λ₂ larger.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 2: The Difference in Collision Cross-Section (σ)**\n        This is the most crucial physical insight.\n        *   `σ_gg` represents the effective area for two relatively large, slow molecules to \"hit\" each other, a process dominated by their physical size.\n        *   `σ_eg` represents the effective area for a high-energy electron to be significantly scattered. It is a common mistake to assume the electron's charge means it interacts more strongly. At very high energies (1000 keV), the electron is extremely **penetrating**. It travels so fast that the time it spends in the vicinity of a gas molecule is minuscule, leading to a very low probability of a significant scattering event. In essence, the gas becomes more \"transparent\" to the electron. Therefore, the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron is **significantly smaller** than the kinetic cross-section between two molecules.\n        *   Conclusion: **σ_eg << σ_gg**.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Resulting Relationship**\n    To find the direct relationship between λ₁ and λ₂, we can calculate their ratio by dividing their respective formulas:\n    \n    λ₂ / λ₁ = [ 1 / (n * σ_eg) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) ]\n\n    After canceling the common term `n` and rearranging the fraction, we get:\n\n    **λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\n    Let's analyze the value of this ratio:\n    *   The `√2` term is approximately 1.414.\n    *   The cross-section ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)` is a number significantly greater than 1.\n\n    The final ratio (`λ₂ / λ₁`) is the product of `~1.414` and a number much larger than 1. Therefore, the ratio must be significantly greater than 1.414.\n    \n    **Final physical conclusion: λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁**\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Given Options**\n    We must now select the option from the question that is consistent with our physical conclusion, `λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁`.\n\n    *   A) `λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation`: Incorrect. The underlying physics is fundamentally different.\n    *   B) `λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1`: Incorrect. This correctly identifies that λ₂ is larger, but it imposes an upper bound (`< 1.22*λ₁`) that is contradicted by our finding that the ratio must be greater than 1.414.\n    *   C) `λ2 < λ1`: Incorrect. This is the opposite of the physical reality.\n    *   D) `λ2 >= 1.22*λ1`: **Correct**. Since our physical analysis proves that `λ₂` is greater than `1.414 * λ₁`, it is certainly and logically true that `λ₂` is also greater than or equal to `1.22 * λ₁`. This is the only option consistent with the physics.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the physical principles governing this problem. The final conclusion can be reached through a step-by-step breakdown that incorporates the key insights shared across the provided analyses.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Define the Two Physical Scenarios**\n\nThe question asks for a comparison between two different types of mean free path (MFP) measured in the same physical environment. The number density of residual gas molecules, `n`, is constant for both cases.\n*   **λ₁**: The mean free path for a **gas molecule** colliding with other identical, moving **gas molecules**.\n*   **λ₂**: The mean free path for a **high-energy electron** from the 1000 kV beam scattering off those same **gas molecules**.\n\n**2. Formulate the Correct Mean Free Path Equations**\n\nThe general formula for MFP is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where `σ` is the collision cross-section. The specific formula changes based on the nature of the collision.\n\n*   **For λ₁ (Molecule-Molecule Collisions):**\n    This scenario is described by the kinetic theory of gases.\n    **Careful Point 1: Target Motion:** Since the projectile molecule is moving through a gas of other molecules that are also in random thermal motion, the relative velocity increases the collision frequency. To account for this, the standard formula includes a factor of `√2`.\n    `λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)`\n    Here, `σ_gg` is the gas-kinetic cross-section between two molecules.\n\n*   **For λ₂ (Electron-Molecule Collisions):**\n    The projectile is a 1000 kV electron.\n    **Careful Point 2: Stationary Target Approximation:** An electron accelerated by 1000 kV is moving at a relativistic speed (~94% the speed of light), which is many orders of magnitude faster than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules. From the electron's perspective, the gas molecules are effectively stationary targets. Therefore, the `√2` factor does not apply.\n    `λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`\n    Here, `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron with a gas molecule.\n\n**3. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ)**\n\nThis is the most critical physical insight of the problem.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Nature of the Cross-Section:** The collision cross-section is a measure of interaction probability. For a very high-energy particle like a 1000 keV electron, it is a common misconception that its charge guarantees a large interaction. The opposite is true. The electron is highly penetrating and travels past a target molecule so quickly that the interaction time is extremely short. This results in a very low probability of a significant deflection (scattering). The gas molecule becomes effectively \"transparent\" to the fast electron. In contrast, `σ_gg` relates to a \"harder\" physical collision between two much larger, slower objects.\n*   **Conclusion:** The high-energy electron scattering cross-section is significantly smaller than the gas-kinetic collision cross-section: **σ_eg << σ_gg**.\n\n**4. Combine the Formulas to Find the Final Relationship**\n\nBy taking the ratio of the two mean free path equations, we can find their relationship:\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [ 1 / (n * σ_eg) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) ]\n\nBy canceling the common `n` term and rearranging the fraction, we get:\n**λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\n**5. Interpret the Result and Evaluate the Options**\n\nWe can now analyze the final ratio.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Analyzing the Factors:** The final ratio `λ₂ / λ₁` is a product of two terms, both of which increase the value of λ₂ relative to λ₁:\n    1.  `√2` (approximately 1.414). This factor comes from the stationary nature of the electron's targets.\n    2.  `(σ_gg / σ_eg)`. Since `σ_gg` is much larger than `σ_eg`, this ratio is a number significantly greater than 1.\n\nMultiplying these two terms together (`~1.414` * `a number >> 1`) means that the total ratio must be significantly greater than 1.414. Therefore, the definitive physical conclusion is:\n**λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁**\n\nBased on this conclusion, we can evaluate the original options:\n*   A) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. The upper bound (`< 1.22*λ₁`) contradicts our finding that `λ₂` must be greater than `1.414*λ₁`.\n*   B) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect. This is the opposite of the physical reality.\n*   C) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: Incorrect. The underlying physics are fundamentally different.\n*   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: **Correct.** Since our analysis proves that `λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁`, it is certainly and logically true that `λ₂` must also be greater than or equal to `1.22 * λ₁`.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning, highlighting the critical points necessary to arrive at the correct conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe question requires a comparison between two different types of mean free paths (MFP) in the same physical environment, where the number density of gas molecules (`n`) is constant.\n\n**1. Define the Mean Free Paths**\n*   **λ₁**: This is the mean free path for a **gas molecule** moving through a collection of other identical, **moving gas molecules**. This is the standard scenario in the kinetic theory of gases.\n*   **λ₂**: This is the mean free path for a **high-energy electron** (accelerated by 1000 kV) scattering off one of the **gas molecules**.\n\n**2. Formulate the Mean Free Path Equations**\nThe general formula for MFP is `λ = 1 / (n * σ)`, where `σ` is the collision cross-section. The specific formulas differ for our two cases.\n\n*   **For λ₁**: When considering collisions between particles that are all in random thermal motion, kinetic theory includes a `√2` correction factor to account for their relative velocities.\n    `λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)`\n    Here, `σ_gg` is the gas-kinetic cross-section between two molecules.\n\n*   **For λ₂**: The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, achieving relativistic speeds that are many orders of magnitude greater than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules. As a result, the gas molecules can be considered effectively stationary targets from the electron's perspective. In this case, the `√2` factor is not used.\n    `λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`\n    Here, `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron interacting with a gas molecule.\n\n**3. Careful Points and Key Physical Insights**\nThere are two critical physical differences that determine the relationship between λ₁ and λ₂, and these are the careful points to consider:\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Target Motion Factor (`√2`)**\n    The `√2` factor is present in the denominator for λ₁ but not for λ₂. It accounts for the fact that for gas-gas collisions, the \"target\" molecules are also moving, increasing the relative speed and collision frequency. For the high-speed electron, the targets are essentially stationary. This absence of the `√2` factor for λ₂ means that, all else being equal, λ₂ would be larger than λ₁ by a factor of `√2` (approximately 1.414).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Collision Cross-Sections (σ)**\n    This is the most significant physical distinction.\n    *   `σ_gg` (Gas-Kinetic Cross-Section) is related to the physical size of the molecules, representing the effective area for a \"hard sphere\" collision.\n    *   `σ_eg` (Electron Scattering Cross-Section) represents the effective area for a high-energy electron to be significantly deflected. A common misconception is to think a charged particle will always interact more strongly. For extremely high-energy (1000 keV) electrons, the opposite is true. The particle is highly penetrating and passes the target atom so quickly that the electromagnetic interaction time is minuscule. This results in a very low probability of a significant scattering event. In essence, the gas becomes largely \"transparent\" to the fast-moving electron.\n    *   Therefore, the electron scattering cross-section is significantly smaller than the gas-kinetic cross-section: **σ_eg << σ_gg**.\n\n**4. Synthesize the Final Relationship**\nWe can directly compare λ₁ and λ₂ by calculating their ratio:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [ 1 / (n * σ_eg) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) ]\n\nAfter canceling the common term `n` and rearranging the fraction, we get:\n\n**λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\nWe can now analyze the final value of this ratio:\n*   The first factor is `√2` (≈ 1.414).\n*   The second factor, the ratio of cross-sections `(σ_gg / σ_eg)`, is a number significantly greater than 1.\n\nThe product of these two factors must be significantly greater than 1.414. Therefore, the definitive physical conclusion is:\n\n**λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁**\n\n**5. Evaluate the Options**\nBased on our conclusion, we check which of the provided options is logically consistent.\n*   A) `λ₂ = λ₁`, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: False. The underlying physics is fundamentally different.\n*   B) `λ₂ >= 1.22*λ₁`: **True**. Since our physical analysis proves that λ₂ is greater than 1.414 times λ₁, it is certainly and logically true that it is also greater than or equal to 1.22 times λ₁. This is the only statement consistent with the derived relationship.\n*   C) `λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22*λ₁`: False. This imposes an upper limit (`< 1.22 * λ₁`) that is impossible, as the ratio must be greater than 1.414.\n*   D) `λ₂ < λ₁`: False. This contradicts the physical reality on two separate counts (target motion and cross-section).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a systematic analysis of the provided candidate answers and the underlying physics, here is a detailed, step-by-step reasoning to determine the correct conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe problem requires a comparison between two distinct types of mean free paths (MFP) within the same physical environment, where the temperature, pressure, and thus the number density (`n`) of residual gas molecules are constant.\n\n**1. Define the Two Mean Free Paths**\n*   **λ₁**: This is the mean free path for a gas molecule colliding with other identical, moving gas molecules. This is governed by the kinetic theory of gases.\n*   **λ₂**: This is the mean free path for a high-energy electron (from a 1000 kV beam) scattering off those same gas molecules. This is governed by particle scattering physics.\n\n**2. Formulate the Equations for each MFP**\nThe general formula for the mean free path is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where `σ` is the collision cross-section. The difference between the two scenarios lies in the details of the collision process.\n\n*   **For λ₁ (Molecule-Molecule Collisions):**\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Relative Motion.** In a gas, all particles are in random thermal motion. To account for the relative velocities between the projectile molecule and the target molecules, kinetic theory introduces a correction factor of `√2` in the denominator. This factor increases the collision probability compared to stationary targets, thereby reducing the MFP.\n    *   The formula is: **λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)**\n    *   `σ_gg` is the gas-kinetic cross-section, related to the physical size of the molecules.\n\n*   **For λ₂ (Electron-Molecule Collisions):**\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Stationary Target Approximation.** The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, giving them relativistic speeds (approximately 94% of the speed of light). This velocity is many orders of magnitude greater than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules. From the electron's perspective, the gas molecules are effectively stationary targets. Therefore, the `√2` factor from kinetic theory does not apply.\n    *   The formula is: **λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)**\n    *   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron with a gas molecule.\n\n**3. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ)**\nThis is the most critical physical insight and is essential for solving the problem.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Effect of High Energy on Scattering Cross-Section.** One might incorrectly assume that the electron's charge leads to a stronger interaction and thus a larger cross-section. While this can be true for low-energy electrons, the opposite is true for very high-energy particles. The 1000 keV electron is extremely penetrating. It travels past a molecule so quickly that the interaction time is minuscule, resulting in a very low probability of a significant scattering event. The atom becomes effectively more \"transparent\" to the fast-moving electron.\n*   Therefore, the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron (`σ_eg`) is significantly **smaller** than the gas-kinetic cross-section between two molecules (`σ_gg`).\n*   Conclusion: **σ_eg << σ_gg**\n\n**4. Synthesize the Final Relationship**\nWe can now find the relationship between `λ₁` and `λ₂` by calculating their ratio:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [ 1 / (n * σ_eg) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) ]\n\nBy canceling the constant `n` and rearranging the complex fraction, we get:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg\n**λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\n**5. Interpret the Result and Evaluate the Options**\nThe ratio `λ₂ / λ₁` is the product of two distinct factors, both of which are greater than 1:\n1.  **The `√2` factor (≈ 1.414):** This arises from the difference in target motion (moving vs. stationary).\n2.  **The Cross-Section Ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)`:** Since we established that `σ_gg` is much larger than `σ_eg`, this ratio is a number significantly greater than 1.\n\nThe product of a number ≈ 1.414 and another number significantly greater than 1 must be a final result significantly greater than 1.414.\n**Therefore, our physical conclusion is: λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁**\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options based on this conclusion:\n\n*   A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: **This statement is true.** If λ₂ is proven to be greater than 1.414 times λ₁, it is certainly and logically greater than or equal to 1.22 times λ₁. This is the only option consistent with the physics.\n*   B) λ2 < λ1: This is false. This is the opposite of the physical reality.\n*   C) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This is false. While it correctly identifies λ₂ is larger, it imposes an upper limit (`< 1.22*λ₁`) that is contradicted by our finding that the ratio must be greater than 1.414.\n*   D) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: This is false. There are clear and fundamental physical reasons why the two mean free paths are different.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on a synthesis of the candidate answers and a step-by-step analysis of the physics, we can determine the correct conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem is to compare two different mean free paths (MFP) within the same physical environment. The number density of gas molecules, `n`, is constant in both scenarios.\n\n*   **λ₁**: The mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules.\n*   **λ₂**: The mean free path of a high-energy electron scattering off gas molecules.\n\nHere are the careful points and steps to reach the solution:\n\n**1. Formulate the Mean Free Path Equations**\n\nThe general formula for MFP is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where `n` is the number density of targets and `σ` is the collision cross-section. The specific formulas differ for our two cases.\n\n*   **For λ₁ (Molecule-Molecule Collision):** In the kinetic theory of gases, when considering collisions between particles that are all in random thermal motion, the formula is modified by a `√2` factor to account for the relative motion.\n    *   **λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)**\n    *   Here, `σ_gg` is the gas-kinetic cross-section between two molecules.\n\n*   **For λ₂ (Electron-Molecule Collision):** The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, giving them relativistic speeds vastly greater than the thermal speed of the gas molecules. From the electron's perspective, the molecules are effectively stationary targets. In this stationary target approximation, the `√2` factor is not used.\n    *   **λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)**\n    *   Here, `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron with a gas molecule.\n\n**2. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ)**\n\nThis is the most critical physical insight.\n\n*   **σ_gg**: This is the kinetic cross-section, related to the physical size of the molecules, which determines their \"billiard ball\"-like interaction probability.\n*   **σ_eg**: This is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron. It is a common misconception to assume the electron's charge automatically leads to a larger interaction. For a highly energetic and penetrating particle like a 1000 keV electron, the opposite is true. The electron travels past the target atom so quickly that the interaction time is extremely short, leading to a low probability of a significant scattering event. Therefore, the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron is **significantly smaller** than the kinetic cross-section between two molecules.\n    *   The key conclusion here is: **σ_eg << σ_gg**.\n\n**3. Combine the Formulas to Compare λ₁ and λ₂**\n\nTo find the relationship between the two mean free paths, we can take the ratio of their equations:\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [ 1 / (n * σ_eg) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) ]\n\nThe number density `n` cancels out. Simplifying the fraction gives:\n**λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\n**4. Interpret the Result and Evaluate the Options**\n\nWe have established two factors that determine the ratio `λ₂ / λ₁`:\n1.  **The Target Motion Factor:** `√2` (approximately 1.414). This factor alone makes λ₂ larger than λ₁.\n2.  **The Cross-Section Factor:** The ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)` is a number significantly greater than 1 because `σ_gg` is much larger than `σ_eg`.\n\nThe final ratio is the product of `√2` and a number significantly greater than 1. Therefore, we can definitively state that the ratio `λ₂ / λ₁` is significantly larger than 1.414.\n*   **λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁**\n\nNow, we must choose the option from the list that is consistent with this conclusion:\n\n*   A) λ2 < λ1: This is false.\n*   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This is false. While it correctly states `λ₂ > λ₁`, it imposes an upper bound (`< 1.22 * λ₁`) that is contradicted by our finding (`> 1.414 * λ₁`).\n*   **C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1**: This is **true**. If a value (λ₂) is definitively greater than 1.414 times another value (λ₁), it is certainly also greater than or equal to 1.22 times that value.\n*   D) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: This is false, as clear physical principles explain the difference.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Physical Problem and Define Key Terms**\n\nThe question asks for a comparison between two different types of mean free paths (MFP) within the same physical environment—a high-vacuum chamber. The number density of the residual gas molecules, denoted as `n`, is constant for both scenarios.\n\n*   **λ₁**: This is the mean free path for a **gas molecule** moving through a collection of other identical, **moving** gas molecules. This is a classic problem governed by the kinetic theory of gases.\n*   **λ₂**: This is the mean free path for a **high-energy electron** (from a 1000 kV beam) scattering off a **gas molecule**. This is a particle physics scattering problem.\n\n**2. State the Correct Formulas for Mean Free Path**\n\nThe general formula for mean free path is λ = 1 / (n * σ), where `σ` is the collision cross-section. The specific formula differs based on the nature of the collision.\n\n*   **For λ₁ (Molecule-Molecule Collisions):**\n    In this case, both the projectile molecule and the target molecules are in random thermal motion. The kinetic theory of gases accounts for this relative motion by introducing a correction factor of `√2` in the denominator.\n    *   **Formula:** `λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)`\n    *   `σ_gg` is the gas-kinetic cross-section, related to the physical size of the molecules.\n\n*   **For λ₂ (Electron-Molecule Collisions):**\n    The electron is accelerated by 1000 kV, giving it a relativistic velocity that is orders of magnitude greater than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules. This leads to a crucial simplification.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Stationary Target Approximation.** Because the electron is so much faster than the gas molecules, the molecules can be considered effectively stationary targets. In this case, the `√2` correction factor is not used.\n    *   **Formula:** `λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ_eg)`\n    *   `σ_eg` is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron with a gas molecule.\n\n**3. Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ)**\n\nThis is the most critical physical insight required to solve the problem.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Effect of High Energy on Cross-Section.** One might intuitively think that a charged electron would interact more strongly with a molecule than another neutral molecule would. However, this is not true for very high-energy particles. The 1000 keV electron is extremely energetic and highly penetrating. It travels past the molecule so quickly that the electromagnetic interaction time is minuscule. This results in a very low probability of a significant deflection (scattering). As a general rule in particle physics, scattering cross-sections tend to decrease as particle energy increases. The gas molecule is, therefore, more \"transparent\" to a high-energy electron than it is to another molecule.\n*   **Conclusion:** The high-energy electron scattering cross-section (`σ_eg`) is significantly **smaller** than the gas-kinetic cross-section (`σ_gg`).\n    *   `σ_eg << σ_gg`\n\n**4. Combine Formulas to Derive the Final Relationship**\n\nWe can directly compare `λ₁` and `λ₂` by taking the ratio of their formulas:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = [ 1 / (n * σ_eg) ] / [ 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg) ]\n\nCanceling the common term `n` and rearranging the fraction, we get:\n\nλ₂ / λ₁ = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg\n\nThis can be written as:\n\n**λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)**\n\n**5. Analyze the Result and Evaluate the Options**\n\nThe final ratio is determined by two factors, both of which increase the value of λ₂ relative to λ₁:\n\n1.  **The `√2` factor (~1.414):** This comes from the stationary target approximation for the electron collisions.\n2.  **The cross-section ratio `(σ_gg / σ_eg)`:** Since we established that `σ_gg` is much larger than `σ_eg`, this ratio is a number significantly greater than 1.\n\nMultiplying these two terms means the total ratio `λ₂ / λ₁` must be significantly greater than 1.414.\n**λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁**\n\nBased on this firm physical conclusion, we evaluate the given options:\n*   A) λ₂ < λ₁: Incorrect. This contradicts the physical reality.\n*   B) λ₂ >= 1.22 * λ₁: **Correct**. Since our analysis proves that `λ₂` is greater than `1.414 * λ₁`, it is certainly and logically true that `λ₂` is also greater than or equal to `1.22 * λ₁`.\n*   C) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: Incorrect. There are clear physical reasons for the values to be different.\n*   D) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22 * λ₁: Incorrect. While it correctly states `λ₂ > λ₁`, it imposes an upper bound (`< 1.22*λ₁`) that is contradicted by our finding (`> 1.414*λ₁`).\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
