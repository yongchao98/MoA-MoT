All the sound analyses converge on the same logic and numerical answer.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\nThis is the foundational step. The identity of Z is derived from three key pieces of information:\n\n*   **Chemical Formula:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 and solving gives the relationship `y = 2x`. Therefore, Z has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Saturation:** The problem states Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which means it is a fully saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   **Identity:** Z is the sole product of hydrogenating all other compounds, implying they all share its carbon skeleton. The nature of the disproportionation reaction strongly suggests a six-membered ring. The most common C₆ cycloalkane that is a \"widely used as a solvent\" is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**2. Identification of the Components of Mixture Y**\nNext, we determine the composition of mixture Y:\n\n*   **Properties:** Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   **Known Component:** We are told Z is a constituent of Y, so one component is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n*   **Unknown Component:** The other component must also hydrogenate to form cyclohexane (since Z is the only final product). For this component to not react with bromine water but be hydrogenated, it must be aromatic. The only compound fitting these criteria is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Reaction and Calculation**\nThe final answer can now be found by analyzing the reaction connecting mixture X and mixture Y.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** Mixture X is converted to mixture Y via a **disproportionation** reaction on a platinum catalyst. In this context, this is a hydrogen transfer reaction. Since both mixtures are equimolar, the overall stoichiometry can be written as:\n    `Liquid X₁ + Liquid X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **The Governing Principle:** The **Law of Conservation of Atoms** states that the total number of atoms for each element must be conserved in a chemical reaction.\n*   **The Calculation:** The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\". Based on the conservation principle, this must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n### **Careful Points and Final Verification**\nA thorough analysis includes checking for consistency with all given constraints.\n\n*   **Constraint:** The components of mixture X must decolorize bromine water (be unsaturated) but have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   **Verification:** A plausible composition for mixture X is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**. This pair fits all conditions:\n    1.  Their hydrogen atoms sum to 10 + 8 = 18, matching our calculation.\n    2.  Both are unsaturated C₆ rings.\n    3.  Critically, the double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are isolated, not conjugated, satisfying the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" rule. The existence of this valid pair confirms the answer derived from the conservation law is correct.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating all the careful points required to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\nThe first step is to deduce the identity of the hydrocarbon Z from the given information.\n*   **Mass Fraction of Hydrogen:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is numerically equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (since 1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n*   **General Formula:** For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)` (using integer atomic masses for simplicity). Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, and finally `y = 2x`. Thus, Z has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Saturation:** The problem states that Z is a product of hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ that is saturated must be a **cycloalkane** (as an alkene would be unsaturated).\n*   **Specific Identity:** All the substances in the problem hydrogenate to form *only* Z, implying they all share a common carbon skeleton. Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The chemical reaction context (a disproportionation that involves an aromatic compound, as will be seen) strongly suggests a six-membered ring structure. The most common six-carbon cycloalkane used as a solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This identity fits the CₙH₂ₙ formula, is a known solvent, and is consistent with all other reaction details.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nMixture Y is formed from mixture X and is described as follows:\n*   **Properties:** Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic. We are also told Z (cyclohexane) is one of its constituents.\n*   **Deduction:** Let the components be Y₁ and Y₂. We know Y₁ is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Since the complete hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only cyclohexane, the second component, Y₂, must also have a six-carbon skeleton and must hydrogenate to cyclohexane. Because Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only logical identity for Y₂ is an aromatic compound, specifically **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer\nThe core of the problem can be solved by applying the Law of Conservation of Atoms to the reaction that converts mixture X to mixture Y.\n*   **The Reaction:** An equimolar mixture X is heated with a platinum catalyst to form the equimolar mixture Y. This transformation is described as a **disproportionation**, which in this chemical context is a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n*   **Stoichiometry:** Let the two components of mixture X be X₁ and X₂. The overall reaction is:\n    `X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Conservation of Mass:** The total number of atoms of each element must be conserved. The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\" This sum must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n### Step 4: Final Verification (A Careful Check)\nTo ensure the solution is robust, we check if a plausible Mixture X could exist that fits all the problem's constraints.\n*   The components of X must decolorize bromine water (be unsaturated), have no conjugated multiple bonds, and have C₆ ring skeletons.\n*   A mixture of **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** perfectly fits all conditions:\n    *   **Hydrogen Sum:** 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our calculation.\n    *   **Unsaturation:** Both molecules have double bonds and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   **Non-conjugated:** The problem explicitly rules out conjugated bonds. 1,4-cyclohexadiene's double bonds are isolated, satisfying this constraint (the alternative, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, is conjugated).\nThe existence of this chemically plausible pair validates the result obtained through the conservation of mass.\n\nThe final answer is 18. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 16\nB) 12\nC) 18\nD) 22\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the provided solutions and the problem statement, the following step-by-step reasoning consolidates the correct logical path to the final answer.\n\n### **Detailed Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\n**Step 1: Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\n\nThe first and most crucial step is to determine the identity of substance Z. This can be done by carefully analyzing the given clues:\n\n*   **Clue 1: Chemical Formula from Mass Fraction.** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is numerically equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen can be calculated using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1) as `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting the equation: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    *   Solving for the relationship between x and y: `7y = 12x + y` -> `6y = 12x` -> `y = 2x`.\n    *   This shows that the general formula for Z is **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n\n*   **Clue 2: Saturation.** A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be either an alkene (containing a double bond) or a cycloalkane. The problem states that Z is a product of hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This indicates that Z is a saturated compound, which rules out the possibility of it being an alkene. Therefore, Z must be a **cycloalkane**.\n\n*   **Clue 3: Specific Identity.** The problem states that all the compounds in the reaction scheme hydrogenate to form *only* Z, which implies they all share the same carbon skeleton. Furthermore, Z is a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The chemical reaction described—a disproportionation involving unsaturated compounds that produces a highly stable product—strongly suggests a six-membered ring system. The most common six-carbon cycloalkane used as a solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This identity fits the CₙH₂ₙ formula and all other conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Identification of the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Clue 1: Properties of Mixture Y.** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. We know Z (**cyclohexane**) is one of the components. The mixture \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components must be either saturated (like an alkane/cycloalkane) or aromatic.\n\n*   **Clue 2: Hydrogenation of Mixture Y.** The complete hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). Since one component is already cyclohexane, the other component must also hydrogenate to produce cyclohexane. This means the second component must also have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n\n*   **Deduction:** We are looking for a compound with a C₆ ring that can be hydrogenated but does not react with bromine water. An alkene is ruled out. The only remaining possibility is an aromatic compound, specifically **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the Reaction and Calculation of the Final Answer**\n\nThis step uses the identities of the products to find the composition of the reactants.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** An equimolar mixture X is heated with a platinum catalyst to form the equimolar mixture Y. This transformation is described as a **disproportionation**, which in this context means a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X is reduced (gains H atoms), and the other is oxidized (loses H atoms).\n*   **Applying the Law of Conservation of Mass:** The most direct way to solve the problem is to recognize that the total number of atoms of each element must be conserved in a chemical reaction.\n    *   Let the two liquids in mixture X be X₁ and X₂.\n    *   The reaction is: `X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n    *   The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\". This sum must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n\n### **Careful Points & Final Verification**\n\nTo ensure the entire scenario is chemically plausible, a final check is warranted.\n*   **Existence of a Valid Mixture X:** The problem specifies that the liquids in X decolorize bromine water (are unsaturated) and have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   A valid composition for Mixture X is a combination of **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   **Hydrogen Sum:** 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our calculation perfectly.\n    *   **Unsaturation:** Both molecules have double bonds and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   **Non-Conjugated Bonds:** 1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated double bonds, satisfying the condition. Its isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, is conjugated and thus excluded.\n*   The existence of this plausible pair confirms that the answer obtained via the law of conservation of mass is correct and the problem is well-posed.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, with careful attention to all the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of Hydrocarbon Z\n\nThe first step is to deduce the identity of substance Z, which is the cornerstone of the solution.\n\n1.  **Analyze Mass Fraction of Hydrogen**: We are given that Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This value is the decimal equivalent of the fraction 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). For a hydrocarbon with the general formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)` (using integer atomic masses C=12, H=1).\n    *   Setting up the equation: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    *   Solving for the relationship between x and y: `7y = 12x + y` → `6y = 12x` → `y = 2x`.\n    *   This reveals that Z has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n\n2.  **Determine Compound Type**: A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be either an alkene (containing a double bond) or a cycloalkane. The problem states that Z is a final hydrogenation product and \"does not react further with hydrogen\". This indicates Z is a saturated compound, which rules out it being an alkene. Therefore, **Z must be a cycloalkane**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Specific Compound**: The problem states that hydrogenation of all other mixtures yields *only* Z. This is a critical clue that all precursor molecules share the same carbon skeleton. Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent\". Given the reaction involves a disproportionation likely forming an aromatic compound, a six-membered ring is the most logical skeleton. The six-carbon cycloalkane that is a common solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This identity fits the CₙH₂ₙ formula (where n=6) and all other conditions perfectly.\n\n### Step 2: Identification of Mixture Y\n\n1.  **Analyze Properties of Y**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. A key property is that it \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are either saturated (like Z) or aromatic.\n2.  **Identify Components**: We know one component of Y is Z (cyclohexane). Let the other component be Y₂. Since the hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y gives only cyclohexane, the hydrogenation of Y₂ must also produce cyclohexane. This means Y₂ has a C₆ ring skeleton. For Y₂ to be hydrogenated to cyclohexane but not react with bromine water, it cannot be a cyclohexene. The only logical choice is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n3.  **Conclusion**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation of Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X\n\nThis is the final step, and it can be solved most elegantly by applying a fundamental chemical law.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction**: The problem describes the conversion of an equimolar mixture X into the equimolar mixture Y upon heating with a platinum catalyst. This reaction is a **disproportionation**, which in this context means a hydrogen transfer. The overall reaction stoichiometry can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `Liquid X₁ + Liquid X₂ → Liquid Y₁ + Liquid Y₂`\n\n2.  **Apply the Law of Conservation of Mass**: This law dictates that the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on the reactant and product sides of the equation. We can substitute the known identities of the products:\n    `Liquid X₁ + Liquid X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Hydrogen Atoms**: The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. According to the law of conservation of atoms, this total must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n### Careful Points and Verification\n\n*   The most direct way to solve the problem is through the conservation of mass, which bypasses the need to identify the exact chemical structures of the two liquids in mixture X.\n*   To ensure the entire scenario is chemically plausible, we can verify that a suitable mixture X exists. Its two components must be C₆ cyclic compounds that are unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water) but have no conjugated double bonds. Their total hydrogen atom count must be 18. A perfect match for these criteria is a mixture of **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   Their total hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   The double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are isolated, not conjugated.\n    *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a chemically valid hydrogen transfer. This confirms our reasoning is sound.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nBased on the analysis of the problem and the provided candidate answers, here is a consolidated, step-by-step reasoning to determine the final answer. The logic is universally consistent across all candidate solutions.\n\n### **Detailed Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\nThis is the cornerstone of the solution, and all candidate answers correctly identify it first.\n*   **Information:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. It is fully saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and is a common solvent.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  The mass percentage of hydrogen, 14.28%, is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n    2.  For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 and solving yields `y = 2x`.\n    3.  The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n    4.  A saturated hydrocarbon with this formula must be a **cycloalkane**.\n    5.  Given that all compounds in the problem share a common carbon skeleton and Z is a common solvent, the most logical identity is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\nThis step logically follows the identification of Z.\n*   **Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, does not decolorize bromine water, and one of its components is Z (cyclohexane). Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  Since one component is cyclohexane, the other component must also have a C₆ skeleton to produce only cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n    2.  This second component does not decolorize bromine water, which rules out cycloalkenes. For it to be hydrogenated to cyclohexane, it must be **benzene (C₆H₆)**, an aromatic compound that is unreactive with bromine water but can be hydrogenated under severe conditions.\n    3.  Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Total Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\nThis is the final step that directly answers the question.\n*   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y through a disproportionation reaction on a heated platinum catalyst.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  A disproportionation reaction, in this context, is a hydrogen transfer reaction. The overall stoichiometry can be written as:\n        `(Liquid 1 from X) + (Liquid 2 from X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n    2.  The **Law of Conservation of Atoms** is the key principle here. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on the reactant and product sides.\n    3.  The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n### **Careful Points and Verification**\n\n*   **Conservation of Mass:** The most critical point is recognizing that the problem can be solved directly by applying the law of conservation of mass, without needing to identify the exact structures of the components of mixture X.\n*   **Chemical Plausibility:** A thorough analysis includes verifying that a mixture X with the described properties can exist. The constraints are that its components decolorize bromine water (are unsaturated) and have no conjugated multiple bonds. A mixture of **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** perfectly fits all conditions:\n    *   The total hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated C₆-ring compounds.\n    *   The double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are isolated, not conjugated.\n    *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a valid disproportionation (hydrogen transfer), confirming the chemical scenario is sound.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a detailed, step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the logic from the candidate answers to arrive at the correct solution. All candidate answers follow a similar logical path, demonstrating its robustness.\n\n### **Detailed Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Hydrocarbon Z**\n\nThis is the foundational step upon which the entire solution is built.\n\n*   **Analyze the Mass Percentage:** The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This value is numerically equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n*   **Determine the General Formula:** For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)` (using integer atomic masses C=12, H=1 for simplicity). Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. Therefore, Z has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Determine the Compound Type:** A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be either an alkene or a cycloalkane. The problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which indicates it is a fully saturated compound. This rules out the possibility of it being an alkene, so **Z must be a cycloalkane**.\n*   **Identify the Specific Compound:** The problem notes that hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives *only* substance Z. This implies that all key compounds in the problem share the same carbon skeleton. Furthermore, Z is described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The chemical reaction involved is a disproportionation that produces an aromatic compound (as determined in the next step), which strongly points to a six-membered carbon ring as the common skeleton. The six-carbon cycloalkane is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**, which is a common solvent and perfectly fits the formula CₙH₂ₙ (with n=6) and all other conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Analyze the Properties:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. It \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components must be either saturated (like Z) or aromatic. We are also told that Z (cyclohexane) is one of the components.\n*   **Identify the Second Component:** Let the other component of Y be Y₂. Since hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y yields only cyclohexane, the hydrogenation of Y₂ must also produce cyclohexane. Therefore, Y₂ must also have a six-carbon ring skeleton. Because Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only remaining possibility is an aromatic compound, specifically **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe crucial insight here is to apply the law of conservation of mass.\n\n*   **Analyze the Reaction:** An equimolar mixture X (of liquids X₁ and X₂) is converted into the equimolar mixture Y through a **disproportionation** reaction on a heated platinum catalyst. In this organic chemistry context, this is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one molecule is reduced (gains hydrogen) and another is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n*   **Apply the Law of Conservation of Mass:** The overall reaction can be written as:\n    `Liquid X₁ + Liquid X₂ → Liquid Y₁ + Liquid Y₂`\n    Substituting the known components of Y:\n    `Liquid X₁ + Liquid X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n    The total number of atoms of each element must be conserved. The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\" This sum must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n\n### **Careful Points & Final Verification**\n\n1.  **Direct Calculation:** The most elegant and robust solution path relies on the conservation of mass. It allows for the calculation of the total hydrogen atoms in mixture X without needing to definitively identify its components, X₁ and X₂.\n2.  **Plausibility Check:** We can verify the entire scheme by checking if a plausible mixture X exists that fits all the remaining conditions:\n    *   Components must decolorize bromine water (be unsaturated).\n    *   They must *not* have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   The total hydrogen count in one molecule of each must be 18.\n    *   The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** perfectly fits all criteria. Their hydrogens sum to 10 + 8 = 18. Both are unsaturated C₆-ring compounds. Crucially, 1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds, satisfying the specific constraint. This confirms that the scenario described in the problem is chemically sound and our answer is consistent.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) 22\nB) 18\nC) 12\nD) 16\n\nThe correct answer is 18, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating all the careful points necessary to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### **Detailed Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\n**Step 1: Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\nThe first crucial task is to determine the identity of substance Z.\n\n*   **Analyze the Mass Percentage:** We are given that Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (since 1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n*   **Determine the General Formula:** For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as `y / (12x + y)` (using integer atomic masses C=12, H=1 for simplicity). Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, and finally to `y = 2x`. Thus, Z has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **A Careful Point on Saturation:** A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be either an alkene (containing a double bond) or a cycloalkane. The problem states that Z is a product of hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This is a key piece of information that indicates Z is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a **cycloalkane**, not an alkene.\n*   **Identify the Specific Compound:** All compounds in the problem hydrogenate to form *only* Z, implying they all share the same carbon skeleton. Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The reaction type (disproportionation) strongly suggests a six-membered ring is the common skeleton, as this allows for the formation of a stable aromatic ring in a later step. The six-carbon cycloalkane that fits all these descriptions is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identification of the Components of Mixture Y**\nNext, we determine the composition of mixture Y.\n\n*   **Analyze the Properties:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. It \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components must be either saturated (like alkanes/cycloalkanes) or aromatic. We are also told Z (cyclohexane) is one of the components.\n*   **Identify the Second Component:** The other liquid in Y must also hydrogenate to produce only cyclohexane (as per the common skeleton rule). For this compound to have a C₆ skeleton, be hydrogenated to cyclohexane, and *not* react with bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only remaining possibility is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   **Conclusion for Mixture Y:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer**\nThis step uses the principle of conservation to directly answer the question.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The problem states that an equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via **disproportionation** when heated with platinum. In this context, this means a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X is reduced (gains hydrogen) to form cyclohexane, while the other is oxidized (loses hydrogen) to form benzene.\n*   **A Careful Point on the Law of Conservation:** The most direct way to solve this problem is by applying the Law of Conservation of Atoms. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same in the reactants and the products. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n*   **Calculation:** The reaction can be written as:\n    `Liquid X₁ + Liquid X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in Cyclohexane) + (H atoms in Benzene)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n**Step 4: Final Verification (A Crucial Careful Point)**\nTo ensure the solution is robust and the problem is chemically consistent, we can verify that a plausible Mixture X exists.\n\n*   **Conditions for Mixture X:** Its components must be two different liquids with C₆ ring skeletons that decolorize bromine water (are unsaturated), and they must *not* have conjugated multiple bonds. Their combined hydrogen atoms must sum to 18.\n*   **Plausible Components:** A perfect candidate pair is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   **Hydrogen sum:** 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our calculation.\n    *   **Unsaturation:** Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   **No Conjugation:** The problem specifically rules out conjugated systems. The double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are isolated (non-conjugated). The conjugated isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, is excluded by this rule.\n*   The existence of this chemically plausible mixture confirms that the answer derived from the law of conservation is correct.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, with careful attention paid to each constraint and logical deduction.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\nThe first and most critical step is to determine the identity of hydrocarbon Z.\n*   **Mass Fraction Analysis:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula `y / (12x + y)` using simplified integer atomic masses.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    *   `7y = 12x + y`\n    *   `6y = 12x`\n    *   `y = 2x`\n    This establishes the general formula for Z as **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Saturation Analysis:** A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be either an alkene (unsaturated) or a cycloalkane (saturated ring). The problem explicitly states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" meaning it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   **Structural Clues:** The fact that all precursors hydrogenate to *only* Z implies they all share a common carbon skeleton. The reaction context (disproportionation involving an aromatic product, as will be seen) strongly points to a six-membered ring. The most common C₆ cycloalkane that is a \"widely used as a solvent\" is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** Correctly identifying Z as cyclohexane is the foundation for solving the rest of the problem. All clues point to this specific compound.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   **Properties of Mixture Y:** It is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic. We are also told that Z (cyclohexane) is a component of Y.\n*   **Identifying the Second Component:** Let the components be Y₁ and Y₂. We know Y₁ is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The second component, Y₂, must also hydrogenate to produce cyclohexane (to satisfy the \"gives only one substance, Z\" condition). Since Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be an alkene like cyclohexene. The only C₆ compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane but is unreactive toward bromine water is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Answer**\nThe most direct path to the solution is by applying the law of conservation of mass.\n*   **The Reaction:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via disproportionation. This means that for every one molecule of the first component of X (X₁), one molecule of the second component (X₂) reacts. The reaction can be written as:\n    `X₁ + X₂ → Y₁ + Y₂`\n*   **Conservation of Atoms:** Substituting the known components of Y:\n    `X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n    According to the Law of Conservation of Atoms, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the equation. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Applying the conservation of atoms is the most efficient and robust method. It allows you to find the total hydrogen count without needing to know the exact structures of the liquids in mixture X.\n\n**Step 4: Verification of Consistency**\nTo ensure the entire scenario is chemically plausible, we must verify that a mixture X fitting the description can exist.\n*   **Mixture X must:** be a mix of two C₆ ring liquids, decolorize bromine water (be unsaturated), and have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   **A plausible mixture X:** Let's consider **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   **Hydrogen Count:** 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our calculation.\n    *   **Unsaturation:** Both have double bonds and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   **Non-conjugated:** The double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are isolated, satisfying the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" constraint (which explicitly rules out the isomer 1,3-cyclohexadiene).\n    *   **Reaction:** The disproportionation `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a classic hydrogen transfer reaction.\n\nThe existence of this valid pair confirms that the reasoning and the calculated answer of 18 are correct.\n\nBased on the provided options:\nA) 18\nB) 22\nC) 16\nD) 12\n\nThe correct answer is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating all the careful points required for a complete and accurate solution.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\n\nThe first and most crucial step is to determine the identity of substance Z.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Analyzing the Mass Percentage.**\n    Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is numerically equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (as 1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). For a hydrocarbon with the general formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen (using integer atomic masses C=12, H=1) is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n    *   Solving this algebraic equation leads to `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, and finally to `y = 2x`.\n    *   Therefore, the general formula for substance Z is **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Interpreting Saturation.**\n    The problem states that Z is a product of hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This indicates that Z is a saturated compound. A hydrocarbon with the formula Cn H₂n that is saturated cannot be an alkene (which is unsaturated); it must be a **cycloalkane**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Common Carbon Skeleton.**\n    Hydrogenation of *both* mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* substance Z. This is a critical piece of information, as it implies that all key compounds in the problem (the two in X and the two in Y) share the same carbon skeleton as Z. The nature of the disproportionation reaction (see later steps) strongly suggests this is a six-membered ring skeleton.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Z:** Based on the above points, Z is a C₆ cycloalkane. Combined with the clue that it's a \"widely used as a solvent,\" the identity is confirmed as **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**2. Identification of the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. It \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z, which we have identified as **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n*   Hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means the other component must also have a C₆ ring skeleton and must hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n*   Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only remaining possibility that fits all criteria is an aromatic compound, specifically **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water but is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under the described severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion for Y:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. The Final Calculation using Conservation of Mass**\n\n*   The problem states that an equimolar mixture X is converted into an equimolar mixture Y via disproportionation on a heated platinum catalyst. In organic chemistry, this means a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n*   The overall reaction, based on our identification of Y, is:\n    `(Liquid 1 of X) + (Liquid 2 of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point 4: The Law of Conservation of Atoms.**\n    The most direct path to the solution is applying this fundamental law. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of a chemical reaction. The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\" This sum must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n**4. Final Verification (A Crucial Step)**\n\nTo ensure the entire scenario is chemically sound, we must check if a plausible Mixture X exists that satisfies all conditions.\n*   The components of X must:\n    1.  Decolorize bromine water (i.e., be unsaturated).\n    2.  Have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    3.  Both have a C₆ ring skeleton.\n    4.  Have a total of 18 hydrogen atoms between them.\n*   Consider the pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   **Hydrogen sum:** 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our calculation.\n    *   **Unsaturation:** Both are unsaturated.\n    *   **No Conjugation:** Cyclohexene's one double bond is not conjugated. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated double bonds, satisfying the condition that it is not a conjugated system (like 1,3-cyclohexadiene).\n    *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a classic example of catalytic hydrogen transfer. This verification confirms that the scenario is plausible and our answer is correct.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, with careful attention paid to each condition provided in the question.\n\n### **Reasoning and Analysis**\n\n**1. Identification of Substance Z**\n\nThe first and most critical step is to identify the hydrocarbon Z, which serves as the anchor for the entire problem.\n\n*   **Analyze the Chemical Formula from Mass Fraction:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This value is the decimal equivalent of the fraction 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n    *   For a hydrocarbon with the general formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen can be expressed as `y / (12x + y)`, using simplified integer atomic masses.\n    *   Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n    *   Solving for the relationship between x and y: `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   This establishes the general formula of Z as **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Analyze the Chemical Properties:**\n    *   A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which means it is a **saturated** compound. This rules out the possibility of it being an alkene. Therefore, Z must be a **cycloalkane**.\n    *   The fact that hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives *only* Z implies that all precursor compounds share the same carbon skeleton.\n*   **Identify the Specific Compound:** Given the reaction involves disproportionation (often involving the formation of a stable aromatic ring) and Z is a \"widely used as a solvent\", the most logical carbon skeleton is a six-membered ring. The C₆ cycloalkane is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**, a very common solvent, which perfectly fits the CₙH₂ₙ formula and all other conditions.\n\n**2. Identification of the Components of Mixture Y**\n\nWith Z identified as cyclohexane, we can determine the composition of mixture Y.\n\n*   **Analyze the Properties of Mixture Y:** It is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic. We know one component is Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂).\n*   **Identify the Second Component:** Let the other component be Y₂.\n    *   Hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y yields only cyclohexane. Therefore, the hydrogenation of Y₂ must also produce cyclohexane, meaning Y₂ has a C₆ ring skeleton.\n    *   Since Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a cyclohexene. The only C₆ ring compound that can be hydrogenated but is unreactive towards bromine water is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Answer**\n\nThe final step connects mixture X to mixture Y.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** An equimolar mixture X is converted into an equimolar mixture Y via **disproportionation** when heated with platinum. In this context, this is a hydrogen transfer reaction. The stoichiometry is 1:1.\n    *   Let the two liquids in mixture X be X₁ and X₂.\n    *   The reaction is: `X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Apply the Law of Conservation of Atoms:** The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the chemical equation. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This sum must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n### **Careful Points & Final Verification**\n\n*   **The Power of Conservation Laws:** The solution relies fundamentally on the law of conservation of atoms. This is a very robust method that allows us to determine the total hydrogen content of the reactants (mixture X) without needing to know their exact identities first.\n*   **Plausibility Check:** We can verify that a chemically plausible mixture X exists. Its components must be C₆ unsaturated ring compounds, must have no conjugated double bonds, and their combined hydrogen atoms must sum to 18. The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** perfectly fits all criteria.\n    *   Total H atoms: 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds, satisfying the constraint.\n    *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` represents a valid hydrogen transfer (disproportionation). This confirms our result is chemically sound.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem and a review of the candidate answers, here is a consolidated reasoning process.\n\n### **Detailed Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe most effective way to solve this problem is to work backward from the most well-defined substance, which is hydrocarbon Z.\n\n**1. Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   **Analyze the Mass Percentage:** The first clue is that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n*   **Determine the General Formula:** For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen (using integer atomic masses C=12, H=1 for simplicity) is given by the equation: `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 gives `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`, which can be solved as follows:\n    `7y = 12x + y`\n    `6y = 12x`\n    `y = 2x`\n    This shows that Z has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Determine the Compound Type:** A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be either an alkene or a cycloalkane. The problem states that Z is a product of hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This indicates Z is a saturated compound, which means it must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   **Identify the Specific Compound:** We are told that hydrogenation of *all* other substances in the problem yields *only* Z. This is a crucial point, as it implies all key compounds share the same carbon skeleton. Furthermore, the reaction involves disproportionation, which in this context strongly suggests a six-membered ring system to allow for the formation of a stable aromatic ring. Combined with the clue that Z is a \"widely used as a solvent,\" the most logical conclusion is that Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits the formula, properties, and reaction context perfectly.\n\n**2. Identification of the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Analyze the Properties:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" and Z (cyclohexane) is one of its constituents. Not decolorizing bromine water means the components must be either saturated or aromatic.\n*   **Identify the Second Component:** Since hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane), the other component of Y must also have a C₆ skeleton and must be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. For this second component to *not* decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a simple cycloalkene. The only remaining possibility is an aromatic compound: **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water under these conditions but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reaction from X to Y and Find the Answer**\n\nThis is the most direct step to the solution, and a key careful point is the application of conservation of mass.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The problem states that an equimolar mixture X is converted into the equimolar mixture Y via a **disproportionation** reaction on a platinum catalyst. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. The overall transformation is:\n    `(Liquid 1 from X) + (Liquid 2 from X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Law of Conservation of Atoms:** The total number of atoms of each element must be conserved in a chemical reaction. The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\" This sum must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n**4. Final Verification (Consistency Check)**\n\nAs a final careful check, we can ensure that a mixture X with these properties could plausibly exist.\n*   **Required properties of X's components:** C₆ ring skeleton, unsaturated (decolorize Br₂ water), non-conjugated bonds, total H atoms = 18.\n*   A plausible composition for Mixture X is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   The hydrogen sum is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated C₆-ring compounds.\n    *   The double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are isolated (non-conjugated), fitting the constraint.\n    *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a valid disproportionation (hydrogen transfer).\n\nThis verification confirms our result of 18 is consistent with all stated conditions. The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the problem and the reasoning provided in the candidate answers, here is a consolidated step-by-step solution.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Identification of Substance Z**\n\n*   **Analyze Chemical Formula from Mass Fraction:** The problem states that substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This value is the decimal equivalent of the fraction 1/7 (since 1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). For a hydrocarbon with the general formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen can be expressed as `y / (12x + y)`, using simplified integer atomic masses.\n    *   Setting up the equation: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    *   Solving for the relationship between `x` and `y`:\n        `7y = 12x + y`\n        `6y = 12x`\n        `y = 2x`\n    *   This establishes the general formula for Z as **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n\n*   **Analyze Chemical Properties:** The problem specifies that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ that is fully saturated (cannot be further hydrogenated) must be a **cycloalkane**. An alkene with the same formula would be unsaturated and would react with hydrogen.\n\n*   **Identify the Specific Compound:** All compounds in the problem (in mixtures X and Y) hydrogenate to form *only* Z, which implies they all share the same carbon skeleton. Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The reaction context, which involves disproportionation and the formation of a very stable dehydrogenated product, strongly suggests a six-membered ring system. The most common six-carbon cycloalkane that is widely used as a solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **. This identification is consistent with the formula CₙH₂ₙ (for n=6) and all other conditions.\n\n**2. Identification of the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. We are told one of these liquids is substance Z, which we have identified as **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **.\n*   Mixture Y \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are either saturated (like alkanes/cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n*   Hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y yields only cyclohexane. This means the second component of Y must also have a C₆ ring skeleton and be capable of being hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   Given that this second component does not react with bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only remaining possibility for a C₆-ring compound that can be hydrogenated but is unreactive with bromine water is an aromatic compound, specifically **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Reaction and Calculation of the Final Answer**\n\n*   The problem states that equimolar mixture X is converted to equimolar mixture Y upon heating with a platinum catalyst. The reaction is a \"disproportionation.\" In this organic chemistry context, this refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component is reduced (gains hydrogen) and another is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n*   The overall chemical transformation, based on 1:1 equimolar stoichiometry, can be written as:\n    `Liquid from X₁ + Liquid from X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   The most direct way to solve the problem is by applying the **Law of Conservation of Atoms**. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both the reactant and product sides of the equation. The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\" This sum must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n\n### **Careful Points and Verification**\n\n*   **Conservation of Mass:** The key to solving this problem efficiently is realizing that the total number of atoms is conserved. This allows for a direct calculation of the hydrogen atoms in the starting materials (Mixture X) by simply summing the hydrogens in the known products (Mixture Y), without needing to identify the exact components of X.\n*   **Plausibility Check:** We can verify that our solution is consistent with all the problem's constraints. Mixture X must be composed of two C₆-ring compounds that are unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water) but do not have conjugated double bonds, and their total hydrogen count must be 18.\n    *   A plausible composition for Mixture X is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   **Check:** Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18. Both are unsaturated. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds. The reaction C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆ is a perfect example of disproportionation. This confirms that a chemically valid scenario exists, and our answer of 18 is correct.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, with careful attention to each piece of information.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\n**1. Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\n\nThe first and most crucial step is to identify substance Z. We are given several clues:\n*   It is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   It is a saturated compound (\"does not react further with hydrogen\").\n*   It is a \"widely used as a solvent\".\n*   All precursor compounds in the problem share its carbon skeleton.\n\n**Analysis of Clues:**\n*   The mass percentage of hydrogen, 14.28%, is the decimal equivalent of the fraction 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n*   For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)` (using approximate atomic masses C=12, H=1).\n*   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   Therefore, Z has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   A hydrocarbon with this formula that is also saturated must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   Given the reaction context (disproportionation involving ring systems) and its use as a common solvent, the most logical identity for Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **. This perfectly fits all given conditions.\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y**\n\nNext, we identify the components of mixture Y:\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n*   One component is Z, which we have identified as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   It \"does not decolorize bromine water\", meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y yields only cyclohexane.\n\n**Analysis of Clues:**\n*   Let the two components be Y₁ and Y₂. We know Y₁ is cyclohexane.\n*   Since Y₁ is already the final hydrogenation product, the other component, Y₂, must also hydrogenate to produce cyclohexane. This implies Y₂ has a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n*   For Y₂ to be hydrogenated but not react with bromine water, it cannot be a simple alkene. The only remaining possibility is an aromatic compound, specifically **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Reaction from X to Y and Final Calculation**\n\nThis step uses the information from the previous steps to solve the core problem.\n*   An equimolar mixture X is heated with platinum, undergoing **disproportionation** to form the equimolar mixture Y.\n*   In this context, disproportionation is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X is reduced (gains hydrogen) to form cyclohexane, while the other component is oxidized (loses hydrogen) to form benzene.\n*   The overall reaction is:\n    `(Liquid 1 from X) + (Liquid 2 from X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n\n**The most careful and crucial point** is to apply the **Law of Conservation of Mass**. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on the reactant and product sides. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This sum must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n\n**Calculation:**\nTotal H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\nTotal H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n**4. Verification (Plausibility Check)**\n\nA good analysis includes verifying that the scenario is chemically possible. Can a mixture X exist that fits the criteria?\n*   **Criteria for X**: Two C₆-ring liquids that decolorize bromine water (are unsaturated), have no conjugated bonds, and their total H atoms sum to 18.\n*   **Plausible Candidates**: Consider **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   **Total H atoms:** 10 + 8 = 18. (Correct)\n    *   **Unsaturation:** Both have double bonds and will decolorize bromine water. (Correct)\n    *   **No Conjugation:** 1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated double bonds, satisfying the condition that there are no *conjugated* multiple bonds. (Correct)\n    *   **Reaction**: `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a valid disproportionation (hydrogen transfer) reaction.\nThis verification confirms our result of 18 is correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) 16\nB) 12\nC) 18\nD) 22\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the careful points required to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of Hydrocarbon Z\n\nThe first step is to deduce the identity of the final product, Z.\n\n*   **Analyze the Mass Percentage:** We are told Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (as 1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen (using integer atomic masses C=12, H=1 for simplicity) is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` and solving gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   Therefore, the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Saturation.** The problem states Z \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ that is fully saturated (cannot add more hydrogen) must be a **cycloalkane**. It cannot be an alkene, which is unsaturated.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Common Carbon Skeleton.** The fact that hydrogenation of *both* mixtures X and Y gives *only* Z as a product implies that all precursor compounds in the reaction scheme share the same carbon skeleton. Given the reaction type (disproportionation involving unsaturated rings), a six-membered ring is the most logical skeleton.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** A six-carbon cycloalkane (n=6) is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **. This is a common solvent and fits all the given conditions perfectly.\n\n### Step 2: Identification of the Components of Mixture Y\n\nNext, we determine the composition of the product mixture Y.\n\n*   **Analyze Mixture Y's Properties:** Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One component is Z (cyclohexane). The mixture \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components must be either saturated (like alkanes/cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n*   **Identify the Second Component:** Let the second liquid be Y₂. Since hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y gives only cyclohexane, the hydrogenation of Y₂ must also produce cyclohexane. Therefore, Y₂ must have a C₆ ring skeleton. For Y₂ to have a C₆ skeleton, be hydrogenated to cyclohexane, and *not* react with bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only compound that fits all these criteria is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic and does not decolorize bromine water under these conditions, but it can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the Reaction and Final Calculation\n\nThe answer can now be found by analyzing the reaction connecting mixture X and mixture Y.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** An equimolar mixture X (of liquids X₁ and X₂) is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via disproportionation. The overall stoichiometry is:\n    `X₁ + X₂ → Y₁ + Y₂`\n    Substituting the identities of the products:\n    `X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Law of Conservation of Mass.** This is the crucial principle for solving the problem. The total number of atoms of each element must be conserved in a chemical reaction. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This sum must be identical to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Total H atoms in mixture X = Total H atoms in mixture Y\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n\n### Step 4: Final Verification\n\nTo ensure the solution is robust, we check that a plausible Mixture X exists.\n*   The components must be C₆ cyclic compounds.\n*   They must decolorize bromine water (i.e., be unsaturated).\n*   They must have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   The total H atoms for two molecules must be 18.\nA valid mixture would be **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n*   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18. (Correct)\n*   Both are unsaturated C₆ rings. (Correct)\n*   The double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are isolated (non-conjugated), unlike in its isomer 1,3-cyclohexadiene. This fulfills the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" condition. (Correct)\nThe existence of this valid pair confirms that the reasoning based on conservation of mass is sound.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the key logical points and careful considerations identified from the candidate answers.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe problem can be solved by systematically identifying the unknown substances based on the chemical properties and reactions described. The most logical path is to identify substance Z first, then mixture Y, and finally use the law of conservation of mass to determine the properties of mixture X.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance Z**\n\n*   **Chemical Formula:** The first clue is that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (since 1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `y / (12x + y)`, using simplified atomic masses. Setting this equal to 1/7 yields the relationship `y = 2x`. Thus, Z has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Saturation:** The problem states Z \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This indicates that Z is a fully saturated compound. A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ that is saturated must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   **Identity:** A critical piece of information is that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* substance Z. This implies that all key components in the reactions share the same carbon skeleton. The reaction type, disproportionation, often involves six-membered rings to form stable aromatic products. The most common six-carbon cycloalkane that is \"widely used as a solvent\" is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This identity fits all the given facts.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Properties:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water.\" This means its components must be either saturated (like Z) or aromatic.\n*   **Known Component:** We are told Z is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one liquid is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n*   **Identifying the Second Component:** The other liquid in mixture Y must also hydrogenate to give only cyclohexane (due to the common carbon skeleton rule). Since it does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only remaining possibility for a C₆ compound that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane but is unreactive with bromine water is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Total Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The core of the problem lies in the reaction where mixture X is converted to mixture Y. This is described as a **disproportionation** reaction on a platinum catalyst. In this chemical context, it is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component is reduced (gains hydrogen atoms) and another is oxidized (loses hydrogen atoms).\n*   **Stoichiometry and Conservation of Mass:** Both X and Y are equimolar mixtures, so the reaction stoichiometry is 1:1 between the reacting components.\n    `Liquid X₁ + Liquid X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   The most direct way to answer the question is by applying the **Law of Conservation of Atoms**. The total number of atoms of each element on the reactant side must equal the total on the product side.\n*   **Calculation:** The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\". This sum must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n\n### **Careful Points & Final Verification**\n\n1.  **Direct Calculation:** The most reliable path to the answer does not require identifying the specific components of Mixture X. It relies only on identifying the products (Mixture Y) and applying the Law of Conservation of Mass.\n2.  **Constraint Checklist:** To ensure the scenario is chemically sound, we can verify that a plausible Mixture X exists. The components of X must be unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water), have non-conjugated multiple bonds, share a C₆ skeleton, and their total hydrogen count must be 18.\n3.  **Plausible Components for X:** A mixture of **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** perfectly fits all conditions:\n    *   Their hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated C₆-ring liquids.\n    *   The problem explicitly states \"no conjugated multiple bonds,\" which rules out 1,3-cyclohexadiene and points specifically to 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n    *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a valid disproportionation.\n\nThe existence of this plausible pair validates the entire logical chain. The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

The identity of Z is derived from three key pieces of information:\n\n*   **Chemical Formula:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 and solving gives the relationship `y = 2x`. Therefore, Z has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Saturation:** The problem states Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which means it is a fully saturated compound. A saturated hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   **Identity:** Z is the sole product of hydrogenating all other compounds, implying they all share its carbon skeleton.

Identification of the Components of Mixture Y**\nNext, we determine the composition of mixture Y:\n\n*   **Properties:** Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   **Known Component:** We are told Z is a constituent of Y, so one component is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n*   **Unknown Component:** The other component must also hydrogenate to form cyclohexane (since Z is the only final product). For this component to not react with bromine water but be hydrogenated, it must be aromatic. The only compound fitting these criteria is **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Reaction and Calculation**\nThe final answer can now be found by analyzing the reaction connecting mixture X and mixture Y.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** Mixture X is converted to mixture Y via a **disproportionation** reaction on a platinum catalyst. In this context, this is a hydrogen transfer reaction. Since both mixtures are equimolar, the overall stoichiometry can be written as:\n    `Liquid X₁ + Liquid X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **The Governing Principle:** The **Law of Conservation of Atoms** states that the total number of atoms for each element must be conserved in a chemical reaction.\n*   **The Calculation:** The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\".

This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating all the careful points required to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\nThe first step is to deduce the identity of the hydrocarbon Z from the given information.\n*   **Mass Fraction of Hydrogen:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is numerically equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (since 1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n*   **General Formula:** For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)` (using integer atomic masses for simplicity). Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, and finally `y = 2x`. Thus, Z has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Saturation:** The problem states that Z is a product of hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ that is saturated must be a **cycloalkane** (as an alkene would be unsaturated).\n*   **Specific Identity:** All the substances in the problem hydrogenate to form *only* Z, implying they all share a common carbon skeleton. Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The chemical reaction context (a disproportionation that involves an aromatic compound, as will be seen) strongly suggests a six-membered ring structure. The most common six-carbon cycloalkane used as a solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This identity fits the CₙH₂ₙ formula, is a known solvent, and is consistent with all other reaction details.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\nMixture Y is formed from mixture X and is described as follows:\n*   **Properties:** Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic. We are also told Z (cyclohexane) is one of its constituents.\n*   **Deduction:** Let the components be Y₁ and Y₂. We know Y₁ is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Since the complete hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only cyclohexane, the second component, Y₂, must also have a six-carbon skeleton and must hydrogenate to cyclohexane. Because Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only logical identity for Y₂ is an aromatic compound, specifically **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer\nThe core of the problem can be solved by applying the Law of Conservation of Atoms to the reaction that converts mixture X to mixture Y.\n*   **The Reaction:** An equimolar mixture X is heated with a platinum catalyst to form the equimolar mixture Y. This transformation is described as a **disproportionation**, which in this chemical context is a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n*   **Stoichiometry:** Let the two components of mixture X be X₁ and X₂. The overall reaction is:\n    `X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Conservation of Mass:** The total number of atoms of each element must be conserved. The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\" This sum must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n### Step 4: Final Verification (A Careful Check)\nTo ensure the solution is robust, we check if a plausible Mixture X could exist that fits all the problem's constraints.\n*   The components of X must decolorize bromine water (be unsaturated), have no conjugated multiple bonds, and have C₆ ring skeletons.\n*   A mixture of **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** perfectly fits all conditions:\n    *   **Hydrogen Sum:** 10 + 8 = 18.

Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 16\nB) 12\nC) 18\nD) 22\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the provided solutions and the problem statement, the following step-by-step reasoning consolidates the correct logical path to the final answer.\n\n### **Detailed Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\n**Step 1: Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\n\nThe first and most crucial step is to determine the identity of substance Z. This can be done by carefully analyzing the given clues:\n\n*   **Clue 1: Chemical Formula from Mass Fraction.** Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is numerically equivalent to the fraction 1/7. For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen can be calculated using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1) as `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting the equation: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    *   Solving for the relationship between x and y: `7y = 12x + y` -> `6y = 12x` -> `y = 2x`.\n    *   This shows that the general formula for Z is **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n\n*   **Clue 2: Saturation.** A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be either an alkene (containing a double bond) or a cycloalkane. The problem states that Z is a product of hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This indicates that Z is a saturated compound, which rules out the possibility of it being an alkene. Therefore, Z must be a **cycloalkane**.\n\n*   **Clue 3: Specific Identity.** The problem states that all the compounds in the reaction scheme hydrogenate to form *only* Z, which implies they all share the same carbon skeleton. Furthermore, Z is a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The chemical reaction described—a disproportionation involving unsaturated compounds that produces a highly stable product—strongly suggests a six-membered ring system. The most common six-carbon cycloalkane used as a solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This identity fits the CₙH₂ₙ formula and all other conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Identification of the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Clue 1: Properties of Mixture Y.** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. We know Z (**cyclohexane**) is one of the components. The mixture \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components must be either saturated (like an alkane/cycloalkane) or aromatic.\n\n*   **Clue 2: Hydrogenation of Mixture Y.** The complete hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). Since one component is already cyclohexane, the other component must also hydrogenate to produce cyclohexane. This means the second component must also have a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n\n*   **Deduction:** We are looking for a compound with a C₆ ring that can be hydrogenated but does not react with bromine water. An alkene is ruled out. The only remaining possibility is an aromatic compound, specifically **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the Reaction and Calculation of the Final Answer**\n\nThis step uses the identities of the products to find the composition of the reactants.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** An equimolar mixture X is heated with a platinum catalyst to form the equimolar mixture Y. This transformation is described as a **disproportionation**, which in this context means a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X is reduced (gains H atoms), and the other is oxidized (loses H atoms).\n*   **Applying the Law of Conservation of Mass:** The most direct way to solve the problem is to recognize that the total number of atoms of each element must be conserved in a chemical reaction.\n    *   Let the two liquids in mixture X be X₁ and X₂.\n    *   The reaction is: `X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n    *   The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\". This sum must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n\n### **Careful Points & Final Verification**\n\nTo ensure the entire scenario is chemically plausible, a final check is warranted.\n*   **Existence of a Valid Mixture X:** The problem specifies that the liquids in X decolorize bromine water (are unsaturated) and have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   A valid composition for Mixture X is a combination of **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   **Hydrogen Sum:** 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our calculation perfectly.\n    *   **Unsaturation:** Both molecules have double bonds and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   **Non-Conjugated Bonds:** 1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated double bonds, satisfying the condition. Its isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, is conjugated and thus excluded.\n*   The existence of this plausible pair confirms that the answer obtained via the law of conservation of mass is correct and the problem is well-posed.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, with careful attention to all the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of Hydrocarbon Z\n\nThe first step is to deduce the identity of substance Z, which is the cornerstone of the solution.\n\n1.  **Analyze Mass Fraction of Hydrogen**: We are given that Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This value is the decimal equivalent of the fraction 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). For a hydrocarbon with the general formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)` (using integer atomic masses C=12, H=1).\n    *   Setting up the equation: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    *   Solving for the relationship between x and y: `7y = 12x + y` → `6y = 12x` → `y = 2x`.\n    *   This reveals that Z has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n\n2.  **Determine Compound Type**: A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be either an alkene (containing a double bond) or a cycloalkane. The problem states that Z is a final hydrogenation product and \"does not react further with hydrogen\". This indicates Z is a saturated compound, which rules out it being an alkene. Therefore, **Z must be a cycloalkane**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Specific Compound**: The problem states that hydrogenation of all other mixtures yields *only* Z. This is a critical clue that all precursor molecules share the same carbon skeleton. Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent\". Given the reaction involves a disproportionation likely forming an aromatic compound, a six-membered ring is the most logical skeleton. The six-carbon cycloalkane that is a common solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This identity fits the CₙH₂ₙ formula (where n=6) and all other conditions perfectly.\n\n### Step 2: Identification of Mixture Y\n\n1.  **Analyze Properties of Y**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. A key property is that it \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are either saturated (like Z) or aromatic.\n2.  **Identify Components**: We know one component of Y is Z (cyclohexane). Let the other component be Y₂. Since the hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y gives only cyclohexane, the hydrogenation of Y₂ must also produce cyclohexane. This means Y₂ has a C₆ ring skeleton. For Y₂ to be hydrogenated to cyclohexane but not react with bromine water, it cannot be a cyclohexene. The only logical choice is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n3.  **Conclusion**: Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation of Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X\n\nThis is the final step, and it can be solved most elegantly by applying a fundamental chemical law.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction**: The problem describes the conversion of an equimolar mixture X into the equimolar mixture Y upon heating with a platinum catalyst. This reaction is a **disproportionation**, which in this context means a hydrogen transfer. The overall reaction stoichiometry can be written for one molecule of each component:\n    `Liquid X₁ + Liquid X₂ → Liquid Y₁ + Liquid Y₂`\n\n2.  **Apply the Law of Conservation of Mass**: This law dictates that the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on the reactant and product sides of the equation. We can substitute the known identities of the products:\n    `Liquid X₁ + Liquid X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Hydrogen Atoms**: The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. According to the law of conservation of atoms, this total must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n### Careful Points and Verification\n\n*   The most direct way to solve the problem is through the conservation of mass, which bypasses the need to identify the exact chemical structures of the two liquids in mixture X.\n*   To ensure the entire scenario is chemically plausible, we can verify that a suitable mixture X exists. Its two components must be C₆ cyclic compounds that are unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water) but have no conjugated double bonds. Their total hydrogen atom count must be 18. A perfect match for these criteria is a mixture of **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   Their total hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   The double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are isolated, not conjugated.\n    *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a chemically valid hydrogen transfer. This confirms our reasoning is sound.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nBased on the analysis of the problem and the provided candidate answers, here is a consolidated, step-by-step reasoning to determine the final answer. The logic is universally consistent across all candidate solutions.\n\n### **Detailed Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\nThis is the cornerstone of the solution, and all candidate answers correctly identify it first.\n*   **Information:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. It is fully saturated (\"does not react further with hydrogen\") and is a common solvent.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  The mass percentage of hydrogen, 14.28%, is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n    2.  For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this to 1/7 and solving yields `y = 2x`.\n    3.  The general formula for Z is therefore CₙH₂ₙ.\n    4.  A saturated hydrocarbon with this formula must be a **cycloalkane**.\n    5.  Given that all compounds in the problem share a common carbon skeleton and Z is a common solvent, the most logical identity is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\nThis step logically follows the identification of Z.\n*   **Information:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, does not decolorize bromine water, and one of its components is Z (cyclohexane). Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  Since one component is cyclohexane, the other component must also have a C₆ skeleton to produce only cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n    2.  This second component does not decolorize bromine water, which rules out cycloalkenes. For it to be hydrogenated to cyclohexane, it must be **benzene (C₆H₆)**, an aromatic compound that is unreactive with bromine water but can be hydrogenated under severe conditions.\n    3.  Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Total Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\nThis is the final step that directly answers the question.\n*   **Information:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y through a disproportionation reaction on a heated platinum catalyst.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  A disproportionation reaction, in this context, is a hydrogen transfer reaction. The overall stoichiometry can be written as:\n        `(Liquid 1 from X) + (Liquid 2 from X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n    2.  The **Law of Conservation of Atoms** is the key principle here. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on the reactant and product sides.\n    3.  The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n### **Careful Points and Verification**\n\n*   **Conservation of Mass:** The most critical point is recognizing that the problem can be solved directly by applying the law of conservation of mass, without needing to identify the exact structures of the components of mixture X.\n*   **Chemical Plausibility:** A thorough analysis includes verifying that a mixture X with the described properties can exist. The constraints are that its components decolorize bromine water (are unsaturated) and have no conjugated multiple bonds. A mixture of **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** perfectly fits all conditions:\n    *   The total hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated C₆-ring compounds.\n    *   The double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are isolated, not conjugated.\n    *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a valid disproportionation (hydrogen transfer), confirming the chemical scenario is sound.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a detailed, step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the logic from the candidate answers to arrive at the correct solution. All candidate answers follow a similar logical path, demonstrating its robustness.\n\n### **Detailed Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Hydrocarbon Z**\n\nThis is the foundational step upon which the entire solution is built.\n\n*   **Analyze the Mass Percentage:** The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This value is numerically equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n*   **Determine the General Formula:** For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)` (using integer atomic masses C=12, H=1 for simplicity). Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`. Therefore, Z has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Determine the Compound Type:** A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be either an alkene or a cycloalkane. The problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which indicates it is a fully saturated compound. This rules out the possibility of it being an alkene, so **Z must be a cycloalkane**.\n*   **Identify the Specific Compound:** The problem notes that hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives *only* substance Z. This implies that all key compounds in the problem share the same carbon skeleton. Furthermore, Z is described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The chemical reaction involved is a disproportionation that produces an aromatic compound (as determined in the next step), which strongly points to a six-membered carbon ring as the common skeleton. The six-carbon cycloalkane is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**, which is a common solvent and perfectly fits the formula CₙH₂ₙ (with n=6) and all other conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Analyze the Properties:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. It \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components must be either saturated (like Z) or aromatic. We are also told that Z (cyclohexane) is one of the components.\n*   **Identify the Second Component:** Let the other component of Y be Y₂. Since hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y yields only cyclohexane, the hydrogenation of Y₂ must also produce cyclohexane. Therefore, Y₂ must also have a six-carbon ring skeleton. Because Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only remaining possibility is an aromatic compound, specifically **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe crucial insight here is to apply the law of conservation of mass.\n\n*   **Analyze the Reaction:** An equimolar mixture X (of liquids X₁ and X₂) is converted into the equimolar mixture Y through a **disproportionation** reaction on a heated platinum catalyst. In this organic chemistry context, this is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one molecule is reduced (gains hydrogen) and another is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n*   **Apply the Law of Conservation of Mass:** The overall reaction can be written as:\n    `Liquid X₁ + Liquid X₂ → Liquid Y₁ + Liquid Y₂`\n    Substituting the known components of Y:\n    `Liquid X₁ + Liquid X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n    The total number of atoms of each element must be conserved. The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\" This sum must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n\n### **Careful Points & Final Verification**\n\n1.  **Direct Calculation:** The most elegant and robust solution path relies on the conservation of mass. It allows for the calculation of the total hydrogen atoms in mixture X without needing to definitively identify its components, X₁ and X₂.\n2.  **Plausibility Check:** We can verify the entire scheme by checking if a plausible mixture X exists that fits all the remaining conditions:\n    *   Components must decolorize bromine water (be unsaturated).\n    *   They must *not* have conjugated multiple bonds.\n    *   The total hydrogen count in one molecule of each must be 18.\n    *   The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** perfectly fits all criteria. Their hydrogens sum to 10 + 8 = 18. Both are unsaturated C₆-ring compounds. Crucially, 1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds, satisfying the specific constraint. This confirms that the scenario described in the problem is chemically sound and our answer is consistent.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) 22\nB) 18\nC) 12\nD) 16\n\nThe correct answer is 18, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating all the careful points necessary to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### **Detailed Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\n**Step 1: Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\nThe first crucial task is to determine the identity of substance Z.\n\n*   **Analyze the Mass Percentage:** We are given that Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%.

Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, and finally to `y = 2x`. Thus, Z has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **A Careful Point on Saturation:** A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be either an alkene (containing a double bond) or a cycloalkane. The problem states that Z is a product of hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This is a key piece of information that indicates Z is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a **cycloalkane**, not an alkene.\n*   **Identify the Specific Compound:** All compounds in the problem hydrogenate to form *only* Z, implying they all share the same carbon skeleton. Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The reaction type (disproportionation) strongly suggests a six-membered ring is the common skeleton, as this allows for the formation of a stable aromatic ring in a later step. The six-carbon cycloalkane that fits all these descriptions is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Identification of the Components of Mixture Y**\nNext, we determine the composition of mixture Y.\n\n*   **Analyze the Properties:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. It \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components must be either saturated (like alkanes/cycloalkanes) or aromatic. We are also told Z (cyclohexane) is one of the components.\n*   **Identify the Second Component:** The other liquid in Y must also hydrogenate to produce only cyclohexane (as per the common skeleton rule). For this compound to have a C₆ skeleton, be hydrogenated to cyclohexane, and *not* react with bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only remaining possibility is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   **Conclusion for Mixture Y:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Final Answer**\nThis step uses the principle of conservation to directly answer the question.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The problem states that an equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via **disproportionation** when heated with platinum. In this context, this means a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X is reduced (gains hydrogen) to form cyclohexane, while the other is oxidized (loses hydrogen) to form benzene.\n*   **A Careful Point on the Law of Conservation:** The most direct way to solve this problem is by applying the Law of Conservation of Atoms. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same in the reactants and the products. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n*   **Calculation:** The reaction can be written as:\n    `Liquid X₁ + Liquid X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in Cyclohexane) + (H atoms in Benzene)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n**Step 4: Final Verification (A Crucial Careful Point)**\nTo ensure the solution is robust and the problem is chemically consistent, we can verify that a plausible Mixture X exists.\n\n*   **Conditions for Mixture X:** Its components must be two different liquids with C₆ ring skeletons that decolorize bromine water (are unsaturated), and they must *not* have conjugated multiple bonds. Their combined hydrogen atoms must sum to 18.\n*   **Plausible Components:** A perfect candidate pair is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   **Hydrogen sum:** 10 + 8 = 18.

The double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are isolated (non-conjugated). The conjugated isomer, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, is excluded by this rule.\n*   The existence of this chemically plausible mixture confirms that the answer derived from the law of conservation is correct.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, with careful attention paid to each constraint and logical deduction.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\nThe first and most critical step is to determine the identity of hydrocarbon Z.\n*   **Mass Fraction Analysis:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is given by the formula `y / (12x + y)` using simplified integer atomic masses.\n    *   `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    *   `7y = 12x + y`\n    *   `6y = 12x`\n    *   `y = 2x`\n    This establishes the general formula for Z as **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Saturation Analysis:** A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be either an alkene (unsaturated) or a cycloalkane (saturated ring). The problem explicitly states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" meaning it is a saturated compound. Therefore, Z must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   **Structural Clues:** The fact that all precursors hydrogenate to *only* Z implies they all share a common carbon skeleton. The reaction context (disproportionation involving an aromatic product, as will be seen) strongly points to a six-membered ring. The most common C₆ cycloalkane that is a \"widely used as a solvent\" is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** Correctly identifying Z as cyclohexane is the foundation for solving the rest of the problem. All clues point to this specific compound.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n*   **Properties of Mixture Y:** It is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic. We are also told that Z (cyclohexane) is a component of Y.\n*   **Identifying the Second Component:** Let the components be Y₁ and Y₂. We know Y₁ is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The second component, Y₂, must also hydrogenate to produce cyclohexane (to satisfy the \"gives only one substance, Z\" condition). Since Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be an alkene like cyclohexene. The only C₆ compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane but is unreactive toward bromine water is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Answer**\nThe most direct path to the solution is by applying the law of conservation of mass.\n*   **The Reaction:** An equimolar mixture X is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via disproportionation. This means that for every one molecule of the first component of X (X₁), one molecule of the second component (X₂) reacts. The reaction can be written as:\n    `X₁ + X₂ → Y₁ + Y₂`\n*   **Conservation of Atoms:** Substituting the known components of Y:\n    `X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n    According to the Law of Conservation of Atoms, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the equation. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in C₆H₆)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Applying the conservation of atoms is the most efficient and robust method.

This matches our calculation.\n    *   **Unsaturation:** Both have double bonds and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   **Non-conjugated:** The double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are isolated, satisfying the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" constraint (which explicitly rules out the isomer 1,3-cyclohexadiene).\n    *   **Reaction:** The disproportionation `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a classic hydrogen transfer reaction.\n\nThe existence of this valid pair confirms that the reasoning and the calculated answer of 18 are correct.\n\nBased on the provided options:\nA) 18\nB) 22\nC) 16\nD) 12\n\nThe correct answer is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating all the careful points required for a complete and accurate solution.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\n\nThe first and most crucial step is to determine the identity of substance Z.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Analyzing the Mass Percentage.**\n    Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is numerically equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (as 1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). For a hydrocarbon with the general formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen (using integer atomic masses C=12, H=1) is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n    *   Solving this algebraic equation leads to `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, and finally to `y = 2x`.\n    *   Therefore, the general formula for substance Z is **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Interpreting Saturation.**\n    The problem states that Z is a product of hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This indicates that Z is a saturated compound. A hydrocarbon with the formula Cn H₂n that is saturated cannot be an alkene (which is unsaturated); it must be a **cycloalkane**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Common Carbon Skeleton.**\n    Hydrogenation of *both* mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* substance Z. This is a critical piece of information, as it implies that all key compounds in the problem (the two in X and the two in Y) share the same carbon skeleton as Z. The nature of the disproportionation reaction (see later steps) strongly suggests this is a six-membered ring skeleton.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Z:** Based on the above points, Z is a C₆ cycloalkane. Combined with the clue that it's a \"widely used as a solvent,\" the identity is confirmed as **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n**2. Identification of the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. It \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z, which we have identified as **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n*   Hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means the other component must also have a C₆ ring skeleton and must hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n*   Since this second component does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only remaining possibility that fits all criteria is an aromatic compound, specifically **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water but is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under the described severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion for Y:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. The Final Calculation using Conservation of Mass**\n\n*   The problem states that an equimolar mixture X is converted into an equimolar mixture Y via disproportionation on a heated platinum catalyst. In organic chemistry, this means a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n*   The overall reaction, based on our identification of Y, is:\n    `(Liquid 1 of X) + (Liquid 2 of X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Careful Point 4: The Law of Conservation of Atoms.**\n    The most direct path to the solution is applying this fundamental law. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of a chemical reaction. The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\" This sum must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n**4. Final Verification (A Crucial Step)**\n\nTo ensure the entire scenario is chemically sound, we must check if a plausible Mixture X exists that satisfies all conditions.\n*   The components of X must:\n    1.  Decolorize bromine water (i.e., be unsaturated).\n    2.  Have no conjugated multiple bonds.\n    3.  Both have a C₆ ring skeleton.\n    4.  Have a total of 18 hydrogen atoms between them.\n*   Consider the pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   **Hydrogen sum:** 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our calculation.\n    *   **Unsaturation:** Both are unsaturated.\n    *   **No Conjugation:** Cyclohexene's one double bond is not conjugated. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated double bonds, satisfying the condition that it is not a conjugated system (like 1,3-cyclohexadiene).\n    *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a classic example of catalytic hydrogen transfer. This verification confirms that the scenario is plausible and our answer is correct.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, with careful attention paid to each condition provided in the question.\n\n### **Reasoning and Analysis**\n\n**1. Identification of Substance Z**\n\nThe first and most critical step is to identify the hydrocarbon Z, which serves as the anchor for the entire problem.\n\n*   **Analyze the Chemical Formula from Mass Fraction:** Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This value is the decimal equivalent of the fraction 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n    *   For a hydrocarbon with the general formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen can be expressed as `y / (12x + y)`, using simplified integer atomic masses.\n    *   Setting this equal to 1/7 gives the equation: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`.\n    *   Solving for the relationship between x and y: `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   This establishes the general formula of Z as **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Analyze the Chemical Properties:**\n    *   A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be either an alkene or a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen,\" which means it is a **saturated** compound. This rules out the possibility of it being an alkene. Therefore, Z must be a **cycloalkane**.\n    *   The fact that hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives *only* Z implies that all precursor compounds share the same carbon skeleton.\n*   **Identify the Specific Compound:** Given the reaction involves disproportionation (often involving the formation of a stable aromatic ring) and Z is a \"widely used as a solvent\", the most logical carbon skeleton is a six-membered ring. The C₆ cycloalkane is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**, a very common solvent, which perfectly fits the CₙH₂ₙ formula and all other conditions.\n\n**2. Identification of the Components of Mixture Y**\n\nWith Z identified as cyclohexane, we can determine the composition of mixture Y.\n\n*   **Analyze the Properties of Mixture Y:** It is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are either saturated or aromatic. We know one component is Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂).\n*   **Identify the Second Component:** Let the other component be Y₂.\n    *   Hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y yields only cyclohexane. Therefore, the hydrogenation of Y₂ must also produce cyclohexane, meaning Y₂ has a C₆ ring skeleton.\n    *   Since Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a cyclohexene. The only C₆ ring compound that can be hydrogenated but is unreactive towards bromine water is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reaction and Calculate the Answer**\n\nThe final step connects mixture X to mixture Y.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** An equimolar mixture X is converted into an equimolar mixture Y via **disproportionation** when heated with platinum. In this context, this is a hydrogen transfer reaction. The stoichiometry is 1:1.\n    *   Let the two liquids in mixture X be X₁ and X₂.\n    *   The reaction is: `X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Apply the Law of Conservation of Atoms:** The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the chemical equation. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This sum must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    *   Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n### **Careful Points & Final Verification**\n\n*   **The Power of Conservation Laws:** The solution relies fundamentally on the law of conservation of atoms. This is a very robust method that allows us to determine the total hydrogen content of the reactants (mixture X) without needing to know their exact identities first.\n*   **Plausibility Check:** We can verify that a chemically plausible mixture X exists. Its components must be C₆ unsaturated ring compounds, must have no conjugated double bonds, and their combined hydrogen atoms must sum to 18. The pair **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** perfectly fits all criteria.\n    *   Total H atoms: 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds, satisfying the constraint.\n    *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` represents a valid hydrogen transfer (disproportionation). This confirms our result is chemically sound.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem and a review of the candidate answers, here is a consolidated reasoning process.\n\n### **Detailed Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nThe most effective way to solve this problem is to work backward from the most well-defined substance, which is hydrocarbon Z.\n\n**1. Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   **Analyze the Mass Percentage:** The first clue is that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n*   **Determine the General Formula:** For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen (using integer atomic masses C=12, H=1 for simplicity) is given by the equation: `y / (12x + y)`. Setting this equal to 1/7 gives `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`, which can be solved as follows:\n    `7y = 12x + y`\n    `6y = 12x`\n    `y = 2x`\n    This shows that Z has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   **Determine the Compound Type:** A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ can be either an alkene or a cycloalkane. The problem states that Z is a product of hydrogenation and \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This indicates Z is a saturated compound, which means it must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   **Identify the Specific Compound:** We are told that hydrogenation of *all* other substances in the problem yields *only* Z. This is a crucial point, as it implies all key compounds share the same carbon skeleton. Furthermore, the reaction involves disproportionation, which in this context strongly suggests a six-membered ring system to allow for the formation of a stable aromatic ring. Combined with the clue that Z is a \"widely used as a solvent,\" the most logical conclusion is that Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits the formula, properties, and reaction context perfectly.\n\n**2. Identification of the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Analyze the Properties:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" and Z (cyclohexane) is one of its constituents. Not decolorizing bromine water means the components must be either saturated or aromatic.\n*   **Identify the Second Component:** Since hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane), the other component of Y must also have a C₆ skeleton and must be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. For this second component to *not* decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a simple cycloalkene. The only remaining possibility is an aromatic compound: **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water under these conditions but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reaction from X to Y and Find the Answer**\n\nThis is the most direct step to the solution, and a key careful point is the application of conservation of mass.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The problem states that an equimolar mixture X is converted into the equimolar mixture Y via a **disproportionation** reaction on a platinum catalyst. This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. The overall transformation is:\n    `(Liquid 1 from X) + (Liquid 2 from X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   **Law of Conservation of Atoms:** The total number of atoms of each element must be conserved in a chemical reaction. The question asks for \"the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\" This sum must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**\n\n**4. Final Verification (Consistency Check)**\n\nAs a final careful check, we can ensure that a mixture X with these properties could plausibly exist.\n*   **Required properties of X's components:** C₆ ring skeleton, unsaturated (decolorize Br₂ water), non-conjugated bonds, total H atoms = 18.\n*   A plausible composition for Mixture X is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   The hydrogen sum is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated C₆-ring compounds.\n    *   The double bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene are isolated (non-conjugated), fitting the constraint.\n    *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a valid disproportionation (hydrogen transfer).\n\nThis verification confirms our result of 18 is consistent with all stated conditions. The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the problem and the reasoning provided in the candidate answers, here is a consolidated step-by-step solution.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Identification of Substance Z**\n\n*   **Analyze Chemical Formula from Mass Fraction:** The problem states that substance Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This value is the decimal equivalent of the fraction 1/7 (since 1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). For a hydrocarbon with the general formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen can be expressed as `y / (12x + y)`, using simplified integer atomic masses.\n    *   Setting up the equation: `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`\n    *   Solving for the relationship between `x` and `y`:\n        `7y = 12x + y`\n        `6y = 12x`\n        `y = 2x`\n    *   This establishes the general formula for Z as **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n\n*   **Analyze Chemical Properties:** The problem specifies that Z \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ that is fully saturated (cannot be further hydrogenated) must be a **cycloalkane**. An alkene with the same formula would be unsaturated and would react with hydrogen.\n\n*   **Identify the Specific Compound:** All compounds in the problem (in mixtures X and Y) hydrogenate to form *only* Z, which implies they all share the same carbon skeleton. Z is also described as a \"widely used as a solvent.\" The reaction context, which involves disproportionation and the formation of a very stable dehydrogenated product, strongly suggests a six-membered ring system. The most common six-carbon cycloalkane that is widely used as a solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **. This identification is consistent with the formula CₙH₂ₙ (for n=6) and all other conditions.\n\n**2. Identification of the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. We are told one of these liquids is substance Z, which we have identified as **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **.\n*   Mixture Y \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components are either saturated (like alkanes/cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n*   Hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y yields only cyclohexane. This means the second component of Y must also have a C₆ ring skeleton and be capable of being hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n*   Given that this second component does not react with bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only remaining possibility for a C₆-ring compound that can be hydrogenated but is unreactive with bromine water is an aromatic compound, specifically **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Reaction and Calculation of the Final Answer**\n\n*   The problem states that equimolar mixture X is converted to equimolar mixture Y upon heating with a platinum catalyst. The reaction is a \"disproportionation.\" In this organic chemistry context, this refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component is reduced (gains hydrogen) and another is oxidized (loses hydrogen).\n*   The overall chemical transformation, based on 1:1 equimolar stoichiometry, can be written as:\n    `Liquid from X₁ + Liquid from X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   The most direct way to solve the problem is by applying the **Law of Conservation of Atoms**. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both the reactant and product sides of the equation. The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\" This sum must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n\n### **Careful Points and Verification**\n\n*   **Conservation of Mass:** The key to solving this problem efficiently is realizing that the total number of atoms is conserved. This allows for a direct calculation of the hydrogen atoms in the starting materials (Mixture X) by simply summing the hydrogens in the known products (Mixture Y), without needing to identify the exact components of X.\n*   **Plausibility Check:** We can verify that our solution is consistent with all the problem's constraints. Mixture X must be composed of two C₆-ring compounds that are unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water) but do not have conjugated double bonds, and their total hydrogen count must be 18.\n    *   A plausible composition for Mixture X is **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   **Check:** Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18. Both are unsaturated. 1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated (non-conjugated) double bonds. The reaction C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆ is a perfect example of disproportionation. This confirms that a chemically valid scenario exists, and our answer of 18 is correct.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, with careful attention to each piece of information.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Reasoning**\n\n**1. Identification of Hydrocarbon Z**\n\nThe first and most crucial step is to identify substance Z. We are given several clues:\n*   It is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   It is a saturated compound (\"does not react further with hydrogen\").\n*   It is a \"widely used as a solvent\".\n*   All precursor compounds in the problem share its carbon skeleton.\n\n**Analysis of Clues:**\n*   The mass percentage of hydrogen, 14.28%, is the decimal equivalent of the fraction 1/7 (1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857).\n*   For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is `y / (12x + y)` (using approximate atomic masses C=12, H=1).\n*   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` gives the equation `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n*   Therefore, Z has the general formula **CₙH₂ₙ**.\n*   A hydrocarbon with this formula that is also saturated must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   Given the reaction context (disproportionation involving ring systems) and its use as a common solvent, the most logical identity for Z is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **. This perfectly fits all given conditions.\n\n**2. Identification of Mixture Y**\n\nNext, we identify the components of mixture Y:\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n*   One component is Z, which we have identified as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n*   It \"does not decolorize bromine water\", meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y yields only cyclohexane.\n\n**Analysis of Clues:**\n*   Let the two components be Y₁ and Y₂. We know Y₁ is cyclohexane.\n*   Since Y₁ is already the final hydrogenation product, the other component, Y₂, must also hydrogenate to produce cyclohexane. This implies Y₂ has a six-carbon ring skeleton.\n*   For Y₂ to be hydrogenated but not react with bromine water, it cannot be a simple alkene. The only remaining possibility is an aromatic compound, specifically **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is unreactive with bromine water but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   Therefore, Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Reaction from X to Y and Final Calculation**\n\nThis step uses the information from the previous steps to solve the core problem.\n*   An equimolar mixture X is heated with platinum, undergoing **disproportionation** to form the equimolar mixture Y.\n*   In this context, disproportionation is a hydrogen transfer reaction. One component of X is reduced (gains hydrogen) to form cyclohexane, while the other component is oxidized (loses hydrogen) to form benzene.\n*   The overall reaction is:\n    `(Liquid 1 from X) + (Liquid 2 from X) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n\n**The most careful and crucial point** is to apply the **Law of Conservation of Mass**. The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on the reactant and product sides. The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This sum must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture Y.\n\n**Calculation:**\nTotal H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\nTotal H atoms = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n**4. Verification (Plausibility Check)**\n\nA good analysis includes verifying that the scenario is chemically possible. Can a mixture X exist that fits the criteria?\n*   **Criteria for X**: Two C₆-ring liquids that decolorize bromine water (are unsaturated), have no conjugated bonds, and their total H atoms sum to 18.\n*   **Plausible Candidates**: Consider **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**.\n    *   **Total H atoms:** 10 + 8 = 18. (Correct)\n    *   **Unsaturation:** Both have double bonds and will decolorize bromine water. (Correct)\n    *   **No Conjugation:** 1,4-cyclohexadiene has isolated double bonds, satisfying the condition that there are no *conjugated* multiple bonds. (Correct)\n    *   **Reaction**: `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a valid disproportionation (hydrogen transfer) reaction.\nThis verification confirms our result of 18 is correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) 16\nB) 12\nC) 18\nD) 22\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the careful points required to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step 1: Identification of Hydrocarbon Z\n\nThe first step is to deduce the identity of the final product, Z.\n\n*   **Analyze the Mass Percentage:** We are told Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (as 1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen (using integer atomic masses C=12, H=1 for simplicity) is `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Setting `y / (12x + y) = 1/7` and solving gives `7y = 12x + y`, which simplifies to `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   Therefore, the general formula for Z is CₙH₂ₙ.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Saturation.** The problem states Z \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ that is fully saturated (cannot add more hydrogen) must be a **cycloalkane**. It cannot be an alkene, which is unsaturated.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Common Carbon Skeleton.** The fact that hydrogenation of *both* mixtures X and Y gives *only* Z as a product implies that all precursor compounds in the reaction scheme share the same carbon skeleton. Given the reaction type (disproportionation involving unsaturated rings), a six-membered ring is the most logical skeleton.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** A six-carbon cycloalkane (n=6) is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) **. This is a common solvent and fits all the given conditions perfectly.\n\n### Step 2: Identification of the Components of Mixture Y\n\nNext, we determine the composition of the product mixture Y.\n\n*   **Analyze Mixture Y's Properties:** Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One component is Z (cyclohexane). The mixture \"does not decolorize bromine water,\" meaning its components must be either saturated (like alkanes/cycloalkanes) or aromatic.\n*   **Identify the Second Component:** Let the second liquid be Y₂. Since hydrogenation of the entire mixture Y gives only cyclohexane, the hydrogenation of Y₂ must also produce cyclohexane. Therefore, Y₂ must have a C₆ ring skeleton. For Y₂ to have a C₆ skeleton, be hydrogenated to cyclohexane, and *not* react with bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only compound that fits all these criteria is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic and does not decolorize bromine water under these conditions, but it can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the Reaction and Final Calculation\n\nThe answer can now be found by analyzing the reaction connecting mixture X and mixture Y.\n\n*   **The Reaction:** An equimolar mixture X (of liquids X₁ and X₂) is converted to the equimolar mixture Y via disproportionation. The overall stoichiometry is:\n    `X₁ + X₂ → Y₁ + Y₂`\n    Substituting the identities of the products:\n    `X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Law of Conservation of Mass.** This is the crucial principle for solving the problem.

(Correct)\nThe existence of this valid pair confirms that the reasoning based on conservation of mass is sound.\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the key logical points and careful considerations identified from the candidate answers.\n\n### **Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe problem can be solved by systematically identifying the unknown substances based on the chemical properties and reactions described. The most logical path is to identify substance Z first, then mixture Y, and finally use the law of conservation of mass to determine the properties of mixture X.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Substance Z**\n\n*   **Chemical Formula:** The first clue is that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. This percentage is equivalent to the fraction 1/7 (since 1 ÷ 7 ≈ 0.142857). For a hydrocarbon with the formula CₓHᵧ, the mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `y / (12x + y)`, using simplified atomic masses. Setting this equal to 1/7 yields the relationship `y = 2x`. Thus, Z has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   **Saturation:** The problem states Z \"does not react further with hydrogen.\" This indicates that Z is a fully saturated compound. A hydrocarbon with the formula CₙH₂ₙ that is saturated must be a **cycloalkane**.\n*   **Identity:** A critical piece of information is that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives *only* substance Z. This implies that all key components in the reactions share the same carbon skeleton. The reaction type, disproportionation, often involves six-membered rings to form stable aromatic products. The most common six-carbon cycloalkane that is \"widely used as a solvent\" is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This identity fits all the given facts.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   **Properties:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that \"does not decolorize bromine water.\" This means its components must be either saturated (like Z) or aromatic.\n*   **Known Component:** We are told Z is a constituent of mixture Y. So, one liquid is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n*   **Identifying the Second Component:** The other liquid in mixture Y must also hydrogenate to give only cyclohexane (due to the common carbon skeleton rule). Since it does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be a cycloalkene. The only remaining possibility for a C₆ compound that can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane but is unreactive with bromine water is the aromatic compound **benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n*   **Conclusion:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Determine the Total Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**\n\n*   **The Reaction:** The core of the problem lies in the reaction where mixture X is converted to mixture Y. This is described as a **disproportionation** reaction on a platinum catalyst. In this chemical context, it is a hydrogen transfer reaction where one component is reduced (gains hydrogen atoms) and another is oxidized (loses hydrogen atoms).\n*   **Stoichiometry and Conservation of Mass:** Both X and Y are equimolar mixtures, so the reaction stoichiometry is 1:1 between the reacting components.\n    `Liquid X₁ + Liquid X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   The most direct way to answer the question is by applying the **Law of Conservation of Atoms**. The total number of atoms of each element on the reactant side must equal the total on the product side.\n*   **Calculation:** The question asks for the \"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X\". This sum must be equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n    Total H atoms = (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₁₂) + (H atoms in one molecule of C₆H₆)\n    Total H atoms = 12 + 6 = **18**.\n\n### **Careful Points & Final Verification**\n\n1.  **Direct Calculation:** The most reliable path to the answer does not require identifying the specific components of Mixture X. It relies only on identifying the products (Mixture Y) and applying the Law of Conservation of Mass.\n2.  **Constraint Checklist:** To ensure the scenario is chemically sound, we can verify that a plausible Mixture X exists. The components of X must be unsaturated (to decolorize bromine water), have non-conjugated multiple bonds, share a C₆ skeleton, and their total hydrogen count must be 18.\n3.  **Plausible Components for X:** A mixture of **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)** and **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)** perfectly fits all conditions:\n    *   Their hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated C₆-ring liquids.\n    *   The problem explicitly states \"no conjugated multiple bonds,\" which rules out 1,3-cyclohexadiene and points specifically to 1,4-cyclohexadiene.\n    *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a valid disproportionation.\n\nThe existence of this plausible pair validates the entire logical chain. The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
