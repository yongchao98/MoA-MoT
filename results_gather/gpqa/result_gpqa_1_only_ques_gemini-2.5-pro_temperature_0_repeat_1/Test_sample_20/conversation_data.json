    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Part A: Identifying the compound that does not show tautomerism.\n\n**Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two isomers that can be interconverted, most commonly by the migration of a proton. The most frequent type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n\n1.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   Its structure consists of a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are CH₂ groups.\n    *   These CH₂ groups are alpha to the carbonyl groups. For example, the carbon at position 2 is alpha to the carbonyls at positions 1 and 3.\n    *   Since there are hydrogen atoms on these alpha-carbons, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   In fact, it tautomerizes to form phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is an aromatic and highly stable compound. The equilibrium strongly favors this aromatic enol form.\n    *   Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism**.\n\n2.  **Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone):**\n    *   Its structure is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two ketone groups opposite each other.\n    *   The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds (they are sp² hybridized).\n    *   For standard keto-enol tautomerism, an alpha-hydrogen on an sp³ hybridized carbon is typically required. Benzoquinone lacks such a carbon.\n    *   While it can be converted to hydroquinone, this is a reduction reaction (gain of two electrons and two protons), not a simple intramolecular proton shift (tautomerization).\n    *   Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n**Conclusion for A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Identifying the compound that will show optical isomerism.\n\n**Optical isomerism** is exhibited by chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature leading to chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C2, the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral.\n    *   Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   This is the *trans* isomer of an alkene with the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond.\n    *   It possesses a center of inversion (a point of symmetry) at the midpoint of the double bond.\n    *   Any molecule with a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   Since dimethyl fumarate is achiral, it will not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion for B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n*   Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nMatching this with the options provided:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
