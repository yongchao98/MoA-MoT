    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Functional Groups and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** A 6-membered aromatic ring (like benzene) has a Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 4 (one ring and three double bonds).\n    *   **Ester Group:** The FTIR spectrum indicates an ester group (-COO-). This group contains a carbonyl (C=O) double bond, which contributes 1 to the DoU.\n    *   **Vinyl Group:** The 1H NMR shows signals for vinyl protons (-CH=CH-). This C=C double bond contributes 1 to the DoU.\n    *   **Total DoU:** The minimum DoU based on the identified functional groups is 4 (aromatic ring) + 1 (ester C=O) + 1 (vinyl C=C) = **6**.\n\n2.  **Calculate the DoU for Each Possible Formula:**\n    The formula for DoU is: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` (Oxygen atoms do not affect the calculation).\n    *   A) C11H14O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5. This does not match the required DoU of 6.\n    *   B) C11H12O2: DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**. This matches.\n    *   C) C12H14O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = **6**. This also matches.\n    *   D) C12H12O2: DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7. This does not match.\n\n    Based on the DoU, the correct formula must be either **B) C11H12O2** or **C) C12H14O2**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data to Build the Structure:**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring (C6H4):** A di-substituted 6-membered ring has 4 aromatic protons. The presence of only two signals for these protons suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely 1,4- (para) substitution.\n    *   **Ester Group:** The problem states there are **no signals for –CH2 groups**. An ester has the general structure R-COO-R'. If R' were an ethyl group (-CH2CH3), we would see a -CH2- signal. Since there is none, the simplest possibility for R' is a methyl group (-CH3). This gives us a **methyl ester** fragment (-COOCH3) and accounts for one of the two –CH3 signals.\n    *   **Vinyl Group & Second -CH3:** There are two vinyl protons. One is a doublet, meaning it's coupled to only one other proton. The other is a doublet of quartets (dq), meaning it's coupled to one proton (the other vinyl H) and a group of three protons (a -CH3 group). This splitting pattern is characteristic of a **propenyl group** (-CH=CH-CH3). This fragment accounts for the two vinyl-H signals and the second –CH3 signal.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n    We have the following pieces:\n    *   A 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring: C6H4\n    *   A methyl ester group: -COOCH3\n    *   A propenyl group: -CH=CH-CH3\n\n    Assembling these gives a structure like methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate. Let's count the atoms in this complete structure:\n    *   **Carbons:** 6 (from ring) + 1 (from C=O) + 1 (from -OCH3) + 3 (from propenyl) = **11 Carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogens:** 4 (from ring) + 3 (from -OCH3) + 5 (from propenyl) = **12 Hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygens:** 2 (from ester) = **2 Oxygens**\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The deduced formula C11H12O2 matches option B. The other possibility with the correct DoU, C12H14O2 (Option C), contains an extra CH2 unit compared to our deduced structure. The explicit absence of –CH2 signals in the NMR spectrum rules out this option.\n\nTherefore, the correct chemical formula is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
