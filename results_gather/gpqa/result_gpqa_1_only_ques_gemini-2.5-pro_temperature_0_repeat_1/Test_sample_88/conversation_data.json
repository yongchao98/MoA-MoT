    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess KOH, heated to 240°C.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   IR: 1720 cm⁻¹ (characteristic of a C=O, ketone group).\n    *   ¹H NMR: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). Total 14H.\n    *   The molecular formula of the starting material is C₁₀H₁₄Br₂. The product has 14 protons and contains an oxygen atom, suggesting a formula of C₁₀H₁₄O.\n\n*   **Analysis:** The reaction involves the loss of two bromine atoms and the gain of one oxygen atom. The IR spectrum confirms the product is a ketone. The ¹H NMR is the most informative piece of data. The signal at 4.79 ppm (2H) is in the vinylic region, indicating a C=C double bond with two protons. The fact that these two protons appear as a single signal with an integration of 2H implies they are chemically equivalent due to symmetry.\n\n*   A structure that fits all these data is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-one**.\n    *   **Formula:** C₁₀H₁₄O. Correct.\n    *   **Functionality:** It is a bicyclic ketone, consistent with the IR peak.\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C3 carbonyl group and the C7 methylene group. This plane makes the two protons of the exocyclic C=CH₂ group chemically equivalent.\n    *   **NMR:** The chemical shift for exocyclic methylene protons (=CH₂) is typically 4.6-4.9 ppm, which is an excellent match for the observed signal at 4.79 ppm.\n    *   **Formation:** This product can be formed from 1,3-disubstituted adamantanes via a fragmentation-rearrangement pathway under harsh conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-i-Pr)₃.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which selectively reduces ketones to alcohols. The C=C double bond is not affected.\n*   **Product 2 Structure:** The ketone group at C3 of Product 1 is reduced to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   Product 2 is **7-methylene-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup. Ozonolysis cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds. The exocyclic C₇=CH₂ double bond in Product 2 is cleaved.\n    *   The C₇ carbon of the ring becomes a ketone (C=O).\n    *   The external CH₂ group becomes formaldehyde (CH₂O), which is a byproduct.\n*   **Product 3 Structure:** The resulting main product is a bicyclic keto-alcohol.\n    *   Product 3 is **3-hydroxy-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-one**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Question:** What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in Product 3 (excluding the exchangeable -OH proton)?\n*   **Structure of Product 3:** 3-hydroxy-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-one. This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C3 and C7.\n*   **Identifying the most deshielded proton:**\n    *   Protons alpha to the ketone (at C6 and C8) are deshielded (~2.5 ppm).\n    *   Bridgehead protons (at C1 and C5) are in the aliphatic region.\n    *   The proton on the carbon bearing the alcohol group (the H-C-OH proton at C3) is deshielded by the adjacent oxygen atom. Its chemical shift is typically in the range of 3.5-4.5 ppm.\n    *   Therefore, the proton at C3 (let's call it H3) is the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton.\n\n*   **Determining the coupling pattern of H3:**\n    *   The splitting of H3 is determined by the number of protons on the adjacent carbons, which are C2 and C4.\n    *   In the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane skeleton, both C2 and C4 are methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two protons on C2 are equivalent to the two protons on C4.\n    *   Thus, H3 is coupled to a total of 4 neighboring protons (two on C2 and two on C4).\n    *   According to the n+1 rule, a proton coupled to 'n' equivalent neighboring protons will be split into 'n+1' peaks.\n    *   Here, n = 4. Therefore, the signal for H3 will be split into 4 + 1 = 5 peaks.\n    *   A signal with 5 peaks is called a **pentet** (or quintet).\n\n(Note: In a rigid chair conformation, the axial and equatorial protons on C2 and C4 would be non-equivalent, leading to a more complex pattern like a triplet of triplets. However, given the options and the conformational flexibility of the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane system, the coupling constants often become similar enough to resolve as a simpler pentet. \"Pentet\" is the best description among the choices for a proton coupled to four neighboring protons.)\n\nFinal Answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
