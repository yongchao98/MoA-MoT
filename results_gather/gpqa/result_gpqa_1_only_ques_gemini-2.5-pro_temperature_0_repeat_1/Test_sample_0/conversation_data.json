    "This problem is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time, which states:\n\nΔE * Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere:\n*   ΔE is the uncertainty in the energy of a state (also known as the energy width of the level).\n*   Δt is the uncertainty in time, which we can take as the lifetime (τ) of the state.\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nFor an order-of-magnitude calculation, we can use the relation ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.\n\nTo \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than the energy widths of the levels. The state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy width, and this width is the primary factor limiting our ability to resolve the two levels.\n\nLet's calculate the energy width (ΔE) for each state:\n\n**State 1:**\n*   Lifetime τ1 = 10⁻⁹ s\n*   Energy width ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1\n*   ΔE1 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s)\n*   ΔE1 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n**State 2:**\n*   Lifetime τ2 = 10⁻⁸ s\n*   Energy width ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2\n*   ΔE2 ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s)\n*   ΔE2 ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nThe energy width of the first state (ΔE1 ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV) is larger than the width of the second state (ΔE2 ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁸ eV). To resolve these two levels, their energy separation must be at least on the order of the larger width, ΔE1. A more rigorous condition for clear resolution is that the separation should be significantly greater than this width.\n\nSo, we need:\n|E1 - E2| > ΔE1\n|E1 - E2| > 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\nNow let's examine the given options:\nA) 10⁻⁹ eV is less than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\nB) 10⁻¹¹ eV is less than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\nC) 10⁻⁴ eV is much greater than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\nD) 10⁻⁸ eV is less than 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nOnly option C provides an energy difference large enough to clearly resolve the two energy levels, as it is significantly larger than the natural energy broadening of the states.\n\n<<<C>>>"
