    "To determine the mass dimension of $\\kappa$ and the renormalizability of the theory described by the interaction Lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$, we follow these steps:\n\n**1. Determine the Mass Dimension of each term**\n\nIn natural units ($\\hbar=c=1$), the action $S = \\int d^4x \\mathcal{L}$ must be dimensionless. Since the spacetime volume element $d^4x$ has a mass dimension of $[d^4x]_M = -4$, the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension of $[\\mathcal{L}]_M = 4$.\n\nTherefore, the interaction term must also have a mass dimension of 4:\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}]_M = [\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$\n\nNow, let's find the mass dimension of each component in the interaction term:\n\n*   **Fermion field $\\psi$**: The kinetic term for a fermion is $\\mathcal{L}_{kinetic, \\psi} = \\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m)\\psi$. For this to have a mass dimension of 4, we look at the term $\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\psi$.\n    *   The derivative $\\partial_\\mu$ has a mass dimension of $[\\partial_\\mu]_M = 1$.\n    *   The gamma matrices $\\gamma^\\mu$ are dimensionless.\n    *   So, we must have $[\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\partial_\\mu]_M + [\\psi]_M = 4$.\n    *   Since $[\\bar{\\psi}]_M = [\\psi]_M$, we get $2[\\psi]_M + 1 = 4$, which implies $[\\psi]_M = 3/2$.\n    *   Thus, $[\\psi]_M = [\\bar{\\psi}]_M = 3/2$.\n\n*   **Tensor $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$**: This is defined as $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}=\\frac{i}{2}\\left[\\gamma_{\\mu},\\gamma_{\\nu}\\right]$. Since the gamma matrices $\\gamma_\\mu$ are dimensionless, their commutator is also dimensionless.\n    *   Thus, $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 0$.\n\n*   **Field strength tensor $F^{\\mu\\nu}$**: The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is $\\mathcal{L}_{kinetic, A} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$. For this to have a mass dimension of 4, we must have:\n    *   $[F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$, which means $2[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$.\n    *   Thus, $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 2$.\n\nNow we can find the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$:\n$[\\kappa]_M + [\\bar{\\psi}]_M + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}]_M + [\\psi]_M + [F^{\\mu\\nu}]_M = 4$\n$[\\kappa]_M + \\frac{3}{2} + 0 + \\frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4$\n$[\\kappa]_M + 3 + 2 = 4$\n$[\\kappa]_M + 5 = 4$\n$[\\kappa]_M = -1$\n\nSo, the mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n**2. Determine Renormalizability**\n\nThe renormalizability of a quantum field theory is related to the mass dimension of its coupling constants. For a coupling constant $g$:\n*   If $[g]_M > 0$, the interaction is super-renormalizable.\n*   If $[g]_M = 0$, the interaction is renormalizable.\n*   If $[g]_M < 0$, the interaction is non-renormalizable.\n\nIn our case, the coupling constant is $\\kappa$, and we found its mass dimension to be $[\\kappa]_M = -1$. Since the mass dimension is negative, the theory is **non-renormalizable**.\n\nA non-renormalizable interaction means that as we go to higher orders in perturbation theory, we would need to introduce an infinite number of new counter-terms to absorb the divergences, rendering the theory non-predictive at high energies (unless treated as an effective field theory).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1, and the theory is non-renormalizable. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
