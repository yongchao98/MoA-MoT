    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each reaction to determine the suitable reagents.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a nucleophilic addition reaction to a carbonyl group, specifically the formation of a cyanohydrin.\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:**\n    *   The cyanide ion (CN⁻) from sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a strong nucleophile. It attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n    *   This attack breaks the pi bond of the C=O group, forming a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   This alkoxide intermediate is negatively charged (CH₃-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH₂CH₃) and needs to be protonated to form the final stable product, which has a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n3.  **Determine reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺) to protonate the alkoxide intermediate.\n    *   H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion, representing a strong aqueous acid like HCl or H₂SO₄) is an excellent proton source for this step.\n    *   NaHSO₃ (sodium bisulfite) is a different reagent that also adds to carbonyls but is not used to complete the cyanohydrin formation initiated by NaCN.\n    *   Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**. This narrows down the options to A and D.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile.\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:** Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base, typically with heating. The presence of H₂O in the reaction indicates hydrolysis.\n    *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is heated with a strong aqueous acid (e.g., HCl, H₂SO₄). The acid protonates the nitrogen atom, making the carbon atom more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water. Through a series of steps, the nitrile is converted first to an amide and then to a carboxylic acid and an ammonium ion.\n    *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** The nitrile is heated with a strong aqueous base (e.g., NaOH). This forms a carboxylate salt, which must then be acidified in a separate step to yield the carboxylic acid.\n3.  **Determine reagent B:** Reagent B acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis.\n    *   HCl (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and a standard reagent used to effectively catalyze the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids in a single step.\n    *   CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid. While it might catalyze the reaction to a very small extent, it is generally not strong enough to efficiently drive the hydrolysis to completion. Strong mineral acids are required.\n    *   Therefore, **B = HCl** is the most suitable choice.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   For the first reaction, A must be H₃O⁺.\n*   For the second reaction, B must be HCl.\n\nCombining these findings, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
