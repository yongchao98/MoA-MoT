    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures.\n\n**1. Understand the Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates away. The formula is:\n\n$T_{eq} = T_{eff} \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $T_{eff}$ is the effective temperature of the star.\n*   $R_*$ is the radius of the star.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   $A$ is the planet's Bond albedo.\n\n**2. Formulate the Ratio of Temperatures**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{eff} \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{eff} \\left( \\frac{R_*}{2a_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nThe problem states that both planets orbit the same star, so $T_{eff}$ and $R_*$ are the same for both. It also states that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, these terms cancel out, and the equation simplifies to:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{a_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we first need to find the ratio of the semi-major axes, $a_2/a_1$.\n\n**3. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity Data**\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method provides the Doppler shift, which can be used to find the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, K. The maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda_{max}$) is related to K by:\n\n$K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$\n\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{\\sqrt{M_* a}} \\sqrt{G}$ (assuming $M_p \\ll M_*$)\n\nwhere $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_*$ is the star's mass, $a$ is the semi-major axis, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\nSince the planets were detected using the transit method, their orbits must be nearly edge-on to our line of sight. This means the inclination angle $i$ is very close to 90°, so we can assume $\\sin i \\approx 1$. The formula becomes:\n\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p \\sqrt{G}}{\\sqrt{M_* a}}$\n\n**4. Solve for the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes ($a_2/a_1$)**\n\nWe can rearrange the formula for K to solve for $a$:\n\n$a = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{K^2 M_*}$\n\nNow, we can set up the ratio for $a_2/a_1$:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 G / (K_2^2 M_*)}{M_{p1}^2 G / (K_1^2 M_*)} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2}{K_2^2} \\frac{K_1^2}{M_{p1}^2} = \\left(\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{K_1}{K_2}\\right)^2$\n\n**5. Substitute the Given Values**\n\n*   **Mass Ratio:**\n    $M_{p1} = 7 M_{Earth}$\n    $M_{p2} = 5 M_{Earth}$\n    $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n*   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio (K):**\n    The ratio $K_1/K_2$ is directly proportional to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts, since $c$ and $\\lambda_0$ are constant:\n    $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nNow, substitute these ratios back into the equation for $a_2/a_1$:\n\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio**\n\nFinally, substitute the value of $a_2/a_1$ back into the simplified temperature ratio equation:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}}$\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nCalculating the decimal value:\n\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<C>>>"
