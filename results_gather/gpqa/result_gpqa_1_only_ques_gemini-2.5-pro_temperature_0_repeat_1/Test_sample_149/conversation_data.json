    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material from the given molecular formula and NMR data.**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C8H9NO\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The formula for DBE is C + 1 - H/2 + N/2.\n    DBE = 8 + 1 - (9/2) + (1/2) = 9 - 4.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n    A DBE of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs) and one additional double bond or ring.\n\n*   **1H-NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet (t) splitting indicates it is coupled to two adjacent protons, suggesting a -CH2-CHO fragment.\n    *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to a CH2 group. The doublet (d) splitting indicates it is coupled to one adjacent proton. This confirms the -CH2-CHO fragment, as these CH2 protons are coupled to the single aldehyde proton.\n    *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic signature of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The upfield chemical shifts (especially 6.51 ppm) suggest a strong electron-donating group is attached to the ring.\n    *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to 2 protons in this region is characteristic of a primary amine group (-NH2). An amine group is a strong electron-donating group, which is consistent with the upfield aromatic signals.\n\n*   **Assembling the Structure:**\n    We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring with an -NH2 group and a -CH2CHO group as substituents. This gives the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. Let's verify the molecular formula: C6H4 (ring) + NH2 + C2H3O (-CH2CHO) = C8H9NO. The structure is consistent with all the given data.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reaction sequence.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n\n*   **Reagents 1 & 2: 1. NaNO2 + HCl; 2. H2O**\n    This is a two-step Sandmeyer-type reaction sequence.\n    1.  **NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization):** This converts the primary aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-). The intermediate is 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n    2.  **H2O (Hydrolysis):** The diazonium salt is then treated with water, which hydrolyzes it. The diazonium group is an excellent leaving group (N2 gas), and it is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The product after these two steps is **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n*   **Reagent 3: aq. KOH, Heat**\n    *   The reactant for this step is 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This molecule is an aldehyde with acidic α-protons (the protons on the -CH2- group).\n    *   The conditions (strong base like KOH and heat) are perfect for a **self-aldol condensation** reaction.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        1.  **Aldol Addition:** The base (OH-) removes an α-proton from one molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. This forms a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which is **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal** (This corresponds to option C).\n        2.  **Dehydration (Condensation):** Because the reaction is heated, the aldol addition product readily undergoes dehydration (loses a molecule of water). The acidic α-proton (at C2) is removed, and the β-hydroxyl group (at C3) is eliminated. This forms a stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n    *   The final condensation product is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the final product from the options.**\n\n*   The reaction starts with 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n*   It is converted to 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n*   This undergoes self-aldol condensation (addition followed by dehydration due to heat).\n*   The aldol addition product is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (Option C).\n*   The final condensation product (after dehydration) is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal (Option B).\n\nSince the question asks for the final product of the entire sequence which includes heat, the dehydrated condensation product is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
