    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the $X^0$ particle. In the context of particle tracking detectors, \"resolution\" can be ambiguous. However, the problem is likely asking for a characteristic length scale. We need to find the distance $L$ traveled by the particle such that a certain condition related to the 30% decay observation is met.\n\n**2. Relativistic Parameters**\n\nThe $X^0$ particle is moving at a relativistic speed. We first need to calculate its Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$) and its speed ($v = \\beta c$).\n\n*   Rest mass energy of $X^0$: $m_0 c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n*   Total energy in the lab frame: $E = 27$ GeV\n*   The Lorentz factor is the ratio of total energy to rest mass energy:\n    $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_0 c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n*   The relationship between energy, momentum ($p$), and mass is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0 c^2)^2$. We can find the momentum:\n    $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_0 c^2)^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ (GeV)}^2$\n    $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78$ GeV\n\n*   The velocity parameter $\\beta = v/c$ can be found from the momentum and energy:\n    $\\beta = \\frac{pc}{E} = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{27 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 0.9919$\n    Alternatively, using $\\gamma$: $\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{7.918^2}} \\approx 0.992$\n\n**3. Decay Length in the Lab Frame**\n\nThe particle's lifetime is dilated in the lab frame. The mean decay length ($\\lambda$) is the average distance the particle travels before decaying in the lab frame.\n\n*   Proper lifetime: $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   Lifetime in the lab frame (time dilation): $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0 = 7.918 \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 6.334 \\times 10^{-15}$ s\n*   Mean decay length: $\\lambda = v \\tau = (\\beta c) \\tau$\n    $\\lambda \\approx 0.992 \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (6.334 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n    A more direct formula for the mean decay length is:\n    $\\lambda = \\frac{p}{m_0} \\tau_0 = \\frac{pc}{m_0 c^2} c \\tau_0$\n    $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 7.853 \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}) \\approx 1.885 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n**4. Interpreting the \"30% Observation\" Condition**\n\nThe number of particles that have not decayed after traveling a distance $L$ is given by $N(L) = N_0 e^{-L/\\lambda}$. The number that have decayed is $N_0(1 - e^{-L/\\lambda})$.\n\nThe phrase \"observe at least 30% of the decays\" is ambiguous. Let's consider two interpretations:\n*   **Interpretation A:** We want to find the minimum detector length $L$ that would capture the first 30% of decays.\n    $P(\\text{decay length} \\le L) = 1 - e^{-L/\\lambda} = 0.3$\n    $e^{-L/\\lambda} = 0.7 \\implies L = -\\lambda \\ln(0.7) \\approx 0.357 \\lambda \\approx 0.357 \\times (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\approx 0.67 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. This value is not among the options.\n\n*   **Interpretation B:** The question is asking for the resolution required to see the 30% of particles that travel the farthest before decaying. This means we are interested in the length $L$ beyond which 30% of the particles decay.\n    $P(\\text{decay length} > L) = e^{-L/\\lambda} = 0.3$\n    $L = -\\lambda \\ln(0.3) = \\lambda \\ln(10/3) \\approx 1.204 \\lambda$\n    $L \\approx 1.204 \\times (1.885 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\n**5. Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe value calculated from Interpretation B, $L \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is very close to option D. The small discrepancy (~9%) is likely due to the numbers in the problem statement being slightly inconsistent with the options, a common occurrence in such problems. The other options are different by orders of magnitude. Therefore, this interpretation is the most likely intended path to the solution.\n\nCalculated value: $2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nOption D: $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nGiven the choices, option D is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
