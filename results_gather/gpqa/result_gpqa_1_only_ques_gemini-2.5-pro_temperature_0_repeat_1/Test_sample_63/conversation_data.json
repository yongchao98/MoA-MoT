    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Analyze the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe problem describes the decomposition of a salt mixture into gases, which are then analyzed by passing them through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong desiccant and absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂.\n    *   The weight of the tube did not change, which means no acidic gases were formed in the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n    *   The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through the three tubes, 2.24 L of gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Determine the Identity of Gas C and the Elemental Composition**\n\nThe initial mixture of salts (7.20 g) completely decomposed into gases. By the law of conservation of mass, the total mass of the gaseous products must equal the initial mass.\n\n*   Total mass of gases = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C)\n*   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C)\n*   Mass(Gas C) = 7.20 g - 4.40 g = 2.80 g\n\nNow we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n*   Molar Mass of C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28 g/mol.\n\nThe gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol that is unreactive towards the reagents used is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nNow, let's find the total moles of each element in the original 7.20 g sample:\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** All H is in H₂O. Moles of H = 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is in H₂O and O₂. Moles of O = (1 × Moles of H₂O) + (2 × Moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** All N is in N₂. Moles of N = 2 × Moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe original mixture contained H, N, and O. The problem states it's a mixture of salts. This suggests ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids (like nitrate or nitrite).\n\nLet's find the simplest whole-number ratio of the elements in the entire sample:\n*   N : H : O\n*   0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25\nDivide by the smallest number (0.20):\n*   1 : 2 : 1.25\nMultiply by 4 to get whole numbers:\n*   4 : 8 : 5\n\nThe overall empirical formula for the combined salts is N₄H₈O₅.\n\nThe problem states we have an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. This means the formula N₄H₈O₅ represents the sum of the chemical formulas of salt A and salt B.\n(Formula of A) + (Formula of B) = N₄H₈O₅\n\nLet's try to split this into two common ammonium salts:\n*   Ammonium nitrate: NH₄NO₃, which has the formula N₂H₄O₃.\n*   Ammonium nitrite: NH₄NO₂, which has the formula N₂H₄O₂.\n\nLet's check if these two salts add up to our overall formula:\n(N₂H₄O₃) + (N₂H₄O₂) = N₄H₈O₅.\nThis is a perfect match. So, salts A and B are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Number of atoms = 2 (N) + 4 (H) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B)**\n    *   Total = 9 + 8 = 17 atoms.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
