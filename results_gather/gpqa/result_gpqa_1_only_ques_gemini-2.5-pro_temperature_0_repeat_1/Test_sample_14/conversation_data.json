    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine which planet has the higher transit probability.\n\n1.  **Transit Probability Formula:** The geometric probability of a planet transiting its host star ($p_{tr}$) is given by the ratio of the star's radius ($R_s$) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis ($a$). For a circular orbit, the orbital distance is always equal to the semi-major axis.\n    $p_{tr} = R_s / a$\n\n2.  **Ratio of Probabilities:** We want to compare the transit probability of Planet_1 ($p_{tr1}$) to that of Planet_2 ($p_{tr2}$).\n    $p_{tr1} = R_{s1} / a_1$\n    $p_{tr2} = R_{s2} / a_2$\n\n    The ratio of the probabilities is:\n    $\\frac{p_{tr1}}{p_{tr2}} = \\frac{R_{s1} / a_1}{R_{s2} / a_2} = \\frac{R_{s1}}{R_{s2}} \\times \\frac{a_2}{a_1}$\n\n3.  **Incorporate Given Information (Stellar Radii):** The problem states that both host stars have the same radii, so $R_{s1} = R_{s2}$. This simplifies the ratio:\n    $\\frac{p_{tr1}}{p_{tr2}} = 1 \\times \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1}$\n\n    This means the ratio of the transit probabilities is the inverse of the ratio of their semi-major axes. To find which planet is more likely to transit, we need to compare their semi-major axes.\n\n4.  **Kepler's Third Law:** To find the relationship between the semi-major axes, we use Kepler's Third Law. The law relates a planet's orbital period ($P$) and semi-major axis ($a$) to the mass of its host star ($M_s$). The mass of the planet is negligible compared to the star's mass.\n    $P^2 \\propto \\frac{a^3}{M_s}$\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis, $a$:\n    $a^3 \\propto M_s P^2$\n    $a \\propto (M_s P^2)^{1/3}$\n\n5.  **Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:** Now we can find the ratio $a_2 / a_1$:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left( \\frac{M_{s2} P_2^2}{M_{s1} P_1^2} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\n6.  **Incorporate Given Information (Stellar Masses and Orbital Periods):**\n    *   The mass of Star 1 is twice that of Star 2: $M_{s1} = 2 M_{s2}$.\n    *   The period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2: $P_1 = P_2 / 3$.\n\n    Substitute these relationships into the equation for the ratio of semi-major axes:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left( \\frac{M_{s2} P_2^2}{(2 M_{s2}) (P_2 / 3)^2} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\n7.  **Simplify and Calculate:**\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left( \\frac{M_{s2} P_2^2}{2 M_{s2} (P_2^2 / 9)} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\n    The terms $M_{s2}$ and $P_2^2$ cancel out:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left( \\frac{1}{2/9} \\right)^{1/3} = \\left( \\frac{9}{2} \\right)^{1/3} = (4.5)^{1/3}$\n\n    Calculating the cube root of 4.5:\n    $(4.5)^{1/3} \\approx 1.65096$\n\n8.  **Final Conclusion:** We found that the ratio of the probabilities is equal to the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n    $\\frac{p_{tr1}}{p_{tr2}} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\approx 1.65$\n\nThis result shows that the transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
