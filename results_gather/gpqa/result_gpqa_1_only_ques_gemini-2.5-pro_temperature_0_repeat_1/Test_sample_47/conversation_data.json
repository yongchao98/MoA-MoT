    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2)**\nThis is the α-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine to form 2-bromocyclohexanone. The bromine atom substitutes one of the hydrogen atoms on a carbon adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl group. Due to the symmetry of cyclohexanone, the two alpha positions (C2 and C6) are equivalent.\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone\n*   **Reagent:** Br2\n*   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\nThis reaction is a classic example of the **Favorskii rearrangement**. An α-halo ketone treated with a strong base undergoes a ring contraction (if the starting material is a cyclic ketone). The base (OH⁻) removes a proton from the other α-carbon (C6), forming an enolate. This enolate then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the opening of the strained three-membered ring. The final product, after protonation during workup, is a carboxylic acid with a five-membered ring.\n\n*   **Reactant:** 2-bromocyclohexanone\n*   **Reagent:** NaOH, heat\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine**\nThis is a standard procedure to convert a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride (acid chloride). The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl).\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n*   **Reagent:** SOCl2, pyridine\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)3)**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a mild and bulky reducing agent. It is selective for the reduction of acyl chlorides to aldehydes. It reacts once with the acyl chloride but is not reactive enough to reduce the resulting aldehyde further to an alcohol.\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n*   **Reagent:** LiAlH(O-t-Bu)3\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\nNow we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This is equivalent to determining the number of signals in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde is a five-membered ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached.\n```\n      H(a)\n      |\n     C=O\n      |\n     C1--H(b)\n    / \\\n H2-C2 C5-H2\n   |   |\n H2-C3-C4-H2\n```\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogens, we must consider the molecule's 3D structure and symmetry. The five-membered ring is not planar and exists in puckered conformations (like envelope or twist). For analysis, we consider the most stable or highest symmetry conformation.\n\nLet's assume the molecule adopts an \"envelope\" conformation where C1 (the carbon bearing the aldehyde group) is the \"flap\" of the envelope. This conformation has a plane of symmetry (a Cₛ plane) that passes through the aldehyde proton H(a), the carbonyl group, the C1 carbon, and the hydrogen attached to it, H(b). This plane bisects the rest of the ring.\n\nDue to this plane of symmetry:\n*   C2 is chemically equivalent to C5.\n*   C3 is chemically equivalent to C4.\n\nNow let's count the sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton, H(a):** This proton is unique. It lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 set)\n2.  **The proton on C1, H(b):** This proton is also unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. (1 set)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** C2 and C5 are equivalent. However, the two protons on C2 are not equivalent to each other; they are diastereotopic. One is in an \"axial-like\" position and the other in an \"equatorial-like\" position. The axial proton on C2 is equivalent to the axial proton on C5. The equatorial proton on C2 is equivalent to the equatorial proton on C5. This gives two distinct sets of two protons each. (2 sets)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, C3 and C4 are equivalent. The two protons on C3 are diastereotopic. The axial-like proton on C3 is equivalent to the axial-like proton on C4, and the equatorial-like proton on C3 is equivalent to the equatorial-like proton on C4. This gives another two distinct sets of two protons each. (2 sets)\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen sets = 1 (from H(a)) + 1 (from H(b)) + 2 (from C2/C5) + 2 (from C3/C4) = **6**.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
