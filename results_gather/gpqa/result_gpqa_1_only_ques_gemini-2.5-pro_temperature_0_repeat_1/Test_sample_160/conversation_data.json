    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2:\n\n1.  **Understanding Mean Free Path (MFP):** The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. It is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ). The general formula is λ = 1 / (n * σ).\n\n2.  **Defining λ1 and its Collision Cross-Section:**\n    *   λ1 is the mean free path of the residual gas molecules themselves. This involves a gas molecule colliding with another gas molecule.\n    *   Let's model the gas molecules as hard spheres with a diameter 'd'. For a collision to occur between two such molecules, the distance between their centers must become equal to 'd'. The collision cross-section for this event is σ_gg = πd².\n    *   Standard kinetic theory accounts for the relative motion of all molecules, which introduces a factor of √2. The formula for the mean free path of a gas molecule among its peers is:\n        λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * πd²)\n        Here, 'n' is the number density of the gas molecules.\n\n3.  **Defining λ2 and its Collision Cross-Section:**\n    *   λ2 is the mean free path of an electron from the beam as it travels through the residual gas. This involves an electron colliding (scattering) with a gas molecule.\n    *   The electron is a subatomic particle, and its size is negligible compared to a gas molecule. We can treat it as a point particle.\n    *   The electrons in a 1000 kV TEM are moving at relativistic speeds, much faster than the thermal motion of the gas molecules. Therefore, we can consider the gas molecules to be stationary targets.\n    *   The collision cross-section for a point particle (the electron) hitting a spherical target of diameter 'd' is simply the geometrical area of the target, which is a circle of radius r = d/2.\n        σ_eg = π * (d/2)² = πd²/4\n    *   The mean free path for the electron is then:\n        λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg) = 1 / (n * πd²/4)\n\n4.  **Comparing λ1 and λ2:**\n    Now we can find the ratio of λ2 to λ1:\n    λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * πd²/4)] / [1 / (√2 * n * πd²)]\n    λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * πd²) / (n * πd²/4)\n    λ2 / λ1 = 4 * √2\n    λ2 / λ1 ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The calculation shows that λ2 is approximately 5.66 times larger than λ1.\n    *   λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1\n\n    This makes intuitive sense: a tiny, fast-moving electron (a \"bullet\") has a much smaller chance of hitting a gas molecule than another gas molecule of comparable size (a \"basketball\" hitting another \"basketball\"). Therefore, the electron travels a much longer average distance between collisions.\n\n6.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   A) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect.\n    *   B) λ2 = λ1: Incorrect.\n    *   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: Correct. Our calculated ratio of ~5.66 is significantly greater than 1.22. This option correctly reflects that the electron's mean free path is substantially longer than the gas molecule's mean free path.\n    *   D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: Incorrect. Our calculated ratio is much larger than 1.22.\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion is that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
