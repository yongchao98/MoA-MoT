    "To determine the cause of the failed protein expression, we need to analyze the provided DNA sequence. The sequence represents the coding strand (plus strand), which has the same sequence as the mRNA, with thymine (T) instead of uracil (U). Translation starts at the first ATG codon and proceeds in triplets.\n\nLet's translate the beginning of the sequence:\n\n1.  **Start Codon:** The sequence begins with `ATG`, which codes for Methionine (M). This is the initiation codon.\n2.  **HA Tag:** The problem states an N-terminal HA tag was added. The amino acid sequence for the HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. Let's see if the DNA codes for this.\n    *   `ATG` -> M (Start)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n    *   `GTT` -> Valine (V)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GCC` -> Alanine (A)\n    The sequence `ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC` correctly codes for M-YPYDVPDYA. So, the HA tag itself is correct. This rules out option A.\n\n3.  **Sequence after the HA Tag:** Let's look at the very next codons.\n    *   `AAA` -> Lysine (K)\n    *   `TGA` -> **STOP**\n\nThe sequence contains a `TGA` codon immediately after the sequence for the HA tag and one additional amino acid. `TGA` is one of the three stop codons (along with `TAA` and `TAG`) that signal the ribosome to terminate translation.\n\nTherefore, the ribosome starts translation, correctly synthesizes the HA tag and one lysine, and then immediately encounters a stop codon, terminating the process. This prevents the synthesis of the full-length GADD45G protein, explaining the experimental failure.\n\nLet's evaluate the other options:\n*   **A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** As shown above, the DNA sequence correctly codes for the HA tag. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While linkers can be important, their absence doesn't explain a complete failure to produce the protein. The primary issue here is that the full-length protein is never synthesized in the first place. This is incorrect.\n*   **C) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This statement is biologically incorrect; stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs. Furthermore, the stop codon in the sequence is TGA, not TAA. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This is precisely what happened due to the premature `TGA` stop codon in the engineered sequence.\n\nThe presence of an accidental, premature stop codon is the reason for the failed expression.\n\n<<<D>>>"
