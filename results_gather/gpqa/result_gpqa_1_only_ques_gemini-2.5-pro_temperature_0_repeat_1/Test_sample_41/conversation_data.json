    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Radius**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates. The formula for equilibrium temperature is:\n\n$T_{eq} = \\left[ \\frac{L_{star} (1 - A)}{16 \\pi \\sigma a^2} \\right]^{1/4}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $L_{star}$ is the luminosity of the star.\n*   $A$ is the planet's albedo.\n*   $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the orbit (the orbital radius for a circular orbit).\n\nSince $L_{star}$, $A$, and $\\sigma$ are the same for all three planets, we can see the relationship between $T_{eq}$ and $a$:\n\n$T_{eq}^4 \\propto \\frac{1}{a^2}$\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\left( \\frac{1}{a^2} \\right)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{a^{1/2}}$\n\nThis means the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital radius.\n\n**2. Understand the relationship between Orbital Period and Orbital Radius**\n\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion relates the orbital period ($P$) to the semi-major axis ($a$):\n\n$P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\n(This assumes the mass of the planets is negligible compared to the mass of the star, which is a standard and safe assumption in this context. The information about planet masses is extraneous.)\n\nFrom this, we can say:\n\n$P \\propto a^{3/2}$\n\n**3. Combine the two relationships to relate Orbital Period and Temperature**\n\nWe have two key relationships:\n1.  From Temperature: $a \\propto \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^2}$\n2.  From Kepler's Law: $P \\propto a^{3/2}$\n\nNow, substitute the expression for $a$ from the first relationship into the second one:\n\n$P \\propto \\left( \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^2} \\right)^{3/2}$\n$P \\propto \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^{(2 \\cdot 3/2)}}$\n$P \\propto \\frac{1}{T_{eq}^3}$\n\nThis crucial result shows that the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature.\n\n**4. Calculate the final ratio**\n\nWe need to find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, which is the ratio $P_3 / P_1$.\n\nUsing the relationship we just derived ($P \\propto 1/T_{eq}^3$):\n\n$\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq3}} \\right)^3$\n\nWe are given the temperature ratios:\n*   $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} \\approx 1.4$\n*   $\\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} \\approx 2.3$\n\nWe can find the ratio $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq3}}$ by multiplying the two given ratios:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq3}} = \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} \\times \\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} \\approx 1.4 \\times 2.3 = 3.22$\n\nNow, substitute this value back into the period ratio equation:\n\n$\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (3.22)^3 \\approx 33.386$\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4.\n\nTherefore, the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of about 33.4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
