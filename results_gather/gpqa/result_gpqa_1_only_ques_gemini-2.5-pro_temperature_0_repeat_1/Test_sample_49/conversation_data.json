    "This is a classic problem in quantum field theory (QFT) that can be solved by understanding the structure of loop calculations.\n\nThe key to determining the number of loops lies in the factor of `1/(4pi)`. In QFT calculations, particularly when using dimensional regularization in four-dimensional spacetime, each loop integral in a Feynman diagram contributes a characteristic factor of `1/(4pi)^2` to the final expression for the amplitude.\n\nLet's denote the number of loops in the diagram by `L`. The total factor arising from these loops will be:\n\n`(1/(4pi)^2)^L = 1/(4pi)^(2L)`\n\nNow, let's examine the expression found on your colleague's note:\n\n`alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\nThe other terms in this expression represent:\n*   `alpha^3 * g^2`: Powers of the theory's coupling constants, related to the number of vertices in the diagram.\n*   `sqrt(2) * 8`: Numerical factors arising from symmetry, traces, or group theory.\n*   `(Q/M)^2`: A ratio of energy scales, which typically comes from the evaluation of the integrals and logarithms like `log(Q^2/M^2)`.\n\nThe crucial term for our purpose is `1/(4pi)^6`. We can equate this to the general formula for an L-loop diagram:\n\n`1/(4pi)^(2L) = 1/(4pi)^6`\n\nBy comparing the exponents, we get a simple equation:\n\n`2L = 6`\n\nSolving for `L`, we find:\n\n`L = 3`\n\nTherefore, the Feynman diagram must have contained 3 loops.\n\n<<<D>>>"
