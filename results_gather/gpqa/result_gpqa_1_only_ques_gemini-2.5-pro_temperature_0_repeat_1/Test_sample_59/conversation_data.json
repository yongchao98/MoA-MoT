    "This problem is a classic example of time dilation, a concept from Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity. Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** We need to find the time that passes for the astronaut on the spacecraft (this is called the \"proper time,\" Δt₀).\n\n2.  **Gather Information:**\n    *   Speed of the spacecraft (v) = 0.99999987 * c\n    *   Destination: Earth. The origin is the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).\n    *   Distance to the LMC (d): This is a known astronomical value. The distance is approximately 159,000 light-years. A light-year is the distance light travels in one year.\n    *   Astronaut's age: 22 years.\n    *   Alien's average lifespan: 150 years.\n\n3.  **Calculate Time in Earth's Reference Frame (Δt):**\n    First, let's calculate how long the journey would take from the perspective of an observer on Earth.\n    *   Time = Distance / Speed\n    *   Δt = 159,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * c)\n    *   Since a light-year is c * 1 year, the 'c' cancels out.\n    *   Δt = 159,000 years / 0.99999987 ≈ 159,000.02 years.\n    So, from Earth, the journey takes just over 159,000 years.\n\n4.  **Apply the Time Dilation Formula:**\n    Time dilation describes how time passes slower for a moving object relative to a stationary observer. The formula is:\n    Δt = γ * Δt₀\n    Where:\n    *   Δt is the time for the stationary observer (on Earth).\n    *   Δt₀ is the proper time for the moving observer (the astronaut).\n    *   γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as: γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   v/c = 0.99999987\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.99999987²)\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.99999974)\n    *   γ = 1 / √0.00000026\n    *   γ ≈ 1 / 0.0005099\n    *   γ ≈ 1961.16\n\n6.  **Calculate the Astronaut's Time (Δt₀):**\n    Now we can rearrange the time dilation formula to solve for the astronaut's time:\n    *   Δt₀ = Δt / γ\n    *   Δt₀ = 159,000.02 years / 1961.16\n    *   Δt₀ ≈ 81.07 years\n\n7.  **Check for Survival:**\n    The journey will take about 81 years from the astronaut's perspective.\n    *   The astronaut is 22 years old.\n    *   The astronaut's remaining lifespan is 150 - 22 = 128 years.\n    *   Since 81 years is less than 128 years, the astronaut will survive the trip and arrive on Earth at the age of 22 + 81 = 103 years old.\n\nTherefore, the journey will take approximately 81 years for the astronaut.\n\n<<<D>>>"
