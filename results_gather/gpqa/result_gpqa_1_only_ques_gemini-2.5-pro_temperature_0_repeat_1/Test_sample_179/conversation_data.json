    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Goal**\n\nThe system consists of 13 identical particles, each with charge `q = 2e`.\n*   One particle (`q_c`) is fixed at a point P.\n*   The other 12 particles (`q_s`) are constrained to lie on the surface of a sphere of radius `R = 2 m` centered at P.\n*   The goal is to find the minimum total electrostatic potential energy of this isolated system.\n\n**2. Formulate the Total Potential Energy**\n\nThe total potential energy (`U_total`) of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of all unique pairs of charges. We can split this into two parts:\n1.  `U_center-sphere`: The energy from the interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n2.  `U_sphere-sphere`: The energy from the interactions among the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\n`U_total = U_center-sphere + U_sphere-sphere`\n\n**3. Calculate `U_center-sphere`**\n\nEach of the 12 sphere charges is at a fixed distance `R` from the central charge. The potential energy between the central charge `q_c` and one sphere charge `q_s` is `k * q_c * q_s / R`. Since there are 12 such charges, this part of the energy is:\n`U_center-sphere = 12 * (k * q_c * q_s / R)`\nSince all charges are identical (`q_c = q_s = q = 2e`), this becomes:\n`U_center-sphere = 12 * (k * q^2 / R)`\n\nThis energy component is constant regardless of how the 12 charges are arranged on the sphere.\n\n**4. Calculate `U_sphere-sphere` (The Minimum Energy Configuration)**\n\nTo find the minimum total energy of the system, we need to find the arrangement of the 12 sphere charges that minimizes their mutual potential energy, `U_sphere-sphere`. This is a classic problem known as the **Thomson problem**.\n\nFor `N = 12` charges on the surface of a sphere, the minimum energy configuration is achieved when the charges are located at the vertices of a regular **icosahedron** inscribed in the sphere. This arrangement maximizes the distance between the charges.\n\nThe potential energy `U_sphere-sphere` is the sum of the potential energies of all pairs of charges on the sphere. There are `12 * 11 / 2 = 66` such pairs.\n`U_sphere-sphere = Σ_{1≤i<j≤12} (k * q^2 / r_ij)`\nwhere `r_ij` is the distance between charge `i` and charge `j`.\n\nFor an icosahedron, there are three distinct distances between vertices:\n*   `d1`: The edge length. Each vertex has 5 adjacent vertices at this distance. There are `12 * 5 / 2 = 30` such pairs (edges).\n*   `d2`: The distance to the next-nearest vertices. Each vertex has 5 such neighbors. There are `12 * 5 / 2 = 30` such pairs.\n*   `d3`: The distance to the antipodal vertex, which is the diameter of the sphere. `d3 = 2R`. Each vertex has 1 antipodal vertex. There are `12 / 2 = 6` such pairs.\n\nThe energy is therefore:\n`U_sphere-sphere = 30 * (k * q^2 / d1) + 30 * (k * q^2 / d2) + 6 * (k * q^2 / d3)`\n\nThe distances `d1` and `d2` for an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius `R` are known to be:\n`d1^2 = 2R^2 * (1 - 1/√5)`\n`d2^2 = 2R^2 * (1 + 1/√5)`\n\nIt is more convenient to express the energy as:\n`U_sphere-sphere = (k * q^2 / R) * E(12)`\nwhere `E(12)` is a dimensionless constant representing the sum of inverse chord lengths (`R/r_ij`).\n`E(12) = 30*(R/d1) + 30*(R/d2) + 6*(R/d3)`\nThrough geometric calculation (as detailed in advanced electrostatics or solid-state physics texts), this sum evaluates to:\n`E(12) = 15 * √(5 + 2√5) + 3`\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Energy**\n\nNow, combine the two energy components:\n`U_total = U_center-sphere + U_sphere-sphere`\n`U_total = 12 * (k * q^2 / R) + (k * q^2 / R) * E(12)`\n`U_total = (k * q^2 / R) * (12 + E(12))`\n`U_total = (k * q^2 / R) * (12 + 15 * √(5 + 2√5) + 3)`\n`U_total = (k * q^2 / R) * (15 + 15 * √(5 + 2√5))`\n\n**6. Substitute Numerical Values**\n\n*   Coulomb's constant, `k ≈ 8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2`\n*   Elementary charge, `e ≈ 1.602177 × 10^-19 C`\n*   Charge of each particle, `q = 2e = 2 * 1.602177 × 10^-19 C = 3.204354 × 10^-19 C`\n*   Radius, `R = 2 m`\n\nFirst, calculate the energy unit `k * q^2 / R`:\n`q^2 = (3.204354 × 10^-19)^2 ≈ 1.026788 × 10^-37 C^2`\n`k * q^2 / R = (8.98755 × 10^9 * 1.026788 × 10^-37) / 2`\n`k * q^2 / R ≈ 4.6143 × 10^-28 J`\n\nNext, calculate the dimensionless factor `(15 + 15 * √(5 + 2√5))`:\n`√5 ≈ 2.23607`\n`√(5 + 2√5) ≈ √(5 + 4.47214) = √9.47214 ≈ 3.07768`\n`15 + 15 * 3.07768 = 15 + 46.1652 = 61.1652`\n\nFinally, calculate the total energy:\n`U_total ≈ (4.6143 × 10^-28 J) * 61.1652`\n`U_total ≈ 28.2215 × 10^-27 J`\n`U_total ≈ 2.82215 × 10^-26 J`\n\nRounding to three decimals as requested by the format of the options:\n`U_total ≈ 2.822 × 10^-26 J`\n\nThis value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
