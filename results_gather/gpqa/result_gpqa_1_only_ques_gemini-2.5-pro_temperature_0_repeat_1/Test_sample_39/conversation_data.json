    "This is a common piece of slang used by organic chemists. The phrase \"on top of each other\" almost always refers to the results of a chromatography experiment, most commonly Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) or column chromatography.\n\nIn these techniques, compounds are separated based on their differential affinity for a stationary phase (like silica gel) and a mobile phase (a solvent). This affinity is primarily determined by the compound's **polarity**.\n\n*   If two compounds have very **different polarities**, they will travel at different rates during chromatography, leading to good separation. On a TLC plate, this would look like two distinct spots at different heights.\n*   If two compounds have very **similar polarities**, they will travel at nearly the same rate. On a TLC plate, their spots will overlap or merge into a single, elongated spot. This is what chemists mean when they say the compounds are \"on top of each other.\" It signifies a failed or very difficult separation.\n\nLet's look at the other options:\n*   **B) Similar optical rotations:** This relates to stereochemistry and is measured by a polarimeter. It doesn't directly cause separation issues in standard chromatography.\n*   **C) Non-covalent interactions:** While these interactions contribute to a molecule's overall polarity, the direct cause of the separation problem is the resulting similar polarity, not the interactions themselves.\n*   **D) Similar boiling points:** This would make separation by distillation difficult, but the phrase \"on top of each other\" is a visual metaphor that strongly points to chromatography.\n\nTherefore, the chemist is lamenting that their desired product and some impurity (like a starting material or a byproduct) have very similar polarities, making them very difficult to separate using chromatography.\n\n<<<A>>>"
