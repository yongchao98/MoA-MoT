    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of Radioactive Decay**\n\nRadioactive decay is a random, memoryless process. This is a crucial concept. \"Memoryless\" means that the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval does not depend on how long it has already existed without decaying. The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future behavior.\n\nTherefore, the problem simplifies to: What is the probability that this type of atom will decay within any 150-minute interval?\n\n**2. Model the Decay Mathematically**\n\nThe probability of an atom surviving for a time `t` is given by the exponential decay formula:\nP(survival, t) = e^(-λt)\n\nWhere:\n*   `λ` (lambda) is the decay constant, a value specific to the type of atom.\n*   `t` is the time interval.\n\nThe probability of an atom decaying within a time `t` is:\nP(decay, t) = 1 - P(survival, t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n**3. Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant (λ)**\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\nP(decay, 100) = 0.32\n1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n\nFrom this, we can find the probability of survival for 100 minutes:\ne^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32\ne^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\nWe don't need to calculate the exact value of `λ` yet. This relationship is sufficient.\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability for the New Time Interval**\n\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. As established in Step 1, this is equivalent to finding the probability of decay for any 150-minute interval.\nP(decay, 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nWe can find the value of `e^(-λ * 150)` by using the relationship we found in Step 3:\ne^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5\n\nNow, substitute the value from Step 3:\ne^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5\n\nLet's calculate this value:\n(0.68)^1.5 = (0.68) * √(0.68) ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607\n\nThis is the probability of the atom *surviving* for 150 minutes.\n\n**5. Find the Final Answer**\n\nThe probability of the atom *decaying* in 150 minutes is:\nP(decay, 150) = 1 - P(survival, 150)\nP(decay, 150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607\nP(decay, 150) ≈ 0.4393\n\nConverting this to a percentage, we get 43.93%, which is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>"
