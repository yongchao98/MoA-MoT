    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state and the measurement:**\n    *   The initial state of the two-electron system is the coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   This state is an eigenstate of the total orbital angular momentum operator $L^2$ and its z-component $L_z$.\n    *   The quantum number for the z-component of the total angular momentum is $m = -1$.\n    *   The measurement being performed is on the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum for each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n\n2.  **Relate the total and individual angular momentum components:**\n    *   The total z-component of the angular momentum, $L_z$, is the sum of the individual components: $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   The corresponding quantum numbers are related by the sum: $m = m_1 + m_2$. Here, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the magnetic quantum numbers for electron 1 and electron 2, respectively.\n\n3.  **Analyze the initial state:**\n    *   The given state $|l=2, m=-1>$ is an eigenstate of the operator $L_z$ with a definite eigenvalue of $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n    *   This means that if we were to measure the total z-component of angular momentum, we would get the value $-1\\hbar$ with 100% certainty.\n\n4.  **Analyze the desired measurement outcome:**\n    *   We want to find the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ as $-\\hbar$ AND the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $m_1\\hbar$. For the eigenvalue to be $-\\hbar$, we must have $m_1 = -1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $m_2\\hbar$. For the eigenvalue to be $-\\hbar$, we must have $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   So, we are looking for the probability of the outcome where $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, -1)$.\n\n5.  **Apply the conservation principle (selection rule):**\n    *   For any possible outcome of measuring $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, the sum of the quantum numbers $m_1 + m_2$ must equal the total magnetic quantum number $m$ of the initial state.\n    *   In our case, the initial state has $m = -1$.\n    *   The desired outcome has $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Let's check the sum for the desired outcome: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Since the sum for the desired outcome ($m_1+m_2 = -2$) is not equal to the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state ($m = -1$), this outcome is forbidden.\n\n6.  **Formal Calculation using Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:**\n    *   The probability of measuring the state to be in the uncoupled state $|l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2>$ is given by the square of the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficient:\n        $P(m_1, m_2) = |\\langle l_1, m_1; l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle|^2$\n    *   We want to find the probability for $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n        $P(m_1=-1, m_2=-1) = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$\n    *   A fundamental property (selection rule) of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is that they are zero unless $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    *   Here, $m = -1$ and $m_1 + m_2 = -2$. Since $-1 \\neq -2$, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ is zero.\n    *   Therefore, the probability is $0^2 = 0$.\n\nConclusion: The measurement outcome where both electrons have a z-component of angular momentum of $-\\hbar$ is physically impossible for a system in the state $|l=2, m=-1>$. The probability of this event is 0.\n\n<<<D>>>"
