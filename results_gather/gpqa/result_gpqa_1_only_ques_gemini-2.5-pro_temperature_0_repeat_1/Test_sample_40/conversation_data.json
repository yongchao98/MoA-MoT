    "This problem requires the use of the relativistic velocity addition formula, as we are dealing with speeds that can be close to the speed of light.\n\nLet's define our frames of reference:\n1.  **The Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the observer's stationary frame.\n2.  **The Glass Frame (S'):** This is the frame of reference moving along with the glass.\n\nNow, let's define the velocities:\n*   **v:** The velocity of the glass frame (S') relative to the laboratory frame (S). The problem states the glass is moving at a constant velocity `v`.\n*   **u':** The speed of the light beam as measured within the glass frame (S'). The index of refraction `n` is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`). So, `n = c / u'`. Since we are given `c=1`, the speed of light in the glass, relative to the glass, is `u' = 1/n`.\n*   **u:** The speed of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame (S). This is the value we need to find.\n\nThe relativistic velocity addition formula for objects moving in the same direction is:\n`u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v / c^2)`\n\nNow, we substitute the values we know into this formula:\n*   `u' = 1/n`\n*   `v = v`\n*   `c = 1`\n\n`u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n) * v / 1^2 )`\n\nLet's simplify this expression:\n`u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\nTo eliminate the fractions within the main fraction, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n`u = n * ( (1/n) + v ) / n * ( 1 + v/n )`\n`u = ( n*(1/n) + n*v ) / ( n*1 + n*(v/n) )`\n`u = ( 1 + n*v ) / ( n + v )`\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
