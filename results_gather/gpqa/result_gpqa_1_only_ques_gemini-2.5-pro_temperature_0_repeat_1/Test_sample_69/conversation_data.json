    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to identify the compounds and solve the puzzle.\n\n1.  **Identify B, D, and H:**\n    *   Clue 4 states: \"D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\" Both B and D are gases.\n    *   A well-known reaction between two common gases that forms a liquid solvent is the synthesis of phosgene:\n        CO(g) + Cl₂(g) → COCl₂(l)\n    *   Phosgene (COCl₂) is a liquid (boiling point 8 °C) and can be used as a solvent in organic chemistry.\n    *   This allows us to tentatively identify H as phosgene (COCl₂), and the pair {B, D} as {CO, Cl₂}.\n\n2.  **Identify A, C, F, and G:**\n    *   We have two possibilities for B and D. Let's test them.\n    *   **Case 1: B = CO and D = Cl₂.**\n        *   Clue 1: A(s) + 8CO(g) → C(red). C would be a metal carbonyl.\n        *   Clue 2: C + H₂O → A + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid). The hydrolysis of metal carbonyls does not typically produce two different acids. This case is unlikely.\n    *   **Case 2: B = Cl₂ and D = CO.**\n        *   Clue 1: A(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → C(red).\n        *   Let's consider what solid A could be. Sulfur exists as a solid, S₈. The reaction of sulfur with chlorine is:\n            S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l)\n        *   This reaction fits the 1:8 stoichiometry if we interpret \"product C\" as the substance SCl₂, even though 8 moles are formed. Sulfur dichloride (SCl₂) is a cherry-red liquid. This is a very good match for C.\n        *   So, let's assume: **A = S₈**, **B = Cl₂**, and **C = SCl₂**.\n        *   Clue 2: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G.\n        *   Let's check the hydrolysis of SCl₂:\n            2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → SO₂ + 4HCl + S(s)\n        *   This reaction reforms elemental sulfur (A). It produces hydrochloric acid (HCl), which is a strong acid (F). It also produces sulfur dioxide (SO₂), which dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃), a weak acid (G).\n        *   This fits perfectly. **F = HCl** and **G = H₂SO₃**.\n\n3.  **Identify E:**\n    *   We have identified:\n        *   C = SCl₂ (sulfur dichloride)\n        *   D = CO (carbon monoxide)\n    *   Clue 3 states: \"C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces the extremely hazardous product E.\"\n    *   The reaction is: SCl₂ + 2CO → E\n    *   Let's consider a plausible reaction. A balanced chemical equation is:\n        SCl₂ + 2CO → CSCl₂ + CO₂\n    *   This reaction produces thiophosgene (CSCl₂) and carbon dioxide. Thiophosgene is an extremely hazardous and toxic substance, fitting the description of E.\n    *   Therefore, **E = CSCl₂** (thiophosgene).\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E:**\n    *   The final step is to determine the point group of E = CSCl₂.\n    *   Thiophosgene has a planar trigonal structure, similar to phosgene. The carbon atom is central, double-bonded to the sulfur atom and single-bonded to the two chlorine atoms.\n        ```\n           Cl\n            \\\n             C = S\n            /\n           Cl\n        ```\n    *   The molecule has the following symmetry elements:\n        *   A C₂ rotation axis that passes through the C=S bond.\n        *   A mirror plane (σᵥ) that contains all the atoms (the molecular plane).\n        *   A second mirror plane (σᵥ') that is perpendicular to the molecular plane and contains the C₂ axis.\n    *   A molecule with a C₂ axis and two perpendicular mirror planes containing the axis belongs to the **C₂ᵥ** point group.\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of E (CSCl₂) is C₂ᵥ.\n\n<<<A>>>"
