    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics**\n\nThe brightness of a star is determined by its temperature and surface area. The Stefan-Boltzmann law states that the flux (F) of energy radiated per unit area by a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its effective temperature (T):\nF = σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nThe problem involves two scenarios that cause a dip in the observed brightness of the star:\n*   **Rotational Modulation:** The star has a cool, dark, spotty hemisphere. As the star rotates, we see this hemisphere, causing the total observed brightness to decrease.\n*   **Exoplanet Transit:** A hypothetical planet passes in front of an unspotted star, blocking a fraction of its light.\n\nWe need to find the size of the planet (relative to the star) that would cause the same brightness dip as the starspots.\n\n**2. Calculate the Brightness Variation due to Starspots**\n\nLet's define the maximum and minimum flux observed from the star.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere (temperature T_eff) is facing the observer. The observed flux is proportional to the star's temperature raised to the fourth power.\n    F_max ∝ T_eff⁴\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotty hemisphere is facing the observer. This hemisphere has a fraction `f` (the filling factor) of its area covered by spots at temperature T_spot, and the remaining fraction `(1-f)` is at the normal photospheric temperature T_eff. The total flux is a weighted average.\n    F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴\n\nThe amplitude of the signal is the relative drop in flux:\nAmplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n\nSubstituting the expressions for flux:\nAmplitude = (T_eff⁴ - [(1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]) / T_eff⁴\nAmplitude = (T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴\nAmplitude = (f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴\nAmplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)\n\n**3. Calculate the Brightness Variation due to an Exoplanet Transit**\n\nWhen a planet transits a star, it blocks an amount of light proportional to its area. The depth of the transit (the amplitude of the signal) is the ratio of the planet's disk area to the star's disk area.\nTransit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star)\nTransit Depth = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²)\nTransit Depth = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n**4. Equate the Amplitudes and Solve**\n\nThe problem states that the two signals have the same amplitude. Therefore, we can set the transit depth equal to the spot modulation amplitude.\n(R_pl / R_star)² = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values:\n*   Star's effective temperature, T_eff = 6000 K\n*   Spot temperature, T_spot = T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K\n*   Spot filling factor, f = 20% = 0.20\n\n(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)\n(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)\n(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.20 * (1 - 625 / 1296)\n(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.20 * ((1296 - 625) / 1296)\n(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.20 * (671 / 1296)\n(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.20 * 0.51775\n(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355\n\nTo find the radius ratio, we take the square root:\nR_pl / R_star = √0.10355\nR_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nComparing our result to the given options:\nA) ~0.11\nB) ~0.39\nC) ~0.07\nD) ~0.32\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
