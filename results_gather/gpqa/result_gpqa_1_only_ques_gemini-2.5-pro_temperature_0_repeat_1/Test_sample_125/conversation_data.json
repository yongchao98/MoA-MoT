    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of peaks in each chromatogram.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the products of Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with one stereocenter at the C5 position.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3`\n    *   The stereocenter at C5 has the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** The reduction of the ketone at C3 creates a new stereocenter. The carbonyl carbon is prochiral, and the hydride nucleophile can attack from either face. The original stereocenter at C5 is not affected by the reaction.\n    *   Attack from one face will yield (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n    *   Attack from the other face will yield (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n*   **Relationship between Products:** The two products, (3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S), have the same connectivity but differ in the configuration at one stereocenter (C3) while having the same configuration at another (C5). Therefore, they are **diastereomers**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the products of Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is an achiral molecule.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3`\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. The excess NaBH4 will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** The product, pentane-2,4-diol, has two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n    *   Structure: `CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3`\n    *   Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, the overall mixture of products must be achiral.\n    *   The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   The molecule is symmetric. Let's analyze the isomers:\n        *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material, they will be produced in equal amounts, forming a racemic mixture.\n        *   (2R, 4S) is identical to (2S, 4R). This isomer has an internal plane of symmetry in one of its conformations and is an achiral **meso compound**.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: a racemic pair of enantiomers ((Â±)-pentane-2,4-diol) and a meso compound (meso-pentane-2,4-diol). The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC is an **achiral** separation technique. It separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated**. They will elute together as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** and **constitutional isomers** have different physical properties and **can be separated**.\n*   Let's count the separable species in the combined mixture:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Rxn I)\n    3.  The racemic mixture of (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n    4.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Rxn II)\n*   Species 1 and 2 are diastereomers, so they will separate into **two peaks**.\n*   Species 3 (the enantiomeric pair) will elute as **one peak**.\n*   Species 4 (the meso compound) is a diastereomer of the compounds in species 3, so it will be separated from them, giving **one peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C7 ethers/alcohols) are constitutional isomers of the products from Reaction II (C5 diols), so they are structurally very different and will have different retention times.\n*   Total peaks = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the combined mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\n*   Chiral HPLC uses a **chiral** stationary phase. This chiral environment allows for the separation of **enantiomers**, in addition to diastereomers and constitutional isomers.\n*   Essentially, a chiral column can separate all stereoisomers that are not identical.\n*   Let's count the distinct stereoisomers in the mixture:\n    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   All five of these are distinct chemical compounds. The chiral column can differentiate between the enantiomers (3 and 4) as well as all the diastereomeric and constitutional relationships.\n*   Therefore, we expect to see a separate peak for each of the five stereoisomers.\n*   Total peaks = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Summary**\n\n*   **Normal-Phase HPLC:** 4 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
