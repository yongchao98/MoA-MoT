    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions ($PO_4^{3-}$).\n\n**1. Identify the components and their roles:**\nThe solution contains KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O.\n*   KH₂PO₄ dissociates into K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻ (dihydrogen phosphate). H₂PO₄⁻ is the weak acid in our buffer system.\n*   Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O dissociates into 2Na⁺, HPO₄²⁻ (hydrogen phosphate), and water. HPO₄²⁻ is the conjugate base in our buffer system.\n*   The pair H₂PO₄⁻ / HPO₄²⁻ constitutes a buffer that will determine the pH of the solution. This corresponds to the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄), so we will use Ka₂.\n\n**2. Calculate the molar concentrations of the buffer components:**\n*   Volume of the solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L\n*   Molar mass of KH₂PO₄ = 136.09 g/mol\n*   Molar mass of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = 177.99 g/mol\n\n*   Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄):\n    Moles = mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n*   Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻, [H₂PO₄⁻]:\n    [H₂PO₄⁻] = moles / volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n\n*   Moles of HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O):\n    Moles = mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n*   Concentration of HPO₄²⁻, [HPO₄²⁻]:\n    [HPO₄²⁻] = moles / volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**3. Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] in the buffer:**\nThe relevant equilibrium is the one involving the buffer pair:\nH₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸.\n\nThe expression for Ka₂ is:\nKa₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]:\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n[H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (1.308)\n[H⁺] = 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**4. Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO₄³⁻]:**\nThe orthophosphate ion ($PO_4^{3-}$) is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻):\nHPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹².\n\nThe expression for Ka₃ is:\nKa₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO₄³⁻]:\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n\nNow, we plug in the values we have calculated:\n*   Ka₃ = 1.8 x 10⁻¹²\n*   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.02809 M (we assume its concentration is not significantly changed by this minor dissociation)\n*   [H⁺] = 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M (determined by the buffer)\n\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] = 6.235 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n**5. Compare with the given options:**\nThe calculated value is 6.235 x 10⁻⁷ M, which rounds to 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
