    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The formula for DoU is C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5.\n*   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) plus one additional double bond (e.g., a C=O group).\n\n**2. Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** This pair of medium-to-strong bands is characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl region and is typical for the C=O stretch of an ester.\n\n**3. Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl (-CH₃) group.\n    *   **Splitting (t, triplet):** According to the n+1 rule, this methyl group is adjacent to a methylene (-CH₂-) group (2+1=3 peaks).\n    *   This signal is the -CH₃ part of an ethyl group.\n\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents a methylene (-CH₂-) group.\n    *   **Splitting (q, quartet):** This methylene group is adjacent to a methyl (-CH₃) group (3+1=4 peaks).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (4.5 ppm):** This is a very downfield shift for a methylene group, indicating it is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂-).\n    *   Together, the signals at 1.20 ppm and 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an **ethyl ester** fragment (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (2H):** Represents two protons.\n    *   **Splitting (bs, broad singlet):** Broad signals are typical for exchangeable protons, such as those on an -OH or -NH group.\n    *   This signal corresponds to the two protons of the primary amine (-NH₂) group identified in the IR spectrum.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   **Integration (4H total):** Four protons in the aromatic region.\n    *   **Splitting Pattern:** Two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**.\n    *   The protons at 8.0 ppm are more deshielded (further downfield) because they are ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group.\n    *   The protons at 7.0 ppm are more shielded (further upfield) because they are ortho to the electron-donating amine group.\n\n**4. Assemble the Structure and Evaluate the Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, the molecule contains:\n*   A para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂).\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\nPutting these pieces together gives the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check the given options:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure matches all the data perfectly.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer, but it has a propionyl group (CH₃CH₂CO-), not an ethyl ester. The NMR would show a quartet for the CH₂ next to the C=O at a much lower chemical shift (~2.4 ppm), not 4.5 ppm.\n*   **C) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This is a meta-substituted ring, which would give a more complex NMR splitting pattern, not two doublets. Also, the C=O of an amide is typically at a lower frequency (~1680 cm⁻¹) than the observed 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide (-NH-), which would show only one N-H stretch in the IR, not the two observed for a primary amine.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
