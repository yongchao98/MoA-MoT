    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Initial and Final States**\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of mass M is at rest.\n    *   Its rest-mass energy is $E_0 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments, with rest-masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n    *   Fragment 1 is the more massive one: $m_1 = 2m_2$.\n    *   The sum of the final rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$.\n\n**2. Calculate the Rest-Masses of the Fragments**\n\nWe have a system of two equations for the fragment masses:\n1.  $m_1 = 2m_2$\n2.  $m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n$2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M$\n$3m_2 = 0.99M \\implies m_2 = 0.33M$\n\nNow find $m_1$:\n$m_1 = 2m_2 = 2(0.33M) = 0.66M$\n\nWe can express their rest-mass energies in GeV:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (1): $m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (2): $m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation Laws**\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The initial energy ($Mc^2$) is converted into the rest-mass energy of the fragments plus their kinetic energies ($T_1$ and $T_2$). The total kinetic energy released, known as the Q-value, is:\n    $Q = T_1 + T_2 = E_{initial} - E_{final, rest}$\n    $Q = Mc^2 - (m_1c^2 + m_2c^2)$\n    $Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - (198 \\text{ GeV} + 99 \\text{ GeV})$\n    $Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial nucleus is at rest, so its momentum is zero. The two fragments must fly apart with equal and opposite momenta.\n    $\\vec{p}_1 + \\vec{p}_2 = 0 \\implies \\vec{p}_1 = -\\vec{p}_2$\n    This means their momentum magnitudes are equal: $p_1 = p_2 = p$.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is $T = p^2 / (2m)$.\n*   $T_1 = p^2 / (2m_1)$\n*   $T_2 = p^2 / (2m_2)$\n\nFrom these equations, we see that $T_1 m_1 = T_2 m_2$. Since $m_1 = 2m_2$, it follows that $T_1 (2m_2) = T_2 m_2$, which simplifies to $T_2 = 2T_1$.\n\nNow use the total kinetic energy equation:\n$T_1 + T_2 = Q$\n$T_1 + 2T_1 = Q$\n$3T_1 = Q$\n$T_{1, class} = Q/3 = 3 \\text{ GeV} / 3 = 1 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nSo, the classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is $T_{1, class} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**5. Calculate T1 using Relativistic Mechanics (Correct Value)**\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$. The kinetic energy is $T = E - mc^2$.\nRearranging the energy-momentum relation gives:\n$(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2 = (T + mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2 = T^2 + 2Tmc^2$.\n\nSince $p_1 = p_2$, we have $(p_1c)^2 = (p_2c)^2$:\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = T_2^2 + 2T_2(m_2c^2)$\n\nWe also know $T_2 = Q - T_1$. Substitute this into the equation:\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = (Q - T_1)^2 + 2(Q - T_1)(m_2c^2)$\n$T_1^2 + 2T_1(m_1c^2) = Q^2 - 2QT_1 + T_1^2 + 2Q(m_2c^2) - 2T_1(m_2c^2)$\n\nCancel $T_1^2$ from both sides and group the terms with $T_1$:\n$2T_1(m_1c^2) + 2QT_1 + 2T_1(m_2c^2) = Q^2 + 2Q(m_2c^2)$\n$T_1 [2(m_1c^2 + m_2c^2) + 2Q] = Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)$\n\nNote that $m_1c^2 + m_2c^2 + Q = 297 \\text{ GeV} + 3 \\text{ GeV} = 300 \\text{ GeV} = Mc^2$.\nSo the equation becomes:\n$T_1 [2(Mc^2)] = Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)$\n$T_{1, rel} = \\frac{Q(Q + 2m_2c^2)}{2Mc^2}$\n\nNow, plug in the values (in GeV):\n$T_{1, rel} = \\frac{3 \\text{ GeV} \\times (3 \\text{ GeV} + 2 \\times 99 \\text{ GeV})}{2 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV}}$\n$T_{1, rel} = \\frac{3 \\times (3 + 198)}{600} \\text{ GeV}$\n$T_{1, rel} = \\frac{3 \\times 201}{600} \\text{ GeV} = \\frac{603}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nThe correct (relativistic) kinetic energy is $T_{1, rel} = 1005 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe difference is the correct value minus the classical approximation:\nDifference = $T_{1, rel} - T_{1, class}$\nDifference = $1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV}$\nDifference = $5 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
