    "Answering this question requires analyzing each compound to determine if it is chiral and if it is specified as a single enantiomer (or an enantioenriched mixture). A compound is optically active if and only if it is chiral and not present as a racemic (50:50) mixture of enantiomers. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. A common way to identify an achiral molecule is to find a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)(CH2CH3)`.\n    *   This molecule has a double bond. The atoms of the double bond (C1, C2) and the atoms directly attached to them (Cl, H, C of methyl, C of ethyl) all lie in a single plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule.\n    *   Since it has a plane of symmetry, the molecule is **achiral** and therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   The name includes stereochemical descriptors (3aR, 7aS, E). This specifies a single, unique stereoisomer.\n    *   The presence of (R) and (S) descriptors indicates the presence of chiral centers. A complex molecule like this with defined chiral centers is almost certainly chiral, unless it happens to be a meso compound.\n    *   The structure is highly asymmetric and does not possess any internal symmetry elements (like a plane or center of symmetry).\n    *   Since it is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two chiral centers (C2 and C3).\n    *   The molecule has identical groups at both ends (COOH). The stereochemistry is (2R, 3S).\n    *   Let's draw the Fischer projection. For a molecule with identical ends, the R,S configuration (or S,R) corresponds to the meso form.\n        ```\n            COOH\n             |\n        H --|-- CH3  (2R)\n       CH3--|-- H    (3S)\n             |\n            COOH\n        ```\n    *   There is a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3. A compound with chiral centers and a plane of symmetry is a meso compound.\n    *   Meso compounds are **achiral** and **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The stereochemistry is (2R, 3R).\n    *   This molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. Its mirror image is the (2S, 3S) compound, and they are non-superimposable.\n    *   Therefore, the (2R, 3R) isomer is chiral. Since the name specifies a single enantiomer, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and an alcohol group. The carbon atom bearing the -OH group (C1) is a chiral center. It is bonded to four different groups: -H, -OH, -CH2-CH=, and -CH=CH-.\n    *   The molecule as a whole lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Thus, it is a chiral molecule.\n    *   The name specifies the (R) enantiomer. As a single enantiomer of a chiral compound, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The descriptors (1s, 3s, 5s) indicate that all three -OH groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   This molecule possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three vertical planes of symmetry (Ïƒv). Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH group and the opposite CH2 group.\n    *   Due to the presence of planes of symmetry, the molecule is **achiral** and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers (a carbon atom with four different substituents).\n    *   The carbon at position 3 is bonded to a hydrogen, two methyl groups (`-CH3`), and the `-CH2-C(=O)-cyclopentyl` group. Since it is bonded to two identical methyl groups, it is not a chiral center.\n    *   There are no other chiral centers in the molecule. The molecule is **achiral** and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Inactive\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-...dione: **Active**\n*   (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Inactive (meso)\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Active**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Active**\n*   (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Inactive\n*   1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Inactive\n\nThere are 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<D>>>"
