    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to find the probability.\n\n**1. Define the State Vector and the Operator**\n\nThe state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (state vector) `|ψ⟩`:\n`|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n\nThe observable is represented by the matrix operator `P`:\n`P = [[0, 1/√2, 0],`\n`     [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],`\n`     [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n\n**2. Find the Eigenvector for the Eigenvalue 0**\n\nThe possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator `P`. We are interested in the outcome `λ = 0`. To find the probability of this outcome, we first need to find the eigenvector `|E_0⟩` corresponding to this eigenvalue.\n\nThe eigenvector `|E_0⟩` satisfies the equation `P|E_0⟩ = λ|E_0⟩`. For `λ = 0`, this becomes `P|E_0⟩ = 0`.\n\nLet `|E_0⟩ = [x, y, z]^T`. Then:\n`[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]^T = [0, 0, 0]^T`\n\nThis matrix equation gives us a system of linear equations:\n1.  `(1/√2)y = 0`  => `y = 0`\n2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\n3.  `(1/√2)y = 0` (This is the same as the first equation)\n\nFrom these equations, we see that any vector of the form `[x, 0, -x]` is an eigenvector for the eigenvalue 0. We can choose a simple representative for this eigenvector, for example by setting `x=1`:\n`|E_0⟩ = [1, 0, -1]^T`\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability**\n\nThe probability `Prob(λ)` of measuring an eigenvalue `λ` for a system in state `|ψ⟩` is given by the formula:\n\n`Prob(λ) = |⟨E_λ|ψ⟩|^2 / (⟨E_λ|E_λ⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `⟨E_λ|ψ⟩` is the inner product of the eigenvector and the state vector.\n*   `⟨E_λ|E_λ⟩` is the squared norm of the eigenvector.\n*   `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` is the squared norm of the state vector (this is for normalization).\n\nLet's calculate each term for `λ = 0`:\n\n*   **Calculate `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`:**\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1] * [-1, 2, 1]^T = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n\n*   **Calculate `⟨E_0|E_0⟩`:**\n    `⟨E_0|E_0⟩ = [1, 0, -1] * [1, 0, -1]^T = 1² + 0² + (-1)² = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`\n\n*   **Calculate `⟨E_0|ψ⟩`:**\n    `⟨E_0|ψ⟩ = [1, 0, -1] * [-1, 2, 1]^T = (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) = -1 + 0 - 1 = -2`\n\n*   **Calculate `|⟨E_0|ψ⟩|²`:**\n    `|⟨E_0|ψ⟩|² = (-2)² = 4`\n\nNow, substitute these values back into the probability formula:\n\n`Prob(0) = 4 / (2 * 6) = 4 / 12 = 1/3`\n\nThe probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 is 1/3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
