  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s).

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results to determine the relationship between the genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n**1. Analyze the Single Mutants**\n\n*   **Wild-type (WT):** 100% resistance (our baseline).\n*   **g1 mutant:** 75% resistance. The loss of G1 function causes a partial loss of resistance (25% loss). This gene contributes to resistance but is not essential on its own.\n*   **g2 mutant:** 0% resistance. The loss of G2 function completely eliminates resistance. This indicates that G2 is an essential gene for this resistance pathway.\n*   **g3 mutant:** 50% resistance. The loss of G3 function causes a significant loss of resistance (50% loss), more than G1.\n\n**2. Analyze the Double Mutants to Determine Epistasis**\n\nEpistasis occurs when the effect of one gene's mutation masks the effect of another. The phenotype of the double mutant will resemble the phenotype of the epistatic (masking) gene's single mutant.\n\n*   **g1g2 and g2g3 mutants:** Both have 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to the g2 single mutant. This means the g2 mutation's effect (complete loss of resistance) masks the effects of the g1 and g3 mutations. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3**. This is strong evidence that G2 acts upstream of G1 and G3 in the resistance pathway. Given the prompt states one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, **G2 is the transcription factor**.\n\n*   **g1g3 mutant:** This double mutant has 10% resistance.\n    *   This phenotype (10%) is different from the g1 single mutant (75%).\n    *   This phenotype (10%) is also different from the g3 single mutant (50%).\n    *   Therefore, neither G1 nor G3 is epistatic to the other in the standard sense.\n    *   The resistance loss in the double mutant (90%) is greater than the sum of the individual losses (25% from g1 + 50% from g3 = 75%). This is a synergistic interaction, suggesting G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways that are both activated by G2.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\nBased on our analysis, the core conclusions are:\n*   G2 is the upstream transcription factor.\n*   G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.\n*   G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other; they interact synergistically.\n\nLet's evaluate the choices:\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: **Correct.** As established, G2 is epistatic to the others and its knockout is lethal to resistance.\n    *   `G1 and G3 has the same promoter`: **Plausible.** If G2 is a TF that activates both G1 and G3, it's a reasonable hypothesis that they are co-regulated, possibly by sharing promoter elements. This fits the model of a branched pathway controlled by G2.\n    *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: This is technically incorrect by the standard definition (10% ≠ 50%). However, in some contexts, the gene with the more severe phenotype (g3 causes a 50% loss vs. g1's 25% loss) is considered the more dominant or \"epistatic\" factor in the interaction. If we accept this non-standard interpretation, this statement could be considered correct in the context of a multiple-choice question.\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: **Correct.**\n    *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: **Correct.** The synergistic effect is a hallmark of partial gene redundancy.\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: **Incorrect.** The double mutant phenotype (10%) is not the g1 phenotype (75%). Also, G1 has the weaker phenotype, making this claim incorrect even under a non-standard interpretation.\n\n*   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n    *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: **Incorrect.** G2 has the phenotype of a master regulator, not G1.\n    *   `G2 is epistatic towards G1`: This part is correct, but the main premise of the option is wrong.\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n    *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: **Incorrect.**\n    *   `Pleiotropy`: We cannot determine if these genes affect other traits from this experiment.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption A provides the best overall conclusion. It correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor. It proposes a plausible mechanism (\"same promoter\") for the co-regulation of G1 and G3 by G2. Finally, its statement \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\" is the only one that can be justified, albeit by using a non-standard interpretation where the gene with the stronger phenotype is considered epistatic. Given the flaws in the other options, this is the most likely intended answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
