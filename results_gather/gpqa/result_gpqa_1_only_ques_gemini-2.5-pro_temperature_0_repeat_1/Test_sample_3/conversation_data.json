    "Excellent question! This gets to the heart of the beautiful symmetry (or slight asymmetry) in Maxwell's equations.\n\nLet's break down the standard Maxwell's equations and see how magnetic monopoles would affect them.\n\n1.  **Gauss's Law for Electricity (related to the divergence of E):** ∇ ⋅ **E** = ρ/ε₀\n    This equation states that the divergence of the electric field (**E**) is proportional to the density of electric charge (ρ). In simple terms, electric field lines start and end on electric charges. The existence of magnetic monopoles wouldn't change anything about electric charges, so this equation would remain the same.\n\n2.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism (related to the divergence of B):** ∇ ⋅ **B** = 0\n    This equation states that the divergence of the magnetic field (**B**) is zero. This is the mathematical way of saying there are no magnetic monopoles—magnetic field lines always form closed loops and never start or end at a point. If an isolated North or South pole (a magnetic monopole) existed, it would be a source or a sink for the magnetic field, just like an electric charge is for the electric field. Therefore, this equation **would change**. It would look like ∇ ⋅ **B** = ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density.\n\n3.  **Faraday's Law of Induction (related to the circulation/curl of E):** ∇ × **E** = -∂**B**/∂t\n    This equation states that a changing magnetic field creates a curling electric field. If magnetic monopoles existed, a moving magnetic monopole would constitute a \"magnetic current.\" To preserve the symmetry of the equations, this magnetic current would have to create a curling electric field, just as an electric current creates a curling magnetic field. This would add a new term to Faraday's Law, so this equation **would change**.\n\n4.  **Ampère-Maxwell Law (related to the circulation/curl of B):** ∇ × **B** = μ₀(**J** + ε₀ ∂**E**/∂t)\n    This equation states that a curling magnetic field is created by an electric current (**J**) or a changing electric field. The existence of magnetic monopoles doesn't directly introduce a new source for a curling magnetic field, so this equation would remain the same.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe two equations that would change are:\n*   Gauss's Law for Magnetism (related to the **divergence of the magnetic field**).\n*   Faraday's Law of Induction (related to the **circulation of the electric field**).\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
