    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the partition function Z.\n\n**1. Define the System and States**\nThe system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3.\nEach spin can take a value of +1 or -1.\nThe total number of possible microstates for the system is 2 x 2 x 2 = 8.\n\n**2. Define the Partition Function**\nThe partition function Z is the sum over all possible states (i) of the Boltzmann factor for that state:\nZ = Σ_i e^(-βE_i)\nwhere E_i is the energy of the i-th state and β = 1/(kT).\n\n**3. List all Possible States and Calculate their Energies**\nThe energy of the system is given by E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3].\nWe need to calculate the energy for each of the 8 possible states.\n\nLet's list the states and their corresponding energies:\n\n*   **State 1: All spins up**\n    (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, +1)\n    E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n*   **State 2: All spins down**\n    (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, -1)\n    E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -3J\n\n*   **State 3: One spin down, two spins up**\n    There are three such configurations:\n    a) (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, +1, -1)\n       E = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    b) (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, +1)\n       E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    c) (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, +1)\n       E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n\n*   **State 4: One spin up, two spins down**\n    There are three such configurations:\n    a) (S1, S2, S3) = (+1, -1, -1)\n       E = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 - 1 + 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    b) (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, +1, -1)\n       E = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 + 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n    c) (S1, S2, S3) = (-1, -1, +1)\n       E = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 - 1 - 1] = -J[-1] = J\n\n**4. Group States by Energy (Find Degeneracy)**\nWe have found two distinct energy levels for the system:\n\n*   **Energy Level 1:** E1 = -3J\n    This energy level corresponds to the states where all spins are aligned (all up or all down).\n    The number of states with this energy (degeneracy) is g1 = 2.\n\n*   **Energy Level 2:** E2 = J\n    This energy level corresponds to the states where one spin is flipped relative to the other two.\n    The number of states with this energy (degeneracy) is g2 = 3 + 3 = 6.\n\n**5. Calculate the Partition Function**\nNow we can write the partition function by summing over the energy levels, taking into account their degeneracies:\nZ = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
