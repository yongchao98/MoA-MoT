    "This problem asks for the threshold energy of a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) that can annihilate with a low-energy Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon ($\\gamma_{CMB}$) to produce an electron-positron pair ($e^{-}e^{+}$). The reaction is:\n$\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-}$\n\nTo solve this, we need to apply the principles of special relativity and conservation of energy and momentum. The key is to find the minimum energy required for the reaction to occur. This minimum energy is called the threshold energy.\n\n**1. The Threshold Condition**\n\nThe reaction is possible only if the total energy in the center-of-mass (CM) frame is at least equal to the rest mass energy of the products. The products are an electron and a positron, each with a rest mass $m_e$.\nSo, the minimum energy in the CM frame, $E'_{CM, min}$, must be:\n$E'_{CM, min} = m_e c^2 + m_e c^2 = 2 m_e c^2$\n\nAt this threshold, the electron and positron are created at rest in the CM frame.\n\n**2. Using Lorentz Invariance**\n\nA convenient way to solve this is to use the Lorentz-invariant quantity $s$, which is the square of the total four-momentum of the system. It has the same value in all inertial frames.\n$s = (p_{\\gamma} + p_{CMB})^2$\n\nLet's calculate $s$ in the CM frame and the lab frame and equate them.\n\n*   **In the Center-of-Mass (CM) Frame:**\n    At threshold, the total energy is $E'_{CM} = 2m_e c^2$ and the total momentum is zero. The four-momentum is $P'_{total} = (E'_{CM}/c, \\vec{0}) = (2m_e c, \\vec{0})$.\n    So, $s = (P'_{total})^2 = (2m_e c)^2 = 4m_e^2 c^2$.\n\n*   **In the Lab Frame:**\n    Let the high-energy photon have energy $E_{\\gamma}$ and momentum $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma}$, and the CMB photon have energy $E_{CMB}$ and momentum $\\vec{p}_{CMB}$.\n    $s = (p_{\\gamma} + p_{CMB})^2 = p_{\\gamma}^2 + p_{CMB}^2 + 2 p_{\\gamma} \\cdot p_{CMB}$\n    For any photon, its four-momentum squared is zero ($p^2 = (E/c)^2 - |\\vec{p}|^2 = 0$), so $p_{\\gamma}^2 = 0$ and $p_{CMB}^2 = 0$.\n    The dot product of the four-momenta is $p_{\\gamma} \\cdot p_{CMB} = \\frac{E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}}{c^2} - \\vec{p}_{\\gamma} \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB}$.\n    Since $|\\vec{p}_{\\gamma}| = E_{\\gamma}/c$ and $|\\vec{p}_{CMB}| = E_{CMB}/c$, we have $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma} \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB} = |\\vec{p}_{\\gamma}||\\vec{p}_{CMB}|\\cos\\theta = \\frac{E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}}{c^2}\\cos\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the two photons.\n    So, $s = 2 \\left( \\frac{E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}}{c^2} - \\frac{E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}}{c^2}\\cos\\theta \\right) = \\frac{2E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}}{c^2}(1-\\cos\\theta)$.\n\n**3. Finding the Threshold Energy**\n\nNow we equate the two expressions for $s$:\n$4m_e^2 c^2 = \\frac{2E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}}{c^2}(1-\\cos\\theta)$\n\nSolving for the high-energy photon's energy $E_{\\gamma}$:\n$E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{4m_e^2 c^4}{2E_{CMB}(1-\\cos\\theta)} = \\frac{2(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}(1-\\cos\\theta)}$\n\nThe threshold energy is the *minimum* possible value for $E_{\\gamma}$. This occurs when the denominator is maximized. The term $(1-\\cos\\theta)$ is maximum when $\\cos\\theta = -1$, which corresponds to a head-on collision ($\\theta = \\pi$).\nThe maximum value of $(1-\\cos\\theta)$ is $1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\nThe minimum threshold energy, $E_{\\gamma, th}$, is therefore:\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{2(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}(2)} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n**4. Calculation**\n\nNow we plug in the given values:\n*   Rest mass energy of an electron: $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$\n*   Average energy of a CMB photon: $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$\n\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV} = 2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\nThe question asks for the answer in GeV ($1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$).\n$E_{\\gamma, th} = \\frac{2.61121 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis value is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV. Comparing this to the options provided:\nA) 2.6 * 1e5 GeV\nB) 1.8 * 1e5 GeV\nC) 9.5 * 1e4 GeV\nD) 3.9 * 1e5 GeV\n\nOur calculated value matches option A. Gamma-rays with energies at or above this threshold will have their propagation distance (and thus lifetime in the intergalactic medium) severely limited by this pair-production process.\n\n<<<A>>>"
