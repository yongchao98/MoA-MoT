    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Signals:**\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents 3 protons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~2.1 ppm):** This is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl group (an acetyl group, CH₃-C=O).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s):** A singlet means these protons have no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with. This is consistent with an acetyl group. All four options are acetates, so they all contain this group.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** This signal represents 3 protons, likely a methyl group (CH₃).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** A doublet means this methyl group is adjacent to a single proton (-CH-).\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~1.6 ppm):** This is a typical shift for an allylic methyl group (a methyl group attached to a C=C double bond). This suggests a `CH₃-CH=` fragment.\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents 1 proton on the double bond (a vinylic proton).\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq):** A doublet of quartets means this proton is coupled to two different groups of protons:\n        *   The \"d\" (doublet) comes from coupling to one other adjacent proton.\n        *   The \"q\" (quartet) comes from coupling to an adjacent group of 3 protons (a methyl group).\n    *   This confirms the `CH₃-CH=CH-` fragment. The proton at 5.5 ppm is the one in the middle, coupled to both the terminal CH₃ group and the other vinylic proton.\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** This signal represents the other vinylic proton.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (~7.0 ppm):** This is a highly deshielded vinylic proton, which is expected for a proton on a carbon atom attached to an electronegative oxygen atom (`-O-CH=`).\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** A doublet means it is coupled to only one other proton (the one at 5.5 ppm).\n    *   **Coupling Constant (J = 16.0 Hz):** This is the most critical piece of information for determining the stereochemistry. A large coupling constant (typically 12-18 Hz) between two vinylic protons is characteristic of a **trans** relationship. A smaller coupling constant (6-12 Hz) would indicate a cis relationship.\n\n**2. Assemble the Structure:**\n\n*   The data points to a `CH₃-C(=O)-O-CH=CH-CH₃` structure. This is propenyl acetate. The total proton count (3+3+1+1 = 8H) matches the structure. This eliminates the butenyl acetate options (C and D), which would have 10 protons.\n*   The coupling constant J = 16.0 Hz between the two vinylic protons (at 7.0 and 5.5 ppm) confirms they are in a **trans** configuration.\n\n**3. Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound has a propenyl acetate structure with a trans configuration across the double bond. Therefore, the unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
