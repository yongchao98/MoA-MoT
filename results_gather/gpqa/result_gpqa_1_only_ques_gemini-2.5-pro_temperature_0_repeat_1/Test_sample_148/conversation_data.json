    "This is a classic problem in peptide chemistry. Let's break down the evidence to arrive at the most logical conclusion.\n\n1.  **¹H NMR Data:** The presence of two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, with a combined integral of 1H, indicates that this proton exists in two different chemical environments. Since the two species are in a roughly 1:1 ratio and spin-spin coupling is ruled out, this means the sample contains two different molecular species.\n\n2.  **LC-MS Data:** The LC-MS analysis confirms the presence of two distinct species that can be separated by chromatography. The fact that they have the same mass spectrum proves they are isomers (i.e., they have the same molecular formula). The equal intensities of the LC peaks confirm the ~1:1 ratio observed in the NMR.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options based on this evidence:\n\n*   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would have a different chemical structure and therefore a different molecular weight. The MS data shows both peaks have the *same mass*, which rules out this option.\n*   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they would not produce separate peaks in a standard ¹H NMR spectrum and would not be separated by a standard (achiral) LC column. This option is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n*   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This side reaction would involve the addition of an extra chemical group, resulting in a product with a higher molecular weight. The MS data shows both peaks have the same, expected mass, ruling out this option.\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n    *   **Consistency with NMR:** Because they are distinct compounds, they would give rise to two different sets of NMR signals. It is very common for corresponding protons in a pair of diastereoisomers to have slightly different chemical shifts, which explains the two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n    *   **Consistency with LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereoisomers can be separated by standard chromatography, explaining the two LC peaks. As isomers, they have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass, which is consistent with the MS data.\n\n**What kind of diastereomers?**\nIn peptides, this phenomenon is most commonly caused by one of two things:\n1.  **Use of a racemic amino acid:** If one of the amino acid building blocks was a racemic mixture (a 50:50 mix of D and L forms), its incorporation into a chiral peptide chain would create a 1:1 mixture of diastereomers.\n2.  ***Cis-trans* isomerism:** The amide bond (peptide bond) has a high barrier to rotation. For amide bonds involving a proline residue (an X-Pro bond), the energy difference between the *cis* and *trans* conformers is small, often leading to a significant population of both isomers at room temperature. These *cis* and *trans* isomers are a specific type of diastereomer (called atropisomers) and are in slow equilibrium. This slow exchange on the NMR timescale results in separate signals for each isomer. They can also often be separated by HPLC, and the \"elevated temperature\" mentioned in the LC-MS analysis is a strong hint that the experimenters were trying to resolve these slowly interconverting species.\n\nBoth of these scenarios result in a mixture of diastereomers. Therefore, this is the only explanation that fits all the provided data.\n\n<<<A>>>"
