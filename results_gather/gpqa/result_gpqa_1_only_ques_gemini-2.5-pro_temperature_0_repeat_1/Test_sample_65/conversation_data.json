    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model Lagrangian. These operators must respect the fundamental symmetries of the Standard Model itself. Let's analyze each symmetry:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** This is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime in all relativistic quantum field theories, including the Standard Model. All operators in SMEFT are constructed to be Lorentz scalars, so this symmetry must be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincare symmetry:** This is the full symmetry group of spacetime in special relativity, combining Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) and spacetime translations. Like Lorentz symmetry, it is a foundational principle of the Standard Model and is preserved in the construction of SMEFT.\n\n3.  **CP symmetry:** This is the combination of Charge conjugation (C) and Parity (P). The Standard Model itself is known to violate CP symmetry through the complex phase in the CKM matrix, which is responsible for the observed CP violation in weak interactions. Since the SM is not CP-symmetric, there is no requirement for the higher-dimensional operators in SMEFT to respect it. In fact, SMEFT provides new potential sources of CP violation that are actively searched for in experiments.\n\n4.  **CPT symmetry:** This is the combination of Charge conjugation (C), Parity (P), and Time reversal (T). The CPT theorem states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be CPT symmetric. Since SMEFT is constructed as a local, Lorentz-invariant QFT, it must respect CPT symmetry.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\nThis corresponds to options 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
