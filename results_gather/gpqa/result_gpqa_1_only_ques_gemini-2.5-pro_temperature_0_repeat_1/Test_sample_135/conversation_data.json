    "Here is a step-by-step evaluation of the integral.\n\n**1. Define the Vector Field and the Integral**\n\nThe vector field is given by its magnitude `f(r) = 1/r^2` and its direction, which is purely radial. In spherical coordinates, this can be written as:\n`f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat`\nwhere `r_hat` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nWe need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field:\n`I = ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV`\nThe volume `V` is a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin.\n\n**2. Method 1: Using the Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem)**\n\nThe Divergence Theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume `V` is equal to the net flux of the field through the closed surface `S` that bounds the volume:\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\n**Important Note:** The Divergence Theorem requires the vector field to be well-behaved (continuous and differentiable) everywhere inside the volume. Our field `f(r) = r_hat / r^2` has a singularity at the origin (`r=0`), where it is undefined. However, the theorem can still be applied by understanding that the integral of the divergence over the volume equals the flux through the boundary surface, which effectively measures the \"source\" at the singularity.\n\nLet's calculate the flux through the surface of the sphere `S`.\n\n*   The surface `S` is a sphere of radius `R`.\n*   The vector field `f` on this surface is `f(R) = (1/R^2) * r_hat`.\n*   The differential surface area vector `dS` on a sphere always points radially outward. So, `dS = dS * r_hat`, where `dS` is the magnitude of the area element. In spherical coordinates, `dS = R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ`.\n*   The dot product `f ⋅ dS` is:\n    `f ⋅ dS = ( (1/R^2) * r_hat ) ⋅ ( dS * r_hat ) = (1/R^2) dS`\n    Substituting the expression for `dS`:\n    `f ⋅ dS = (1/R^2) * (R^2 sin(θ) dθ dφ) = sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nNow, we integrate this over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for spherical coordinates are `θ` from `0` to `π`, and `φ` from `0` to `2π`.\n\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = ∫_{φ=0}^{2π} ∫_{θ=0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ dφ`\n\nWe can separate the integrals:\n`= (∫_{0}^{2π} dφ) * (∫_{0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ)`\n\nEvaluate each integral:\n*   `∫_{0}^{2π} dφ = [φ]_0^{2π} = 2π`\n*   `∫_{0}^{π} sin(θ) dθ = [-cos(θ)]_0^{π} = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\nMultiply the results:\n`∮_S (f ⋅ dS) = (2π) * (2) = 4π`\n\nTherefore, the volume integral of the divergence is `4π`.\n\n**3. Method 2: Direct Calculation of the Divergence**\n\nThe divergence of a vector field `F = F_r * r_hat` in spherical coordinates is `∇ ⋅ F = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (r^2 * F_r)`.\nFor our field, `f_r = 1/r^2`.\n`∇ ⋅ f = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (r^2 * (1/r^2)) = (1/r^2) * ∂/∂r (1) = 0`\n\nThis result is valid for all `r ≠ 0`. At `r=0`, the field is singular. A field of the form `r_hat / r^2` corresponds to a point source at the origin (like the electric field of a point charge). The divergence of such a field is zero everywhere except at the source, where it is a Dirac delta function. Specifically, it can be shown that:\n`∇ ⋅ (r_hat / r^2) = 4πδ(r)`\nwhere `δ(r)` is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function.\n\nNow, we integrate this over the volume of the sphere:\n`I = ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∫_V 4πδ(r) dV`\n\nBy the definition of the delta function, this integral is `4π` if the origin is inside the volume of integration (which it is) and `0` otherwise.\nSo, `I = 4π`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The integral evaluates to `4π`. This value is independent of the radius `R` of the sphere, as long as `R > 0`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 4 π\nB) 0\nC) 1\nD) 4/3 π R\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
