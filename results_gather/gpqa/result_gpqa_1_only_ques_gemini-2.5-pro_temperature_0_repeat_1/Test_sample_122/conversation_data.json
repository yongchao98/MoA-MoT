    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the frames of reference and given information.**\n*   **Galaxy's reference frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we want to measure the distance traveled.\n*   **Ejecta's reference frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame.\n*   **Relative velocity (v):** The ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s relative to the Galaxy.\n*   **Proper time (Δt'):** The time elapsed in the moving frame (the ejecta's frame) is Δt' = 50 s. This is called the proper time because it's measured by a clock that is at rest in its own frame.\n*   **Speed of light (c):** c ≈ 300,000 km/s.\n\n**2. Determine the goal.**\nWe need to find the distance (d) the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (S). The formula for distance is `d = v * Δt`, where Δt is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n**3. Apply the principle of time dilation.**\nAccording to special relativity, time passes more slowly for a moving object as measured by a stationary observer. This phenomenon is called time dilation. The time elapsed in the stationary frame (Δt) is related to the proper time in the moving frame (Δt') by the following formula:\n\nΔt = γ * Δt'\n\nwhere γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**4. Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated as:\n\nγ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nFirst, let's find the ratio v/c:\nv/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n\nNow, substitute this into the Lorentz factor formula:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.2)²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04)\nγ = 1 / √(0.96)\n\nCalculating the value:\nγ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206\n\n**5. Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt).**\nNow we can find the time that has passed in the Galaxy's frame:\nΔt = γ * Δt'\nΔt ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s\nΔt ≈ 51.03 s\n\n**6. Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame (d).**\nFinally, we can calculate the distance:\nd = v * Δt\nd ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s\nd ≈ 3,061,800 km\n\nThis value is very close to option A.\n\n**Alternative approach using approximation:**\nFor speeds much less than the speed of light, the Lorentz factor can be approximated using the binomial expansion: γ ≈ 1 + v²/(2c²).\nγ ≈ 1 + (0.2)² / 2\nγ ≈ 1 + 0.04 / 2\nγ ≈ 1.02\n\nUsing this approximated γ:\nΔt = γ * Δt' ≈ 1.02 * 50 s = 51 s\nd = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51 s = 3,060,000 km\n\nThis result exactly matches option A, indicating that this approximation was likely intended for the problem.\n\n*   **Classical calculation (incorrect):** If we ignored relativity, d = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km (Option C).\n*   **Incorrect time dilation (incorrect):** If we mistakenly thought time in the stationary frame was shorter, d = v * t' / γ ≈ 2,940,000 km (Option B).\n*   **Correct relativistic calculation:** The time in the Galaxy frame is longer (dilated), so the distance covered is greater than the classical calculation. d = v * γ * t' ≈ 3,060,000 km (Option A).\n\nThe correct answer is found by applying the time dilation formula.\n\n<<<A>>>"
