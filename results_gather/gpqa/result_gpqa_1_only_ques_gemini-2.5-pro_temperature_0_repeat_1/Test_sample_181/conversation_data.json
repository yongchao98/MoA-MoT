    "To determine the correct statement about the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation, let's analyze the fundamental assumptions made in its derivation.\n\nThe Mott-Gurney law describes the current in a regime where the number of injected charge carriers is so high that they form a significant \"space charge\" within the device. This space charge creates its own electric field that opposes the applied field, thus limiting the current. The derivation of this law relies on several key conditions:\n\n1.  **Single-Carrier Device:** The model assumes that current is transported by only one type of charge carrier (unipolar injection), either electrons or holes. This rules out option D, which mentions a two-carrier device.\n\n2.  **Trap-Free Material:** The ideal Mott-Gurney equation assumes the semiconductor or insulator is perfectly free of traps (localized energy states in the bandgap). If traps were present, they would capture some of the injected carriers, and the current-voltage relationship would change. This makes \"trap-free\" a necessary condition.\n\n3.  **Ohmic Contact (No Injection Barrier):** For SCLC to occur, the contact must be able to inject carriers freely into the device. This means there should be no energy barrier for injection. Such a contact is called an Ohmic or injecting contact. A Schottky contact (mentioned in option B) has an energy barrier and would limit the current at the interface (injection-limited current), preventing the bulk space-charge-limited regime from being established. Therefore, the condition is \"no carrier injection barrier\" or an \"Ohmic contact\".\n\n4.  **Negligible Diffusion Current:** The model assumes that the dominant transport mechanism is the **drift** of carriers under the influence of the electric field. The current arising from the diffusion of carriers (due to the concentration gradient) is assumed to be negligible compared to the drift current. This is a standard approximation in the derivation.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options based on these assumptions:\n\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.** This is incorrect. The SCLC is fundamentally a **drift** current. Stating that drift current is negligible is a direct contradiction.\n\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect. A Schottky contact is a rectifying contact with an energy barrier that would limit injection, which is contrary to the requirement for SCLC.\n\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.** This statement correctly combines all the key assumptions: it's a single-carrier device, it's trap-free, there is no injection barrier (which is the definition of a perfect Ohmic contact for SCLC), and diffusion current is negligible.\n\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.** This is incorrect. The Mott-Gurney law is derived for unipolar (single-carrier) injection.\n\nTherefore, statement C accurately describes the conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
