    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n**1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum:**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a characteristic feature of the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid is found around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene functional group, which supports the FTIR data.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum:**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly diagnostic fragment. The mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺, is calculated as:\n    *   Carbon (C): 12\n    *   Oxygen (O): 16\n    *   Oxygen (O): 16\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 1\n    *   Total mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45.\n*   This fragment is a very common and stable ion formed from carboxylic acids, strongly confirming the presence of the -COOH group.\n\n**4. Synthesizing the Information and Evaluating the Options:**\n\nFrom the combined spectroscopic data, we have established that the unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. This means it must contain:\n*   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which has two oxygen atoms.\n*   An alkene group (C=C).\n\nNow, let's calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for our structure. The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds in a molecule.\n*   One C=O double bond contributes 1 to the DoU.\n*   One C=C double bond contributes 1 to the DoU.\n*   Therefore, the molecule must have a total DoU of 2.\n\nLet's check the given formulas:\n\n*   **A) C6H10O:** Contains only one oxygen atom, so it cannot be a carboxylic acid. Incorrect.\n*   **B) C6H12O2:** Contains two oxygen atoms. Let's check its DoU.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n    *   A DoU of 1 is not enough to account for both a C=C and a C=O bond. This would be a saturated carboxylic acid. Incorrect.\n*   **C) C6H12O:** Contains only one oxygen atom, so it cannot be a carboxylic acid. Incorrect.\n*   **D) C6H10O2:** Contains two oxygen atoms, consistent with a carboxylic acid. Let's check its DoU.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n    *   A DoU of 2 perfectly matches the requirement for one C=C bond and one C=O bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe formula C6H10O2 is the only option that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence: the presence of a carboxylic acid group, an alkene group, and the required degree of unsaturation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
