    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Notation**\n\nThe notation [X/Y] represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of element X to element Y in a star, relative to the Sun. It is defined as:\n[X/Y] = log₁₀( (nₓ/nᵧ)ₛₜₐᵣ ) - log₁₀( (nₓ/nᵧ)ₛᵤₙ )\nwhere nₓ and nᵧ are the number densities of elements X and Y.\n\nA key property of this notation is that abundances can be combined:\n[A/C] = [A/B] + [B/C]\nAnother useful property is:\n[A/B] = -[B/A]\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. This is interpreted as the ratio of their silicon number densities, which is equivalent to the ratio of their silicon abundances relative to hydrogen: (n_Si/n_H)₁ / (n_Si/n_H)₂.\n\n**2. Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star_1**\n\nWe are given for Star_1:\n*   [Fe/H]₁ = 0\n*   [Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3\n\nWe want to find [Si/H]₁. We can use the combination property:\n[Si/H]₁ = [Si/Fe]₁ + [Fe/H]₁\n[Si/H]₁ = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3\n\nNow, let's convert this back to an abundance ratio using the definition:\n[Si/H]₁ = log₁₀( (n_Si/n_H)₁ / (n_Si/n_H)ₛᵤₙ ) = 0.3\n(n_Si/n_H)₁ / (n_Si/n_H)ₛᵤₙ = 10⁰.³\n(n_Si/n_H)₁ = (n_Si/n_H)ₛᵤₙ * 10⁰.³\n\n**3. Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star_2**\n\nWe are given for Star_2:\n*   [Mg/H]₂ = 0\n*   [Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3\n\nWe want to find [Si/H]₂. First, we need [Si/Mg]₂:\n[Si/Mg]₂ = -[Mg/Si]₂ = -0.3\n\nNow, we can use the combination property:\n[Si/H]₂ = [Si/Mg]₂ + [Mg/H]₂\n[Si/H]₂ = -0.3 + 0 = -0.3\n\nNext, convert this back to an abundance ratio:\n[Si/H]₂ = log₁₀( (n_Si/n_H)₂ / (n_Si/n_H)ₛᵤₙ ) = -0.3\n(n_Si/n_H)₂ / (n_Si/n_H)ₛᵤₙ = 10⁻⁰.³\n(n_Si/n_H)₂ = (n_Si/n_H)ₛᵤₙ * 10⁻⁰.³\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Ratio**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of silicon atoms (abundances) in Star_1 to Star_2:\nRatio = (n_Si/n_H)₁ / (n_Si/n_H)₂\n\nSubstitute the expressions from steps 2 and 3:\nRatio = ( (n_Si/n_H)ₛᵤₙ * 10⁰.³ ) / ( (n_Si/n_H)ₛᵤₙ * 10⁻⁰.³ )\n\nThe solar silicon abundance (n_Si/n_H)ₛᵤₙ cancels out:\nRatio = 10⁰.³ / 10⁻⁰.³\nRatio = 10⁽⁰.³ ⁻ ⁽⁻⁰.³⁾⁾\nRatio = 10⁰.⁶\n\nNow, we evaluate 10⁰.⁶:\n10⁰.⁶ ≈ 3.981\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9.\n\nNote that the masses of the stars and the specific solar abundance values for Fe and Mg are extra information not needed for the calculation.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) ~3.9\nB) ~0.8\nC) ~1.2\nD) ~12.6\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
