    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each option to determine the correct sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**Target Molecule:**\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. It has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nAll three substituents are meta to each other. Let's analyze their directing effects in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   -COCH3: meta-director, deactivating.\n*   -Br: ortho,para-director, deactivating.\n*   -NO2: meta-director, strongly deactivating.\n\nThe presence of an ortho,para-director (-Br) meta to two meta-directors makes direct substitution challenging. This often requires a more complex strategy, possibly involving the use of a temporary directing group that is later removed or modified (e.g., via a Sandmeyer reaction). The presence of reagents like Fe/HCl, NaNO2/HCl, and H3PO2 in the options strongly suggests such a strategy is employed.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n*   i) Benzene → Nitrobenzene\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene → Aniline (reduction)\n*   iii) Aniline → Benzenediazonium chloride (diazotization)\n*   iv) Benzenediazonium chloride → Benzene (deamination with H3PO2)\nThis sequence of steps i-iv starts with benzene and ends with benzene, making it a pointless loop. Thus, option A is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) Fe/HCl ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   i) Benzene → Bromobenzene\n*   ii) Bromobenzene → p-Bromonitrobenzene (major product) and o-bromonitrobenzene.\n*   iii) p-Bromonitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation. This reaction fails or gives very low yields on strongly deactivated rings, such as those bearing a nitro group. Thus, option B is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n*   i) Benzene → Acetophenone\n*   ii) Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone (The acetyl group is a meta-director).\n*   iii) Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. The substituents are -COCH3 (meta-director) at C1 and -Br (ortho,para-director) at C3. The directing effects are conflicting. The -Br group directs nitration to positions 2, 4, and 6, while the -COCH3 group directs to position 5. The o,p-directing effect of the halogen will dominate, leading to a mixture of 1-(3-bromo-4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one and 1-(3-bromo-6-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one would not be the major product. This is not a high-yield synthesis. Thus, option D is incorrect.\n\n**C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\nThis sequence is complex but represents a valid, albeit sophisticated, synthetic strategy. Let's break it down. The final steps (vi, vii) are diazotization and deamination, which remove an amino group. This is a powerful technique to achieve substitution patterns that are otherwise inaccessible. The synthesis likely involves creating a precursor with an extra amino group, which is then removed.\n\nHere is the plausible reaction pathway for option C:\n1.  **i) Benzene + HNO3/H2SO4 → Nitrobenzene**\n2.  **ii) Nitrobenzene + Fe/HCl → Aniline**\n3.  **iii) Aniline + CH3COCl → Acetanilide.** This is an N-acylation to protect the amino group. The acetyl group makes the amine less activating and sterically hinders it. (Note: AlCl3 is typically used for Friedel-Crafts C-acylation, not N-acylation, and would problematically complex with the amine. Its inclusion here is likely to indicate it will be used for a later Fries rearrangement step).\n4.  **iv) Acetanilide + Br2/FeBr3 → 4-Bromoacetanilide.** The -NHCOCH3 group is an ortho,para-director, and the para product is major due to less steric hindrance.\n5.  **v) 4-Bromoacetanilide + HNO3/H2SO4 → 4-Bromo-2-nitroacetanilide.** The activating -NHCOCH3 group directs the incoming nitro group to its ortho position (C2), which is also meta to the bromo group.\n6.  **Fries Rearrangement:** The product from step v, 4-bromo-2-nitroacetanilide, is treated with the Lewis acid **AlCl3** (from step iii). This causes the acetyl group to migrate from the nitrogen atom to the ring, typically ortho to the amino group. This yields **1-(2-amino-5-bromo-3-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n7.  **vi) Diazotization:** The resulting primary amine, 1-(2-amino-5-bromo-3-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, is treated with **NaNO2/HCl** to form a diazonium salt.\n8.  **vii) Deamination:** The diazonium salt is treated with **H3PO2** to remove the diazonium group and replace it with a hydrogen atom. This removes the temporary amino group from position 2.\n\nThe final product is **1-(5-bromo-3-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**, which is the same molecule as the target, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\nThis sequence, while complex and involving a non-obvious Fries rearrangement, is chemically sound and leads to the desired product in high yield by carefully controlling the regiochemistry at each step. Since options A, B, and D are fundamentally flawed, C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
