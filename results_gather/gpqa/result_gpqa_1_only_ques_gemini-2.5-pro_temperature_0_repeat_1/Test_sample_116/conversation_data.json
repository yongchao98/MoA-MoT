    "An organic compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This property is most commonly due to the presence of a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups) or due to restricted rotation that creates a chiral axis (atropisomerism). Let's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**:\n    *   This is a substituted biphenyl compound. In biphenyls, if there are bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'), the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is restricted.\n    *   In this molecule, all four ortho positions are substituted with bulky groups: two methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃) and two nitro groups (-NO₂).\n    *   This steric hindrance prevents the molecule from becoming planar. The two rings are forced into a non-planar, twisted conformation.\n    *   Because the substitution pattern on each ring is asymmetric (e.g., on one ring, you have -COOCH₃ at position 2 and -NO₂ at position 6), the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule is chiral and its mirror image is non-superimposable. This phenomenon is called atropisomerism, a form of axial chirality. The compound will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   To check for chirality, we look for a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group):\n        *   Group 1: -H (hydrogen)\n        *   Group 2: -OH (hydroxyl)\n        *   Group 3: -CH₃ (methyl)\n        *   Group 4: -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   Since all four groups attached to this carbon are different, it is a chiral center.\n    *   A molecule with one chiral center is always chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**:\n    *   The structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of a central carbonyl carbon double-bonded to an oxygen and single-bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   The molecule has no chiral centers.\n    *   The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C=O bond and bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   Due to the presence of this plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and superimposable on its mirror image. It does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of but-2-enedioic acid.\n    *   The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   The molecule is planar and has a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.\n    *   Any molecule with a center of inversion is achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is not optically active.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nCompounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will show optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not.\n\nTherefore, the correct option includes only 1 and 2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
