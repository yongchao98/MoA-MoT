    "This problem involves an elimination-addition reaction mechanism, which proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. Let's break down the reaction step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate (Elimination)**\n\nThe reactant is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. The reagent is sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). The amide ion (:NH2⁻) is a very strong base that will abstract an acidic proton from the benzene ring. The most acidic protons are those located ortho to the bromine atom, due to bromine's inductive electron-withdrawing effect.\n\nIn 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two ortho positions relative to the bromine at C1:\n1.  **Position C6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H).\n2.  **Position C2:** This position has a deuterium atom (d).\n\nThe C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to this kinetic isotope effect (KIE), the amide base will abstract the proton (H⁺) from C6 more readily than the deuteron (d⁺) from C2. However, both pathways are possible.\n\n*   **Pathway A (Major): Abstraction of H from C6**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the proton from C6, forming a carbanion at C6.\n    2.  The carbanion intermediate then loses the bromide ion (Br⁻) from C1.\n    3.  This results in the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains on the ring.\n    4.  The intermediate formed is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B (Minor): Abstraction of D from C2**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2, forming a carbanion at C2.\n    2.  This carbanion loses the bromide ion from C1.\n    3.  This results in the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2. The deuterium atom is removed from the ring in this process.\n    4.  The intermediate formed is **benzyne** (non-deuterated).\n\nSo, two different benzyne intermediates are possibly formed in this reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide ion (:NH2⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH3).\n\n*   **Addition to 3-deuteriobenzyne (from Pathway A)**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The nucleophile can attack either carbon.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The -NH2 group adds to C1, and a carbanion forms at C6. Protonation of the C6 carbanion by NH3 yields a product with the -NH2 group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The -NH2 group adds to C6, and a carbanion forms at C1. Protonation of the C1 carbanion by NH3 yields a product with the -NH2 group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. If we renumber the ring starting from the -NH2 group, the deuterium is at position 3. This product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n*   **Addition to benzyne (from Pathway B)**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C2. The nucleophile can attack either carbon.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Regardless of which carbon is attacked, the subsequent protonation by NH3 will result in the formation of **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy considering all possible pathways, we identify three distinct organic products:\n1.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n2.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from Pathway A)\n3.  **Aniline** (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
