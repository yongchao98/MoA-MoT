    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the minimum uncertainty in the energy of the electron.\n\n**1. Identify the relevant physical principles:**\nThis problem involves the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the relationship between a particle's energy and momentum.\n\n*   **Heisenberg's Position-Momentum Uncertainty Principle:** This principle states that the product of the uncertainty in a particle's position (Δx) and the uncertainty in its momentum in the same direction (Δp_x) must be greater than or equal to a constant value. The most precise form is:\n    Δx * Δp_x ≥ ħ / 2\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n\n*   **Energy-Momentum Relation:** The energy (E) of a particle is related to its momentum (p). We need to find how the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) relates to the uncertainty in momentum (Δp).\n\n**2. Relate Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE) to Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp):**\nThe relationship between small changes (or uncertainties) in energy and momentum can be found by taking the derivative of the energy E with respect to momentum p.\nΔE ≈ (dE/dp) * Δp\n\nThe derivative dE/dp is the group velocity of the particle's wave packet, which is equal to the particle's classical velocity, v. This is true for both the non-relativistic (E = p²/2m) and relativistic (E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)²) cases.\nSo, the relationship is:\nΔE ≈ v * Δp\n\nSince the motion is along the x-direction, we have:\nΔE ≈ v_x * Δp_x\n\n**3. Calculate the Minimum Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp_x):**\nFrom the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the minimum uncertainty occurs when we take the equality:\nΔx * Δp_x = ħ / 2\n\nWe can solve for the minimum uncertainty in momentum, Δp_x:\nΔp_x = ħ / (2 * Δx)\n\n**4. Calculate the Minimum Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE):**\nNow, substitute the expression for the minimum Δp_x into our equation for ΔE:\nΔE_min = v_x * (ħ / (2 * Δx))\n\n**5. Plug in the given values and constants:**\n*   Velocity of the electron, v_x = 2 * 10⁸ m/s\n*   Uncertainty in position, Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 * 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   Reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 1.054 * 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\nNow, let's calculate ΔE_min:\nΔE_min = (2 * 10⁸ m/s) * (1.054 * 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 10⁻¹⁰ m)\n\nΔE_min = (1.054 * 10⁻³⁴ J·s * 2 * 10⁸ m/s) / (2 * 10⁻¹⁰ m)\n\nThe '2' in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\nΔE_min = (1.054 * 10⁻³⁴ * 10⁸) / (10⁻¹⁰) J\n\nΔE_min = 1.054 * 10⁻³⁴⁺⁸⁺¹⁰ J\nΔE_min = 1.054 * 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n**6. Compare with the given options:**\nThe calculated minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately 1.054 * 10⁻¹⁶ J. This value is very close to 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n*   A) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\n*   B) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\n*   C) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\n*   D) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
