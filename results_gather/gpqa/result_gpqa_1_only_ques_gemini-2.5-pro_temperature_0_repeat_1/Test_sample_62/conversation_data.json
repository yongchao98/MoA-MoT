    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Model and Energy Levels**\n\nThe problem describes a diatomic molecule using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The energy levels for such a molecule are given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n\nE(v, J) = E_vib + E_rot = (v + 1/2)ħw + B*J*(J + 1)\n\nwhere:\n*   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (v = 0, 1, 2, ...)\n*   `J` is the rotational quantum number (J = 0, 1, 2, ...)\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)\n*   `w` is the angular frequency of vibration\n*   `B` is the rotational constant, defined as B = ħ² / (2I)\n*   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule\n\n**2. Identify the Initial State**\n\nThe molecule is initially in its fundamental state, which is the state with the lowest possible energy. This occurs when both quantum numbers are at their minimum values: v = 0 and J = 0.\n\n*   Initial State: (v_i, J_i) = (0, 0)\n*   Initial Energy: E_i = E(0, 0) = (1/2)ħw\n\n**3. Determine the Final State and Transition Energy**\n\nThe molecule absorbs a photon and transitions to the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\". We must consider the selection rules for photon absorption in a heteronuclear diatomic molecule:\n\n*   Δv = +1 (for fundamental vibrational transitions)\n*   ΔJ = ±1\n\nThe initial state is J=0. Therefore, a transition to J-1 is not possible. The only allowed change in J is ΔJ = +1.\nThis means the transition must be from J=0 to J=1.\nCombining the selection rules, the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next accessible state involving a change in vibration is to the state (v=1, J=1).\n\n*   Final State: (v_f, J_f) = (1, 1)\n*   Final Energy: E_f = E(1, 1) = (1 + 1/2)ħw + B*1*(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħw + 2B\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon (ΔE) must be equal to the difference between the final and initial energy levels:\n\nΔE = E_f - E_i = [(3/2)ħw + 2B] - (1/2)ħw\nΔE = ħw + 2B\n\n**4. Calculate the Physical Constants**\n\nWe need to calculate the rotational constant `B`, which requires the reduced mass `μ` and the moment of inertia `I`.\n\n*   **Reduced Mass (μ):**\n    μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n    μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n    Converting to kg (1 amu ≈ 1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg):\n    μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.6605 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n*   **Moment of Inertia (I):**\n    I = μ * R²\n    R = 2 angstroms = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n    I ≈ (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\n    I ≈ (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (4 x 10⁻²⁰ m²) ≈ 1.208 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n*   **Rotational Constant (B):**\n    B = ħ² / (2I)\n    B ≈ (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (2 * 1.208 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²)\n    B ≈ (1.111 x 10⁻⁶⁸ J²·s²) / (2.416 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 4.60 x 10⁻²³ J\n\n**5. Calculate the Photon Energy (ΔE)**\n\nNow we can calculate the total energy of the transition:\n\n*   Vibrational energy part: ħw = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) = 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n*   Rotational energy part: 2B ≈ 2 * (4.60 x 10⁻²³ J) = 9.20 x 10⁻²³ J\n\nΔE = ħw + 2B ≈ 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J + 9.20 x 10⁻²³ J\nΔE ≈ 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J + 0.0092 x 10⁻²⁰ J ≈ 4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n(Note: The rotational energy contribution is very small compared to the vibrational energy).\n\n**6. Calculate the Photon Momentum (p)**\n\nThe energy of a photon is related to its momentum `p` and the speed of light `c` (c ≈ 3 x 10⁸ m/s) by the equation E = pc.\n\np = ΔE / c\np ≈ (4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3 x 10⁸ m/s)\np ≈ 1.408 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis value is closest to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
