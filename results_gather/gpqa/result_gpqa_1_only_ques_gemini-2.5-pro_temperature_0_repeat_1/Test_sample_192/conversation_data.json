    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the relationship between the number of stars and distance.\n\n1.  **Understand the variables and the given relationship.**\n    *   Let `N` be the number of stars.\n    *   Let `r` be the distance to a star.\n    *   Let `plx` be the parallax of a star.\n    *   The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of distance, which can be written as the derivative `dN/dr`.\n    *   The problem states that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\". This is most directly interpreted as the number of stars per unit of parallax, `dN/d(plx)`.\n    *   So, we are given: `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`, where `∝` means \"is proportional to\".\n\n2.  **Relate distance and parallax.**\n    *   Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The relationship is:\n        `plx = 1/r`\n    *   (Assuming standard units of parsecs for distance and arcseconds for parallax).\n\n3.  **Connect the two distributions using the chain rule.**\n    *   We want to find `dN/dr` and we know `dN/d(plx)`. We can relate these two derivatives using the chain rule:\n        `dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the derivative `d(plx)/dr`.**\n    *   Since `plx = 1/r = r⁻¹`, we can differentiate with respect to `r`:\n        `d(plx)/dr = -1 * r⁻² = -1/r²`\n    *   When considering number densities, we are interested in the magnitude of the relationship, so we use the absolute value:\n        `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r²`\n\n5.  **Substitute the known relationships into the chain rule equation.**\n    *   We have `dN/dr ∝ (dN/d(plx)) * |d(plx)/dr|`.\n    *   Substitute the given proportionality for `dN/d(plx)` and the derivative we just calculated:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (1/plx^5) * (1/r²)`\n\n6.  **Express the final relationship in terms of distance `r` only.**\n    *   To get the final answer, we replace `plx` with `1/r` in the expression:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (1 / (1/r)^5) * (1/r²)`\n    *   Simplify the expression:\n        `dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (1/r²)`\n        `dN/dr ∝ r^(5-2)`\n        `dN/dr ∝ r^3`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance varies as `r^3`.\n\nComparing this result to the options:\nA) ~ r^4\nB) ~ r^2\nC) ~ r^5\nD) ~ r^3\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
