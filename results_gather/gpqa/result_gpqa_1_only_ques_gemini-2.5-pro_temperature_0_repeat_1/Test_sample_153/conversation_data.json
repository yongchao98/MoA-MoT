    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates that the molecular weight of the compound (using the most abundant isotopes) is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has a relative abundance of 32%. The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which is very close to a 3:1 ratio. This isotopic pattern is a classic signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule (natural abundance of ³⁵Cl is ~75.8% and ³⁷Cl is ~24.2%).\n\nLet's check the molecular weights of the options (using C=12, H=1, O=16, Cl=35):\n*   A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (C₇H₅ClO₂): 7(12) + 5(1) + 1(35) + 2(16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n*   B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅ClO₂): 7(12) + 5(1) + 1(35) + 2(16) = 156 g/mol.\n*   C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid (C₇H₅ClO₂): 7(12) + 5(1) + 1(35) + 2(16) = 156 g/mol.\n*   D) Phenyl chloroformate (C₇H₅ClO₂): 7(12) + 5(1) + 1(35) + 2(16) = 156 g/mol.\n\nAll four options have the correct molecular weight and contain one chlorine atom. The mass spectrometry data confirms the molecular formula is likely C₇H₅ClO₂ but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very characteristic and definitive peak for the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding in the carboxylic acid dimer.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value of 1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for a carbonyl group that is conjugated with an aromatic ring, such as in an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\nBased on the IR data, the compound must be a carboxylic acid. This allows us to eliminate:\n*   A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: This is an aldehyde with a phenol. While it has an O-H and a C=O, the O-H stretch of a phenol is typically less broad (around 3600-3200 cm⁻¹), and the very broad peak down to 2700 cm⁻¹ is specific to carboxylic acids.\n*   D) Phenyl chloroformate: This is a chloroformate (an ester derivative). It has a C=O group but no O-H group, so it would not show the broad peak at 3500-2700 cm⁻¹.\n\nThe IR data strongly suggests the compound is either 2-chlorobenzoic acid or 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** This is a singlet (s) integrating to one proton (1H) in a very downfield region. Chemical shifts greater than 10 ppm are characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This confirms the conclusion from the IR spectrum.\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):**\n    *   We see two signals in the aromatic region.\n    *   Both signals are doublets (d).\n    *   Each signal integrates to two protons (2H).\n    *   This pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is a classic signature for a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the para-substitution makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two on the other, resulting in two sets of equivalent protons.\n\nLet's examine the remaining two options:\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted (1,2-disubstituted) ring. It has no symmetry, so it would show four distinct signals for the four aromatic protons, likely as complex multiplets, not two simple doublets.\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) ring. It has a plane of symmetry, leading to two sets of equivalent protons. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group are equivalent and would appear as one doublet. The protons ortho to the -Cl group are also equivalent and would appear as a second doublet. This structure perfectly matches the observed NMR data. The protons ortho to the strongly deshielding carboxyl group are expected to be further downfield (8.02 ppm), while those ortho to the chlorine atom are slightly less deshielded (7.72 ppm).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy combining all the spectral data, the only structure that fits all the evidence is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n*   **MS:** Correct molecular weight (156) and Cl isotope pattern.\n*   **IR:** Confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **¹H NMR:** Confirms the carboxylic acid proton and shows a para-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nTherefore, the unidentified solid is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>"
