    "This clever riddle describes the process of co-translational protein targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).\n\n*   The \"ribonucleoprotein particle\" is the **Signal Recognition Particle (SRP)**.\n*   The \"nascent chain\" is a new protein being synthesized on a ribosome in the **cytosol**.\n*   The SRP recognizes a signal on the new protein, binds to it, and \"pauses\" translation.\n*   It then guides the ribosome and the protein chain to the surface of the **\"rough\" Endoplasmic Reticulum** (\"It seems somewhat rough\").\n*   The protein is then threaded into the ER, where it can undergo modifications like glycosylation (\"you really need some sugar\").\n*   This is the first step in the secretory pathway. From the ER, the protein will travel through the Golgi apparatus and eventually be secreted from the cell into the **extracellular space**.\n\nTherefore, the meeting happens in the cytosol, and the chain is heading for the extracellular space.\n\n<<<D>>>"
