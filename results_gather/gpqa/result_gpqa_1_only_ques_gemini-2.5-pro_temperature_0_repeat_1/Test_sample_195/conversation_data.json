    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Identify the Principle of Conservation of Energy**\n    The total energy of the system is conserved. The total energy ($E_{total}$) is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy ($K$) and the potential energy ($U$).\n    $E_{total} = K + U = \\text{constant}$\n\n2.  **Define Kinetic and Potential Energy**\n    *   The relativistic kinetic energy of a particle of mass $m$ moving at speed $v$ is given by:\n        $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The force is given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy stored in the spring at a displacement $x$ from the equilibrium position is:\n        $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$. We set the potential energy to be zero at the equilibrium position ($x=0$).\n\n3.  **Write the Expression for Total Energy**\n    The total energy of the oscillator at any point in its motion is:\n    $E_{total} = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n4.  **Analyze the Energy at Key Points of the Oscillation**\n\n    *   **At the maximum amplitude ($x = A$):**\n        The mass momentarily comes to a stop, so its speed is $v=0$.\n        When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        The kinetic energy is $K = (1-1)mc^2 = 0$.\n        The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        Therefore, the total energy of the system is:\n        $E_{total} = 0 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n    *   **At the equilibrium position ($x = 0$):**\n        The potential energy is zero: $U(0) = 0$.\n        The speed of the mass is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n        The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        The kinetic energy is at its maximum: $K_{max} = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n        Therefore, the total energy of the system at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2 + 0 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n\n5.  **Apply Conservation of Energy**\n    Since the total energy is conserved, the energy at the maximum amplitude must equal the energy at the equilibrium position:\n    $E_{total}(\\text{at } x=A) = E_{total}(\\text{at } x=0)$\n    $\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\n6.  **Solve for the Maximum Speed ($v_{max}$)**\n    First, we solve for the maximum Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} - 1 = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    Now, substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, we perform the following algebraic steps:\n    *   Square both sides of the equation:\n        $\\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2$\n    *   Take the reciprocal of both sides:\n        $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n    *   Isolate the $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$ term:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n    *   Multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n        $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n*   **Check Classical Limit:** In the classical limit, the potential energy is much smaller than the rest energy ($kA^2/2 \\ll mc^2$). Let $x = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \\ll 1$. Using the binomial approximation $(1+x)^{-2} \\approx 1-2x$, we get $v_{max} \\approx c\\sqrt{1 - (1-2x)} = c\\sqrt{2x} = c\\sqrt{2\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$, which is the correct classical result. This confirms our relativistic formula is consistent.\n\n<<<C>>>"
