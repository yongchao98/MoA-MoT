    "This problem deals with the exponential decay of relativistic particles. The fraction of particles that survive after traveling a certain distance depends on their lifetime, which is affected by time dilation.\n\nHere is a step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **The Survival Equation:**\n    The number of particles `N` remaining from an initial sample `N₀` after a time `t` in the lab frame is given by the decay law:\n    `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / T_lab)`\n    where `T_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particle in the lab frame.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:**\n    Due to special relativity, the lifetime of a moving particle is dilated. The lab-frame lifetime `T_lab` is related to the particle's proper lifetime `τ` (its lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor `γ`:\n    `T_lab = γ * τ`\n\n3.  **Travel Time:**\n    The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time `t` it takes for them to travel the detector radius `R` is:\n    `t ≈ R / c`\n\n4.  **Combined Formula:**\n    Substituting the expressions for `T_lab` and `t` into the decay law, we get the fraction of particles `N/N₀` that reach the detector wall:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γτ)) = exp(-R / (γcτ))`\n    The term `cτ` is a constant property of the particle, representing its proper decay length.\n\n5.  **Using the Initial Condition:**\n    We are given that for a Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, one-third of the particles reach the detector (`N₁/N₀ = 1/3`). The radius `R` is 30 m.\n    `1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * cτ))`\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * cτ)`\n    `-ln(3) = -1.5 / (cτ)`\n    `ln(3) = 1.5 / (cτ)`  (Equation 1)\n\n6.  **Setting up the Second Condition:**\n    We want to find the new Lorentz factor `γ₂` for which two-thirds of the particles reach the detector (`N₂/N₀ = 2/3`).\n    `2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * cτ))`\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n    `-ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n    `ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`  (Equation 2)\n\n7.  **Solving for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂):**\n    We can solve for `γ₂` by dividing Equation 1 by Equation 2. This cancels out the unknown `cτ` term.\n    `ln(3) / ln(3/2) = (1.5 / cτ) / (30 / (γ₂ * cτ))`\n    `ln(3) / ln(3/2) = (1.5 / cτ) * (γ₂ * cτ / 30)`\n    `ln(3) / ln(3/2) = 1.5 * γ₂ / 30`\n    `ln(3) / ln(3/2) = γ₂ / 20`\n\n    Now, we can isolate `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`\n\n8.  **Calculation:**\n    Using the values `ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`:\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`\n    `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.\n\n<<<C>>>"
