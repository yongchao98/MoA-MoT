    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Product and its Precursor**\n\nThe product in both reactions is a stereoisomer of **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**.\n*   This is a lactone, which is a cyclic ester.\n*   It's a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom (a pyran ring system).\n*   The stereocenter is at carbon-4, which has an ethyl group attached.\n\nLactones are formed by the intramolecular esterification of hydroxy-carboxylic acids. The precursor to this specific six-membered lactone is **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n\n```\n      HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2(5)-OH\n```\n\nDuring lactonization (either by acid-catalyzed esterification or transesterification), the hydroxyl group on C5 attacks the carbonyl carbon of the carboxylic acid (or ester) at C1. This reaction does not affect the stereocenter at C3 of the acid, which becomes C4 in the lactone. Therefore, the stereochemistry (R/S configuration) of the starting material's chiral center is preserved in the final lactone product.\n\n*   An (R)-configured starting material will produce an (R)-lactone.\n*   An (S)-configured starting material will produce an (S)-lactone.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Starting Materials and Reducing Agents**\n\nThe proposed starting materials are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This molecule is a monoester of a dicarboxylic acid (3-ethylglutaric acid). It contains two different carbonyl functional groups:\n1.  A **carboxylic acid** group (-COOH) at one end.\n2.  An **isobutyl ester** group (-COO-iBu) at the other end.\n\n```\n      HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)(5)-O-iBu\n```\nThe stereocenter is at C3.\n\nTo form the lactone, one of these carbonyl groups must be reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH) to create the necessary hydroxy-acid (or hydroxy-ester) precursor. The key to this problem is the chemoselectivity of the two different reducing agents.\n\n*   **BH3 (Borane):** Borane (usually as BH3·THF) is a highly selective reducing agent. It readily reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols but does not typically reduce esters under the same conditions.\n*   **LiBH4 (Lithium Borohydride):** Lithium borohydride is a stronger reducing agent than NaBH4. It reduces esters to primary alcohols. While it can also reduce carboxylic acids, in a molecule containing both an ester and a carboxylic acid, LiBH4 will preferentially reduce the ester. This is because the acidic proton of the carboxylic acid reacts first with the hydride to form a lithium carboxylate salt (`-COO⁻ Li⁺`), which is much less electrophilic and thus resistant to further reduction.\n\n### **Step 3: Apply the Selectivity to Each Reaction**\n\n**Reaction 1:**\n*   **A + LiBH4 + H+ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH4 selectively reduces the **ester** group.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `A` (which is `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu`) reacts with LiBH4. The ester at C5 is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH).\n    2.  The intermediate is the hydroxy-acid: `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-CH2-OH`.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reaction sequence does not affect the stereocenter. Since the product is the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n**Reaction 2:**\n*   **B + BH3 + H+ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**\n*   **Reagent:** BH3 selectively reduces the **carboxylic acid** group.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  `B` (which is `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu`) reacts with BH3. The carboxylic acid at C1 is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH).\n    2.  The intermediate is the hydroxy-ester: `HO-CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-iBu`.\n    3.  The acidic workup (H+) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification (the new OH group attacks the ester carbonyl) to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** This reaction sequence also does not affect the stereocenter. Since the product is the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
