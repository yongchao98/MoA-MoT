    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a trans-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA:** This reagent performs an epoxidation, which is a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent catalyzes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The nucleophile (H₂O) attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide C-O bond, resulting in an *anti*-addition of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups overall.\n*   **Overall Transformation:** The two-step sequence (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The rule for stereospecific addition reactions states that the *anti*-addition to a *trans*-(E)-alkene results in a meso compound.\n    *   (E)-oct-4-ene + anti-dihydroxylation → meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Product of Reaction 1:** A single, achiral meso compound: meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a cis-alkene. It is also an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** The same as in Reaction 1, resulting in an overall *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The rule for stereospecific addition reactions states that the *anti*-addition to a *cis*-(Z)-alkene results in a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n    *   (Z)-oct-4-ene + anti-dihydroxylation → racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n*   **Products of Reaction 2:** A pair of enantiomers, which together form a racemic mixture.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe relationship between these isomers is as follows:\n*   Compounds 2 and 3 are **enantiomers** of each other.\n*   Compound 1 (the meso compound) is a **diastereomer** of both compound 2 and compound 3.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n*   **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Therefore, the meso-diol (1) will be separated from the enantiomeric pair (2 and 3).\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated and will elute at the same time (co-elute).\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **two peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: The co-eluting enantiomers (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   It can also separate diastereomers.\n    *   Since all three stereoisomers in the mixture are chemically distinct in a chiral environment, they will all be separated.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **three peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC chromatogram and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
