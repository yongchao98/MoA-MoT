    "This problem asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\nLet's define the key quantities based on the problem description:\n*   `q`: The charge of the point particle.\n*   $\\vec{s}(t)$: The position vector of the charge as a function of time, representing its trajectory.\n*   $\\vec{r}$: The position vector of the observation point (field point).\n*   $t$: The time at which the fields are observed at $\\vec{r}$.\n*   $t_r$: The retarded time, which is the time at which the signal (electromagnetic field) was emitted from the charge to reach point $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n*   $\\vec{s}(t_r)$: The position of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$: The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   $d = |\\vec{d}| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|$: The distance from the charge's retarded position to the observation point.\n*   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}(t)}{dt}\\Big|_{t=t_r}$: The velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n*   $c$: The speed of light in vacuum.\n\nThe relationship between the observation time $t$ and the retarded time $t_r$ is given by the fact that the signal travels the distance $d$ at the speed of light $c$:\n$t = t_r + \\frac{d}{c} \\implies t - t_r = \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$\n\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials are the solutions to Maxwell's equations for a moving point charge. They are derived from the general formulas for retarded potentials:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t_r)}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}'|} d^3r'$\n\nFor a point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t)$, the charge density $\\rho$ and current density $\\vec{J}$ are given by:\n$\\rho(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n$\\vec{J}(\\vec{r}', t') = q \\vec{v}(t') \\delta^3(\\vec{r}' - \\vec{s}(t'))$\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals and performing the integration (a standard but non-trivial derivation in electromagnetism) yields the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key step involves accounting for the fact that the volume element of the moving charge appears compressed due to the retardation effect. This introduces a factor of $1/(1 - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v} / (dc))$ in the potentials.\n\nThe resulting expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nTo match the format of the given options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{qc\\vec{v}}{dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\frac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (dc - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nThese expressions match option C.\n\nLet's briefly analyze the other options:\n*   A) and D) present the static Coulomb potential form for V, which is incorrect for a moving charge as it neglects the retardation effect. Also, in A), the expression for $\\vec{A}$ is a scalar, which is incorrect.\n*   B) has a plus sign in the denominator ($dc + \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}$). This would correspond to the \"advanced potentials,\" which are solutions to Maxwell's equations but are generally discarded as they violate causality (effects preceding causes). The correct retarded potentials have a minus sign.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option C. It's also worth noting that for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$, which can be verified using the expressions from option C and the relation $c^2 = 1/(\\epsilon_0 \\mu_0)$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
