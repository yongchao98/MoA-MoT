    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order:\n\n**Step 1: Classify the substituents**\n\nFirst, we need to classify the substituent on each benzene ring (C6H5-) as either an *ortho, para*-director or a *meta*-director. This classification determines the primary position of the incoming bromine electrophile.\n\n*   **Ortho, para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho and para to themselves. They generally lead to a high yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   1) -CH3 (Toluene): Activating, *o,p*-director.\n    *   5) -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene): Activating, *o,p*-director.\n    *   3) -Cl (Chlorobenzene): Deactivating, but *o,p*-director.\n*   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position. They produce very little, if any, of the para-isomer.\n    *   4) -NO2 (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating, *m*-director.\n    *   6) -COOH (Benzoic acid): Deactivating, *m*-director.\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate): Deactivating, *m*-director.\n\nBased on this, the substances that are *meta*-directors (4, 6, 2) will have the lowest yield of the para-isomer, while the *ortho, para*-directors (1, 5, 3) will have the highest yields.\n\n**Step 2: Order the *meta*-directors**\n\nFor the *meta*-directing groups, the yield of the para-isomer is extremely low. The order among them depends on their deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group is more selective for the *meta* position, and thus produces an even smaller fraction of the *ortho* and *para* isomers.\n\nThe order of deactivating strength is:\n-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5\n(Nitro > Carboxylic acid > Ester)\n\nTherefore, the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order of their deactivating strength:\nYield(para-NO2) < Yield(para-COOH) < Yield(para-COOC2H5)\n\nSo, the order for these three substances is: **4 < 6 < 2**.\n\n**Step 3: Order the *ortho, para*-directors**\n\nFor the *ortho, para*-directing groups, we need to compare the ratio of the para-isomer to the ortho-isomer. This is influenced by steric and electronic effects.\n\n*   **-CH3 (1) vs. -C2H5 (5):** Both are activating alkyl groups. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). Increased steric bulk hinders the approach of the electrophile to the adjacent *ortho* positions, thus increasing the proportion of substitution at the less hindered *para* position. Therefore, the yield of the para-isomer from ethylbenzene should be greater than that from toluene.\n    *   Order: **1 < 5**\n\n*   **-Cl (3) vs. alkyl groups (1, 5):** The chloro group is an *o,p*-director, but it is deactivating due to its strong inductive electron-withdrawing effect (-I effect). This -I effect is felt more strongly at the *ortho* positions than at the more distant *para* position. This electronic effect, combined with sterics, strongly favors the formation of the *para*-isomer. The bromination of chlorobenzene yields about 89% of the para-isomer, which is a very high selectivity. This percentage is higher than that for toluene (~67%) and is also expected to be higher than for ethylbenzene.\n    *   Order: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\n**Step 4: Combine the orders**\n\nNow, we combine the two groups. The para-isomer yield for any *o,p*-director is significantly higher than for any *m*-director.\n\n*   Order of *m*-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of *o,p*-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nCombining them gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
