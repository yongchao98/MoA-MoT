    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Initial State and Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The antiproton is described as \"slowly moving\". In particle physics, this is a common way to state that the initial kinetic energy of the system is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. Therefore, we can approximate the annihilation as occurring with the proton and antiproton at rest.\n\nThe total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) of the system is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\nThe rest mass energy of a proton is $m_p c^2 \\approx 938 \\text{ MeV}$.\nThe antiproton has the same mass as the proton, so $m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = m_p c^2$.\n\n$E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n$E_{initial} = 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nThis total initial energy must be conserved and will be converted into the total energy of the final particles.\n\n**2. Analyze the Final State**\n\nThe final state consists of four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$. We are given that the rest mass energy of particle A is $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$. Since $A^+$ and $A^-$ are likely antiparticles, they have the same mass.\n\nThe total final energy ($E_{final}$) is the sum of the total energies of these four particles.\n$E_{final} = E_{A_1^+} + E_{A_2^+} + E_{A_1^-} + E_{A_2^-}$\n\nSince the initial system was at rest (total momentum is zero), the total momentum of the final four particles must also be zero due to the conservation of momentum. The problem asks for \"the velocity of particle A\", implying that all four final particles have the same speed and thus the same total energy, $E_A$.\n\nTherefore, $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A$.\n\n**3. Equate Initial and Final Energy**\n\nBy the principle of conservation of energy:\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n$1876 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times E_A$\n\nNow, we can solve for the total energy of a single particle A:\n$E_A = \\frac{1876 \\text{ MeV}}{4} = 469 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**4. Calculate the Velocity**\n\nWe now know the total energy ($E_A$) and the rest mass energy ($m_A c^2$) for one of the A particles. We can use the relativistic energy formula to find its velocity.\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is given by:\n$E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469 \\text{ MeV}}{300 \\text{ MeV}} \\approx 1.563$\n\nNow, we can solve for the velocity $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nPlugging in the value of $\\gamma$:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.563)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.443}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4093}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{0.5907} \\approx 0.7686$\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is $v = \\beta c \\approx 0.77c$.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
