    "This problem asks us to identify the correct starting material (A) and catalyst (B) for the synthesis of 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine from 3-methylpyrrolidine.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reactants and product to determine the reaction type.**\n\n*   **Reactant 1:** 3-methylpyrrolidine. This is a secondary amine because the nitrogen atom is bonded to two carbon atoms (within the ring) and one hydrogen atom.\n*   **Product:** 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Let's analyze the structure. The parent molecule is 3-methylpyrrolidine. A substituent is attached at position 1 (the nitrogen atom). The name of the substituent is \"cyclohexylidenemethyl\". Although the name is slightly ambiguous, in the context of this reaction, it describes an enamine structure. Enamines are characterized by a C=C double bond adjacent to a nitrogen atom (N-C=C).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction of a secondary amine with a carbonyl compound (an aldehyde or a ketone) in the presence of an acid catalyst produces an enamine. This is a type of condensation reaction, often called the Stork enamine synthesis. The overall process involves the formation of a C-N bond and the elimination of a water molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the starting material A.**\n\n*   The enamine product is formed from the secondary amine (3-methylpyrrolidine) and a carbonyl compound (A).\n*   The structure of the product incorporates parts of both starting materials. The 3-methylpyrrolidine part is clear. The \"cyclohexylidenemethyl\" part must come from the carbonyl compound A.\n*   This part of the structure corresponds to a cyclohexyl ring attached to a one-carbon unit. This points to **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde** ((cyclohexyl)-CHO) as the carbonyl starting material.\n*   Let's trace the mechanism:\n    1.  The nitrogen of 3-methylpyrrolidine attacks the carbonyl carbon of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n    2.  After proton transfer, a carbinolamine intermediate is formed.\n    3.  The acid catalyst protonates the hydroxyl group, which then leaves as a water molecule, forming an iminium ion.\n    4.  A proton is removed from a carbon adjacent to the iminium C=N+ bond to form the stable enamine product.\n*   The other option for A is vinylcyclohexane, which is an alkene. Alkenes do not react with secondary amines under these conditions to form enamines.\n*   Therefore, **A must be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the catalyst B.**\n\n*   The reaction is an acid-catalyzed dehydration. We need an acid catalyst to facilitate the removal of the water molecule.\n*   The remaining options for B are TsOH (p-toluenesulfonic acid) and Acetic acid.\n*   **TsOH** is a strong, non-nucleophilic acid. It is a very common and effective catalyst for condensation reactions like the formation of enamines, imines, and acetals. It is typically used in catalytic amounts, often with heating and a Dean-Stark trap to remove the water byproduct and drive the reaction to completion.\n*   **Acetic acid** is a weak acid. It can also be used to catalyze enamine formation, sometimes acting as both the catalyst and the solvent.\n*   Both are plausible catalysts. However, TsOH is a classic, powerful catalyst specifically used for these types of dehydration reactions and is considered a standard choice for ensuring high yields. In the context of a multiple-choice question asking for a suitable catalyst, the strong acid catalyst TsOH is an excellent and very common choice.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Reagent A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.\n*   Catalyst B is an acid, with TsOH being a standard and highly effective choice for this transformation.\n\nTherefore, the most suitable combination of reagents is A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and B = TsOH.\n\n<<<A>>>"
