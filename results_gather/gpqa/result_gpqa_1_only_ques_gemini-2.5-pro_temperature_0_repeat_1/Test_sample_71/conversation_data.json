    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product, 4.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (let's call it **N**), 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, and sodium iodide (NaI).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction of 1,2-bis(dibromomethyl) compounds with sodium iodide is a standard method for generating highly reactive dienes, in this case, o-quinodimethane analogues.\n    *   First, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene reacts with NaI to form the reactive diene, 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene (let's call it **D**). This species is an isomer of o-xylene and is also known as [6]dendralene.\n    *   The diene **D** is generated in situ and trapped by the dienophile **N**.\n    *   **N** (7-tert-butoxynorbornadiene) has two double bonds and acts as a dienophile. Since 2 equivalents of the precursor to **D** are used, a double Diels-Alder reaction occurs, with one molecule of **D** adding to each of the two double bonds of **N**.\n    *   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition. The endocyclic diene system of **D** (the C1=C2-C3=C4 part) reacts with a double bond of **N**.\n    *   This results in **Product 1**, a large, symmetric (possessing a C2 axis) polycyclic molecule, which is the bis-adduct.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1\n*   **Reagents:** Aqueous sulfuric acid (H2SO4/H2O).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of a tert-butyl ether. The bulky tert-butoxy group at the C7 position is cleaved to afford a secondary alcohol.\n    *   **Product 2** is the same as Product 1, but with a hydroxyl (-OH) group at the C7 position instead of the tert-butoxy (-OtBu) group. The overall symmetry of the molecule is maintained.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2 (the secondary alcohol).\n*   **Reagents:** SO3 and pyridine in DMSO (Parikh-Doering oxidation).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a mild oxidation of a secondary alcohol to a ketone.\n    *   The secondary alcohol at C7 is oxidized to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    *   **Product 3** is the corresponding ketone. The C7 position is now a C=O group.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3\n*   **Conditions:** Heating at 150 °C.\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 is a Diels-Alder adduct. Heating such adducts often leads to a retro-Diels-Alder (rDA) reaction.\n    *   Product 3 undergoes a double rDA reaction, reversing the cycloadditions from Step 1.\n    *   This fragmentation releases two molecules of the diene **D** (5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene) and one molecule of the original dienophile core, which is now bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one.\n    *   Bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one is thermally unstable. It readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination to lose a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO), forming the very stable aromatic molecule, benzene.\n    *   The overall transformation is: Product 3 → 2 **D** + Benzene + CO.\n    *   The question asks for the final product, **4**. In the context of such problems, this typically refers to the main organic component that was built up and then released. Benzene and CO are small, simple byproducts. The complex diene **D** is the molecule of interest. So, **Product 4 is D**.\n\n**Analysis of Product 4**\n\n*   **Product 4** = **D** = 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n*   **Structure:** A six-membered ring with double bonds at C1-C2 and C3-C4. There are exocyclic double bonds (=CH2) at positions C5 and C6. The ring is not planar but puckered.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule is chiral due to the puckered ring and lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Therefore, its point group is C1 (asymmetric).\n*   **Chemically Distinct Hydrogens:** In a molecule with C1 symmetry, all protons that are not constitutionally equivalent are chemically distinct. Furthermore, protons that are constitutionally equivalent but diastereotopic are also chemically distinct.\n    1.  **Ring Protons:** There are 6 protons attached to the ring carbons (one each on C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6). Due to the lack of symmetry in the molecular graph, all six of these protons are constitutionally non-equivalent and thus chemically distinct. This gives **6 signals**.\n    2.  **Exocyclic Protons:** There are two exocyclic methylene (=CH2) groups, one at C5 and one at C6.\n        *   At C5: The two protons of the =CH2 group are attached to the same carbon, but they are in a chiral environment. This makes them diastereotopic, and therefore chemically non-equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   At C6: Similarly, the two protons of the =CH2 group at C6 are also diastereotopic and chemically non-equivalent. This gives another **2 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Count:** The total number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is the sum of all these unique positions: 6 (from the ring) + 2 (from =CH2 at C5) + 2 (from =CH2 at C6) = **10**.\n\nTherefore, there are 10 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
