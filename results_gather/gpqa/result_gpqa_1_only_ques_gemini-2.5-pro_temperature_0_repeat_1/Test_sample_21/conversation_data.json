    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct combination.\n\n### Part 1: Thermodynamics (Oxidizing Strength)\n\nThe strength of an oxidizing agent is determined by its standard reduction potential (E°). A more positive E° value indicates a stronger oxidant because it has a greater tendency to be reduced (i.e., to accept electrons).\n\nWe need to compare the reduction potential of oxygen in acidic and basic solutions.\n\n*   **In acidic solution:** The half-reaction is:\n    O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)\n    The standard reduction potential for this reaction is **E° = +1.23 V**.\n\n*   **In basic solution:** The half-reaction is:\n    O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq)\n    The standard reduction potential for this reaction is **E° = +0.40 V**.\n\nComparing the two values, +1.23 V is more positive than +0.40 V. This means that oxygen is a **stronger** oxidant in acidic solution. Consequently, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n\nSo, the first part of the statement is: \"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\"\n\n### Part 2: Kinetics (Reaction Rate)\n\nKinetics deals with the speed of a reaction. The reduction of oxygen is known to be a kinetically slow process due to the high energy required to break the strong O=O double bond.\n\nThe question asks to compare the reaction rate in acidic versus basic solutions.\n\n*   The overall reaction for oxygen reduction is a complex, multi-electron process.\n*   In acidic solutions, the presence of a high concentration of protons (H⁺) can facilitate the reaction pathways. Protons can participate directly in the rate-determining steps, often by protonating oxygen or its intermediates, which weakens the O-O bond and lowers the activation energy.\n*   In electrochemistry, this is observed as a lower overpotential for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acidic media compared to basic media on many catalysts. A lower overpotential means the reaction proceeds more easily and thus **faster** at a given potential.\n\nSo, the second part of the statement is: \"Kinetically, oxygen reacts **faster** in acidic solutions.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the two parts, we get:\n\n*   Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.\n*   Kinetically, oxygen reacts **faster** in acidic solutions.\n\nThis corresponds to the combination **weaker – faster**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
