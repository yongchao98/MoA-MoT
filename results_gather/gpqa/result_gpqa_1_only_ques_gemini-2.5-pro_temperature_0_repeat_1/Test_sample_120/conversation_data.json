    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the product of the reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n\n*   **Core Structure:** `bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring fused with a cyclopropane ring. The `7-oxa` part indicates that the single-atom bridge is an oxygen, meaning we have an epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring. The epoxide is across carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Substituents:** Methyl groups are located at C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** We need to establish the 3D structure from the given (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S) configuration.\n    *   Let's draw a planar representation of the cyclohexane ring with C1 at the top and numbering clockwise.\n    *   The epoxide can be either above the plane (beta, wedged) or below the plane (alpha, dashed). The fusion must be *cis*, so the substituents at C1 (methyl) and C6 (hydrogen) that are part of the cyclohexane ring must be on the opposite side of the epoxide.\n    *   Let's assume the epoxide is **alpha (down, dashed)**. This means the C1-Me and C6-H bonds point **beta (up, wedged)**.\n    *   Let's verify the stereocenters with this assumption:\n        *   **C1:** Priorities are O > C6 > C2 > Me. With the Me group wedged (up), the sequence O→C6→C2 is counter-clockwise, which gives **(1R)**. This matches.\n        *   **C6:** Priorities are O > C1 > C5 > H. With the H atom wedged (up), the sequence O→C1→C5 is clockwise, which gives **(6S)**. This matches.\n        *   **C3 & C4:** The (3R) and (4R) configurations correspond to the methyl groups at C3 and C4 also being **beta (up, wedged)**. (This can be confirmed with priority rules, but for brevity, we accept the given name).\n\n**Summary of Starting Material Structure:**\n*   A cyclohexane ring with an **alpha (downward)** epoxide fused across C1 and C6.\n*   The methyl group at C1 is **beta (upward)**.\n*   The methyl group at C3 is **beta (upward)**.\n*   The methyl group at C4 is **beta (upward)**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate or Gilman reagent).\n*   **Reaction:** Nucleophilic opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Key Principles:**\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** Organocuprates are soft nucleophiles and attack the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack occurs via an Sₙ2 mechanism, resulting in **inversion of configuration** at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n\n**3. Predict the Product**\n\n*   **Site of Attack (Regioselectivity):**\n    *   The epoxide is formed by C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 is a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, **C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon**, and the nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻) from the cuprate will attack C6.\n\n*   **Stereochemistry of Attack:**\n    *   The attack is Sₙ2-like and must occur from the side opposite the C-O bond being broken.\n    *   The C6-O bond of the epoxide is **alpha (down)**.\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophile (Me⁻) must attack C6 from the **beta (up) side**.\n\n*   **Resulting Structure:**\n    *   The attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen remains attached to C1 and, after an acidic workup (which is implicit in such reactions), becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The product is a cyclohexanol.\n    *   Let's trace the positions and stereochemistry of all groups in the product. For IUPAC naming, we must renumber the ring so that the carbon with the -OH group is C1.\n\n**4. Determine the IUPAC Name and Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nLet's map the old atom numbers to the new IUPAC numbering for the cyclohexanol product:\n*   Old C1 → New C1 (bears the -OH group)\n*   Old C6 → New C2\n*   Old C5 → New C3\n*   Old C4 → New C4\n*   Old C3 → New C5\n*   Old C2 → New C6\n\nNow, let's determine the configuration of each stereocenter in the product:\n\n*   **New C1 (Old C1):**\n    *   This center is not directly attacked. Its spatial configuration is retained.\n    *   The starting configuration was **(1R)**. The priorities of the attached groups do not change in a way that would flip the descriptor. So, the product is **(1R)**.\n    *   The -OH group is alpha (down), and the original methyl group is beta (up).\n\n*   **New C2 (Old C6):**\n    *   This is the site of attack, so its configuration is inverted.\n    *   The starting configuration was **(6S)**. Inversion means the product will be **(2R)**.\n    *   Let's confirm: The incoming methyl group is beta (up). The original H at C6 (which was beta) is pushed to the alpha (down) position. Priorities are C1 > C5 > Me > H. With H pointing away (alpha), the sequence C1→C5→Me is clockwise, which is **(R)**. So, the configuration is **(2R)**.\n\n*   **New C4 (Old C4):**\n    *   This center is unaffected by the reaction. Its configuration is retained.\n    *   The starting configuration was **(4R)**, so the product is **(4R)**.\n\n*   **New C5 (Old C3):**\n    *   This center is also unaffected. Its configuration is retained.\n    *   The starting configuration was **(3R)**, so the product is **(5R)**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe product has four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The full stereochemical descriptor is (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R).\n\nThe final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
