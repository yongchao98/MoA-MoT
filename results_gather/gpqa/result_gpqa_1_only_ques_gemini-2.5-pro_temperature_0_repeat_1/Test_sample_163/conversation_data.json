    "Here is a step-by-step solution to determine the mass ratio of the two binary star systems.\n\n### 1. Understand the Physics\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass of the system (M_total = m1 + m2) can be related to the orbital period (P) and the radial velocity amplitudes (K1 and K2) of the two stars. The key relationship is derived from Kepler's Third Law and the definitions of radial velocity.\n\nThe formula for the total mass is:\nM_total = (P / (2 * π * G)) * (K1 + K2)^3 / sin^3(i)\n\nWhere:\n*   `M_total` is the sum of the masses of the two stars.\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `K1` and `K2` are the amplitudes of the radial velocities.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n\n### 2. Use the Information about Eclipses\nThe problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. For an eclipse to occur, the orbital plane must be aligned almost perfectly with our line of sight. This means the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90 degrees.\nIf `i` ≈ 90°, then `sin(i)` ≈ 1, and `sin^3(i)` ≈ 1.\n\nThis simplifies the mass formula to:\nM_total ≈ (P / (2 * π * G)) * (K1 + K2)^3\n\nThis shows that the total mass is directly proportional to the period and the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes:\nM_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)^3\n\n### 3. Set up the Ratio\nWe need to find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2. This is the ratio M_total_1 / M_total_2.\n\nUsing the proportionality from the previous step, we can write the ratio as:\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = [P1 * (K1_1 + K1_2)^3] / [P2 * (K2_1 + K2_2)^3]\n\nWhere the subscripts `1` and `2` refer to system_1 and system_2, respectively.\n\n### 4. Plug in the Given Values\nLet's list the values for each system:\n\n**System 1:**\n*   Period (P1) = 2 years\n*   Sum of RV amplitudes (K1_1 + K1_2) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**System 2:**\n*   Period (P2) = 1 year\n*   Sum of RV amplitudes (K2_1 + K2_2) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, substitute these values into the ratio formula. Note that since we are taking a ratio, we can keep the units as years and km/s as long as they are consistent between the two systems.\n\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = [2 * (15)^3] / [1 * (25)^3]\n\n### 5. Calculate the Result\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 2 * (15 / 25)^3\n\nFirst, simplify the fraction inside the parenthesis:\n15 / 25 = 3 / 5 = 0.6\n\nNow, substitute this back into the equation:\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 2 * (0.6)^3\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 2 * (0.6 * 0.6 * 0.6)\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 2 * 0.216\nM_total_1 / M_total_2 = 0.432\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 0.432.\n\n### 6. Compare with Options\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) ~ 0.7\nB) ~ 0.6\nC) ~ 1.2\nD) ~ 0.4\n\nThe value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
