    "An electric dipole transition in the hydrogen atom is governed by the following selection rules for the quantum numbers $|n,l,m\\rangle$:\n1.  The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n2.  The change in the magnetic quantum number must be $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$.\n3.  The change in the principal quantum number $n$ is not restricted, i.e., $\\Delta n$ can be any integer.\n\nThe problem describes a two-step decay from the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. Let the intermediate state be $|n',l',m'\\rangle$. The problem specifies that the intermediate state has $n'=2$.\n\n**Step 1: First transition $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,l',m'\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Initial state:** $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$, so $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n*   **Applying the selection rule for $l$:** $\\Delta l = l' - l = l' - 0 = \\pm 1$. Since $l'$ must be non-negative, we must have $l'=1$.\n*   **Applying the selection rule for $m$:** $\\Delta m = m' - m = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1$. So, the possible values for $m'$ are $-1, 0, 1$.\n\nThus, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Second transition $|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n\n*   **Final state:** $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$, so $n_f=1, l_f=0, m_f=0$.\n*   **Applying the selection rule for $l$:** $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is allowed.\n*   **Applying the selection rule for $m$:** $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This must be $0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible intermediate states ($m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$).\n\nAll three possible routes are allowed by the selection rules. Now we must determine the probability for each route.\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the probability**\n\nThe probability of a specific cascade route $|i\\rangle \\rightarrow |k\\rangle \\rightarrow |f\\rangle$ is given by the branching ratio of the first transition, $P(|i\\rangle \\rightarrow |k\\rangle)$, multiplied by the probability of the second transition, $P(|k\\rangle \\rightarrow |f\\rangle)$.\n\nFor the second transition, the intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ can only decay to the ground state $|1,0,0\\rangle$ via an E1 transition (since there are no other lower energy states with $l=0$ or $l=2$ that it can decay to). Therefore, the probability of the second step is 1 for any of the intermediate states.\n$P(|2,1,m'\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = 1$.\n\nThe problem thus reduces to finding the branching ratios for the first transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle$.\n\nThe transition rate is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element. The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (since $l=0$). Due to this symmetry, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the decay must populate each of the possible final magnetic sublevels ($m'=-1, 0, 1$) with equal probability.\n\nSince there are three possible final $m'$ states, the probability (branching ratio) for the transition to any one of them is $1/3$.\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) = 1/3$\n*   $P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle) = 1/3$\n\nThe total probability for each of the three possible cascade routes is therefore $1/3$.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluating the options**\n\nLet's check the given options:\nA) Route: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. This is a valid route. The calculated probability is $1/3$. The option gives $\\frac{1}{4}$. Incorrect.\nB) Route: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. This is a valid route. The calculated probability is $1/3$. The option gives $\\frac{2}{3}$. Incorrect.\nC) Route: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. This is a valid route. The calculated probability is $1/3$. The option gives $\\frac{1}{4}$. Incorrect.\nD) Route: $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$. This is a valid route. The calculated probability is $1/3$. The option gives $\\frac{1}{3}$. Correct.\n\nOnly option D provides a valid transition route with the correctly calculated probability.\n\n<<<D>>>"
