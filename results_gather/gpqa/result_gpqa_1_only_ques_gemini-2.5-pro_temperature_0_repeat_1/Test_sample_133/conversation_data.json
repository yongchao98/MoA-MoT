    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the enthalpy of neutralization.\n\n**1. Calculate the total moles of H+ ions from the acids.**\n\n*   **From HCl (a strong monoprotic acid):**\n    *   Moles of HCl = Molarity × Volume\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.2 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.10 mol\n    *   Since HCl is monoprotic (HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻), moles of H⁺ = 0.10 mol.\n\n*   **From H₂SO₄ (a strong diprotic acid):**\n    *   Moles of H₂SO₄ = Molarity × Volume\n    *   Moles of H₂SO₄ = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.09 mol\n    *   Since H₂SO₄ is diprotic (H₂SO₄ → 2H⁺ + SO₄²⁻), moles of H⁺ = 2 × 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol.\n\n*   **Total moles of H⁺:**\n    *   Total H⁺ = (moles from HCl) + (moles from H₂SO₄)\n    *   Total H⁺ = 0.10 mol + 0.18 mol = 0.28 mol\n\n**2. Calculate the total moles of OH⁻ ions from the base.**\n\n*   **From Ba(OH)₂ (a strong base):**\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = Molarity × Volume\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.5 mol/L × 0.200 L = 0.10 mol\n    *   Since Ba(OH)₂ provides two hydroxide ions (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻), moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n**3. Determine the limiting reactant for the neutralization reaction.**\n\nThe neutralization reaction is: H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → H₂O(l)\n*   We have 0.28 mol of H⁺ and 0.20 mol of OH⁻.\n*   Since the reaction is 1:1, the reactant with the fewer moles (OH⁻) is the limiting reactant.\n*   Therefore, only 0.20 moles of H⁺ will react with 0.20 moles of OH⁻ to form 0.20 moles of water.\n\n**4. Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization.**\n\nThe standard enthalpy of neutralization for the reaction between a strong acid and a strong base is approximately **-13.7 kcal/mol** (or -57.1 kJ/mol). This is the heat released when one mole of water is formed.\n\n*   Total heat released = (moles of water formed) × (enthalpy of neutralization per mole)\n*   Total heat released = 0.20 mol × (-13.7 kcal/mol)\n*   Total heat released = -2.74 kcal\n\nThis value is very close to option A. The slight difference is due to using a more precise value of -13.6 kcal/mol, which is also commonly cited.\n*   Total heat released = 0.20 mol × (-13.6 kcal/mol) = **-2.72 kcal**\n\n**Note on Precipitation:**\nIn this reaction, Ba²⁺ ions from Ba(OH)₂ and SO₄²⁻ ions from H₂SO₄ will react to form a precipitate, BaSO₄.\n*   Moles of Ba²⁺ = 0.10 mol\n*   Moles of SO₄²⁻ = 0.09 mol\nThis precipitation reaction (Ba²⁺ + SO₄²⁻ → BaSO₄(s)) also releases heat. However, the term \"enthalpy of neutralization\" specifically refers to the heat released from the H⁺ + OH⁻ reaction. Given the options, it is clear the question is only asking for the heat from the neutralization process itself.\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of neutralization is -2.72 kcal.\n\n<<<A>>>"
