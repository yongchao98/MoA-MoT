    "Here is a step-by-step calculation of the energies for the system.\n\n**1. Single-Particle Energy Levels**\n\nFor a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the allowed energy levels are given by:\n$E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nwhere n = 1, 2, 3, ... is the principal quantum number.\n\nThe problem defines the base energy unit as $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\nSo, the single-particle energy levels can be written as:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n*   and so on.\n\n**2. Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\nThe system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles. Since they are spin-1/2 particles, they are fermions. The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state is defined by both its spatial part (the energy level n) and its spin part (spin up or spin down). This means each energy level $E_n$ can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n**3. Ground State Energy ($E_{GS}$)**\n\nTo find the ground state energy, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n*   The lowest energy level is $n=1$ (energy E). We can place two particles here (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   The next lowest energy level is $n=2$ (energy 4E). We can place the remaining two particles here.\n\nThe ground state configuration is:\n*   2 particles in the n=1 level\n*   2 particles in the n=2 level\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n$E_{GS} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = (2 \\times E) + (2 \\times 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n**4. First Excited State Energy ($E_{1st}$)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. We can achieve this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   In the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2, and the lowest unoccupied level is n=3.\n*   We promote one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n\nThe first excited state configuration is:\n*   2 particles in the n=1 level\n*   1 particle in the n=2 level\n*   1 particle in the n=3 level\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n**5. Second Excited State Energy ($E_{2nd}$)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We need to consider all possible single-particle promotions from the ground state and find the one with the second-lowest energy.\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excitation (already found):** Promote a particle from n=2 to n=3. Energy = 15E.\n*   **Other Possible Excitations:**\n    *   **Option A:** Promote a particle from n=1 to n=3. The configuration would be: 1 particle in n=1, 2 particles in n=2, and 1 particle in n=3.\n        Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (1 \\times E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n    *   **Option B:** Promote a second particle from n=2 to n=3. The configuration would be: 2 particles in n=1, 0 particles in n=2, and 2 particles in n=3.\n        Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times E) + (2 \\times 9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n\nComparing the energies of the excited states:\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Next lowest energy state: 18E\n*   Then: 20E\n\nTherefore, the second excited state has an energy of 18E.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe energies of the states are:\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
