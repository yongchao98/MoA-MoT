    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the mass fraction of fluorine in A2.**\n    The problem states that substance A2 has a mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) of 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YF_n, where Y is the unknown element and n is the number of fluorine atoms.\n    The molar mass of Fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n    The mass fraction is given by the formula:\n    ɷF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n    Rearranging for the molar mass of Y, M(Y):\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * n * 19.00 = n * 19.00\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 19.00 * (1 - 0.3196)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 19.00 * 0.6804\n    M(Y) = n * (12.9276 / 0.3196)\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    We can test integer values for n to find a plausible element Y:\n    *   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Ca, K - unlikely to form 5 fluorides)\n    *   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Br - forms BrF, BrF3, BrF5)\n    *   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (close to Sb - Antimony, M=121.76 g/mol)\n    *   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (close to Dy - unlikely)\n    *   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol (close to Hg, Bi)\n    *   n=6: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (close to Pu, Am)\n\n    Let's check the mass percentage for the most likely candidates more precisely:\n    *   For Y=Sb (Antimony) and n=3, A2 would be SbF3.\n        M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n        ɷF = (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%. This is a very close match to the given 31.96%.\n    *   For Y=Pu (Plutonium) and n=6, A2 would be PuF6.\n        M(PuF6) = 244 + 6 * 19.00 = 358 g/mol.\n        ɷF = (6 * 19.00) / 358 = 114 / 358 ≈ 0.3184 or 31.84%. This is also a very close match.\n\n2.  **Analyze the properties of the compounds to distinguish between Sb and Pu.**\n    *   **Decomposition of A1:** \"A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine.\" This means A1 -> A2 + F2. A1 must be a higher fluoride than A2.\n        *   If Y=Pu and A2=PuF6, then A1 would have to be a fluoride higher than PuF6 (e.g., PuF8), which is not known to exist as a stable compound. This path contradicts known chemistry.\n        *   If Y=Sb and A2=SbF3, then A1 would be a higher fluoride that decomposes to SbF3 and F2. This would be SbF5. The reaction is SbF5 -> SbF3 + F2.\n    *   **Properties of A1:** \"bright-red substance A1\", \"decomposes at 293 K\", \"oxidizes xenon\".\n        *   SbF5 is a colorless liquid/solid and is stable well above 293 K (boils at 149.5 °C). This contradicts the description of A1.\n    *   **Properties of A4 and the reaction to form A5:** \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n        *   This part of the problem provides clues to identify A4. The problem asks for the molecular weight range of A4.\n\n3.  **Identify A4.**\n    Let's assume Y=Sb, as it provides a chemically plausible (if flawed) path. The flaws in the description of A1 might be errors in the problem statement.\n    The five compounds (A1 to A5) are binary fluorides of Y (Antimony). So A4 must be an antimony fluoride. The known simple fluorides are SbF3 and SbF5.\n    *   **Possibility 1: A4 = SbF5.**\n        M(SbF5) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = 216.76 g/mol. This value does not fall into any of the given ranges.\n    *   **Possibility 2: A4 = SbF3.**\n        M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol. This value falls squarely in the range **C) 160-180**.\n\n4.  **Check for consistency.**\n    If we assume A4 = SbF3, let's see if it fits the description.\n    *   **Molecular Weight:** 178.76 g/mol is in the range 160-180. This works.\n    *   **\"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\"**: SbF3 is a colorless solid. It is soluble in solvents like anhydrous HF, forming a colorless solution. This is consistent.\n    *   **A2 = SbF3**: We identified A2 as SbF3 from the mass percentage. This means A2 and A4 are the same substance, which is permissible.\n\n    While there are inconsistencies in the problem statement regarding the properties of A1 (SbF5) and the stoichiometry of the reaction to form A5, the identification of A4 as SbF3 is strongly supported by:\n    a) The mass percentage of A2 pointing to SbF3.\n    b) The molecular weight of SbF3 fitting perfectly into one of the answer choices.\n    c) The physical property of A4 (forming a colorless solution) being consistent with SbF3.\n\nTherefore, the most logical conclusion is that A4 is SbF3, and its molecular weight is approximately 178.8 g/mol.\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 (178.8 g/mol) falls within the range 160-180.\n\n<<<C>>>"
