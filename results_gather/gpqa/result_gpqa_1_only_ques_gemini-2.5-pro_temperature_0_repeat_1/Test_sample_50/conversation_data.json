    "This problem can be solved using the method of images. The electric field and potential outside the grounded conducting sphere, due to the point charge `q`, are identical to the field and potential produced by the original charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere, with the sphere itself removed.\n\n**1. Finding the Image Charge (q') and its Position (b)**\n\nFor a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` and a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from its center (`d > R`), the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (distance from the center along the same line as `q`) are chosen to make the potential on the spherical surface (at radius `R`) equal to zero. The standard results for this configuration are:\n\n*   **Position of the image charge:** `b = R^2 / d`\n*   **Magnitude of the image charge:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n\nThe image charge `q'` is located at a distance `b` from the center, and the real charge `q` is at a distance `d` from the center.\n\n**2. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d` from the center of the grounded sphere.\n\nA common mistake is to calculate the potential energy of the two-charge system (`q` and `q'`) directly as `U = kqq' / (d-b)`. This is incorrect because the image charge `q'` is not a fixed charge; its magnitude and position depend on the position of the real charge `q`.\n\nThe correct way to calculate the energy is to use the formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`, where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by all other charges (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere).\n\n*   The potential at the location of `q` (at distance `d`) due to the induced charges on the sphere is equivalent to the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that same location.\n*   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b`) is `d - b`.\n*   So, `V_induced` is the potential at `d` due to `q'` at `b`:\n    `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n`V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n`d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nSubstitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n`V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n`V_induced = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, calculate the potential energy `U`:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n**Alternative Method (Work Integral):**\nThe potential energy is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to `d`. The force on the charge `q` at a distance `x` from the center is the force exerted by the image charge:\n`F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2 = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2 = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\nThe potential energy is the integral of the external force (`-F(x)`) from infinity to `d`:\n`U = ∫(from ∞ to d) -F(x) dx = ∫(from ∞ to d) [k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\nUsing the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, the integral evaluates to:\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\nThe correct answer is `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
