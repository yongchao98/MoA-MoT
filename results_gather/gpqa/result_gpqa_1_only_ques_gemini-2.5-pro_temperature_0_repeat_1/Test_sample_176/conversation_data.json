    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L1) to the luminosity of Star_2 (L2), which is L1 / L2.\n\n**2. Identify Relevant Physical Principles**\n*   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it's a black body, is related to its radius (R) and surface temperature (T). The formula is:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   **Wien's Displacement Law:** This law connects the surface temperature (T) of a black body to the wavelength at which it emits the most radiation (its peak wavelength, λ_rest). This wavelength is measured in the star's own rest frame. The formula is:\n    λ_rest = b / T\n    where b is Wien's displacement constant. This implies that T is inversely proportional to λ_rest (T ∝ 1/λ_rest).\n*   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength (λ_obs) of light from a moving source is shifted relative to the wavelength emitted in its rest frame (λ_rest). The shift depends on the source's radial velocity (v_r) relative to the observer. For non-relativistic speeds:\n    λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c)\n    where c is the speed of light. A positive v_r indicates the source is moving away (redshift), and a negative v_r indicates it is moving closer (blueshift).\n\n**3. Formulate the Luminosity Ratio**\nUsing the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the ratio of the luminosities is:\nL1 / L2 = (4π(R1)²σ(T1)⁴) / (4π(R2)²σ(T2)⁴)\nThe constants 4, π, and σ cancel out, leaving:\nL1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)² * (T1 / T2)⁴\n\n**4. Use the Given Information**\n*   **Radius Ratio:** We are given R1 = 1.5 * R2, so (R1 / R2) = 1.5.\n    (R1 / R2)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n*   **Temperature Ratio:** We need to find (T1 / T2). From Wien's Law, T ∝ 1/λ_rest, so:\n    (T1 / T2) = (λ_rest2 / λ_rest1)\n    Therefore, (T1 / T2)⁴ = (λ_rest2 / λ_rest1)⁴.\n\n**5. Determine the Ratio of Rest-Frame Wavelengths (λ_rest2 / λ_rest1)**\nThe problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs1 = λ_obs2. We must use the Doppler effect to relate these observed wavelengths to the rest-frame wavelengths.\n\n*   **For Star_1:** v_r1 = 0 km/s. There is no Doppler shift.\n    λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 * (1 + 0/c) = λ_rest1.\n*   **For Star_2:** v_r2 = 700 km/s. The star is moving away, causing a redshift.\n    λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2 / c).\n\nSince λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, we can set the expressions equal:\nλ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2 / c)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio we need for the temperature calculation:\nλ_rest2 / λ_rest1 = 1 / (1 + v_r2 / c)\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Luminosity Ratio**\nSubstitute the expressions for the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\nL1 / L2 = (R1 / R2)² * (λ_rest2 / λ_rest1)⁴\nL1 / L2 = (2.25) * [ 1 / (1 + v_r2 / c) ]⁴\nL1 / L2 = 2.25 / (1 + v_r2 / c)⁴\n\nNow, plug in the numerical values:\n*   v_r2 = 700 km/s\n*   c (speed of light) ≈ 300,000 km/s\n\nL1 / L2 = 2.25 / (1 + 700 / 300000)⁴\nL1 / L2 = 2.25 / (1 + 7 / 3000)⁴\nL1 / L2 = 2.25 / (1.002333...)⁴\nL1 / L2 = 2.25 / 1.009355...\nL1 / L2 ≈ 2.2292\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23.\n\nThe information about the mass of the stars is extra information not needed for this calculation, as the problem specifies to treat them as black bodies.\n\nComparing our result to the given options:\nA) ~2.25 (This would be the answer if the Doppler effect were ignored)\nB) ~2.23 (This matches our calculation)\nC) ~2.32\nD) ~2.35\n\nThe correct factor is ~2.23.\n\n<<<B>>>"
