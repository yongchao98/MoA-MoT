    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product.\n\n**1. Identify the Starting Material and its Structure**\n\nThe starting material is **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with one double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group. By convention, this is at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl**: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is at position 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) is at position 5.\n\nThe structure contains the following features that contribute to the index of hydrogen deficiency:\n*   One ring\n*   One C=C double bond within the ring\n*   One C=C double bond in the vinyl group\n*   One C=O double bond in the formyl (aldehyde) group\n*   One C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid group\n\nThe IHD of the starting material is the sum of rings and pi bonds: 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=O in acid) = **5**.\n\n**2. Identify the Reagent and the Reaction**\n\nThe reagent is **red phosphorus and excess of HI**. This is a very strong reducing agent known for the complete reduction of oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon-carbon multiple bonds. Specifically:\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) to alkane groups (-CH₃).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It does not break the carbon ring structure.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Product**\n\nThe reaction will cause the following transformations:\n*   The C=C double bond in the cyclohexene ring is reduced to a C-C single bond, forming a **cyclohexane** ring.\n*   The C=C double bond in the vinyl group (-CH=CH₂) is reduced, converting it to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂-CH₃).\n*   The formyl group (-CHO) is reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH₃).\n\nThe final product is a substituted **cyclohexane**. It is a saturated molecule, meaning it contains only single bonds, but it still has a ring structure.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is calculated as:\nIHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds)\n\nFor the product:\n*   **Number of rings**: The cyclohexane ring is preserved. So, there is **1** ring.\n*   **Number of π bonds**: All double bonds (C=C and C=O) have been reduced to single bonds. So, there are **0** π bonds.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product is:\nIHD = 1 + 0 = **1**\n\nAlternatively, we can determine the molecular formula.\n*   Starting material (C₁₀H₁₂O₃) has 10 carbon atoms. The reduction does not change the number of carbons.\n*   The product is a substituted cycloalkane with 10 carbon atoms. The general formula for a monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane) is CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   For n=10, the formula is C₁₀H₂₀.\n*   Using the IHD formula: IHD = C + 1 - (H/2) = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1, which corresponds to the single ring in the saturated structure.\n\n<<<D>>>"
