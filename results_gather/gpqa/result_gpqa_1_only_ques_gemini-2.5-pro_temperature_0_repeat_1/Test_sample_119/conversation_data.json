    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the relationship between the number of stars and parallax.\n\n1.  **Assumption:** We assume that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (number of stars per unit volume), is constant everywhere.\n\n2.  **Number of Stars at a Certain Distance:** Let's consider the number of stars, `dN`, located in a thin spherical shell at a distance `d` from us, with a small thickness `dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell, `dV`, is its surface area (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`).\n    *   `dV = 4πd² dd`\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars `dN` in this volume is:\n    *   `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² dd`\n\n3.  **Relating Distance and Parallax:** Parallax (`plx`) is defined as the inverse of the distance (`d`) to a star.\n    *   `plx = 1/d`\n    *   This also means `d = 1/plx`.\n\n4.  **Changing Variables from Distance to Parallax:** Our goal is to find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. To do this, we need to express `d` and `dd` in our equation for `dN` in terms of `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   We already have `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   To find `dd`, we differentiate `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d(1/plx)/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    *   So, `dd = - (1/plx²) d(plx)`. The negative sign indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. When we consider the number of stars in a given range, we are interested in the magnitude, so we can ignore the negative sign.\n\n5.  **Substituting into the Star Count Equation:** Now we substitute our expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation `dN = 4πρd² dd`:\n    *   `dN = 4πρ * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    *   `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Finding the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax, we divide by `d(plx)`:\n    *   `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Since `4πρ` is a constant, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\n`dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
