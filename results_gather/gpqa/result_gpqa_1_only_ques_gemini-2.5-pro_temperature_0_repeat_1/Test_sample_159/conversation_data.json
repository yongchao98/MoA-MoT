    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the solution:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Aperture Shape**\n\nThe problem describes an aperture in the shape of an N-sided regular polygon where N is infinitely large (N → ∞). A key piece of information is that the apothem of this polygon is 'a'. The apothem is the perpendicular distance from the center of the polygon to one of its sides.\n\nAs the number of sides N of a regular polygon increases to infinity, the polygon approaches a circle. The apothem of the polygon becomes the radius of this limiting circle. Therefore, the aperture can be treated as a circular aperture of radius **r = a**.\n\n**Step 2: Recall Fraunhofer Diffraction for a Circular Aperture**\n\nWhen monochromatic light passes through a circular aperture, it produces a diffraction pattern known as the Airy pattern. The intensity `I` of the diffracted light at an angle `θ` from the central axis is given by:\n\n`I(θ) = I₀ * [2 * J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) / (k * a * sin(θ))]²`\n\nwhere:\n*   `I₀` is the maximum intensity at the center.\n*   `J₁` is the Bessel function of the first kind, of order one.\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   `λ` is the wavelength of the light.\n*   `θ` is the angular position from the center.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Angular Positions of the Minima**\n\nThe intensity minima (dark rings) occur at angles `θ` where the numerator of the intensity formula is zero, i.e., `J₁(k * a * sin(θ)) = 0`.\n\nThe minima correspond to the zeros of the Bessel function `J₁(x)`. Let `x_m` be the m-th zero of `J₁(x)`. The first few zeros are:\n*   `x₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   `x₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n*   `x₃ ≈ 10.1735`\n*   ...\n\nThe condition for the m-th minimum is:\n`k * a * sin(θ_m) = x_m`\n\nSubstituting `k = 2π / λ`:\n`(2π / λ) * a * sin(θ_m) = x_m`\n\nSolving for `sin(θ_m)`:\n`sin(θ_m) = (x_m * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\nThe problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`), so the angular position of the m-th minimum is:\n`θ_m = (x_m * λ) / (2π * a)`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Positions of the First Two Minima**\n\n*   **First Minimum (m=1):**\n    Using `x₁ ≈ 3.8317`:\n    `θ₁ = (3.8317 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n\n*   **Second Minimum (m=2):**\n    Using `x₂ ≈ 7.0156`:\n    `θ₂ = (7.0156 * λ) / (2π * a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Angular Distance Between the First Two Minima**\n\nThe angular distance `Δθ` is the difference between the angular positions of the second and first minima:\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`\n`Δθ = [1.1166 * (λ / a)] - [0.6098 * (λ / a)]`\n`Δθ = (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ = 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\n\n**Step 6: Compare with the Options**\n\nThe calculated value `Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)` is closest to option B.\n\n*   A) 1.220 λ /a  (This is the angular *diameter* of the central maximum, `2 * θ₁`)\n*   B) 0.506 λ / a  (This matches our calculation for `θ₂ - θ₁`)\n*   C) 0.500 λ / a\n*   D) 0.610 λ / a  (This is the angular position of the *first* minimum, `θ₁`)\n\nTherefore, the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately `0.506 λ / a`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
