    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the correct equation.\n\n1.  **The Boltzmann Equation:** The problem states that the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). This allows us to use the Boltzmann equation to describe the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy states (an excited state `j` and a lower state `i`). The equation is:\n\n    N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-(E_j - E_i) / (k * T)]\n\n    Where:\n    *   `N_j` and `N_i` are the number of atoms in states `j` and `i`.\n    *   `g_j` and `g_i` are the statistical weights of the states.\n    *   `E_j - E_i` is the energy difference between the states, which we'll call `ΔE`.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n2.  **Applying to Star 1 and Star 2:** We can write the Boltzmann equation for each star, using their respective temperatures, T_1 and T_2.\n\n    *   For star_1: (N_j / N_i)_1 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n    *   For star_2: (N_j / N_i)_2 = (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n3.  **Using the Given Information:** The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are \"twice as excited\" as in star_2. This means the ratio of atoms in the excited state to the lower state is twice as large for star_1 compared to star_2.\n\n    (N_j / N_i)_1 = 2 * (N_j / N_i)_2\n\n4.  **Substituting and Simplifying:** Now, we substitute the Boltzmann equations into this relationship:\n\n    (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * [ (g_j / g_i) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)] ]\n\n    Since we are considering the same energy levels in the same type of atom (iron), the statistical weights `g_j` and `g_i` are the same for both stars. We can cancel the `(g_j / g_i)` term from both sides:\n\n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n5.  **Solving for the Temperatures:** To solve for the relationship between T_1 and T_2, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\n    ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]) = ln(2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n\n    Using the logarithm properties ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b) and ln(e^x) = x:\n\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln(exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)])\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n    Now, rearrange the equation to isolate ln(2):\n\n    ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n\n    Factor out the common term `ΔE / k`:\n\n    (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\n    Combine the fractions in the parenthesis:\n\n    (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n6.  **Using the Numerical Values:** The problem provides the energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`. The Boltzmann constant is `k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`. Let's calculate the ratio `ΔE / k`:\n\n    ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1 K\n\n    The problem is designed so that this factor simplifies to 1. Substituting this value back into our equation:\n\n    1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n    This gives us the final relationship:\n\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\nThis equation matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
