    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the electric field at point P.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Charge Distribution:**\n    *   We start with an uncharged spherical conductor. This means its net charge is zero.\n    *   A positive point charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity.\n    *   This charge $+q$ will attract free electrons within the conductor. These electrons will accumulate on the surface of the cavity. This process is called electrostatic induction.\n\n2.  **Apply Gauss's Law Inside the Conductor:**\n    *   A fundamental property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the bulk of the conducting material is zero ($\\vec{E}_{conductor} = 0$).\n    *   Imagine a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity.\n    *   According to Gauss's Law, the total electric flux through this surface is $\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_o}$.\n    *   Since $\\vec{E} = 0$ everywhere on this Gaussian surface, the total flux is zero.\n    *   This implies that the total charge enclosed by the surface, $Q_{enclosed}$, must also be zero.\n    *   The enclosed charge is the sum of the point charge $+q$ inside the cavity and the charge induced on the inner surface (the cavity wall), let's call it $q_{inner}$.\n    *   So, $Q_{enclosed} = q + q_{inner} = 0$.\n    *   This gives us $q_{inner} = -q$. A charge of $-q$ is induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n3.  **Charge Conservation on the Conductor:**\n    *   The conductor was initially uncharged. The total charge of the conductor must remain zero.\n    *   The conductor's total charge is the sum of the charge on its inner surface and the charge on its outer surface ($q_{outer}$).\n    *   Total charge = $q_{inner} + q_{outer} = 0$.\n    *   Substituting $q_{inner} = -q$, we get $-q + q_{outer} = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, $q_{outer} = +q$. A charge of $+q$ must reside on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding:**\n    *   The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the superposition of the fields created by all charges: the original charge $+q$ inside the cavity, the induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface, and the induced charge $+q$ on the outer surface.\n    *   A crucial concept is electrostatic shielding. The conducting material acts as a \"Faraday cage\". The charges on the inner surface ($q_{inner} = -q$) arrange themselves in such a way that their electric field, when combined with the field of the point charge $+q$, results in a zero electric field everywhere outside the cavity.\n    *   Therefore, for any point P outside the conductor, the net electric field from the charge inside the cavity and the charge on the inner surface is zero.\n\n5.  **Field from the Outer Surface:**\n    *   This means the electric field at point P is solely due to the charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor.\n    *   Because the outer surface is a sphere and it is shielded from the asymmetrically placed charges inside, the charge $+q$ on the outer surface will distribute itself *uniformly* over the surface.\n    *   According to the shell theorem (or by applying Gauss's Law to the outer charge distribution), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the electric field of a point charge of the same total charge located at the center of the sphere.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Electric Field at P:**\n    *   The total charge on the outer shell is $+q$.\n    *   The point P is at a distance $L$ from the center of the spherical conductor.\n    *   Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point P is the same as that of a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor, at a distance $L$.\n    *   Using Coulomb's Law:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe information about the cavity's radius ($r$), its position ($s$), the distance from the cavity's center ($l$), and the angle ($\\theta$) are all distractors. The principle of electrostatic shielding simplifies the problem significantly. The field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed and the distance from the center of the conductor.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$\n\nOur derived expression matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
