    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the starting material, Compound X, from the given spectroscopic data.**\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad absorption is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong peak is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are typical for C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This very downfield, broad singlet is the classic signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). This confirms the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is indicative of a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons at 8.0 ppm are ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the protons at 7.2 ppm are ortho to the other substituent.\n    *   **Alkyl Region Analysis:** Let's piece together the structure of the second substituent from the remaining signals.\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is a -CH₂-CH₃ fragment (an ethyl group).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the -CH₂- group, which is adjacent to the -CH₃ (from the 0.9 ppm signal) and a methine (-CH-) group.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a single proton (-CH-).\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the -CH- group. This proton is attached to the benzene ring (making it a benzylic proton), the methyl group (1.4 ppm), and the ethyl group (1.7 and 0.9 ppm).\n    *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** The fragments are -CH(Ar)-, a -CH₃, and a -CH₂CH₃. Putting them together on the single carbon gives the structure -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃), which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** Based on the combined data, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the product of the reaction.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Compound X (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid) reacts with red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reagents:** Red P / HI is a very powerful reducing agent. Its primary function in organic chemistry is the complete reduction of oxygen-containing functional groups to the corresponding alkane.\n*   **Transformation:** This reagent will reduce the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) completely to a methyl group (-CH₃). The aromatic ring and the sec-butyl group are stable under these conditions and will not be changed.\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Final Product:** The -COOH group is reduced to -CH₃. Therefore, the product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect. The carboxylic acid is reduced.\n*   B) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - **Correct.** This matches our predicted product.\n*   C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - Incorrect. This is the starting material (Compound X).\n*   D) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect. The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl. The reaction does not cause rearrangement of the alkyl chain.\n\nThe final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
