    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify Compound X.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Product from the NMR Data**\n\nThe first step is to determine the structure of the product formed in the reaction. The reaction is an isomerization, so the product will have the same molecular formula as the starting material, Compound X: C11H12O.\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** For C11H12O, the DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6. This indicates a combination of rings and pi bonds. A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation.\n\n*   **13C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 197.7 (1C):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O), specifically in a ketone.\n    *   **δ 126.9 - 144.1 (8C total):** This region corresponds to aromatic and alkene carbons. The presence of 8 carbons suggests a substituted benzene ring (6C) and a C=C double bond (2C).\n    *   **δ 21.3 (1C) and 28.4 (1C):** These are in the aliphatic region, likely corresponding to methyl groups.\n\n*   **1H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 7.71 (2H, d) and 7.08 (2H, d):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2 protons, is a classic signature for a **para-substituted benzene ring**.\n    *   **δ 7.68 (1H, d) and 6.75 (1H, d):** These two doublets in the alkene region, each integrating to 1 proton, indicate a disubstituted double bond (-CH=CH-). The doublet multiplicity means the two protons are coupled to each other.\n    *   **δ 2.31 (3H, s) and 2.28 (3H, s):** These two singlets, each integrating to 3 protons, represent two methyl (CH3) groups that have no adjacent protons.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    1.  We have a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    2.  We have a methyl group (let's assign δ 2.31) attached to this ring, making it a **p-tolyl group**.\n    3.  We have a ketone group (-C=O).\n    4.  We have another methyl group (let's assign δ 2.28) which is a singlet, suggesting it's attached to the carbonyl group (an acetyl group, -CO-CH3).\n    5.  We have a -CH=CH- group connecting the p-tolyl ring and the acetyl group.\n\n    Putting these pieces together, the structure is:\n    (p-CH3-C6H4)-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3\n\n    This structure is **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**. Let's verify its formula: C7H7 (p-tolyl) + C4H5O (butenone part) = C11H12O. This matches the given formula. The structure is fully consistent with all the NMR data.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Identify Compound X**\n\nThe reaction involves heating an epoxide (Compound X) with DABCO (1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane), a non-nucleophilic base, in a nonpolar solvent. These conditions are known to promote the rearrangement of allylic epoxides (also known as vinyloxiranes) into α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds.\n\nThe product is 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. We need to find which of the given options for Compound X would rearrange to this product.\n\n*   The product contains a **p-tolyl group** (a p-methylphenyl group). This is a crucial clue. We should look for a starting material that also contains this group.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n*   A) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane: Contains a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group.\n*   B) 2-styrylepoxide: Contains a phenyl group (styryl = phenylvinyl). Also, its formula is C10H10O, which is incorrect.\n*   C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane: Contains a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group.\n*   D) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane: The \"4-methylstyryl\" group is (p-CH3-C6H4)-CH=CH-. This compound contains the required p-tolyl group.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the Rearrangement of Compound D**\n\nLet's confirm that compound D can rearrange to the identified product.\n*   **Compound D:** 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Its structure is (p-CH3-C6H4)-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2.\n*   **Product:** 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. Its structure is (p-CH3-C6H4)-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3.\n\nThe proposed mechanism for this base-catalyzed rearrangement is as follows:\n1.  The base (DABCO) abstracts the most acidic proton, which is the one on the carbon that is both allylic to the double bond and alpha to the epoxide oxygen.\n    (p-tolyl)-CH=CH-**CH**(O)CH2 + Base ⇌ (p-tolyl)-CH=CH-**C⁻**(O)CH2 + Base-H⁺\n2.  The resulting carbanion rearranges. The C-C bond of the epoxide ring cleaves to form a more stable, conjugated enolate anion.\n    (p-tolyl)-CH=CH-C⁻(O)CH2 → (p-tolyl)-CH=CH-C(=O)CH2⁻\n3.  The enolate is protonated (by the protonated base, Base-H⁺) to give the final α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n    (p-tolyl)-CH=CH-C(=O)CH2⁻ + Base-H⁺ → (p-tolyl)-CH=CH-C(=O)CH3 + Base\n\nThis mechanism shows a direct and plausible pathway from compound D to the product deduced from the NMR spectra. The other options are incorrect because they lack the p-tolyl group that is clearly present in the final product.\n\nTherefore, Compound X is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<D>>>"
