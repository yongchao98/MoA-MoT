    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to find the amount of non-Gaussianity (nG) for the given Schrödinger cat state.\n\n**1. Understand the Measure of Non-Gaussianity (nG)**\n\nThe problem defines the non-Gaussianity `nG` using a relative entropy measure `del_b`:\n`del_b = trace(rho * ln(rho)) - trace(tau * ln(tau))`\n\nThis can be rewritten in terms of the von Neumann entropy, `S(sigma) = -trace(sigma * ln(sigma))`.\n`del_b = -S(rho) - (-S(tau)) = S(tau) - S(rho)`\n\n*   `rho` is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state `|psi>`.\n*   `tau` is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. This reference state is chosen to have the same first and second moments (mean displacement and covariance matrix) as `rho`.\n\n**2. Analyze the State `rho`**\n\nThe state is given by `|psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N`.\nSince `|psi>` is a pure quantum state, its density matrix is `rho = |psi><psi|`.\nThe von Neumann entropy of any pure state is zero.\n`S(rho) = -trace(rho * ln(rho)) = 0`\n\nTherefore, the non-Gaussianity measure simplifies to:\n`nG = del_b = S(tau) - 0 = S(tau)`\n\nThe problem now is to find the entropy of the reference Gaussian state `tau`.\n\n**3. Determine the Reference Gaussian State `tau`**\n\nWe need to find the first and second moments of `rho` for the given parameters `phi = -pi/4` and `alpha = 0.5`.\n\n*   **State vector:**\n    For `phi = -pi/4`, we have `cos(phi) = 1/sqrt(2)` and `sin(phi) = -1/sqrt(2)`.\n    The state becomes `|psi> = (1/sqrt(2)N) * (|alpha> - |-alpha>)`. This is an odd cat state.\n\n*   **First Moments (Mean Displacement):**\n    The expectation value of the annihilation operator `a` is `<a> = <psi|a|psi>`. Due to the symmetry of the odd cat state, the mean displacement is zero.\n    `<a> = 0`.\n    This means the reference Gaussian state `tau` is centered in phase space.\n\n*   **Second Moments (Covariance Matrix):**\n    The covariance matrix `V` for a centered state has elements `V_xx = <x^2>`, `V_pp = <p^2>`, and `V_xp = (1/2)<xp+px>`, where `x = (a+a_dagger)/2` and `p = (a-a_dagger)/(2i)`.\n    These can be calculated from `<n> = <a_dagger a>` and `<a^2>`.\n\n    For the odd cat state with real `alpha`, the general formulas are:\n    `<a^2> = alpha^2`\n    `<n> = alpha^2 * (1 + exp(-2*alpha^2)) / (1 - exp(-2*alpha^2))`\n\n    Plugging in `alpha = 0.5`:\n    `alpha^2 = 0.25`\n    `exp(-2*alpha^2) = exp(-0.5) approx 0.60653`\n    `<n> = 0.25 * (1 + 0.60653) / (1 - 0.60653) = 0.25 * (1.60653 / 0.39347) approx 1.0208`\n    `<a^2> = 0.25`\n\n    The covariance matrix elements are:\n    `V_xx = (1/4) * (2*Re(<a^2>) + 2<n> + 1) = (1/4) * (2*0.25 + 2*1.0208 + 1) = (1/4) * (0.5 + 2.0416 + 1) = 3.5416 / 4 = 0.8854`\n    `V_pp = (1/4) * (-2*Re(<a^2>) + 2<n> + 1) = (1/4) * (-2*0.25 + 2*1.0208 + 1) = (1/4) * (-0.5 + 2.0416 + 1) = 2.5416 / 4 = 0.6354`\n\n**4. Calculate the Entropy of `tau`**\n\nThe entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state `tau` is given by:\n`S(tau) = (nu + 1/2) * ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2) * ln(nu - 1/2)`\nwhere `nu` is the symplectic eigenvalue of the covariance matrix `V`. For a single mode, `nu = 2 * sqrt(det(V))`.\n\n*   **Calculate `det(V)`:**\n    `det(V) = V_xx * V_pp = 0.8854 * 0.6354 approx 0.5625`\n    (The exact value is `9/16 = 0.5625`).\n\n*   **Calculate `nu`:**\n    `nu = 2 * sqrt(0.5625) = 2 * 0.75 = 1.5`\n\n*   **Calculate `S(tau)`:**\n    `S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5) * ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5) * ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n    `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) - 1 * ln(1)`\n    `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) - 0`\n    `S(tau) = 2 * 0.6931... = 1.3862...`\n\n**5. Final Result**\n\nThe non-Gaussianity is `nG = S(tau) = 1.3862...`.\nComparing this value to the given options:\nA) 0.25\nB) 2.48\nC) 0\nD) 1.38\n\nThe calculated value is closest to 1.38.\n\n<<<D>>>"
