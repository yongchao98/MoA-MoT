    "This problem can be solved by applying the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum from special relativity.\n\nLet's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n**1. Define the System and Initial Conditions**\n\n*   We have an electron (e⁻) and a positron (e⁺). They have the same rest mass, which we'll call $m_e$.\n*   Let's set up a coordinate system where the collision happens along the horizontal x-axis.\n*   The electron moves from left to right, so its velocity is in the +x direction. Its Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_e = 4$.\n*   The positron moves from right to left, so its velocity is in the -x direction. Its Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_p = 2$.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Initial Energy**\n\nThe energy of a relativistic particle is given by the formula $E = \\gamma m c^2$.\n\n*   Energy of the electron: $E_e = \\gamma_e m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2$\n*   Energy of the positron: $E_p = \\gamma_p m_e c^2 = 2 m_e c^2$\n\nThe total initial energy of the system is the sum of their energies:\n$E_{initial} = E_e + E_p = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2$\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Initial Momentum**\n\nThe momentum of a relativistic particle can be calculated using the formula $p = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} \\cdot mc$. Momentum is a vector quantity.\n\n*   Momentum of the electron (in the +x direction):\n    $p_e = \\sqrt{\\gamma_e^2 - 1} \\cdot m_e c = \\sqrt{4^2 - 1} \\cdot m_e c = \\sqrt{15} \\cdot m_e c$\n*   Momentum of the positron (in the -x direction):\n    $p_p = \\sqrt{\\gamma_p^2 - 1} \\cdot m_e c = \\sqrt{2^2 - 1} \\cdot m_e c = \\sqrt{3} \\cdot m_e c$\n\nThe total initial momentum is the vector sum. Since they are moving in opposite directions along the x-axis:\n$P_{initial} = p_e - p_p = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c$\nThe total momentum is in the +x direction.\n\n**4. Analyze the Final State (Two Photons)**\n\nAfter annihilation, two photons are produced.\n*   **Energy:** According to the law of conservation of energy, the total final energy must equal the total initial energy.\n    $E_{final} = E_{initial} = 6 m_e c^2$\n    The problem states that the two photons have the same energy ($E_{\\gamma1} = E_{\\gamma2} = E_\\gamma$).\n    Therefore, $E_{\\gamma1} + E_{\\gamma2} = 2E_\\gamma = 6 m_e c^2$, which means the energy of each photon is $E_\\gamma = 3 m_e c^2$.\n\n*   **Momentum:** The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by $p_\\gamma = E_\\gamma / c$.\n    So, the magnitude of the momentum of each photon is $p_\\gamma = (3 m_e c^2) / c = 3 m_e c$.\n\n**5. Apply Conservation of Momentum to Find the Angle**\n\nThe initial momentum was purely horizontal. To conserve momentum, the vertical components of the photons' momenta must cancel out. Since the photons have equal momentum magnitude, they must be emitted at symmetric angles to the horizontal axis. Let this angle be $\\theta$. One photon goes up at angle $\\theta$, and the other goes down at angle $-\\theta$.\n\nThe total final momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of each photon's momentum:\n$P_{final} = p_\\gamma \\cos(\\theta) + p_\\gamma \\cos(\\theta) = 2 p_\\gamma \\cos(\\theta)$\n\nNow, we equate the initial and final momentum:\n$P_{initial} = P_{final}$\n$(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 2 p_\\gamma \\cos(\\theta)$\n\nSubstitute the value we found for $p_\\gamma$:\n$(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 2 (3 m_e c) \\cos(\\theta)$\n$(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m_e c = 6 m_e c \\cos(\\theta)$\n\nWe can cancel $m_e c$ from both sides and solve for $\\cos(\\theta)$:\n$\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}$\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$\\sqrt{15} \\approx 3.873$\n$\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$\n\n$\\cos(\\theta) \\approx \\frac{3.873 - 1.732}{6} = \\frac{2.141}{6} \\approx 0.3568$\n\n$\\theta = \\arccos(0.3568) \\approx 69.1^\\circ$\n\nThe question asks for the angle **between** the directions of the two photons. This is the sum of the angle of the first photon above the horizontal and the second photon below the horizontal, which is $2\\theta$.\n\nAngle = $2\\theta \\approx 2 \\times 69.1^\\circ = 138.2^\\circ$\n\nThis value is closest to 138.\n\n<<<A>>>"
