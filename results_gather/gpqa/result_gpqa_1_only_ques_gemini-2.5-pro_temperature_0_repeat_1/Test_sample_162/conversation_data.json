    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Chemistry**\n\nTo dissolve the sparingly soluble base, iron(III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)₃), we need to add a strong acid. The acid will neutralize the hydroxide, shifting the solubility equilibrium to favor the dissolved ions. The overall reaction is:\n\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThe problem asks for the *minimum* volume of acid. This means we need to add just enough acid to completely dissolve the solid and maintain a pH low enough to prevent it from re-precipitating. The final solution will be saturated with respect to Fe(OH)₃.\n\nThe total amount of acid added must accomplish two things:\n1.  Provide the H⁺ ions to react stoichiometrically with the Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  Provide the excess H⁺ ions that will remain in the solution to establish the final acidic pH.\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n\n*   Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = (atomic mass of Fe) + 3 * (atomic mass of O + atomic mass of H)\n    *   Molar Mass ≈ 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol\n\n**3. Calculate the Moles of H⁺ Needed for the Reaction**\n\nFrom the stoichiometry of the reaction (Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺), 3 moles of H⁺ are required for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n\n*   Moles of H⁺ (consumed in reaction) = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n*   Moles of H⁺ (consumed) = 3 * 0.0009356 mol = 0.0028068 mol\n\n**4. Test the Options**\n\nWe will now test each option to see which one provides a consistent pH and volume. For each option, we will calculate the total moles of H⁺ required and the corresponding volume of 0.1 M acid.\n\n**General Formula:**\n*   Total Moles H⁺ = (Moles H⁺ consumed) + (Moles H⁺ remaining in solution)\n*   Moles H⁺ remaining = [H⁺]final * Total Volume = (10⁻ᵖᴴ) * (0.1 L)\n*   Volume of Acid (cm³) = (Total Moles H⁺ / 0.1 M) * 1000\n\n---\n\n**A) Test Option A: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n*   Moles H⁺ remaining = 10⁻².⁰⁴ M * 0.1 L ≈ 0.00912 M * 0.1 L = 0.000912 mol\n*   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.0028068 mol + 0.000912 mol = 0.0037188 mol\n*   Calculated Volume = (0.0037188 mol / 0.1 M) * 1000 = 37.19 cm³\n*   This does **not** match the given volume of 28.05 cm³.\n\n**B) Test Option B: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n*   Moles H⁺ remaining = 10⁻³.¹⁶ M * 0.1 L ≈ 0.000692 M * 0.1 L = 0.0000692 mol\n*   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.0028068 mol + 0.0000692 mol = 0.002876 mol\n*   Calculated Volume = (0.002876 mol / 0.1 M) * 1000 = 28.76 cm³\n*   This does **not** match the given volume of 32.14 cm³.\n\n**C) Test Option C: pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\n*   Moles H⁺ remaining = 10⁻⁴.⁹⁴ M * 0.1 L ≈ 0.0000115 M * 0.1 L = 0.00000115 mol\n*   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.0028068 mol + 0.00000115 mol = 0.00280795 mol\n*   Calculated Volume = (0.00280795 mol / 0.1 M) * 1000 = 28.08 cm³\n*   This does **not** match the given volume of 20.40 cm³.\n\n**D) Test Option D: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n*   Moles H⁺ remaining = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M * 0.1 L ≈ 0.002042 M * 0.1 L = 0.0002042 mol\n*   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.0028068 mol + 0.0002042 mol = 0.003011 mol\n*   Calculated Volume = (0.003011 mol / 0.1 M) * 1000 = 30.11 cm³\n*   This calculated volume of **30.11 cm³** is an excellent match for the given volume of **30.09 cm³**. The minor difference is due to rounding of constants.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption D is the only choice where the given pH and the volume of acid are consistent with the chemical principles governing the dissolution.\n\n<<<D>>>"
