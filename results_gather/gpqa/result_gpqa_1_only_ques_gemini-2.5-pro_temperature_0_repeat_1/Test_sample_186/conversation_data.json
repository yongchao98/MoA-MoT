    "To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable by ESPRESSO, we need to evaluate each case based on two main criteria:\n1.  **Visibility:** The star must be visible from the Paranal Observatory in Chile (Latitude ~24.6° S).\n2.  **Brightness:** The star must be bright enough to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a 1-hour exposure using one 8m VLT.\n\nLet's analyze the ESPRESSO performance first. According to the \"Performance and Sky Coverage\" table in the provided link for the 1-UT mode (one 8m telescope), the S/N for a 1-hour exposure is:\n*   V = 14 mag -> S/N = 23\n*   V = 15 mag -> S/N = 13\n*   V = 16 mag -> S/N = 6\n\nFrom this data, a star with an apparent magnitude of V=16 is not detectable (S/N=6 < 10), while a star with V=15 is detectable (S/N=13 > 10). The limiting magnitude for our condition (S/N ≥ 10) is therefore between 15 and 16. Any star with an apparent magnitude of **V ≤ 15.5** (approximately) will be detectable.\n\nNow let's evaluate each star:\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Visibility:** Canopus has a declination of approximately -52.7°. Since Paranal is in the Southern Hemisphere, Canopus is easily visible and passes high in the sky.\n*   **Brightness:** Canopus has an apparent V magnitude of -0.74. This is extremely bright, far brighter than the V=15 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable.**\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Visibility:** Polaris has a declination of approximately +89.2°. As the North Star, it is located very close to the North Celestial Pole. It is **not visible** from the Southern Hemisphere location of Paranal Observatory.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Not Detectable.**\n\nFor stars c, d, e, and f, we first need to calculate their apparent V magnitude (m_V) from their absolute V magnitude (M_V) and distance (d) using the distance modulus formula:\nm_V - M_V = 5 * log₁₀(d) - 5, where d is in parsecs (pc).\nHere, M_V = 15 for all four stars.\n\n**c) Star with M_V = 15 mag at d = 10 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** Declination is 0°, which is on the celestial equator. It is visible from Paranal.\n*   **Brightness:** m_V = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(10) - 5 = 15 + 5 * 1 - 5 = 15.\n    An apparent magnitude of V=15 gives an S/N of 13, which is greater than 10.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable.**\n\n**d) Star with M_V = 15 mag at d = 200 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** Declination is 0°, so it is visible.\n*   **Brightness:** m_V = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(200) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 2.30 - 5 = 15 + 11.5 - 5 = 21.5.\n    An apparent magnitude of V=21.5 is far too faint.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Not Detectable.**\n\n**e) Star with M_V = 15 mag at d = 5 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** Declination is 0°, so it is visible.\n*   **Brightness:** m_V = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(5) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 0.70 - 5 = 15 + 3.5 - 5 = 13.5.\n    An apparent magnitude of V=13.5 is brighter than V=14 (where S/N=23), so it will easily achieve an S/N > 10.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable.**\n\n**f) Star with M_V = 15 mag at d = 50 pc**\n*   **Visibility:** Declination is 0°, so it is visible.\n*   **Brightness:** m_V = 15 + 5 * log₁₀(50) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * 1.70 - 5 = 15 + 8.5 - 5 = 18.5.\n    An apparent magnitude of V=18.5 is much fainter than the V≈15.5 limit.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Not Detectable.**\n\n**Summary:**\n*   a) Canopus: **Detectable**\n*   b) Polaris: **Not Detectable**\n*   c) Star at 10 pc: **Detectable**\n*   d) Star at 200 pc: **Not Detectable**\n*   e) Star at 5 pc: **Detectable**\n*   f) Star at 50 pc: **Not Detectable**\n\nIn total, there are 3 detectable stars (a, c, and e). This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
