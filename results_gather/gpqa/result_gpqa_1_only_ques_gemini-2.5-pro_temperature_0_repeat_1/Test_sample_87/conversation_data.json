    "The scenario describes an active immune response in a secondary lymphoid organ (Peyer's patches) following antigen exposure. Let's break down the key observations and relate them to the options provided:\n\n1.  **Antigen delivery and uptake:** Rotavirus proteins are delivered orally and reach the Peyer's patches, which are key sites for initiating immune responses to gut antigens.\n2.  **Proliferating cell population:** The presence of proliferating cells in the Peyer's patches indicates that lymphocytes (likely B cells and T cells) have recognized the antigen and have become activated. This proliferation occurs in specialized structures called germinal centers.\n3.  **High variability in the variable heavy chain gene:** This is the most critical piece of information. It points to a process that actively introduces mutations into the genes that code for the antigen-binding part of an antibody (the variable region).\n\nNow let's evaluate the options:\n\n*   **A) Class switching recombination:** This process changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain, not the variable region. It switches the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgA, which is common in mucosal responses), but it does not increase the variability of the antigen-binding site itself.\n*   **B) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs in activated B cells within the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs. It deliberately introduces point mutations into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This creates a pool of B cells with slightly different antibodies, and those with higher affinity for the antigen are selected to survive and proliferate. This directly explains the \"high variability\" observed in the sequenced variable heavy chain genes of the proliferating cell population.\n*   **C) Complement activation:** This is a system of plasma proteins that helps clear pathogens. It is part of the innate immune response and does not involve genetic changes in lymphocytes.\n*   **D) V(D)J recombination:** This is the process that initially creates the diverse repertoire of B cell receptors by combining different V (Variable), D (Diversity), and J (Joining) gene segments. However, this process occurs in the bone marrow during B cell development, *before* the B cell ever encounters an antigen. The scenario describes a process happening *after* antigen encounter in a secondary lymphoid organ.\n\nThe observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of a proliferating B cell population in a germinal center is the classic hallmark of somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
