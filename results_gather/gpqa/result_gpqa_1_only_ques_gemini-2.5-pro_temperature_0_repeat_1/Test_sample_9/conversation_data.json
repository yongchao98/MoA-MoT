    "Here's a breakdown of the options to determine which planet has the highest density:\n\n*   **Density** is a measure of mass per unit of volume (Density = Mass / Volume).\n*   **Gravitational Compression:** For planets with the same composition (the same mix of rock and metal), a more massive planet will have stronger gravity. This stronger gravity compresses the material more, squeezing the same amount of mass into a smaller volume, thus increasing its overall density.\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this principle:\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our baseline, which is Earth itself. Its average density is approximately 5.5 g/cm³.\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** This planet's density is explicitly given as 5.5 g/cm³, the same as Earth's.\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** Because this planet is much more massive than Earth, its internal gravity will be much stronger. This will compress its rock and iron core far more than Earth's gravity does, resulting in a significantly higher overall density. Its density will be greater than 5.5 g/cm³.\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** This planet is less massive than Earth. Its gravity will be weaker, and it will be less able to compress its materials. Therefore, its density will be lower than Earth's (less than 5.5 g/cm³).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the options, the 5-Earth-mass planet (c) will be the most compressed by its own gravity, giving it the highest density.\n\n*   Density of (d) < Density of (a) = Density of (b) < Density of (c)\n\nTherefore, the planet described in (c) has the highest density.\n\n<<<A>>>"
