    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂].\n\n**1. Identify the species in solution**\nThe total cobalt in the solution is distributed among several species due to complex formation with thiocyanate (SCN⁻). The species are:\n*   Free cobalt(II) ion: Co²⁺\n*   Monothiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)]⁺\n*   Dithiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)₂]\n*   Trithiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n*   Tetrathiocyanato cobalt(II): [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\n**2. Use the overall stability constants (β)**\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion concentration [Co²⁺], the free thiocyanate concentration [SCN⁻], and the overall stability constants (β_n).\n\nThe formation reactions and stability constants are:\nCo²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺ ;       β₁ = [[Co(SCN)]⁺] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) = 9\nCo²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂] ;     β₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) = 40\nCo²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ ;   β₃ = [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) = 63\nCo²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ ; β₄ = [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) = 16\n\nFrom these definitions, we can write the concentration of each complex:\n[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\n**3. Express the total cobalt concentration**\nSubstitute these expressions into the equation for the total cobalt concentration:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\nFactor out the [Co²⁺] term:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**4. Calculate the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex**\nThe fraction (α₂) of the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)₂], is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nSubstitute the expressions for [[Co(SCN)₂]] and c(Co):\nα₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))\n\nThe [Co²⁺] term cancels out, leaving an expression that depends only on the free ligand concentration [SCN⁻] and the stability constants:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n**5. Plug in the given values and calculate**\nWe are given:\n[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\nβ₁ = 9\nβ₂ = 40\nβ₃ = 63\nβ₄ = 16\n\nFirst, calculate each term in the expression. Let's denote the denominator as Φ (the complex formation function).\n*   Numerator term: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   Denominator terms:\n    *   1\n    *   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n    *   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4\n    *   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n    *   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nNow, sum the terms in the denominator:\nΦ = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nNow, calculate the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = Numerator / Φ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n**6. Convert the fraction to a percentage**\nTo find the percentage, multiply the fraction by 100:\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = α₂ * 100% ≈ 0.16916 * 100% = 16.916%\n\nThis value is approximately 16.9%.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 25.6%\nB) 38.1%\nC) 42.3%\nD) 16.9%\n\nThe calculated percentage matches option D. Note that the total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M, was not needed for this calculation because the free ligand concentration [SCN⁻] was given directly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
