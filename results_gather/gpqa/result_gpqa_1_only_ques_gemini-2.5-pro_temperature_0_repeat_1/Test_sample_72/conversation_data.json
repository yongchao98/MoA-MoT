    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)\n\nSince the astronauts are traveling at relativistic speeds, we must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula to find their relative speed. For two objects moving in the same direction (let's say the positive x-direction) with velocities $v_1$ and $v_2$ as measured from a stationary frame, the relative velocity of object 1 with respect to object 2 is given by:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nGiven:\n*   $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.1428c$\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Total Energy of the System ($E_{total}$)\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the formula $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual energies of the two astronauts:\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$\n\n**For Astronaut 1:**\n*   Mass: $m_1 = 2m$\n*   Velocity: $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_1$):\n    $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n*   Energy ($E_1$):\n    $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) \\times c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**For Astronaut 2:**\n*   Mass: $m_2 = 3m$\n*   Velocity: $v_2 = 0.5c$\n*   Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_2$):\n    $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5c)^2/c^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}/2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 1.1547$\n*   Energy ($E_2$):\n    $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times (3m) \\times c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 \\approx 2 \\times 1.732 \\times mc^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n\n**Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n$E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n$E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\n\nSo, the total energy is approximately **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately 0.14c, and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
