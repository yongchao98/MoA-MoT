    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Core Physics**\n\nThe problem asks about the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy levels. Assuming the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), this ratio is governed by the Boltzmann equation:\n\n$\\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{kT}}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $N_2$ and $N_1$ are the number of atoms in the higher energy level (level 2) and lower energy level (level 1), respectively.\n*   $g_2$ and $g_1$ are the statistical weights of the levels. The ratio $g_2/g_1$ is a constant for a given transition.\n*   $\\Delta E = E_2 - E_1$ is the energy difference between the two levels.\n*   $k$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   $T$ is the temperature of the gas.\n\n**2. Calculate the Energy Difference ($\\Delta E$)**\n\nThe energy difference can be calculated from the wavelength ($\\lambda$) of the transition between the levels using the formula $\\Delta E = hc/\\lambda$. It is convenient to work with the quantity $\\Delta E/k$.\n\nGiven:\n*   Wavelength $\\lambda = 1448$ Å = $1448 \\times 10^{-10}$ m.\n*   Planck's constant $h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34}$ J·s.\n*   Speed of light $c = 3.0 \\times 10^8$ m/s.\n*   Boltzmann constant $k = 1.381 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K.\n\n$\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} = \\frac{hc}{k\\lambda} = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s}) \\times (3.0 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s})}{(1.381 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J/K}) \\times (1448 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m})}$\n$\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\approx 99420 \\text{ K}$\n\nAlternatively, using the convenient formula in electron-volts:\n$\\Delta E (\\text{eV}) = \\frac{1240}{\\lambda (\\text{nm})} = \\frac{1240}{144.8} \\approx 8.563$ eV.\n$k \\approx 8.617 \\times 10^{-5}$ eV/K.\n$\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} = \\frac{8.563 \\text{ eV}}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/K}} \\approx 99376 \\text{ K}$.\nThe small difference is due to rounding of constants. We will use the value ~99400 K.\n\n**3. Identify the Temperatures**\n\nThe problem provides the effective temperatures for the two scenarios:\n*   **Unspotted star:** The photospheric temperature is $T_{unspotted} = 6000$ K.\n*   **Spotted star:** The *overall* photospheric effective temperature is $T_{spotted} = 5500$ K.\n\nWhen astronomers analyze the integrated light from a star to determine its properties (like level populations), they typically use a single effective temperature that best represents the entire photosphere. Therefore, we should use these two effective temperatures for our comparison. The other information (stellar radius, mass, spot coverage percentage) is extraneous detail, likely intended to distract, as it is implicitly accounted for in the given overall effective temperature of the spotted star.\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratios and the Factor of Change**\n\nLet $R_{pop}$ be the population ratio $N_2/N_1$.\n*   For the unspotted star: $R_{pop, unspotted} = C \\cdot e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{unspotted}}}$, where $C = g_2/g_1$.\n*   For the spotted star: $R_{pop, spotted} = C \\cdot e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k T_{spotted}}}$.\n\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes \"when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots\". This means we need to calculate the ratio:\nFactor = $\\frac{R_{pop, unspotted}}{R_{pop, spotted}}$\n\nFactor = $\\frac{C \\cdot e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k \\cdot 6000}}}{C \\cdot e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k \\cdot 5500}}}$\nFactor = $e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k \\cdot 6000} + \\frac{\\Delta E}{k \\cdot 5500}}$\nFactor = $e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000}\\right)}$\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\n\nNow, plug in the numerical values:\nExponent = $99420 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000}\\right)$\nExponent = $99420 \\times \\left(\\frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \\times 6000}\\right)$\nExponent = $99420 \\times \\left(\\frac{500}{33,000,000}\\right)$\nExponent = $99420 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{66000}\\right)$\nExponent $\\approx 1.506$\n\nFactor = $e^{1.506} \\approx 4.508$\n\nThis value is very close to 4.5.\n\nThe problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which means $R_{pop, spotted} < R_{pop, unspotted}$. Our calculated factor is greater than 1, which is consistent with this statement.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
