    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each statement to determine the correct one:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Core Problem:** The scientist wants to make branched polyethylene using only ethylene as a monomer. This requires a dual-catalyst system (or a single catalyst with dual functionality). One catalytic function must be the oligomerization of ethylene into short alpha-olefins (like 1-butene, 1-hexene, or 1-octene). The second catalytic function must be the copolymerization of these *in-situ* generated alpha-olefins with the remaining ethylene. This process is known as tandem catalysis and is used to produce Linear Low-Density Polyethylene (LLDPE) or bimodal High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) with controlled short-chain branching. The term \"regular branches\" implies that the branches have a consistent length (e.g., all butyl branches, which come from incorporating 1-hexene).\n\n2.  **Analyze Statement A: \"Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.\"**\n    *   Late transition metal catalysts, particularly those based on palladium (a noble metal) and nickel, developed by Maurice Brookhart and others, can produce branched polyethylene from ethylene alone. They do this through a \"chain-walking\" mechanism where the catalyst can move along the polymer chain before adding the next monomer, creating branches.\n    *   However, this process typically creates a hyperbranched structure with a variety of branch lengths (methyl, ethyl, propyl, etc.). This does not fit the description of \"regular branches,\" which implies branches of a uniform length (like in LLDPE).\n    *   Therefore, this statement is likely incorrect in the context of producing \"regular branches.\"\n\n3.  **Analyze Statement C: \"Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.\"**\n    *   The \"essential additional reaction step\" is the oligomerization of ethylene.\n    *   Most organometallic catalysts for olefin polymerization and oligomerization, including Ziegler-Natta, metallocenes, and the chromium-based systems used for tandem catalysis, require an activator or co-catalyst.\n    *   Aluminum-based activators, such as trialkylaluminums (e.g., triethylaluminum, TEA) and aluminoxanes (e.g., methylaluminoxane, MAO), are the most common and essential activators for these systems. They are crucial for the oligomerization step.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is factually incorrect.\n\n4.  **Analyze Statement D: \"One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.\"**\n    *   Group VIa (or Group 6) consists of Chromium (Cr), Molybdenum (Mo), and Tungsten (W).\n    *   The most famous and commercially successful tandem catalysis system for this purpose was developed by Chevron Phillips Chemical. It uses a specific chromium-based catalyst (e.g., a Cr-pyrrolide complex) to selectively trimerize ethylene into 1-hexene. This 1-hexene is then copolymerized to create polyethylene with regular butyl branches.\n    *   So, it is true that a catalyst based on a Group VIa metal (Chromium) can be used. However, the statement refers to the entire group. While Mo and W catalysts for ethylene oligomerization exist, they may not provide the high selectivity for a single alpha-olefin (like 1-hexene) that is required to produce \"regular branches.\" The high selectivity is a special feature of certain chromium catalysts. Therefore, the statement could be considered an overgeneralization and potentially incorrect in a strict sense, as it implies any metal from the group might be suitable for this specific task.\n\n5.  **Analyze Statement B: \"Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.\"**\n    *   The tandem catalysis technology described, particularly the Chevron Phillips process, is a well-established industrial process.\n    *   Chevron Phillips Chemical operates large-scale chemical plants in the United States (e.g., in Baytown and Orange, Texas) that utilize this technology to produce polyethylene with in-situ generated comonomers.\n    *   This statement is a specific, verifiable, and accurate description of the commercial status of the exact process the scientist is contemplating.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Statement A is incorrect because chain-walking catalysts do not typically produce \"regular branches.\"\n*   Statement C is incorrect because aluminum-based activators are essential for the process.\n*   Statement D is arguably an overgeneralization, as the high selectivity required is a specific property of certain chromium catalysts, not necessarily a general feature of all Group VIa metal catalysts.\n*   Statement B is a factually correct and specific statement about the industrial reality of the exact system in question. It is the most accurate and least ambiguous statement among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>"
