    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method**\n\nThe RV method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The star \"wobbles\" as the planet orbits it, causing its light to be slightly blueshifted as it moves towards us and redshifted as it moves away.\n\nThe magnitude of the wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) along our line of sight. The maximum observed shift corresponds to the maximum radial velocity, known as the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K).\n\nTherefore, we can establish a relationship between K and Δλ:\nK ∝ Δλ\n\nGiven the wavelength shifts for the two systems:\n*   Δλ₁ = 5 mÅ\n*   Δλ₂ = 7 mÅ\n\nThe ratio of their radial velocity semi-amplitudes is:\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 / 7\n\n**2. Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters**\n\nThe formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is derived from Kepler's Laws and the conservation of momentum. The full formula is:\n\nK = [ (2πG) / T ]^(1/3) * [ Mₚ / (Mₛ + Mₚ)^(2/3) ] * sin(i)\n\nWhere:\n*   T is the orbital period.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   Mₚ is the mass of the planet.\n*   Mₛ is the mass of the star.\n*   i is the inclination of the orbit (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n**3. Simplify the Relationship for this Specific Problem**\n\nWe are given the following information:\n*   The stars have the same mass (Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂).\n*   The planets have the same mass (Mₚ₁ = Mₚ₂).\n*   The problem does not specify different orbital inclinations, so we assume they are the same (sin(i₁) = sin(i₂)). This is a standard assumption in such problems.\n\nSince G, Mₛ, Mₚ, and sin(i) are the same for both systems, we can see how K depends only on the orbital period, T:\n\nK ∝ 1 / T^(1/3)\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods**\n\nUsing the proportionality from step 3, we can set up a ratio for the two systems:\n\nK₁ / K₂ = (1 / T₁^(1/3)) / (1 / T₂^(1/3))\nK₁ / K₂ = (T₂ / T₁)^(1/3)\n\nWe want to find the ratio T₂ / T₁. To do this, we can cube both sides of the equation:\n\n(T₂ / T₁) = (K₁ / K₂)³\n\nNow, substitute the ratio of the semi-amplitudes we found in step 1:\n\nT₂ / T₁ = (5 / 7)³\nT₂ / T₁ = 125 / 343\nT₂ / T₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This matches option A.\n\nThe star with the larger wavelength shift (Star 2) is moving faster, which implies its planet has a stronger gravitational pull at a closer distance, resulting in a shorter orbital period. Our result (T₂/T₁ < 1) is consistent with this physical intuition.\n\n<<<A>>>"
