    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we need to check two conditions for each star:\n1.  **Visibility:** The star must be visible from both the Paranal Observatory in the Southern Hemisphere (latitude ~24° S) and the Keck Observatory in the Northern Hemisphere (latitude ~20° N).\n2.  **Brightness:** The star's apparent V magnitude (m_V) must be bright enough for both instruments. The limits are V < 17 for ESPRESSO and V < 16 for HIRES. Therefore, the star must satisfy the stricter limit, which is **V < 16 mag**.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Visibility Range\n\nA star is visible from an observatory if it rises above the horizon. Disregarding atmospheric refraction and telescope pointing limits as requested:\n*   From Keck Observatory (latitude ≈ +20° N), stars with a declination (DEC) greater than -70° are visible.\n*   From Paranal Observatory (latitude ≈ -24° S), stars with a declination (DEC) less than +66° are visible.\n\nFor a star to be visible from **both** observatories, its declination must be in the overlapping range: **-70° < DEC < +66°**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Apparent V Magnitude (m_V)\n\nIf the apparent magnitude is not given directly, we calculate it using the distance modulus formula, including interstellar extinction (A_V) where applicable:\n**m_V = M_V + 5 * log₁₀(d / 10 pc) + A_V**\nwhere:\n*   m_V is the apparent magnitude.\n*   M_V is the absolute magnitude.\n*   d is the distance in parsecs (pc).\n*   A_V is the extinction in the V band. The problem states A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Star\n\n**Star 1**\n*   DEC = -75°\n*   **Visibility:** -75° is outside the required range of -70° < DEC < +66°. It is too far south to be seen from Keck.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n**Star 2**\n*   DEC = +55°\n*   **Visibility:** +55° is within the required range. The star is visible from both observatories.\n*   m_V = 16.5 mag\n*   **Brightness:** 16.5 is not less than 16. The star is too faint for HIRES.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n**Star 3**\n*   DEC = +48°\n*   **Visibility:** +48° is within the required range. The star is visible from both observatories.\n*   m_V = 15.5 mag (This is the observed apparent magnitude, which already accounts for any extinction).\n*   **Brightness:** 15.5 is less than 16. The star is bright enough for both instruments.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Can be observed by both.**\n\n**Star 4**\n*   DEC = -48°\n*   **Visibility:** -48° is within the required range. The star is visible from both observatories.\n*   M_V = 15.5 mag, d = 10 pc, E(B-V) = 0.4 mag\n*   **Brightness:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n    *   Extinction A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n    *   m_V = M_V + 5 * log₁₀(10/10) + A_V = 15.5 + 5 * log₁₀(1) + 1.24 = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n    *   16.74 is not less than 16. The star is too faint for HIRES.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n**Star 5**\n*   DEC = +60°\n*   **Visibility:** +60° is within the required range. The star is visible from both observatories.\n*   M_V = 16.5 mag, d = 5 pc\n*   **Brightness:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude. (No extinction is mentioned, so A_V = 0).\n    *   m_V = M_V + 5 * log₁₀(5/10) = 16.5 + 5 * log₁₀(0.5)\n    *   m_V ≈ 16.5 + 5 * (-0.301) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995 mag.\n    *   14.995 is less than 16. The star is bright enough for both instruments.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Can be observed by both.**\n\n### Final Result\n\nThe stars that can be detected with both ESPRESSO and HIRES are Star 3 and Star 5.\n\n<<<D>>>"
