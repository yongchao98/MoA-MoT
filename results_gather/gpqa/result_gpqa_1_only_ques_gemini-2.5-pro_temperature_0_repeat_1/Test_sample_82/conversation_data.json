    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at both points.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\nThe initial solution of acetic acid is diluted with an equal volume of water.\n*   Initial volume of acetic acid (V₁): 20.00 cm³\n*   Initial concentration of acetic acid (M₁): 0.05 M\n*   Final volume after adding water (V₂): 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n\nUsing the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂, we can find the new concentration (M₂):\nM₂ = (M₁V₁) / V₂\nM₂ = (0.05 M * 20.00 cm³) / 40.00 cm³\nM₂ = 0.025 M\n\nSo, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.**\nThe reaction is: CH₃COOH + NaOH → CH₃COONa + H₂O\nFirst, find the moles of acetic acid to be titrated:\n*   Moles of CH₃COOH = Concentration × Volume = 0.025 mol/L × 0.04000 L = 0.00100 mol\n\nAt the equivalence point, moles of NaOH = moles of CH₃COOH.\n*   Moles of NaOH = 0.00100 mol\n\nNow, find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH required (V_eq):\n*   Volume = Moles / Concentration = 0.00100 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.0 mL\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\nAt 25% titration, we have added 25% of the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.\n*   Volume of NaOH added = 0.25 × 10.0 mL = 2.50 mL\n\nAt this point, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), and 75% of the acetic acid remains. This creates a buffer solution. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\npH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])\n\nFirst, calculate the pKa:\n*   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) = 4.73\n\nThe ratio of the conjugate base [A⁻] to the acid [HA] is 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n*   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n*   pH = 4.73 - log(3)\n*   pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n*   pH = 4.253 ≈ **4.26**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid (0.00100 mol) has been converted to its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The acetate ion will hydrolyze in water, producing OH⁻ ions.\nCH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\nFirst, calculate the total volume of the solution:\n*   Total Volume = Initial volume of acid solution + Volume of NaOH added\n*   Total Volume = 40.00 mL + 10.0 mL = 50.0 mL = 0.0500 L\n\nNext, calculate the concentration of the acetate ion ([CH₃COO⁻]):\n*   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.00100 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.020 M\n\nNow, we need the Kb for the acetate ion:\n*   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) = 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\nSet up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis:\n*   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n*   5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.020 - x)\n\nAssuming x is very small compared to 0.020, we can simplify:\n*   5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.020\n*   x² = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.020 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n*   x = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) = 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   x = [OH⁻]\n\nNow, calculate the pOH and then the pH:\n*   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) = 5.48\n*   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = 8.52\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.\n\nThe calculated values are pH = 4.26 at 25% titration and pH = 8.52 at the equivalence point. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
