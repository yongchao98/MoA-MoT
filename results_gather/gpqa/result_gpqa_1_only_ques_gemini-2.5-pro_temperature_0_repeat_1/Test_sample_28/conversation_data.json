    "To determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to analyze the effect of each mutation on the protein that is synthesized from the gene. The goal is to find a mutation that results in a non-functional protein. A non-functional protein cannot synthesize the compound, thus eliminating it.\n\nLet's analyze the DNA sequence by breaking it into codons (three-base-pair units) and translating them into amino acids. The sequence starts with `ATG`, which is the start codon for Methionine (Met).\n\n**Intact Gene Sequence:**\n5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n*   **Codons:** ATG, TTT, CTC, GCT, GGT...\n*   **Amino Acids:** Met, Phe, Ser, Ala, Gly...\n\nNow let's analyze each mutant:\n\n**Mutant 1:**\n5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n*   **Change:** The original `TTT` is changed to `TTC`, and `CTC` is changed to `TAC`.\n*   **Translation:**\n    *   `TTT` -> Phenylalanine (Phe)\n    *   `TTC` -> Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a **silent mutation**; the amino acid does not change.\n    *   `CTC` -> Serine (Ser)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a **missense mutation**; it changes one amino acid to another.\n*   **Effect:** This mutation results in a protein with one amino acid changed (Serine to Tyrosine). This might alter the protein's function, but it is not guaranteed to make it completely non-functional.\n\n**Mutant 2:**\n5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n*   **Change:** The original `CTC` is changed to `TAA`.\n*   **Translation:**\n    *   `CTC` -> Serine (Ser)\n    *   `TAA` -> **STOP codon**.\n*   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. It introduces a premature stop codon very early in the sequence (at the third codon). This will cause the ribosome to stop translation, producing a tiny, truncated peptide (only two amino acids long: Met-Phe). This peptide will almost certainly be non-functional.\n\n**Mutant 3:**\n5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...-3’\n*   **Change:** The original `CTC` is changed to `TAC`, and `ACT` is changed to `GTC`.\n*   **Translation:**\n    *   `CTC` -> Serine (Ser) -> `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Tyr). (Missense mutation)\n    *   `ACT` -> Threonine (Thr) -> `GTC` -> Valine (Val). (Missense mutation)\n*   **Effect:** This mutant has two amino acid changes. Like Mutant 1, this might alter the protein's function, but it is unlikely to completely eliminate it.\n\n**Mutant 4:**\n5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...-3’\n*   **Change:** The original `CTC` is changed to `TAC`, and `GGT` is changed to `ACT`.\n*   **Translation:**\n    *   `CTC` -> Serine (Ser) -> `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Tyr). (Missense mutation)\n    *   `GGT` -> Glycine (Gly) -> `ACT` -> Threonine (Thr). (Missense mutation)\n*   **Effect:** This mutant also has two amino acid changes and is unlikely to result in a completely non-functional protein.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe most effective way to eliminate the function of a gene is to introduce a premature stop codon (a nonsense mutation), especially early in the coding sequence. This ensures that a full-length, functional protein is not produced. Mutant 2 is the only mutant with a nonsense mutation, which will truncate the protein after only two amino acids. This is the most probable mutation to eliminate the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
