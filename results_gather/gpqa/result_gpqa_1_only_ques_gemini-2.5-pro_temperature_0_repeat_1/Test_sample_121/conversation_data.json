    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the structure of the final product, followed by an analysis of its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O).\n*   **Reaction:** This is an α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid, a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Acetic acid is brominated at the α-carbon.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a sequence involving two alkylations on the same carbon, leading to cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH, a strong base, removes an acidic α-proton from ethyl cyanoacetate, forming a stabilized carbanion (enolate). The α-protons are acidic due to the two adjacent electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The enolate attacks one end of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The resulting product still has one acidic α-proton. Since NaH is in excess, this proton is also removed.\n        NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + NaH → [NC-C((CH2)5Br)-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    4.  **Intramolecular Alkylation (Cyclization):** The newly formed carbanion attacks the other end of the carbon chain, displacing the second bromide ion. This intramolecular SN2 reaction forms a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.\n\n**Structure of Product 4:**\nThe structure is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH2CH3) group attached to the same carbon atom (C1).\n\n      EtOOC   CN\n           \\ /\n            C (C1)\n           / \\\n      H2C---CH2 (C2, C6)\n      |     |\n      H2C---CH2 (C3, C5)\n       \\   /\n        CH2 (C4)\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the chemical equivalence of the protons in the molecule, considering symmetry and conformational dynamics (rapid chair-flipping at room temperature).\n\n1.  **Symmetry:** The molecule is achiral. Due to rapid rotation around single bonds and rapid chair-flipping, the molecule has a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group. This plane relates the left and right sides of the ring:\n    *   C2 is equivalent to C6.\n    *   C3 is equivalent to C5.\n\n2.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH2CH3):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH3) group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene (-OCH2-) group are rendered equivalent (enantiotopic) by the molecular plane of symmetry. They are isochronous in a standard NMR experiment. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n3.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The two primary chair conformers are:\n        *   Conformer A: -COOEt group equatorial, -CN group axial.\n        *   Conformer B: -COOEt group axial, -CN group equatorial.\n    *   The ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOEt) is sterically bulkier than the cyano group (-CN). Therefore, Conformer A is more stable than Conformer B, and their populations in the equilibrium are unequal (pA > pB).\n    *   **Geminal Protons:** For a substituted cyclohexane, geminal protons (the two protons on the same CH2 group) are diastereotopic. They only become equivalent through rapid chair-flipping if the two interconverting chair forms have equal energy (pA = pB). Since pA ≠ pB in our case, the time-averaging does not make the geminal protons equivalent. Therefore, the axial (ax) and equatorial (eq) protons on each carbon will have distinct chemical shifts.\n\nLet's count the signals from the ring based on this:\n*   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The plane of symmetry makes H-2ax equivalent to H-6ax, and H-2eq equivalent to H-6eq. However, H-2ax and H-2eq are not equivalent. This results in two distinct signals: one for the (H-2ax, H-6ax) pair and one for the (H-2eq, H-6eq) pair. This gives **2 signals**.\n*   **Protons on C3 and C5:** Similarly, H-3ax is equivalent to H-5ax, and H-3eq is equivalent to H-5eq. But H-3ax and H-3eq are not equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n*   **Protons on C4:** C4 lies on the plane of symmetry. The two protons, H-4ax and H-4eq, are diastereotopic and not interconverted by the symmetry operation. They are not made equivalent by the unequal chair-flipping. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\n*   From the ethyl group: 1 (CH3) + 1 (CH2) = 2 signals\n*   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = 6 signals\n*   **Total = 2 + 6 = 8 distinct hydrogen signals.**\n\nThe eight signals are:\n1.  -CH3 (ethyl)\n2.  -OCH2- (ethyl)\n3.  H-2ax / H-6ax\n4.  H-2eq / H-6eq\n5.  H-3ax / H-5ax\n6.  H-3eq / H-5eq\n7.  H-4ax\n8.  H-4eq\n\n<<<D>>>"
