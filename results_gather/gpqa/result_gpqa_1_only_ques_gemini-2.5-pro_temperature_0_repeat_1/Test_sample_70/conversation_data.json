    "Here is a step-by-step solution to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures.\n\n**1. Understand the Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates away. The formula is:\n\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{star}}{2a}} \\cdot (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the star's effective temperature.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   $A$ is the planet's albedo (the fraction of light it reflects).\n\nSince both Planet_2 and Planet_4 orbit the same star, $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constant for both. The problem also states that they have the same albedo ($A$). Therefore, the formula simplifies to a proportionality:\n\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\nThis means the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis.\n\n**2. Relate Semi-Major Axis to Orbital Period using Kepler's Third Law**\n\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period ($P$) is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis ($a$):\n\n$P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for $a$:\n\n$a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\n**3. Combine the Relationships**\n\nNow, we can substitute the relationship for $a$ from Kepler's Law into our simplified temperature relationship:\n\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{P^{2/3}}}$\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{(2/3) \\cdot (1/2)}}$\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}$ or $T_{eq} \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\nThis shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n**4. Calculate the Temperature Ratio**\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 ($T_{eq,4}$) to that of Planet_2 ($T_{eq,2}$). Using the relationship derived above:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{(P_4)^{-1/3}}{(P_2)^{-1/3}} = (\\frac{P_4}{P_2})^{-1/3} = (\\frac{P_2}{P_4})^{1/3}$\n\n**5. Use the Given Orbital Period Ratios**\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as:\n$P_1 : P_2 : P_3 : P_4 : P_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5$\n\nFrom this, we can find the ratio of the periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n\n$\\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \\frac{2}{3.5}$\n\n**6. Final Calculation**\n\nSubstitute this value back into our temperature ratio equation:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = (\\frac{2}{3.5})^{1/3} = (\\frac{4}{7})^{1/3}$\n\nNow, calculate the numerical value:\n\n$\\frac{4}{7} \\approx 0.5714$\n$(0.5714)^{1/3} \\approx 0.8298$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the ratio is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<B>>>"
