    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the key substances based on the clues.**\n    *   **Clue 1 & 7:** \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements\" and \"its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" This points towards a common reagent where a hydrogen atom has been replaced by its heavier isotope, deuterium (D). A prime candidate is a deuterated reducing agent like Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄), whose analog is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), or Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄), whose analog is Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄).\n\n    *   **Clue 3:** The reaction releases a gas W \"whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\" Let's analyze potential gases:\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (No)\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (Yes)\n        *   ¹⁴N₂ (Nitrogen): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible, but less likely from this reaction type)\n        *   ¹²C¹⁶O (Carbon Monoxide): 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (Possible, but less likely)\n        The release of D₂ gas strongly supports that substance X contains deuterium and reacts to release it.\n\n    *   **Clue 2, 4, 5:** \"Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y... a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B... is very close to 277 K.\"\n        *   277 K is approximately 4°C. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0°C (273.15 K), but the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C (276.97 K). This is extremely close to 277 K. So, **B is D₂O**.\n        *   If B (D₂O) is released from heating G, then G must be a deuterated hydroxide.\n        *   Metal hydrides like LiAlH₄ react violently with water. So, X (LiAlD₄) would react violently with Y (D₂O).\n        *   The reaction is: LiAlD₄ + 4 D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4 D₂\n        *   This reaction produces D₂ gas (W), which fits our earlier deduction.\n        *   It also produces Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, which is a gelatinous precipitate. So, **G is Al(OD)₃**.\n        *   When G (Al(OD)₃) is heated, it decomposes: 2 Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3 D₂O. This releases B (D₂O), fitting the clue perfectly.\n\n    *   **Clue 6:** \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"\n        *   A keto acid has the general structure R-C(=O)-COOH, containing 3 oxygen atoms.\n        *   LiAlH₄ (and thus LiAlD₄) is a strong reducing agent that can reduce both a ketone and a carboxylic acid. The reaction would be: R-C(=O)-COOH → R-CH(OH)-CH₂OH (a diol).\n        *   The final product, the diol, contains 2 oxygen atoms. This confirms that X must be a strong reducing agent like LiAlD₄. (A milder reagent like NaBD₄ would only reduce the ketone, leaving the carboxylic acid intact, resulting in a product with 3 oxygen atoms).\n\n2.  **Confirm the identity of Substance X.**\n    All clues consistently point to **Substance X being LiAlD₄** (Lithium Aluminum Deuteride).\n\n3.  **Perform the final calculation.**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1).\n    *   The **lightest element** is Hydrogen (present as its isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The **heaviest element** is Aluminum.\n    *   We need to find the sum of the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the molecule. We will use integer mass numbers for the calculation:\n        *   Mass number of Deuterium (²H or D) = 2\n        *   Mass number of Aluminum (²⁷Al) = 27\n    *   The formula is LiAlD₄.\n    *   Total mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen): There are 4 atoms of Deuterium. Mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum): There is 1 atom of Aluminum. Mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative (summed) mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
