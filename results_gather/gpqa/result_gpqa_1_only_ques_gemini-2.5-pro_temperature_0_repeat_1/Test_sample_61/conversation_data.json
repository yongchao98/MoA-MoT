    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the synthesis problem to determine the correct sequence of reagents.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Product**\n\n*   **Name:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde\n*   **Structure:** Let's break down the name to draw the structure.\n    *   The parent molecule is **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**, which is a cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde (-CHO) group attached.\n    *   At position 1 (the same carbon atom to which the -CHO group is attached), there is a substituent: **(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)**. This group is a methyl group (-CH₃) where one hydrogen is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH) and another hydrogen is replaced by a cyclohexyl group. The structure of this substituent is -CH(OH)-Cyclohexyl.\n*   **Putting it together:** The final product has a cyclohexane ring. On one carbon of this ring, there are two groups attached: a -CHO group and a -CH(OH)-Cyclohexyl group.\n\n*   **Recognize the Reaction Type:** This structure, an α-hydroxy aldehyde, is the characteristic product of an **aldol addition reaction**. Specifically, it is the product of the self-condensation of two molecules of **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n    *   **Reaction:** 2 x (Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde) --(Base)--> 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde\n\n**2. Determine the Key Intermediate**\n\nBased on the analysis above, the crucial intermediate that needs to be synthesized from the starting material is **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (Cy-CHO)**.\n\n**3. Plan the Synthesis from Starting Material to Intermediate**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane (Cy-C≡CH)\n*   **Intermediate:** Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (Cy-CHO)\n\nWe need a way to transform Cy-C≡CH into Cy-CHO. This is not a direct conversion. We need to manipulate the carbon chain. Let's evaluate the proposed reaction sequences in the options.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n\n**A) 1. NaNH₂, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ H₂O; 4. NH₄OH**\n1.  `NaNH₂, ethyl chloride`: This sequence alkylates the terminal alkyne. Cy-C≡CH → Cy-C≡C-CH₂CH₃ (1-cyclohexylbut-1-yne).\n2.  `Li/liq. NH₃`: This reduces the alkyne to a *trans*-alkene. → (E)-1-cyclohexylbut-1-ene.\n3.  `O₃/ H₂O`: This is ozonolysis with an *oxidative* workup. It cleaves the double bond to form carboxylic acids. → Cyclohexanecarboxylic acid (Cy-COOH) and propanoic acid (CH₃CH₂COOH).\n4.  This pathway does not produce the required cyclohexanecarbaldehyde intermediate. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n**B) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. Ba(OH)₂**\n1.  `NaNH₂, methyl chloride`: Alkylates the alkyne with a methyl group. Cy-C≡CH → Cy-C≡C-CH₃ (1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne).\n2.  `H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate`: This is Lindlar's catalyst, which reduces the alkyne to a *cis*-alkene. → (Z)-1-cyclohexylprop-1-ene.\n3.  `O₃/ (CH₃)₂S`: This is ozonolysis with a *reductive* workup. It cleaves the double bond to form aldehydes. → **Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (Cy-CHO)** and acetaldehyde (CH₃CHO). This step successfully produces our key intermediate.\n4.  `Ba(OH)₂`: This is a strong base, a standard catalyst for aldol reactions. It will promote the self-condensation of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form the desired final product. (Note: A mixture of aldol products will form due to the presence of acetaldehyde, but the desired product is indeed synthesized by this route).\n5.  This sequence is chemically sound and leads to the target molecule. **Option B is correct.**\n\n**C) 1. NaNH₂, methyl chloride; 2. H₂/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)₂; 3. H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**\n1.  `NaNH₂, methyl chloride`: → Cy-C≡C-CH₃ (1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne).\n2.  `H₂/Pd`: This catalyst performs complete hydrogenation, reducing the alkyne all the way to an alkane. → Propylcyclohexane (Cy-CH₂CH₂CH₃). This is a saturated alkane and cannot be easily converted to the target product.\n3.  The rest of the sequence is irrelevant as the pathway has already gone astray. **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n**D) 1. NaNH₂, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH₃; 3. O₃/ (CH₃)₂S; 4. NH₄OH**\n1.  `NaNH₂, methanol`: NaNH₂ is a very strong base, and methanol (CH₃OH) is a protic solvent (an acid). The NaNH₂ will deprotonate the alkyne (Cy-C≡CH → Cy-C≡C⁻), but the resulting acetylide anion will be immediately protonated by methanol, regenerating the starting alkyne. This step accomplishes nothing.\n2.  This sequence is flawed from the first step. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only sequence of reactions that correctly transforms ethynylcyclohexane into 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is the one described in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
