    "Here is a step-by-step estimation to determine the lower limit on the redshift.\n\n1.  **Identify the rest wavelength:** The Lyman-alpha (Lyα) line of neutral hydrogen has a rest wavelength ($\\lambda_0$) of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å). This wavelength is in the ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n2.  **Identify the observational constraint:** Ground-based optical telescopes are limited by the Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere is opaque to most UV radiation. The \"optical window\" through which ground-based telescopes can observe begins at a wavelength of about 3200-3500 Å (320-350 nm). For a spectral line to be detected, its observed wavelength must be shifted into this window.\n\n3.  **Determine the minimum observed wavelength:** To find the *lower limit* on the redshift, we need to find the redshift required to shift the 1216 Å line to the very edge of this atmospheric window. Let's use a conservative estimate for the shortest observable wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$) of about 3500 Å.\n\n4.  **Apply the redshift formula:** The relationship between the observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{obs}$), the rest wavelength ($\\lambda_0$), and the redshift ($z$) is given by:\n    $z = \\frac{\\lambda_{obs} - \\lambda_0}{\\lambda_0}$\n    or rearranged:\n    $1 + z = \\frac{\\lambda_{obs}}{\\lambda_0}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the minimum redshift:** We can now solve for the minimum redshift ($z_{min}$) using our values:\n    $1 + z_{min} = \\frac{3500 \\text{ Å}}{1216 \\text{ Å}}$\n    $1 + z_{min} \\approx 2.88$\n    $z_{min} \\approx 2.88 - 1$\n    $z_{min} \\approx 1.88$\n\nThis calculated value of ~1.88 is the minimum redshift required for the Lyα line to be shifted just into the observable optical spectrum from the ground.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 2.4\nB) 1.9\nC) 1.2\nD) 3\n\nThe value 1.9 is the closest to our calculated estimate of 1.88.\n\nLet's check the observed wavelength for z=1.9:\n$\\lambda_{obs} = 1216 \\text{ Å} \\times (1 + 1.9) = 1216 \\text{ Å} \\times 2.9 = 3526.4$ Å.\nThis wavelength is indeed at the very beginning of the optical window, making z=1.9 a very good estimate for the lower limit.\n\n<<<B>>>"
