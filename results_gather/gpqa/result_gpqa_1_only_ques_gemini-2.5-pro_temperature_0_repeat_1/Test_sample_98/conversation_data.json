    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound:\n\n**1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated alkanoic acids, which is consistent with this observation.\n*   **Key Splitting Patterns:** The most revealing information comes from the complex splitting patterns observed for two different protons:\n    *   One signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   Another signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\nThese complex patterns arise when a proton is coupled to three different sets of non-equivalent neighboring protons. The multiplicity is determined by the (n+1) rule for each set of neighbors.\n*   **dtq:** A proton coupled to one proton (n=1, gives a doublet), two equivalent protons (n=2, gives a triplet), and three equivalent protons (n=3, gives a quartet).\n*   **dtt:** A proton coupled to one proton (n=1, gives a doublet), two equivalent protons (n=2, gives a triplet), and another set of two equivalent protons (n=2, gives another triplet).\n\nLet's analyze the protons on the chiral centers for each proposed structure, as these are the most likely to exhibit such complex splitting.\n\n**A) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n`COOH(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH(4)(CH₃)-CH₃(5)`\n*   **H on C3:** Coupled to H on C4 (1H), the CH₂ on C2 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq**. (Matches one signal).\n*   **H on C4:** Coupled to H on C3 (1H), the CH₃ on C4 (3H), and the CH₃ on C5 (3H). This would produce a doublet of quartets of quartets (dqq).\n*   This structure has a `dtq` but not a `dtt`. So, A is incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n`COOH(1)-CH(2)(CH₃)-CH(3)(CH₃)-CH₂(4)-CH₃(5)`\n*   **H on C3:** Coupled to H on C2 (1H), the CH₂ on C4 (2H), and the CH₃ on C3 (3H). This would produce a **dtq**. (Matches one signal).\n*   **H on C2:** Coupled to H on C3 (1H) and the CH₃ on C2 (3H). This would produce a doublet of quartets (dq).\n*   This structure has a `dtq` but not a `dtt`. So, B is incorrect.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n`COOH(1)-CH(2)(Et)-CH(3)(Et)-CH₂(4)-CH₃(5)`\n*   **H on C3:** Coupled to H on C2 (1H), the CH₂ on C4 (2H), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C3 (2H). This would produce a **dtt**. (Matches one signal).\n*   **H on C2:** Coupled to H on C3 (1H) and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C2 (2H). This would produce a doublet of triplets (dt).\n*   This structure has a `dtt` but not a `dtq`. So, C is incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\nLet's correctly identify the structure from the formula: `CH₃-CH(Et)-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`. The longest chain containing the COOH group is a pentanoic acid chain, with ethyl groups at positions 3 and 4.\n`COOH(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(3)(Et)-CH(4)(Et)-CH₃(5)`\n*   **H on C3:** Coupled to H on C4 (1H), the CH₂ on C2 (2H), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C3 (2H). This proton's signal would be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n*   **H on C4:** Coupled to H on C3 (1H), the CH₃ on C5 (3H), and the CH₂ of the ethyl group on C4 (2H). This proton's signal would be a **doublet of quartets of triplets (dqt)**, which is equivalent to a **dtq**. This matches the other observed signal.\n\n**Conclusion**\nStructure D is the only compound that has two chiral protons whose splitting patterns match both the observed `dtt` and `dtq` signals.\n\n<<<D>>>"
