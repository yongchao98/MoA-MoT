    "Here is a step-by-step explanation to determine the color of light absorbed by the compound.\n\n1.  **Find the wavelength of the emitted light.**\n    The relationship between the energy (E) of a photon and its wavelength (λ) is given by the formula E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. A convenient shortcut for converting energy in electron volts (eV) to wavelength in nanometers (nm) is:\n    λ (nm) = 1240 / E (eV)\n\n    Given the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV:\n    λ_emitted = 1240 / 2.3393 eV ≈ 530 nm\n\n2.  **Identify the color of the emitted light.**\n    A wavelength of 530 nm corresponds to **green** light in the visible spectrum.\n\n3.  **Relate emitted light to absorbed light.**\n    When a molecule absorbs light, it gets promoted to an excited state. It then relaxes slightly before emitting light (fluorescence) to return to the ground state. This relaxation process means that the emitted light always has lower energy (and therefore a longer wavelength) than the absorbed light. This phenomenon is known as the Stokes shift.\n\n    Therefore, the energy of absorption is greater than the energy of emission:\n    E_absorbed > E_emitted\n\n    And the wavelength of absorption is shorter than the wavelength of emission:\n    λ_absorbed < λ_emitted\n\n4.  **Determine the color of the absorbed light.**\n    Since the emitted light has a wavelength of ~530 nm (green), the absorbed light must have a wavelength shorter than 530 nm. Let's examine the options based on their approximate wavelengths:\n    *   A) Red: ~620-750 nm (longer than 530 nm)\n    *   D) Yellow: ~570-590 nm (longer than 530 nm)\n    *   B) Blue: ~450-495 nm (shorter than 530 nm)\n    *   C) Violet: ~400-450 nm (shorter than 530 nm)\n\n    Both Blue and Violet light have shorter wavelengths (higher energy) than the emitted green light. However, for a dye that emits green light, the primary absorption peak is typically in the blue region of the spectrum. This represents a common and reasonable Stokes shift. Therefore, blue is the most likely color of light absorbed to produce green emission.\n\n<<<B>>>"
