    "Here is a step-by-step solution to determine the concentration of calcium ions.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Equilibrium**\n\nThe problem involves a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, which is in equilibrium. The complex is formed from calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) and the fully deprotonated form of EDTA ($Y^{4-}$). The formation reaction is:\n\n$Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons CaY^{2-}$\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is the formation constant, $K_f$ (also called the stability constant), which is given as $K_{Ca-EDTA} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$.\n\n$K_f = \\frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n\nSince we start with the complex and want to find the concentration of the free ions, it's more convenient to consider the dissociation reaction, which is the reverse of the formation reaction:\n\n$CaY^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-}$\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this dissociation, $K_d$, is the inverse of the formation constant:\n\n$K_d = \\frac{1}{K_f} = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 2 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\n**2. Set up an ICE Table**\n\nWe can use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to track the concentrations of the species as the complex dissociates to reach equilibrium. We are given that the initial stoichiometric concentration of the complex, $[CaY^{2-}]$, is 0.02 M. We assume the initial concentrations of the free ions are zero. Let 'x' be the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ formed at equilibrium.\n\n| Species     | $CaY^{2-}$ | $Ca^{2+}$ | $Y^{4-}$ |\n|-------------|------------|-----------|----------|\n| **I**nitial | 0.02 M     | 0 M       | 0 M      |\n| **C**hange  | -x         | +x        | +x       |\n| **E**quil.  | 0.02 - x   | x         | x        |\n\n**3. Solve for the Unknown Concentration (x)**\n\nNow, we substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the expression for the dissociation constant, $K_d$:\n\n$K_d = \\frac{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}{[CaY^{2-}]} = \\frac{(x)(x)}{0.02 - x}$\n\n$2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{x^2}{0.02 - x}$\n\nBecause the formation constant ($K_f$) is very large, the complex is very stable. This means the dissociation is very slight, and 'x' will be extremely small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. Therefore, we can make a simplifying approximation:\n\n$0.02 - x \\approx 0.02$\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n$2 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{0.02}$\n\nNow, we can solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of calcium ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$:\n\n$x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times 0.02$\n$x^2 \\approx (2 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times (2 \\times 10^{-2})$\n$x^2 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-13}$\n\nTo find x, we take the square root:\n\n$x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}}$\n$x = \\sqrt{40 \\times 10^{-14}}$\n$x = \\sqrt{40} \\times 10^{-7}$\n$x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions is approximately $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M.\n\n**4. Compare with Options**\n\nThe calculated value, $6.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ M, matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
