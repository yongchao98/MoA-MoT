    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Source of Radiation:**\n    The problem describes an \"oscillating charge distribution\" that is \"spheroid in shape\" with a symmetry axis along the z-axis. This is a source of electromagnetic radiation. In the multipole expansion of radiation fields, the lowest order terms typically dominate. The possible radiating multipoles are electric dipole, magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole, and so on. (The electric monopole, corresponding to the total charge, does not radiate if charge is conserved).\n\n2.  **Choose the Dominant Radiation Model:**\n    An oscillating charge distribution with a defined axis (the z-axis) will, in general, have a time-varying electric dipole moment `p(t)` along that axis. For example, if positive and negative charges oscillate relative to each other along the z-axis. Unless the dipole moment is forced to be zero by some specific symmetry (e.g., if the charge distribution is always symmetric about the xy-plane and only its shape oscillates), the electric dipole radiation will be the dominant form of radiation, especially in the long-wavelength limit (source size `R << λ`). The electric dipole is the simplest and most fundamental model for an oscillating charge distribution. Therefore, we will model the source as an oscillating electric dipole oriented along the z-axis.\n\n3.  **Determine the Angular Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    For an electric dipole `p(t) = p_0 cos(ωt) \\hat{z}`, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) in the radiation zone is given by:\n    `dP/dΩ = C * sin^2(θ)`\n    where `θ` is the angle with respect to the dipole axis (the z-axis), and `C` is a constant that depends on the dipole moment amplitude `p_0` and the frequency `ω`. The function `f` in the problem is this `dP/dΩ`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Fraction of Maximum Power:**\n    *   The maximum radiated power per unit solid angle, `A`, occurs when `sin^2(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin^2(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n    *   So, `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = C * sin^2(90°) = C * 1 = C`.\n    *   We need to find the power radiated at `θ = 30°`.\n    *   `dP/dΩ` at `30°` = `C * sin^2(30°)`.\n    *   Since `sin(30°) = 1/2`, we have `sin^2(30°) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4`.\n    *   So, the power at `30°` is `C * (1/4) = A/4`.\n    *   The fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at `θ = 30°` is `(A/4) / A = 1/4`.\n\n5.  **Determine the Wavelength Dependence:**\n    *   The constant `C` in the power formula is `C = (p_0^2 ω^4) / (32π^2 ε_0 c^3)`. The key part is the dependence on the angular frequency `ω`.\n    *   `dP/dΩ ∝ ω^4`.\n    *   The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by `ω = 2πf = 2π(c/λ)`.\n    *   Substituting this into the proportionality, we get:\n    *   `dP/dΩ ∝ (1/λ)^4 = λ^{-4}`.\n    *   This is the famous `λ^{-4}` dependence responsible for Rayleigh scattering.\n    *   So, a possible form for the function `f` includes a factor of `λ^{-4}`.\n\n6.  **Combine the Results and Select the Correct Option:**\n    *   The fraction of maximum power at `θ = 30°` is `1/4`.\n    *   The dependence on wavelength is `λ^{-4}`.\n    *   Matching these two results with the given options:\n        A) 1/4, `λ^{-3}`\n        B) 1/2, `λ^{-4}`\n        C) 1/4, `λ^{-4}`\n        D) 3/4, `λ^{-6}`\n\n    The correct option is C.\n\n*(Note: Option D corresponds to electric quadrupole radiation, which has a `sin^2(θ)cos^2(θ)` angular dependence and a `λ^{-6}` wavelength dependence. While physically possible, it is not the dominant radiation mechanism for a generic oscillating charge distribution, making the electric dipole model the most appropriate choice.)*\n\n<<<C>>>"
