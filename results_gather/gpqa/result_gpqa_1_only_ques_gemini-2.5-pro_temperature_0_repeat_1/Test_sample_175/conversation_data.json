    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Define the Initial State and Operators**\n\nThe initial state of the system is given by the column matrix (ket vector):\n`|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n\nFirst, we need to normalize this state vector. The squared norm is:\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\nThe normalization constant is `1/√6`. So, the normalized initial state is:\n`|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n\nThe operators for the observables P and Q are given by the matrices:\n`P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n`Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\n**2. First Measurement: Measuring P**\n\nWe need to find the probability of getting the value 0 when measuring P. According to the principles of quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator. The probability of obtaining a specific eigenvalue is the squared magnitude of the projection of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvalues and eigenvector for P=0:**\n    We need to find the eigenvector `|p_0⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ=0`. This is done by solving the equation `P|p_0⟩ = 0|p_0⟩ = 0`.\n    Let `|p_0⟩ = [x, y, z]^T`.\n    `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]^T = [0, 0, 0]^T`\n    This gives the system of equations:\n    1.  `(1/√2)y = 0`  => `y = 0`\n    2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\n    The eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]^T`. To normalize it, we set its length to 1: `x² + 0² + (-x)² = 1` => `2x² = 1` => `x = 1/√2`.\n    So, the normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue 0 is:\n    `|p_0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T`\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring P=0:**\n    The probability `Prob(P=0)` is given by `|⟨p_0|ψ_norm⟩|²`.\n    `⟨p_0|ψ_norm⟩ = ( (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1] ) * ( (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T )`\n    `= (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1)`\n    `= (1/√12) * (-2) = -2 / (2√3) = -1/√3`\n    `Prob(P=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`\n\n**3. State Collapse after Measuring P**\n\nAfter measuring P and obtaining the result 0, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding normalized eigenvector `|p_0⟩`. The new state of the system, let's call it `|ψ'⟩`, is:\n`|ψ'⟩ = |p_0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T`\n\n**4. Second Measurement: Measuring Q**\n\nNow, we measure the observable Q on the new state `|ψ'⟩`. We want to find the probability of getting the value -1.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector for Q=-1:**\n    The operator Q is a diagonal matrix. Its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements (1, 0, -1), and its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. The eigenvector `|q_{-1}⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue -1 is:\n    `|q_{-1}⟩ = [0, 0, 1]^T`\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring Q=-1:**\n    The probability `Prob(Q=-1)` from the state `|ψ'⟩` is given by `|⟨q_{-1}|ψ'⟩|²`.\n    `⟨q_{-1}|ψ'⟩ = [0, 0, 1] * ( (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T )`\n    `= (1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1))`\n    `= -1/√2`\n    `Prob(Q=-1 | after P=0) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2`\n\n**5. Total Probability**\n\nThe probability of the sequence of events (getting P=0, then Q=-1) is the product of the individual probabilities:\n`Prob(P=0 and then Q=-1) = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 | after P=0)`\n`= (1/3) * (1/2)`\n`= 1/6`\n\nThe probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q is 1/6.\n\n<<<A>>>"
