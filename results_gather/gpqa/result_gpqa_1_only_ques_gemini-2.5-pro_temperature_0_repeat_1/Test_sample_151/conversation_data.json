    "The formation of a shmoo in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* is a response to mating pheromones, which causes the cell to arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and prepare for mating. This process involves a significant change in the gene expression profile, meaning there is a high level of transcription of specific genes.\n\nYour experiment aims to recover the proteome of **active chromatin** from these G1-arrested cells. Active chromatin (euchromatin) is where gene transcription occurs. Let's analyze the options in this context:\n\n*   **A) pre-initiation complex (PIC):** The PIC, which includes RNA polymerase II and general transcription factors, assembles at gene promoters to initiate transcription. Since the shmoo response involves actively transcribing many genes, the PIC will be highly abundant on active chromatin.\n*   **C) nucleosome histone complex:** Nucleosomes are the fundamental building blocks of all chromatin, both active and inactive. Any chromatin immunoprecipitation will recover large amounts of histones. In fact, antibodies against modified histones (e.g., acetylated histones) are often used to specifically pull down active chromatin.\n*   **D) enhancer protein complex:** Enhancers (in yeast, called Upstream Activating Sequences or UASs) bind specific transcription factors that activate gene expression. The mating response is controlled by such factors (e.g., Ste12). These complexes are a key feature of active chromatin and would be abundant.\n*   **B) pre-replication complex (pre-RC):** The pre-RC assembles at origins of replication during the G1 phase to \"license\" the DNA for replication in the S phase. However, the shmoo is **arrested** in G1. The cell is preparing to mate, not to divide, and DNA replication is actively inhibited. While the pre-RC is assembled on chromatin during G1, it is not associated with active transcription, and its downstream function (replication) is blocked. Therefore, compared to the complexes directly involved in the massive transcriptional program of the shmoo response, the pre-RC would be the least represented protein complex in a sample specifically enriched for transcriptionally active chromatin.\n\n<<<B>>>"
