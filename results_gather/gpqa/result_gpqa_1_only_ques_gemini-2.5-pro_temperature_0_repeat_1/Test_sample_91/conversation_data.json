    "Here is a step-by-step calculation of the enthalpy of formation.\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\n\nThe compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nLet's draw the structure to count the atoms and bonds:\n\n      CH3\n      |\nH3C - C = CH - CH2 - CH - CH2 - CH = C - CH3\n                         |              |\n                         CH3            CH3\n\n*   **Count Carbon (C) atoms:** 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (from CH(CH3)) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 (from C(CH3)2) = 12 Carbon atoms.\n*   **Count Hydrogen (H) atoms:** 6 (from (CH3)2) + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 (from CH(CH3)) + 2 + 1 + 6 (from C(CH3)2) = 22 Hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nBy examining the structure, we can count the bonds:\n*   **C-H bonds:** There are 22 hydrogen atoms, each bonded to a carbon atom, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C double bonds:** There are two double bonds in the main chain. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C single bonds:**\n    *   Two CH3 groups attached to the first C=C: 2 bonds\n    *   One bond between =CH- and -CH2-: 1 bond\n    *   One bond between -CH2- and -CH(CH3)-: 1 bond\n    *   One bond from the main chain to the CH3 group: 1 bond\n    *   One bond between -CH(CH3)- and -CH2-: 1 bond\n    *   One bond between -CH2- and -CH=: 1 bond\n    *   Two CH3 groups attached to the second C=C: 2 bonds\n    *   Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the compound (ΔH_atom(compound)) is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous compound to form gaseous atoms. It is the sum of all the bond energies.\n\nΔH_atom(compound) = (No. of C-C bonds × BE(C-C)) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE(C=C)) + (No. of C-H bonds × BE(C-H))\nGiven bond energies:\n*   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n\nΔH_atom(C12H22) = (9 × 200) + (2 × 300) + (22 × 400)\nΔH_atom(C12H22) = 1800 + 600 + 8800\n**ΔH_atom(C12H22) = 11200 kJ/mol**\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Reactants**\n\nThe formation reaction for C12H22 is from its elements in their standard states:\n12 C(s, graphite) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the reactants (ΣΔH_atom(reactants)) is the energy required to form gaseous atoms from the elements in their standard states.\nΣΔH_atom(reactants) = 12 × ΔH_atom(C) + 11 × BE(H-H)\n\nGiven:\n*   Enthalpy of atomization of carbon, ΔH_atom(C) = 1000 kJ/mol\n*   Bond energy of H-H, BE(H-H) = 100 kJ/mol\n\nΣΔH_atom(reactants) = (12 × 1000) + (11 × 100)\nΣΔH_atom(reactants) = 12000 + 1100\n**ΣΔH_atom(reactants) = 13100 kJ**\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nUsing Hess's Law, the enthalpy of formation is the difference between the enthalpy of atomization of the reactants and the enthalpy of atomization of the product (the compound).\n\nΔH_f = ΣΔH_atom(reactants) - ΔH_atom(compound)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\n**ΔH_f = 1900 kJ/mol**\n\n**6. Convert the Answer to the Required Units**\n\nThe options are given in kJ/g or kJ/mol. Our calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's check the options.\n*   A) 1900 kJ/g\n*   B) 11200 kJ/mol\n*   C) 11.44 kJ/g\n*   D) 67.4 kJ/mol\n\nOur calculated value of 1900 kJ/mol is not directly listed with the correct units. Option A has the right number but wrong units. Option B is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, not its formation. Let's convert our answer to kJ/g and see if it matches any option.\n\nFirst, calculate the molar mass of C12H22.\nMolar Mass = (12 × Atomic Mass of C) + (22 × Atomic Mass of H)\nMolar Mass ≈ (12 × 12) + (22 × 1) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**\n\nNow, convert the enthalpy of formation from kJ/mol to kJ/g:\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = ΔH_f (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = 1900 kJ/mol / 166 g/mol\n**ΔH_f (kJ/g) ≈ 11.4457 kJ/g**\n\nThis value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
