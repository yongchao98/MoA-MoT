    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This means we have a benzene ring (C₆H₄) with two substituents. A benzene ring accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   **8 carbon atoms in total:** Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n    *   **FTIR - Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents must contain a carbonyl group.\n    *   **FTIR - Aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X):** The other substituent is a halogen atom (like Cl, Br, I) directly attached to the aromatic ring.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n    *   We have a halogen (-X) as one substituent.\n    *   The other substituent must contain 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The most common and stable structure for this is an acetyl group (-COCH₃).\n    *   Combining these pieces, the most likely molecule is a **haloacetophenone** (chemical formula X-C₆H₄-COCH₃). This structure satisfies all the given conditions.\n\n3.  **Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The molecule is a haloacetophenone. Now we need to consider the substitution pattern (ortho, meta, or para) and how it affects the NMR spectrum.\n    *   **Acetyl Protons (-CH₃):** The three protons on the methyl group are adjacent to a carbonyl group, which has no protons. Therefore, they will appear as a **singlet (s)** integrating to **3H**. Their chemical shift is typically around **δ 2.0-2.6 ppm**.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (on the C₆H₄ ring):** There are 4 protons on the di-substituted ring. Their splitting pattern depends on the substitution pattern:\n        *   **Para (1,4-substitution):** This is the most symmetrical arrangement. It results in a simple, characteristic pattern: two doublets (d), each integrating to 2H. The protons closer to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group will be further downfield (higher ppm).\n        *   **Ortho (1,2-substitution):** This would give a complex multiplet pattern for the 4 adjacent aromatic protons.\n        *   **Meta (1,3-substitution):** This would also give a more complex pattern, often with four distinct signals.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (δ 7-8 ppm). This cannot be the correct answer.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **`2.3 (3H, s)`:** This perfectly matches the predicted signal for the acetyl methyl group (-COCH₃).\n        *   **`7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`:** This is the classic pattern for a para-substituted benzene ring with two different substituents. The total integration is 4H, which is correct.\n        *   This data is a perfect match for **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde (-CHO), not a ketone. While an aldehyde contains a carbonyl group, the rest of the data doesn't fit the corresponding structure (p-halo-phenylacetaldehyde, X-C₆H₄-CH₂CHO), as the CH₂ and CHO protons should be coupled, resulting in a doublet and a triplet, not two singlets.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum only shows one proton in the aromatic region (`6.9 (1H, s)`), which is inconsistent with a di-substituted benzene ring that must have 4 aromatic protons.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe provided information points to a para-haloacetophenone structure. The 1H NMR data in option B is the only one that correctly represents this molecule, showing the characteristic signals for the acetyl group and the para-substituted aromatic ring.\n\n<<<B>>>"
