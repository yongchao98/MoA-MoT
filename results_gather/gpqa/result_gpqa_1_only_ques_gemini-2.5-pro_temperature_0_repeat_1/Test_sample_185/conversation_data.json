    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the product of the Cope rearrangement of (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene.\n\n**1. Identify the Starting Material and the Reacting System**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene.\n    *   This is a norbornene derivative where the carbon at position 2 is replaced by a nitrogen atom (an aza-norbornene).\n    *   There is a double bond in the ring between C5 and C6.\n    *   A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is attached to the nitrogen at position 2.\n*   **Reaction:** Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. It requires a 1,5-diene system.\n*   **Identifying the 1,5-diene system:** In our molecule, we have two double bonds: the C5=C6 bond in the ring and the vinyl group's C=C bond. Let's trace the atoms connecting them: `C5=C6-C1-N2-CH=CH2`. This is a 3-aza-1,5-diene system (or a 4-aza-1,5-diene, depending on the numbering convention, but the mechanism is the same).\n\n**2. Determine the Connectivity of the Product**\n\nThe [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement involves the breaking of the central sigma bond (between atoms 3 and 4 of the 1,5-diene chain) and the formation of a new sigma bond between atoms 1 and 6, with a corresponding shift of the two double bonds.\n\nLet's number the atoms of the reacting system:\n`C5=C6–C1–N2–CH=CH2`\n`6  5  4  3   2   1`  (A common numbering for aza-Cope)\n\n*   **Bond to break:** The sigma bond between atoms 3 and 4, which is the `N2-C1` bond.\n*   **Bond to form:** A new sigma bond between atoms 1 and 6, which is between the terminal carbon of the vinyl group (`CH2`) and `C5`.\n*   **Double bonds shift:**\n    *   The vinyl double bond (`C1=C2`) shifts to become an imine double bond (`C2=N3`).\n    *   The ring double bond (`C5=C6`) shifts to a new position (`C4=C5`, which is `C1=C6`).\n\nLet's trace the atoms to see the new ring structure formed.\n*   The original bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton is broken at the `N2-C1` bond.\n*   A new ring is formed. Let's trace its atoms starting from the `C4-C5` bond of the original structure, which will become the fusion bond of the new bicyclic system.\n    *   The chain `C4-C3-N2-C(vinyl_alpha)-C(vinyl_beta)-C5` forms a new six-membered ring.\n    *   The original five-membered ring `C1-C7-C4-C5-C6` remains, but its double bond shifts from `C5=C6` to `C1=C6`.\n\nSo, the product is a fused bicyclic system consisting of:\n1.  A **five-membered cyclopentene ring**: `C4-C7-C1=C6-C5`.\n2.  A **six-membered dihydropyridine ring**: `C4-C3-N2=C(vinyl_alpha)-C(vinyl_beta)-C5`.\n\nThe product has two double bonds: one C=C bond in the 5-membered ring and one C=N (imine) bond in the 6-membered ring. This structure is an isomer of **tetrahydro-cyclopenta[c]pyridine**. The \"tetrahydro\" designation indicates the addition of 4 hydrogens to the parent aromatic `cyclopenta[c]pyridine`, which would reduce two of its four double bonds, leaving two double bonds in the product, consistent with our finding.\n\n**3. Match the Product Structure to the Given Options**\n\nThis is the most challenging part, as it requires mapping our derived structure to the standard IUPAC nomenclature for `cyclopenta[c]pyridine`.\n\n*   **IUPAC Numbering for cyclopenta[c]pyridine:**\n    ```\n          1---7a--7\n         /   \\  /\n        N(2)  4a--6\n         \\   /  \\\n          3---4---5\n    ```\n*   **Our Product's Double Bonds:** We found double bonds at `C1=C6` (original numbering) and `N2=C(vinyl_alpha)`.\n*   **Mapping:** Through a careful process of matching the connectivity of our product to the IUPAC skeleton, we can establish a correspondence between the atoms. The correct mapping reveals that the double bonds in our product correspond to the `N2=C3` and `C5=C6` positions in the IUPAC-numbered `cyclopenta[c]pyridine` skeleton.\n\nNow let's analyze the options based on this finding. We are looking for the option that describes a structure with double bonds at `N2=C3` and `C5=C6`.\n\n*   A) `...-3H-...` DBs at C1=N2, C4a=C5.\n*   B) `...-1H-...` Saturated positions are 1, 4, 4a, 7, 7a. This leaves `N2, C3, C5, C6` as sp2 hybridized. This implies double bonds at **`N2=C3` and `C5=C6`**. This matches our derived structure. The `1H` indicates that position C1 is a saturated CH2 group, which is also consistent with our analysis of the product structure.\n*   C) `...-1H-...` DBs at N2=C3, C7=C7a.\n*   D) `...-3H-...` DBs at C1=N2, C6=C7.\n\nThe structure described by option B is the only one that matches the connectivity and double bond positions of the kinetic product from the aza-Cope rearrangement.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Cope rearrangement of (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene yields 4,4a,7,7a-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[c]pyridine.\n\n<<<B>>>"
