    "This problem describes the phenomenon of Larmor precession for a spin 1/2 particle. Let's break down the physics step-by-step.\n\n### 1. Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   The magnetic field is `B_initial = B * z_hat` (pointing in the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian of the system is `H_initial = -μ · B_initial = -(γS) · (B * z_hat) = -γB * S_z`.\n*   The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with the field. This means the particle is in the lowest energy eigenstate of `H_initial`.\n*   The eigenstates of `S_z` are spin-up `|+z>` (eigenvalue `+ħ/2`) and spin-down `|-z>` (eigenvalue `-ħ/2`).\n*   The corresponding energy levels are `E_up = -γB(ħ/2)` and `E_down = -γB(-ħ/2) = +γB(ħ/2)`.\n*   The lowest energy state is `E_up`, which corresponds to the spin-up state `|+z>`.\n*   Therefore, the initial state of the particle at `t=0` is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`.\n\n### 2. Time Evolution (t ≥ 0)\n\n*   At `t=0`, the magnetic field is switched to `B_new = B * y_hat` (pointing in the +Y direction).\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution of the system is `H_new = -μ · B_new = -γB * S_y`.\n*   The state of the system at a later time `t` is given by the Schrödinger equation:\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * H_new * t / ħ) |ψ(0)>`\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(-i * (-γB * S_y) * t / ħ) |+z>`\n    `|ψ(t)> = exp(i * γB * t * S_y / ħ) |+z>`\n\nThis operator `exp(i * θ * S_y / ħ)` represents a rotation of the state vector around the y-axis by an angle `θ = γB * t`. So, the initial spin state `|+z>` starts to precess around the new magnetic field axis (the y-axis).\n\n### 3. Calculating the Expectation Value of S_z\n\nWe want to find the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z(t)>`. Since `μ_z = γ * S_z`, this is equivalent to finding `<S_z(t)>`.\n\n`<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`\n\nWe can solve this using a few methods.\n\n**Method 1: The Heisenberg Picture**\n\nIn the Heisenberg picture, the operators evolve in time. The equation of motion for the operator `S_z` is:\n`d(S_z)/dt = (1/iħ) * [S_z, H_new] = (1/iħ) * [S_z, -γB * S_y] = (-γB/iħ) * [S_z, S_y]`\n\nUsing the spin commutation relation `[S_y, S_z] = iħS_x`, we get `[S_z, S_y] = -iħS_x`.\n`d(S_z)/dt = (-γB/iħ) * (-iħS_x) = γB * S_x`\n\nSimilarly, for `S_x`:\n`d(S_x)/dt = (1/iħ) * [S_x, -γB * S_y] = (-γB/iħ) * [S_x, S_y]`\nUsing `[S_x, S_y] = iħS_z`:\n`d(S_x)/dt = (-γB/iħ) * (iħS_z) = -γB * S_z`\n\nNow we have a pair of coupled differential equations. We can solve them by differentiating the first equation:\n`d²(S_z)/dt² = γB * d(S_x)/dt`\nSubstituting the second equation into this:\n`d²(S_z)/dt² = γB * (-γB * S_z) = -(γB)² * S_z`\n\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator: `d²(S_z)/dt² + (γB)² * S_z = 0`.\nThe solution for this equation has the form `cos(ωt)` and `sin(ωt)`, where the angular frequency of oscillation is `ω = γB`.\n\nLet's find the full solution for the expectation value:\nThe solution for the operator is `S_z(t) = S_z(0)cos(γBt) + S_x(0)sin(γBt)`.\nThe expectation value is `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(0)| S_z(t) |ψ(0)> = <+z| (S_z cos(γBt) + S_x sin(γBt)) |+z>`.\nThis gives `<S_z(t)> = cos(γBt)<+z|S_z|+z> + sin(γBt)<+z|S_x|+z>`.\nWe know `<+z|S_z|+z> = ħ/2` and `<+z|S_x|+z> = 0`.\nSo, `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(γBt)`.\n\n**Method 2: The Classical Analogy (Larmor Precession)**\n\nA classical magnetic moment `μ` in a magnetic field `B` experiences a torque `τ = μ x B`, which causes it to precess around the magnetic field vector. The equation of motion is `dμ/dt = γ(μ x B)`. This equation describes precession around `B` with an angular frequency `ω = γB`, known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nIn our case, the initial moment is along the Z-axis, and the field is along the Y-axis. The moment vector will precess in the x-z plane around the y-axis. The z-component of the moment will vary as `μ_z(t) = μ_z(0) * cos(ωt)`. The frequency of this oscillation is the Larmor frequency, `ω = γB`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth the quantum mechanical calculation and the classical analogy show that the z-component of the particle's moment oscillates. The oscillation is described by a cosine function with an angular frequency `ω = γB`.\n\nThe question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is `γB`.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) gamma*B/2\nB) gamma*B\nC) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
