    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the given NMR data:**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   Since the mixture is 1:1, the total number of aromatic protons from each compound must be equal. Let's say each compound contributes 'x' aromatic protons. The total aromatic integration is 2x.\n    *   The two signals having a 1:1 ratio means each signal corresponds to x protons.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   The total number of protons in C10H14 is 14. If there are 'x' aromatic protons, there must be (14-x) alkyl protons.\n    *   The total integration of the alkyl region is 2 * (14-x).\n    *   The 2:1:1 ratio corresponds to relative integrations.\n\n**2. Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each candidate compound:**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   *Summary: 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).*\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** One plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two separate singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three sets of equivalent methyl groups: (C1, C3), (C2), and (C5). This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of **6H : 3H : 3H** (which simplifies to 2:1:1).\n    *   *Summary: 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 alkyl singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).*\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** One plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are equivalent but are adjacent to each other. They will couple and appear as an **AB quartet (or two doublets)**, not singlets.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** Two sets of equivalent methyl groups: (C1, C4) and (C2, C3). This will produce **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n    *   *Summary: 1 aromatic AB quartet (2H total), 2 alkyl singlets (6H each).*\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four protons are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **4H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The CH2 groups will produce a **quartet (4H)**, and the CH3 groups will produce a **triplet (6H)**.\n    *   *Summary: 1 aromatic singlet (4H), 1 alkyl quartet (4H), 1 alkyl triplet (6H).*\n\n**3. Evaluate the options based on the mixture's spectrum:**\n\nThe observed spectrum has only singlets in both the aromatic and alkyl regions. This immediately eliminates any option containing **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** (which gives an AB quartet) or **1,4-diethylbenzene** (which gives a quartet and a triplet).\n\nThis leaves only option D as a possibility. Let's verify it.\n\n**Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n\nLet's predict the spectrum of a 1:1 mixture of these two compounds.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet for 2H.\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes two singlets, each for 1H.\n    *   The problem states we see **two singlets in a 1:1 ratio**. This can happen if the two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene accidentally have the same chemical shift, appearing as a single peak integrating to 2H.\n    *   So, we would have:\n        *   Signal 1: Singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (2H)\n        *   Signal 2: Overlapping singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (1H + 1H = 2H)\n    *   This results in two singlets with a 2H:2H or 1:1 integration ratio. This matches the data.\n\n*   **Alkyl Region:**\n    *   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one singlet for 12H.\n    *   1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes three singlets for 6H, 3H, and 3H.\n    *   The problem states we see **three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio**.\n    *   Let's look at the total protons. In a 1:1 mixture, the total alkyl protons are 12 + (6+3+3) = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio for 24 protons means the signals integrate to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   This can happen if:\n        *   Signal 1: The 12H singlet from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n        *   Signal 2: The 6H singlet from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n        *   Signal 3: The two 3H singlets from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene accidentally overlap to form a single peak integrating to 6H.\n    *   This results in three singlets with an integration of 12H:6H:6H, which is a 2:1:1 ratio. This also matches the data.\n\nBoth the aromatic and alkyl regions of the described spectrum are perfectly explained by a 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, assuming some plausible accidental overlaps in chemical shifts.\n\n<<<D>>>"
