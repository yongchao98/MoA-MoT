    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each reaction:\n\n**Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton of dimethyl malonate. The α-protons between the two ester groups are highly acidic.\n    *   Donor Precursor: Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂\n    *   Nucleophile: The malonate enolate, ⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon is electrophilic due to resonance.\n    *   Acceptor: p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:** The malonate enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate.\n    *   Intermediate (enolate): (CH₃OOC)₂CH–CH(p-tolyl)–⁻CH–COOCH₃\n    *   Protonation: The intermediate enolate is protonated by the solvent (EtOH) to give the final product.\n    *   Product (A): (CH₃OOC)₂CH–CH(p-tolyl)–CH₂–COOCH₃\n\n4.  **Name the Product (A):** The structure is (CH₃OOC)₂CH–CH(p-tolyl)–CH₂–COOCH₃. To name this using IUPAC rules, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional groups (the esters). This is a propane chain with carboxylate groups at positions 1, 1, and 3.\n    *   Parent name: trimethyl propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n    *   Substituent: A p-tolyl group is at position 2.\n    *   Full Name: **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**\n\n**Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) --> (B)**\n\nThis is a Stork enamine synthesis, which proceeds via a Michael addition.\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine derived from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the α-carbon (the β-carbon of the original enone system).\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (crotononitrile) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   Acceptor: CH₃–CH(β)=CH(α)–CN\n\n3.  **Michael Addition:** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enamine attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the nitrile. This forms an iminium salt intermediate.\n\n4.  **Hydrolysis:** The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium salt back into a ketone. The overall reaction is the α-alkylation of cyclohexanone.\n    *   The group added to the α-position of cyclohexanone is –CH(CH₃)–CH₂–CN.\n    *   Product (B): A cyclohexanone ring with a –CH(CH₃)–CH₂–CN group at the 2-position.\n\n5.  **Name the Product (B):** The structure is 2-(2-cyanopropyl)cyclohexan-1-one. To match the options, we can also name it as a derivative of butanenitrile.\n    *   Parent chain: Butanenitrile, N≡C(1)–C(2)H₂–C(3)H(CH₃)–C(4)H₃.\n    *   Substituent: The cyclohexanone ring is attached at its C2 position to the C3 of the butanenitrile chain. The substituent is a (2-oxocyclohexyl) group.\n    *   Full Name: **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The keto form is the major product under these conditions, not the enol form (3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile).\n\n**Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\nThis is a Michael addition where we need to identify the starting nucleophile precursor (C).\n\n1.  **Identify the Product and Acceptor:**\n    *   Product: 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. The substituent at C2 is –CH₂–CH₂–C(=O)CH₃.\n    *   Acceptor: but-3-en-2-one, also known as methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), CH₂(β)=CH(α)–C(=O)CH₃.\n\n2.  **Retrosynthesis (Working Backwards):** The Michael addition forms a bond between the nucleophile and the β-carbon of the acceptor. In the product, the bond is between C2 of the dione ring and the first CH₂ of the oxobutyl chain. This CH₂ was the β-carbon of MVK.\n    *   Breaking this bond gives the two starting components (before reaction).\n    *   The acceptor is MVK: CH₂=CH–C(=O)CH₃.\n    *   The nucleophile precursor (C) is the rest of the molecule: cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\n3.  **Identify Reactant C:** The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic proton at C2 of cyclohexane-1,3-dione (located between two carbonyl groups) to form a resonance-stabilized enolate, which then acts as the Michael donor.\n    *   Reactant (C): **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing these results with the given options, option C matches all three parts.\n\n<<<C>>>"
