    "Here is a step-by-step determination of the pH of the final solution.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of acid and base species.**\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.1 M\n    *   Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.050 mol CH3COOH**\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   HCl is a strong acid and dissociates completely (HCl → H+ + Cl-).\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of H+ = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = **0.080 mol H+**\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and dissociates completely, yielding two moles of OH- for every mole of Ba(OH)2 (Ba(OH)2 → Ba2+ + 2OH-).\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of OH- = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L × 2 = **0.180 mol OH-**\n\n**Step 2: Determine the limiting and excess reactants.**\n\nThe strong base (OH-) will first neutralize the strong acid (H+ from HCl), and then it will neutralize the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Total moles of acid species to be neutralized:**\n    *   Total Acid = Moles of H+ (from HCl) + Moles of CH3COOH\n    *   Total Acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n\n*   **Total moles of strong base:**\n    *   Total Base = **0.180 mol OH-**\n\nNow, compare the total moles of acid and base to see which is in excess.\n*   Moles of OH- (0.180 mol) > Total moles of acid (0.130 mol)\n*   Therefore, the strong base is in excess.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the moles of excess strong base.**\n\n*   Moles of excess OH- = Total moles of OH- - Total moles of acid\n*   Moles of excess OH- = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol OH-**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the concentration of the excess OH- in the final solution.**\n\n*   **Total volume of the final solution:**\n    *   V_total = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n\n*   **Concentration of excess OH-:**\n    *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the pOH and then the pH.**\n\nThe pH of the solution is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base.\n\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH-]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   pH + pOH = 14\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>"
