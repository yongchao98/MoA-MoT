    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the forbidden partial wave.\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State and Conservation Laws\n\n*   **Initial State:** The system starts as a two-nucleon (NN) bound system in a `1S0` state.\n    *   From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we have:\n        *   Total Spin `S_i = 0` (since `2S_i+1 = 1`)\n        *   Orbital Angular Momentum `L_i = 0` (from the letter 'S')\n        *   Total Angular Momentum `J_i = 0` (from the subscript '0')\n    *   The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **Final State:** The system decays into a final NN state and a particle X.\n    *   The particle X has intrinsic parity `P(X) = -1`.\n    *   The final NN state has isospin `T(NN) = 0`.\n    *   The final state is denoted as `(NN)_f + l`, where `l` is the orbital angular momentum of particle X relative to the final NN pair's center of mass. We'll denote this as `L_X`.\n\n*   **Conservation Laws and Principles:**\n    1.  **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum must be conserved, so `J_f = J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum `J_f` is the vector sum of the final NN state's total angular momentum, `J(NN)`, and the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `L_X` (assuming X is spinless, which is standard notation).\n        `J_f = J(NN) + L_X` (vector sum).\n        For `J_f` to be 0, the magnitudes must be equal: `J(NN) = L_X`.\n\n    2.  **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity must be conserved, so `P_f = P_i = +1`. The final parity is the product of the parities of the final NN state and particle X.\n        `P_f = P(NN)_f * P(X)`\n        `P(NN)_f = (-1)^L(NN)` (intrinsic parity of two nucleons is +1).\n        `P(X) = P(X)_intrinsic * (-1)^L_X = (-1) * (-1)^L_X`.\n        So, `P_f = (-1)^L(NN) * (-1) * (-1)^L_X = -(-1)^(L(NN) + L_X)`.\n        Setting `P_f = +1`, we get `+1 = -(-1)^(L(NN) + L_X)`, which simplifies to `(-1)^(L(NN) + L_X) = -1`.\n        This requires `L(NN) + L_X` to be an odd integer.\n\n    3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** The problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. This is equivalent to the requirement that the total wavefunction of two identical fermions be antisymmetric, which means `T(NN) + S(NN) + L(NN)` must be an odd integer.\n        Given that the final NN state has `T(NN) = 0`, the condition becomes `0 + S(NN) + L(NN)` must be odd.\n        So, `S(NN) + L(NN)` must be an odd integer.\n\n    4.  **Physicality of States:** A two-nucleon system is composed of two spin-1/2 particles. Their total spin `S(NN)` can only be `S=0` (singlet) or `S=1` (triplet). Therefore, the spin multiplicity `2S+1` can only be 1 or 3. Any other value is unphysical.\n\n### 2. Analyze Each Option\n\nWe will check each option against these four conditions. A transition is not permitted if it violates any of them.\n\n**A) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S(NN)=1`, `L(NN)=2`, `J(NN)=3`.\n*   Particle X `f`-wave: `L_X=3`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J(NN) = L_X`? `3 = 3`. (OK)\n2.  **P Conservation:** `L(NN) + L_X` odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S(NN) + L(NN)` odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. (OK)\n4.  **State Physicality:** `S(NN)=1` is possible. (OK)\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S(NN)=1`, `L(NN)=0`, `J(NN)=1`.\n*   Particle X `p`-wave: `L_X=1`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J(NN) = L_X`? `1 = 1`. (OK)\n2.  **P Conservation:** `L(NN) + L_X` odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S(NN) + L(NN)` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n4.  **State Physicality:** `S(NN)=1` is possible. (OK)\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**C) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S(NN)=1`, `L(NN)=1`, `J(NN)=0`.\n*   Particle X `s`-wave: `L_X=0`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J(NN) = L_X`? `0 = 0`. (OK)\n2.  **P Conservation:** `L(NN) + L_X` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S(NN) + L(NN)` odd? `1 + 1 = 2`. (FAIL - this is even)\n4.  **State Physicality:** `S(NN)=1` is possible. (OK)\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **not permitted** because it violates the Pauli exclusion principle for the final NN state.\n\n**D) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S(NN)+1=7` -> `S(NN)=3`.\n*   Particle X `p`-wave: `L_X=1`.\n1.  **J Conservation:** `J(NN)=1`, `L_X=1`. `1=1`. (OK)\n2.  **P Conservation:** `L(NN)=2`, `L_X=1`. `2+1=3`. (OK)\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S(NN)=3`, `L(NN)=2`. `3+2=5`. (OK)\n4.  **State Physicality:** `S(NN)=3` is **not possible** for a two-nucleon system. (FAIL)\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **not permitted** because the final state `7D1` is unphysical for a two-nucleon system.\n\n### 3. Final Decision\n\nBoth options C and D describe forbidden transitions. However, they are forbidden for different reasons:\n*   **Option C** is forbidden because the process violates a selection rule (the Pauli principle as applied to the final `T=0` state). The state `3P0` itself is a valid quantum state, but it cannot be the final state of this particular process under the given conditions.\n*   **Option D** is forbidden for a more fundamental reason: the proposed final state `7D1` cannot exist for a system of two nucleons. The rules of the process (J and P conservation, Pauli principle) are hypothetically satisfied, but the destination state is not part of the system's possible states.\n\nThe question explicitly asks to \"Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity\" and provides the specific Pauli statistics rule. Option C is the one that is ruled out directly by applying these rules for the process. The issue with option D is the validity of the state itself, which is a prerequisite piece of knowledge not directly related to the conservation laws governing the transition dynamics. Therefore, the most likely intended answer is the one that violates the explicitly mentioned rules for the transition.\n\n<<<C>>>"
