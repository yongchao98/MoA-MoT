    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n**1. Normalize the initial state |alpha>**\n\nThe state is given as being proportional to `(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>`. Let's write the state as:\n`|alpha> = C * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`\n\nTo normalize the state, we must satisfy the condition `<alpha|alpha> = 1`.\nThe bra corresponding to `|alpha>` is `<alpha| = C* * [(1-i) <up| + (2+i) <down>]`.\n\nNow, we calculate the inner product `<alpha|alpha>`:\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [(1-i) <up| + (2+i) <down|] * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`\nUsing the orthonormality of the basis vectors (`<up|up> = 1`, `<down|down> = 1`, `<up|down> = <down|up> = 0`), we get:\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [(1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)]`\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [(1² - i²) + (2² - i²)]`\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [(1 - (-1)) + (4 - (-1))]`\n`<alpha|alpha> = |C|^2 * [2 + 5] = 7|C|^2`\n\nSetting this equal to 1 for normalization:\n`7|C|^2 = 1  =>  |C|^2 = 1/7  =>  C = 1/sqrt(7)` (we can choose the real, positive root).\n\nSo, the normalized state is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]`\nIn vector notation, with `|up> = [1, 0]^T` and `|down> = [0, 1]^T`, this is:\n`|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1+i, 2-i]^T`\n\n**2. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator A**\n\nThe operator A is defined by its matrix elements `Aij = hbar/2` if `i ≠ j` and `Aij = 0` if `i = j`. In the `{|up>, |down>}` basis, the matrix is:\n`A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\nThis is `(hbar/2) * sigma_x`, where `sigma_x` is the Pauli X matrix.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[ -λ, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -λ ]]) = 0`\n`(-λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)(hbar/2) = 0`\n`λ² - (hbar/2)² = 0`\n`λ² = (hbar/2)²`\nThe eigenvalues are `λ₁ = +hbar/2` and `λ₂ = -hbar/2`.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors.\nFor `λ₁ = +hbar/2`:\n`(A - λ₁I) |v₁> = 0`\n`[[ -hbar/2, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, -hbar/2 ]] * [[x], [y]] = 0`\nThis gives the equation `- (hbar/2)x + (hbar/2)y = 0`, which simplifies to `x = y`.\nThe eigenvector is proportional to `[1, 1]^T`. Normalizing it:\n`|v₁> = (1/sqrt(1²+1²)) * [1, 1]^T = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1]^T = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> + |down>)`\n\nFor `λ₂ = -hbar/2`:\n`(A - λ₂I) |v₂> = 0`\n`[[ hbar/2, hbar/2 ], [ hbar/2, hbar/2 ]] * [[x], [y]] = 0`\nThis gives the equation `(hbar/2)x + (hbar/2)y = 0`, which simplifies to `x = -y`.\nThe eigenvector is proportional to `[1, -1]^T`. Normalizing it:\n`|v₂> = (1/sqrt(1²+(-1)²)) * [1, -1]^T = (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, -1]^T = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up> - |down>)`\n\n**3. Calculate the probabilities**\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue `λi` is given by `P(λi) = |<vi|alpha>|²`.\n\nProbability `P₁` of measuring `λ₁ = +hbar/2`:\n`<v₁|alpha> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| + <down|)] * [(1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>)]`\n`<v₁|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [ (1+i)<up|up> + (2-i)<down|down> ]`\n`<v₁|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [ (1+i) + (2-i) ] = 3/sqrt(14)`\n`P₁ = |<v₁|alpha>|² = |3/sqrt(14)|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.643`\n\nProbability `P₂` of measuring `λ₂ = -hbar/2`:\n`<v₂|alpha> = [(1/sqrt(2)) * (<up| - <down|)] * [(1/sqrt(7)) * ((1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>)]`\n`<v₂|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [ (1+i)<up|up> - (2-i)<down|down> ]`\n`<v₂|alpha> = (1/sqrt(14)) * [ (1+i) - (2-i) ] = (1/sqrt(14)) * [-1 + 2i]`\n`P₂ = |<v₂|alpha>|² = |(-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. (Check: 9/14 + 5/14 = 14/14 = 1).\n\n**4. Find the average value of the operator A**\n\nThe average (or expectation) value `<A>` can be calculated using the formula `<A> = Σ Pᵢ * λᵢ`.\n`<A> = P₁λ₁ + P₂λ₂`\n`<A> = (9/14) * (hbar/2) + (5/14) * (-hbar/2)`\n`<A> = (hbar/28) * (9 - 5)`\n`<A> = 4*hbar/28 = hbar/7`\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate `<A> = <alpha|A|alpha>`:\n`A|alpha> = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * (1/sqrt(7)) * [[1+i], [2-i]] = (hbar/(2*sqrt(7))) * [[2-i], [1+i]]`\n`<alpha|A|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * [1-i, 2+i] * (hbar/(2*sqrt(7))) * [[2-i], [1+i]]`\n`<A> = (hbar/14) * [ (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) ]`\n`<A> = (hbar/14) * [ (2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1) ]`\n`<A> = (hbar/14) * [ (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) ]`\n`<A> = (hbar/14) * [2] = hbar/7`\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe probabilities are `9/14 ≈ 0.64` and `5/14 ≈ 0.36`.\nThe average value is `hbar/7`.\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
