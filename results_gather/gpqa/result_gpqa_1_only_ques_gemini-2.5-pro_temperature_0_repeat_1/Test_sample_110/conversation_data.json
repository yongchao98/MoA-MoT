    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the two reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) ---> A\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This is a ketone.\n    *   **Reagent:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which acts as a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered base.\n    *   The combination of a ketone (or other compound with acidic α-protons), a base, and an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound points to a **Michael Addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation:**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) deprotonates the ketone at an α-carbon to form an enolate.\n    *   The α-carbons to the carbonyl group (C=O at C1) are C2 and C6.\n    *   **At C2:** This carbon is quaternary, bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3. It has **no α-protons**. Therefore, deprotonation cannot occur at C2.\n    *   **At C6:** This carbon is tertiary, bonded to a methyl group, C1, C5, and one hydrogen. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, the base must deprotonate the ketone at C6, forming the only possible enolate.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The enolate formed at C6 acts as a nucleophile.\n    *   It attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate molecule.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Product Structure and Naming:**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The reaction adds a `-(CH₂-CH₂-COOEt)` group to C6.\n    *   The resulting product is 6-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   To match the name format in the options, we name the product as a derivative of ethyl propanoate.\n        *   The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`.\n        *   The cyclohexanone ring is a substituent on C3 of the propanoate chain.\n        *   We number the cyclohexyl ring substituent starting from the point of attachment (C1'). This was C6 in the original ketone.\n        *   The substituents on the ring are:\n            *   A methyl group at C1' (originally at C6).\n            *   An oxo group (=O) at C2' (originally at C1).\n            *   An ethyl group and a methyl group at C3' (originally at C2).\n        *   The name of the substituent is `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`.\n        *   The full name of product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O) ---> B\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂). The protons on the carbon adjacent to the nitro group (α-protons) are acidic.\n    *   **Reagent:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃-CH=CH-CN). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile, a Michael acceptor.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n    *   This is also a **Michael Addition** reaction.\n\n2.  **Carbanion Formation:**\n    *   The base (KOH) deprotonates the 1-nitropropane at the α-carbon (C1) to form a resonance-stabilized carbanion (a nitronate anion).\n    *   `CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂ + OH⁻  ⇌  CH₃-CH₂-CH⁻-NO₂ + H₂O`\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The nitronate anion attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon from the nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n\n4.  **Product Structure and Naming:**\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 (the β-carbon) of the butenenitrile.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile group is C1.\n    *   The longest carbon chain including C1 is a six-carbon chain (hexanenitrile).\n        *   `CN(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH₂(5)-CH₃(6)`\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name of product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile\n\nOption A correctly identifies both major products.\n\n<<<A>>>"
