    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   The mass fraction of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon CₓHᵧ is given by `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\n    *   So, `y / (12x + y) = 1/7`. This simplifies to `7y = 12x + y`, which gives `6y = 12x`, or `y = 2x`.\n    *   The empirical formula of Z is CH₂.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen). A saturated hydrocarbon can be an alkane (CₙH₂ₙ₊₂) or a cycloalkane (CₙH₂ₙ).\n    *   The formula CₙH₂ₙ matches the empirical formula CH₂. Therefore, Z must be a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent. The most common cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits all the information provided for Z.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hydrogenation Reactions:**\n    *   Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only* substance Z (cyclohexane).\n    *   This is a crucial clue: it means that all the components in both mixtures must have a six-carbon skeleton that can be hydrogenated to form a cyclohexane ring.\n\n3.  **Analyze Mixture Y and the Disproportionation Reaction:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   One component of Y is Z (cyclohexane, C₆H₁₂). Let the other component be Y'.\n    *   Since Y does not decolorize bromine water, Y' must be saturated or aromatic.\n    *   Hydrogenation of Y' must also yield cyclohexane. The most common substance that fits this description is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic, does not react with bromine water under these conditions, and is readily hydrogenated to cyclohexane.\n    *   So, **Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n    *   Mixture Y is formed from mixture X via a disproportionation reaction on a platinum catalyst. This is characteristic of a catalytic hydrogen transfer. In such a reaction, some molecules are hydrogenated (gain hydrogen) while others are dehydrogenated (lose hydrogen).\n    *   The formation of cyclohexane (hydrogenated product) and benzene (dehydrogenated product) from unsaturated C₆ cyclic precursors is a classic example of this.\n\n4.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X:**\n    *   Let the two components of the equimolar mixture X be X₁ and X₂.\n    *   The overall reaction is: X₁ + X₂ → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆).\n    *   Based on the hydrogenation results, X₁ and X₂ must be C₆ cyclic compounds. Let their formulas be C₆Hₐ and C₆Hₑ.\n    *   By conservation of atoms, the total number of atoms on both sides of the equation must be equal.\n        *   Carbon: 6 + 6 = 6 + 6 (This is consistent).\n        *   Hydrogen: a + b = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   So, the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of X₁ and one molecule of X₂ is 18.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, so both X₁ and X₂ must be unsaturated (i.e., contain C=C double bonds). This means a < 12 and b < 12.\n    *   The problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X.\n    *   We need to find two plausible unsaturated C₆ cyclic compounds whose hydrogen atoms sum to 18. The most logical combination is a C₆ alkene and a C₆ diene.\n        *   Let X₁ be **cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**. (a=10)\n        *   Let X₂ be a cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). (b=8)\n    *   Check the sum: a + b = 10 + 8 = 18. This works.\n    *   The cyclohexadiene must be non-conjugated, so it must be **cyclohexa-1,4-diene**.\n    *   The reaction is: Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) + Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈) → Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆). In this hydrogen transfer, the diene donates hydrogen to the alkene.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n    *   This is the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and one molecule of cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈).\n    *   Total H atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
