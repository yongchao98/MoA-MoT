    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. This anhydride has a single peak in its ¹H NMR spectrum (at 7 ppm) and two peaks in its ¹³C NMR spectrum (at 137 ppm and 165 ppm).\n    *   The simplest *cis*-dicarboxylic acid is maleic acid.\n    *   Dehydration of maleic acid yields **maleic anhydride**.\n    *   Let's check the NMR data for maleic anhydride. Due to its symmetry, it has only one type of proton (the two vinyl protons), which would appear as a singlet. The chemical shift of ~7 ppm is appropriate for vinyl protons deshielded by two adjacent carbonyl groups. It also has two types of carbons: the two equivalent vinyl carbons (C=C) and the two equivalent carbonyl carbons (C=O). The peak at ~137 ppm corresponds to the vinyl carbons, and the peak at ~165 ppm corresponds to the carbonyl carbons.\n    *   Therefore, the dienophile is **maleic anhydride**.\n\n*   **Diene:** The problem explicitly states the diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**2. The Diels-Alder Reaction and its Products**\n\n*   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride.\n*   This reaction produces a bicyclic adduct. The formation of a major and a minor product indicates the formation of *endo* and *exo* stereoisomers.\n*   According to the **endo rule**, the major product of a Diels-Alder reaction is typically the *endo* isomer, where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride ring) are oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the longest bridge of the newly formed bicyclic system. In this case, the longest bridge is the C=C double bond, but the key interaction is with the C7 bridge. The *endo* product has the anhydride ring tucked under the bicyclic system, on the same side as the C7 bridge.\n*   The **major product is the *endo* adduct**, and the **minor product is the *exo* adduct**.\n*   The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (Diene C₉H₁₄ + Dienophile C₄H₂O₃ = C₁₃H₁₆O₃), which matches the information given.\n\n**3. Structure and NMR of the Major (*endo*) Product**\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the *endo* adduct and predict its ¹H NMR signals. The molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Vinyl methyl groups:** Two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond. This will be a **6H singlet**. These are on sp² carbons, so they will be relatively downfield for methyl groups, around **~1.7 ppm**.\n*   **Bridgehead methyl groups:** Two equivalent methyl groups at the bridgehead positions. This will be another **6H singlet**. These are on sp³ carbons, so they will be upfield, around **~1.0 ppm**.\n*   **Anhydride protons:** Two equivalent protons on the fused anhydride ring. They are adjacent to carbonyl groups, which makes them significantly deshielded. This will be a **2H singlet** around **~3.5 ppm**.\n*   **Bridge protons:** The two protons on the C7 bridge are not equivalent. One is *syn* to the double bond, and the other is *anti*. They would likely appear as two separate signals, probably doublets due to geminal coupling. The *syn* proton is shielded by the π-system of the double bond and would appear more upfield, around **~1.5 ppm**.\n\n**4. Analyzing the NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The problem states that a specific cross-peak is **present in the major product (*endo*)** but **absent or weak in the minor product (*exo*)**. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\nLet's compare the spatial relationships in both isomers:\n\n*   ***Endo* Isomer (Major):** The anhydride ring is on the same side as the C7 bridge. This brings the **anhydride protons** (2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm) very close to the ***syn*-proton on the C7 bridge** (1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm). A strong NOE cross-peak is expected between these two signals.\n\n*   ***Exo* Isomer (Minor):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the C7 bridge. The **anhydride protons** are now far away from the **C7 bridge protons**. No NOE cross-peak is expected between them. Instead, in the *exo* isomer, the anhydride protons are close to the vinyl methyl groups (~1.7 ppm).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe NOE cross-peak that is uniquely present in the major (*endo*) product is the one connecting the anhydride protons and the *syn*-C7 bridge proton. Based on our chemical shift assignments:\n\n*   Anhydride protons: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n*   *syn*-C7 bridge proton: **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**\n\nNow let's match this with the given options:\n\nA) **A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This matches our analysis perfectly. These are the *syn*-C7 proton and the anhydride protons, which are close in the *endo* adduct.\nB) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm: These are the bridgehead methyls and the *syn*-C7 proton. They are close in both isomers.\nC) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm: These are the bridgehead methyls and the vinyl methyls. They are close in both isomers.\nD) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm: These are the vinyl methyls and the anhydride protons. They are far apart in the *endo* (major) product but close in the *exo* (minor) product. This is the opposite of what is described.\n\nTherefore, the cross-peak observed in the major product connects the resonances described in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
