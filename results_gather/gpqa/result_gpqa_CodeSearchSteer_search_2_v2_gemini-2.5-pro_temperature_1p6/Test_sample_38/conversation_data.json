    "To determine the numerical value of \"a\", we must use the normalization condition from quantum mechanics. This condition states that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere in the space it is allowed to exist must be equal to 1. This probability is calculated by integrating the square of the modulus of the wave function, |ψ(x)|², over the entire allowed region.\n\nThe given wave function is:\nψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nThe particle is only found in the region between x=1 and x=3.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the probability density, which is |ψ(x)|². This is found by multiplying the wave function by its complex conjugate.\n\nThe complex conjugate, ψ*(x), is found by changing the sign of the imaginary part:\nψ*(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i\n\nNow, we calculate the probability density, |ψ(x)|²:\n|ψ(x)|² = ψ*(x) * ψ(x)\n|ψ(x)|² = [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5i ] * [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5i ]\nUsing the identity (u + iv)(u - iv) = u² + v², we get:\n|ψ(x)|² = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) )² + (0.5)²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nNext, we apply the normalization condition by integrating the probability density from x=1 to x=3 and setting the result to 1.\n\n∫¹³ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nWe solve the integral:\n∫ (a² / (1 + x)) dx = a² * ln(1 + x)\n∫ 0.25 dx = 0.25x\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral from 1 to 3:\n[a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25x] from 1 to 3\n= [a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3] - [a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1]\n= [a² * ln(4) + 0.75] - [a² * ln(2) + 0.25]\n= a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5\n\nSet this expression equal to 1:\na² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5 = 1\n\nUsing the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\na² * ln(4/2) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\nNow, we solve for 'a':\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\na = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))\n\nUsing the value ln(2) ≈ 0.6931:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7214\na ≈ sqrt(0.7214) ≈ 0.8493\n\nThis value is approximately 0.85.\n\n<<<A>>>"
