    "To solve this problem, we need to use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n### 1. Identify the Knowns\n*   **Destination:** Earth\n*   **Origin:** The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)\n*   **Distance to LMC:** Approximately 160,000 to 163,000 light-years. A commonly cited value is around 160,000 light-years.\n*   **Spacecraft Speed (v):** 0.99999987 * c (where 'c' is the speed of light)\n*   **Astronaut's Age:** 22 years\n*   **Astronaut's Lifespan:** 150 years\n\n### 2. The Physics: Time Dilation\n\nAccording to Einstein's theory of special relativity, time for a moving observer passes more slowly than for a stationary observer. This effect, known as time dilation, is described by the formula:\n\n`t_astronaut = t_earth * √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `t_astronaut` is the time experienced by the astronaut (the proper time).\n*   `t_earth` is the time that passes on Earth.\n*   `v` is the velocity of the spacecraft.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n\nThe term `1 / √(1 - v²/c²)` is known as the Lorentz factor (γ).\n\n### 3. Calculation\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the travel time from Earth's perspective (`t_earth`).**\nFirst, we determine how long the journey takes as measured by clocks on Earth. Using a common distance estimate for the LMC of about 160,000 light-years:\n\n`t_earth = Distance / Velocity`\n`t_earth = 160,000 light-years / 0.99999987 * c`\n`t_earth ≈ 160,000.02 years`\n\nFor observers on Earth, the journey takes just over 160,000 years.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\nThis factor tells us how much time is slowed for the traveling astronaut.\n\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.99999987c)²/c²)`\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.99999987²)`\n`γ ≈ 1 / √(0.00000026)`\n`γ ≈ 1 / 0.0005099`\n`γ ≈ 1961.16`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (`t_astronaut`).**\nNow, we can find out how much time has passed for the astronaut by dividing the Earth time by the Lorentz factor.\n\n`t_astronaut = t_earth / γ`\n`t_astronaut = 160,000.02 years / 1961.16`\n`t_astronaut ≈ 81.58 years`\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe journey will take approximately **81.6 years** from the astronaut's perspective.\n\n*   The astronaut started the journey at 22 years old.\n*   Upon arrival at Earth, the astronaut's age would be 22 + 81.6 = **103.6 years**.\n*   This is well within the alien's 150-year lifespan, so the astronaut survives the trip.\n\nComparing our calculated time of ~81.6 years to the given options, the closest choice is 81 years.\n\n<<<B>>>"
