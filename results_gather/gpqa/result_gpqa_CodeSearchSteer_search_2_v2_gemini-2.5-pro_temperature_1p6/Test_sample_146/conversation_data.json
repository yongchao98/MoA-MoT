    "Here is the step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Conservation of Energy\n\nThe fundamental principle governing this annihilation process is the conservation of energy. The total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after the annihilation.\n\n**Initial State:**\n*   We have a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n*   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We can assume it is effectively at rest.\n*   Assuming the process happens in a stationary target frame, the proton is also at rest.\n*   Therefore, the initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n*   The rest mass energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938 MeV. The antiproton has the same rest mass.\n\nSo, the total initial energy is:\n$E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**Final State:**\n*   The annihilation produces four particles: two $A^+$ and two $A^-$.\n*   The rest mass energy of each particle A ($m_A c^2$) is given as 300 MeV.\n*   These four particles will be moving, so they possess both rest mass energy and kinetic energy.\n*   The total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the total energies of the four A particles. Due to the conservation of momentum (starting from a near-zero initial momentum), the kinetic energy will be distributed equally among the four resulting particles.\n*   The total energy of a single relativistic particle is given by $E = \\gamma m c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\nSo, the total final energy is:\n$E_f = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2) = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times 300 \\text{ MeV} = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n### 2. Calculation\n\nBy equating the initial and final energies ($E_i = E_f$):\n$1876 \\text{ MeV} = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\nNow, we can solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876}{1200} \\approx 1.5633$\n\n### 3. Finding the Velocity\n\nThe Lorentz factor is related to the velocity ($v$) by the equation:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for $v/c$:\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n$1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nNow, substitute the value of $\\gamma$ we found:\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4092}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{0.5908}$\n$v/c \\approx 0.7686$\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.96c\nB) 0.91c\nC) 0.77c\nD) 0.86c\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
