    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], among all cobalt-containing species, we need to calculate its mole fraction (α₂) and then convert it to a percentage.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all species:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed using the overall stability constants (βn):\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nThe mole fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (α₂) is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nBy substituting the expressions for each species, we derive a formula for α₂ that depends on the free thiocyanate concentration ([SCN⁻]) and the stability constants:\n\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nWe are given the following values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nNow, we can perform the calculation:\n1.  **Calculate the terms for the denominator:**\n    *   1\n    *   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9\n    *   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n    *   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n    *   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\n2.  **Sum the denominator terms:**\n    *   Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\n3.  **The numerator is the β₂[SCN⁻]² term:**\n    *   Numerator = 0.4\n\n4.  **Calculate the mole fraction (α₂):**\n    *   α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\n5.  **Convert the mole fraction to a percentage:**\n    *   Percentage = 0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%\n\nThe calculated percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<A>>>"
