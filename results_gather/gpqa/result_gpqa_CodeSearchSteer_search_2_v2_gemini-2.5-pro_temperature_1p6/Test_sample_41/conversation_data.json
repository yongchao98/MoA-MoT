    "The results of the search confirm the physical principles used in the initial reasoning.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature:** The search results confirm that the equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is primarily dependent on the temperature and size of its star, and the planet's distance from the star (semi-major axis, 'a', for a circular orbit). The standard formula shows that T_eq is proportional to 1/√a. The problem states the orbits are circular and the planets orbit the same star. The albedo is the same for all planets, thus it cancels out in the ratio. The other information about mass and the TTV discovery method appears to be extraneous.\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** The search results also confirm Kepler's Third Law, which states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). This can be expressed as P² ∝ a³. Therefore, the ratio of the orbital periods of two planets around the same star is (P₂/P₁)² = (a₂/a₁_³_, or P₂/P₁ = (a₂/a₁)³/².\n\nThe calculation steps remain the same:\nFirst, determine the ratio of the semi-major axes using the given temperature ratios. Then, use that result to find the ratio of the orbital periods via Kepler's Third Law.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes.**\n\nThe relationship between equilibrium temperature and semi-major axis is:\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\nGiven:\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 1.4\n*   T_eq2 / T_eq3 = 2.3\n\nFrom this, we can derive the ratios of the semi-major axes:\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a₂/a₁) = 1.4  =>  a₂/a₁ = 1.4² = 1.96\n*   T_eq2 / T_eq3 = √(a₃/a₂) = 2.3  =>  a₃/a₂ = 2.3² = 5.29\n\nTo find the ratio between Planet 3 and Planet 1 (a₃/a₁), we multiply the intermediate ratios:\na₃/a₁ = (a₃/a₂) * (a₂/a₁) = 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the ratio of the orbital periods.**\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, P ∝ a^(3/2).\nTherefore, the ratio of the orbital periods of Planet 3 to Planet 1 is:\nP₃ / P₁ = (a₃ / a₁)^(3/2)\nP₃ / P₁ = (10.3684)^(1.5)\nP₃ / P₁ ≈ 33.38\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
