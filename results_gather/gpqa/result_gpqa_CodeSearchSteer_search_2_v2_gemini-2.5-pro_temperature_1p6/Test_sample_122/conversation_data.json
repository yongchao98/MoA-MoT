    "This problem involves the concept of time dilation from Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity. Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n### 1. Identify the Frames of Reference\n\n*   **Galaxy Reference Frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we want to determine the distance traveled by the ejecta.\n*   **Ejecta Reference Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame. A clock in this frame measures the proper time.\n\n### 2. State the Given Information\n\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is 60,000 km/s.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt'):** The time that has passed in the ejecta's reference frame is 50 seconds.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 300,000 km/s. While the exact value is 299,792.458 km/s, the approximation is sufficient for this problem and is standard in many physics calculations.\n\n### 3. Determine the Goal\n\nThe objective is to calculate the distance the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame (let's call it Δx).\n\n### 4. Apply the Time Dilation Formula\n\nAccording to the theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object. This phenomenon is called time dilation. The formula for time dilation is:\n\nΔt = γ * Δt'\n\nwhere:\n*   **Δt** is the time elapsed in the stationary reference frame (the Galaxy).\n*   **Δt'** is the proper time, the time elapsed in the moving reference frame (the ejecta), which is given as 50 s.\n*   **γ** (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, which is calculated as:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\n### 5. Calculation\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light (β).**\n    β = v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ).**\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)\n    γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798\n    γ ≈ 1.0206\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt).**\n    Δt = γ * Δt' = 1.0206 * 50 s\n    Δt ≈ 51.03 s\n\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δx).**\n    The distance is the velocity multiplied by the time elapsed in the same reference frame.\n    Δx = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s\n    Δx ≈ 3,061,800 km\n\n### 6. Compare with Options and Conclude\n\nThe calculated distance is approximately 3,061,800 km. Comparing this value to the given options:\n\n*   A) 3,000,000 km\n*   B) 2,880,000 km\n*   C) 2,940,000 km\n*   D) 3,060,000 km\n\nThe calculated value is closest to option D.\n\n**A quick sanity check:** Without considering relativistic effects (classical mechanics), the distance would be simply velocity × time = 60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km. Because of time dilation, the time measured in the Galaxy's frame must be longer than 50 seconds, so the distance covered in the Galaxy's frame must be greater than 3,000,000 km. This immediately eliminates options A, B, and C, leaving only D as the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
