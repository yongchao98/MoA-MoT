    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Goal\nThe main objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n\n### 2. Equilibrium Temperature Formula\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\nT_eq = T_eff * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n\nWhere:\n*   T_eff is the star's effective temperature.\n*   A is the planet's albedo.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_eff * (1 - A1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a1))] / [T_eff * (1 - A2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a2))]\n\nThe problem states that the planets orbit the same star, so T_eff and R_star are the same for both. It is also given that both planets have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, most terms cancel out:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we first need to determine the ratio of the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.\n\n### 4. Using the Radial Velocity (RV) Method\nThe problem provides information from the radial velocity method, which measures the Doppler shift of the star's light caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve (K) is related to the planet's mass (M_p), the star's mass (M_star), and the semi-major axis (a).\n\nFor a circular orbit, and assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (M_p << M_star), the formula for the RV semi-amplitude is:\n\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n\nThe detection by the transit method implies an orbital inclination i ≈ 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1, which is implicitly used in this formula.\n\n### 5. Relating Semi-Major Axis to RV Data\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for the semi-major axis, 'a':\n\nK^2 ≈ (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)\nK^2 ≈ (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * a)\na ≈ (G * M_p^2) / (M_star * K^2)\n\n### 6. Calculating the Ratio of Semi-Major Axes\nNow, we can find the ratio a2 / a1:\n\na2 / a1 = [(G * M_p2^2) / (M_star * K2^2)] / [(G * M_p1^2) / (M_star * K1^2)]\n\nThe gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) are the same in both expressions, so they cancel out:\n\na2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) * (K1^2 / M_p1^2)\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2\n\n### 7. Plugging in the Given Values\nFrom the problem statement:\n*   M_p1 = 7 M_earth\n*   M_p2 = 5 M_earth\n*   The Doppler shift for Planet1 (Δλ1) is up to 0.03 Å.\n*   The Doppler shift for Planet2 (Δλ2) is up to 0.04 Å.\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the Doppler shift Δλ (K = c * Δλ / λ, where c and λ are constants). Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:\n\nK1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nThe ratio of the planet masses is:\n\nM_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\nNow, substitute these ratios back into the equation for a2 / a1:\n\na2 / a1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2\na2 / a1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na2 / a1 = 225 / 784\n\n### 8. Final Calculation of the Temperature Ratio\nFinally, substitute the value of a2 / a1 back into the temperature ratio equation:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a2 / a1)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>"
