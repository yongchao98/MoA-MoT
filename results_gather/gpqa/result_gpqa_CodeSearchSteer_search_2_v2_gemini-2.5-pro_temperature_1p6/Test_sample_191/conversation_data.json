    "This is a classic problem in electrostatics that demonstrates the principle of electrostatic shielding.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity will attract the free electrons within the conductor. A charge of `-q` will be induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n2.  **Charge Conservation:** Since the spherical conductor was initially uncharged, and a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner cavity wall, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality.\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key property of conductors is that the material shields the outside from the inside. The electric field inside the conducting material itself is zero. Because of this shielding, the charge `+q` on the outer surface is not affected by the position of the cavity or the charge within it.\n4.  **Charge Distribution on the Outer Surface:** Since the conductor is a sphere and is isolated, the induced charge `+q` on its outer surface will distribute itself uniformly.\n5.  **Electric Field Outside the Sphere:** According to Gauss's Law (or the Shell Theorem), the electric field at a point outside a uniformly charged sphere is identical to the field produced by a single point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n\nTherefore, the electric field at point P, which is a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor, is determined only by the total charge on the outer surface (`+q`) and the distance from the center (`L`). The location of the cavity (`s`), the charge within the cavity (`l`), and the angle (`Î¸`) are all irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor.\n\nThe magnitude of the electric field is given by Coulomb's Law for a point charge:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
