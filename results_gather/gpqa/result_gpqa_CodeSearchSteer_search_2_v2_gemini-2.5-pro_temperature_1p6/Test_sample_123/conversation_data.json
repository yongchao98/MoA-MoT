    "This problem can be solved by applying the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation, to the exponential decay of particles.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Particle Decay Law**: The number of particles, N, that survive after a time *t* in the laboratory frame is given by the exponential decay formula:\n    N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / T)\n    where N₀ is the initial number of particles and T is the mean lifetime of the particles in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation**: The lifetime of the moving particles is dilated in the lab frame (T) compared to their proper lifetime (τ) in their own rest frame. The relationship is:\n    T = γτ\n    where γ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Time of Flight**: The particles travel at ultra-relativistic velocities (v ≈ c), so the time it takes for them to reach the detector wall at a radius R = 30 m is:\n    t = R / v ≈ R / c\n\n4.  **Survival Fraction**: By substituting the expressions for T and t into the decay law, we can find the fraction of particles (N/N₀) that reach the detector:\n    N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γτ))\n\n    This equation shows the relationship between the survival fraction, the detector radius, and the Lorentz factor.\n\n5.  **Setting up the Equations**: We are given two scenarios:\n\n    *   **Scenario 1**: One-third (1/3) of the particles reach the detector with a Lorentz factor (γ₁) of 20.\n        1/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (20τ))\n        Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        ln(1/3) = -ln(3) = -(R/c) / (20τ)\n        So, **ln(3) = (R/c) / (20τ)**  (Equation 1)\n\n    *   **Scenario 2**: We want to find the new Lorentz factor (γ₂) for which two-thirds (2/3) of the particles reach the detector.\n        2/3 = exp(-(R/c) / (γ₂τ))\n        Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        ln(2/3) = -ln(3/2) = -(R/c) / (γ₂τ)\n        So, **ln(3/2) = (R/c) / (γ₂τ)** (Equation 2)\n\n6.  **Solving for the New Lorentz Factor (γ₂) **: To solve for γ₂, we can divide Equation 1 by Equation 2. The term (R/c)/τ is constant in both scenarios and will cancel out.\n\n    (ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = [ (R/c) / (20τ) ] / [ (R/c) / (γ₂τ) ]\n    (ln(3)) / (ln(3/2)) = γ₂ / 20\n\n    Now, we can solve for γ₂:\n    γ₂ = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))\n\n    Using the approximate values for natural logarithms (ln(3) ≈ 1.0986 and ln(2) ≈ 0.6931):\n    γ₂ = 20 * (1.0986 / (1.0986 - 0.6931))\n    γ₂ = 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)\n    γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709\n    γ₂ ≈ 54.18\n\nThis calculated value is very close to 54. Therefore, a Lorentz factor of approximately 54 is needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector.\n\n<<<B>>>"
