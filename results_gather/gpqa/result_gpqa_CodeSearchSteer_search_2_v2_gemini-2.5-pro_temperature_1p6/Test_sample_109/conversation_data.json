    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Observability Criteria**\n\nFor a star to be observable by both instruments, it must meet two conditions:\n1.  **Positional Visibility:** The star must be visible from both the Paranal Observatory (Southern Hemisphere) and the W. M. Keck Observatory (Northern Hemisphere).\n    *   The Paranal Observatory is at a latitude of approximately 24° South. It can observe celestial objects with declinations roughly north of -90° and south of +66°.\n    *   The Keck Observatory is at a latitude of approximately 20° North. It can observe objects with declinations roughly north of -70° and south of +90°.\n    *   Therefore, for a star to be seen from **both** observatories, its declination (DEC) must be within the overlapping range of approximately **-70° to +66°**.\n\n2.  **Brightness Limit:** The star's apparent brightness must be within the detection limits of both spectrographs.\n    *   ESPRESSO can observe stars with an apparent magnitude V < 17.\n    *   HIRES can observe stars with an apparent magnitude V < 16.\n    *   Therefore, to be detected by **both**, a star must be brighter than the stricter limit, meaning its apparent V magnitude must be **less than 16**.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate Apparent Magnitudes**\n\nWe need to determine the apparent V magnitude (m_V) for each star. The relationship between apparent magnitude (m), absolute magnitude (M), distance in parsecs (d), and interstellar absorption (A_V) is given by the distance modulus formula:\n\n`m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d / 10) + A_V`\n\nThe absorption `A_V` is calculated from the color excess `E(B-V)` as:\n\n`A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate Each Star**\n\nLet's evaluate each star against the declination and brightness criteria.\n\n**Star1**\n*   **Declination:** DEC = -75°. This is south of the -70° limit for the Keck Observatory.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not visible from Keck.\n*   **Result:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n**Star2**\n*   **Declination:** DEC = +55°. This is within the range for both observatories.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** The problem states the apparent V magnitude is 16.5 mag.\n*   **Brightness Check:** 16.5 is not less than 16. It is too faint for the HIRES spectrograph.\n*   **Result:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n**Star3**\n*   **Declination:** DEC = +48°. This is within the range for both observatories.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** The problem states the apparent V magnitude is 15.5 mag.\n*   **Brightness Check:** 15.5 is less than 16 (for HIRES) and less than 17 (for ESPRESSO).\n*   **Result:** Can be observed by both.\n\n**Star4**\n*   **Declination:** DEC = -48°. This is within the range for both observatories.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude Calculation:**\n    *   Absolute Magnitude (M_V) = 15.5 mag\n    *   Distance (d) = 10 pc\n    *   Absorption (A_V) = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n    *   `m_V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10 / 10) + 1.24 = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag`\n*   **Brightness Check:** 16.74 is not less than 16. It is too faint for the HIRES spectrograph.\n*   **Result:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n**Star5**\n*   **Declination:** DEC = +60°. This is within the range for both observatories.\n*   **Apparent Magnitude Calculation:**\n    *   Absolute Magnitude (M_V) = 16.5 mag\n    *   Distance (d) = 5 pc\n    *   Absorption (A_V) = 0 (not mentioned)\n    *   `m_V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5 / 10) = 16.5 + 5 * (-0.301) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995 mag`\n*   **Brightness Check:** ~15.0 is less than 16 (for HIRES) and less than 17 (for ESPRESSO).\n*   **Result:** Can be observed by both.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that only Star3 and Star5 meet both the positional and brightness requirements to be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs.\n\n<<<D>>>"
