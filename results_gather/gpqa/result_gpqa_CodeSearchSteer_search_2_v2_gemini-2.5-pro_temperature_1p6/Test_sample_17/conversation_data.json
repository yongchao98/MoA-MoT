    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.\n\n### **Understanding the Notation**\n\nThe notation `[A/B]` represents the logarithmic abundance ratio of element A to element B in a star, compared to the same ratio in the Sun. It is defined as:\n\n`[A/B] = log₁₀(nₐ/nₒ)ₛₜₐᵣ - log₁₀(nₐ/nₒ)ₛᵤₙ`\n\nwhere `nₐ` and `nₒ` are the number densities of elements A and B, respectively.\n\nThis can also be expressed in terms of other abundance ratios. For instance, `[A/B]` can be written as `[A/H] - [B/H]`:\n\n`[A/B] = (log₁₀(nₐ/nₕ)ₛₜₐᵣ - log₁₀(nₐ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ) - (log₁₀(nₒ/nₕ)ₛₜₐᵣ - log₁₀(nₒ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ)`\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio for Star 1**\n\nWe are given the following for Star 1:\n*   `[Fe/H]₁ = 0`\n*   `[Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3`\n\nWe can relate these to find the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio, `[Si/H]₁`:\n`[Si/Fe]₁ = [Si/H]₁ - [Fe/H]₁`\n`0.3 = [Si/H]₁ - 0`\n`[Si/H]₁ = 0.3`\n\nBy definition, this means:\n`log₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)₁ - log₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ = 0.3`\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio for Star 2**\n\nWe are given the following for Star 2:\n*   `[Mg/H]₂ = 0`\n*   `[Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3`\n\nWe can relate these to find the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio, `[Si/H]₂`. First, we can write:\n`[Mg/Si]₂ = [Mg/H]₂ - [Si/H]₂`\n`0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]₂`\n`[Si/H]₂ = -0.3`\n\nBy definition, this means:\n`log₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)₂ - log₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ = -0.3`\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the final ratio**\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the number of silicon atoms (or, more precisely, the silicon number density relative to hydrogen) in Star 1 to Star 2:\n`Ratio = (nₛᵢ/nₕ)₁ / (nₛᵢ/nₕ)₂`\n\nTo calculate this, we can take the logarithm of the ratio:\n`log₁₀(Ratio) = log₁₀((nₛᵢ/nₕ)₁) - log₁₀((nₛᵢ/nₕ)₂)`\n\nFrom Step 1 and Step 2, we have:\n`log₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)₁ = 0.3 + log₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ`\n`log₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)₂ = -0.3 + log₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ`\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for `log₁₀(Ratio)`:\n`log₁₀(Ratio) = (0.3 + log₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ) - (-0.3 + log₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ)`\n`log₁₀(Ratio) = 0.3 + 0.3 = 0.6`\n\nNow, we solve for the ratio itself:\n`Ratio = 10⁰·⁶`\n`Ratio ≈ 3.98`\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9. The masses of the stars and the specific solar abundances of Mg and Fe are context but are not needed for the final calculation, as the solar silicon abundance term cancels out.\n\nThe correct option is A.\n<<<A>>>"
