    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution to the chemical problem:\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Gaseous Products\n\nThe problem states that a 7.20 g equimolar mixture of salts A and B was heated, forming only a mixture of gases. These gases were then passed through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent used to absorb water. The weight increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water (H₂O) produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.015 g/mol = **0.20 mol H₂O**\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution (limewater) is used to detect acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂, which would form a precipitate and increase the tube's weight. The fact that the weight did not change indicates that no such acidic gases were produced or absorbed.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper acts as a reducing agent, reacting with oxygen-containing gases like O₂ or, in some cases, nitrogen oxides. The reaction forms copper oxide (CuO), and the weight gain corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms.\n    *   Mass of Oxygen (O) = **0.80 g**\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.00 g/mol = **0.05 mol O**\n\n*   **Gas C:** The remaining gas after all reactions was 2.24 liters at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This corresponds to:\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**\n    *   Given the elements involved (deduced below), this inert gas is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### 2. Deducing the Identity of the Salts and Reactions\n\nThe products contain hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. Therefore, the original salts must be composed of these elements. The most plausible candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen-based oxyanions. An equimolar mixture of ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) fits the description perfectly.\n\nLet's assume the mixture contains *n* moles of NH₄NO₂ and *n* moles of NH₄NO₃. Their standard decomposition reactions are:\n*   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n*   NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O\n\nLet's trace the products based on these reactions:\n*   From *n* moles of NH₄NO₂: *n* moles of N₂ and 2*n* moles of H₂O are produced.\n*   From *n* moles of NH₄NO₃: *n* moles of N₂O and 2*n* moles of H₂O are produced.\n\n**Total Products from the decomposition:**\n*   **Total H₂O:** 2*n* + 2*n* = 4*n* moles.\n*   **Total N₂ (initial):** *n* moles.\n*   **Total N₂O:** *n* moles.\n\nNow, we match these with the experimental data:\n*   We know moles of H₂O = 0.20. So, 4*n* = 0.20 mol, which gives **n = 0.05 mol**.\n*   This means the initial mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n*   The gaseous products (after H₂O is removed) are 0.05 mol of N₂ and 0.05 mol of N₂O. These pass through Tube №2 unchanged.\n*   In Tube №3, red-hot copper reacts with the nitrous oxide (N₂O): Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂.\n    *   This reaction consumes 0.05 mol of N₂O.\n    *   The mass of oxygen transferred to the copper is 0.05 mol, which equals 0.05 mol * 16.00 g/mol = **0.80 g**. This exactly matches the weight gain of tube №3.\n*   This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂.\n*   The final remaining gas (Gas C) is the sum of the initial N₂ (from NH₄NO₂ decomposition) and the N₂ produced in Tube №3.\n    *   Total N₂ = 0.05 mol (initial) + 0.05 mol (from N₂O) = **0.10 mol**. This perfectly matches the moles of Gas C.\n\n### 3. Final Verification and Calculation\n\nTo confirm our findings, let's check the initial mass:\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.05 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol × 64.04 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80.05 g/mol) = 3.202 g + 4.0025 g = **7.2045 g**.\nThis confirms that the salts are indeed ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 atoms\n    *   **Total atoms in A = 8**\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3 atoms\n    *   **Total atoms in B = 9**\n\nThe total number of atoms is the sum of the atoms in one unit of each salt: 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
