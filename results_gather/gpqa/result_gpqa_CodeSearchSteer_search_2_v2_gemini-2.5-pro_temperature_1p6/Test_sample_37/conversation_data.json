    "The correct option is C. The sequence of reagents (A) is (i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+, and the product (B) is heptan-4-one.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of the reaction:\n\n1.  **Reactant Analysis**: The starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. This is a pre-formed iminium salt, which is an intermediate in the Stork enamine reaction. It is derived from pentan-2-one (an unsymmetrical ketone) and N-methylethanamine (a secondary amine).\n\n2.  **Step (i) - Enamine Formation**: LDA (Lithium diisopropylamide) is a strong, sterically hindered, non-nucleophilic base. In the presence of an unsymmetrical ketone derivative like this, LDA selectively deprotonates the less-substituted α-carbon (the C1 methyl group) to form the kinetic enamine. This regioselectivity is a key feature of the Stork enamine synthesis, leading to alkylation on the less substituted side of the ketone.\n\n3.  **Step (ii) - Alkylation**: The enamine formed in the previous step acts as a nucleophile. It attacks the electrophilic ethyl group of ethyl iodide (CH3CH2I) in an SN2 reaction. This adds an ethyl group to the C1 carbon, forming a new, more substituted iminium salt.\n\n4.  **Step (iii) - Hydrolysis**: The addition of a protic acid, such as aqueous H3O+, hydrolyzes the iminium salt. This step cleaves the C=N bond and regenerates a carbonyl group, yielding the final ketone product.\n\n5.  **Product Identification**: The original pentan-2-one structure was CH3−CO−CH2−CH2−CH3. The reaction adds an ethyl group (−CH2CH3) to the C1 methyl group. The resulting chain becomes CH3CH2−CH2−CO−CH2−CH2−CH3, which is named **heptan-4-one**.\n\nThe reaction sequence must be performed in discrete steps: base addition to form the enamine, followed by the addition of the alkylating agent, and finally acidic workup for hydrolysis. Option C correctly lists these sequential steps and identifies the correct final product.\n\n<<<C>>>"
