    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the correct chemical formula:\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR (Fourier-Transform Infrared) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. Its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid, particularly one that might be conjugated.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to a C=C (alkene) double bond stretch. The presence of an alkene is further supported by the 1H NMR data.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR (Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens:** This observation confirms the presence of hydrogens attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This is definitive evidence for an alkene functional group.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a highly characteristic fragment for a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the cleavage of the molecule to produce the [COOH]⁺ ion.\n\n### Synthesis and Determination of the Molecular Formula\n\nThe combined data from FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry strongly indicates that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. It contains a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and at least one carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given molecular formulas based on their degree of unsaturation (DoU). The DoU represents the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula is:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2) (Oxygen atoms do not affect this calculation).\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O:** This formula has only one oxygen, which is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) that contains two oxygens.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O₂:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = 1.\n    *   A degree of unsaturation of 1 would account for the C=O double bond of the carboxylic acid. However, it does not account for the additional C=C double bond confirmed by the FTIR and ¹H NMR spectra. This formula would represent a saturated carboxylic acid.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O:** This formula has only one oxygen and is therefore incorrect.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O₂:**\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2.\n    *   A degree of unsaturation of 2 perfectly matches our findings. One degree of unsaturation is from the C=O bond in the carboxylic acid, and the second is from the C=C bond of the alkene.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe spectral data unequivocally points to a molecule that is a carboxylic acid and also contains an alkene. This requires two degrees of unsaturation. The only molecular formula among the choices that has two oxygens and a degree of unsaturation of 2 is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<D>>>"
