    "The average, or expectation value, of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment oscillates at a frequency determined by the magnitude of the magnetic field and the particle's gyromagnetic ratio.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the physics:\n*   **Initial State:** The particle starts with its spin aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in the spin-up state with respect to the z-axis.\n*   **New Hamiltonian:** The magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction. The Hamiltonian (energy operator) of the system is now determined by the interaction of the magnetic moment with this new field: H = - **μ** · **B** = -μ_y * B = -γ * S_y * B, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and S_y is the spin operator for the y-direction.\n*   **Time Evolution and Precession:** The initial spin state is not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. According to the principles of quantum mechanics, the spin state will evolve over time. This time evolution causes the expectation value of the spin vector to precess around the new magnetic field direction (the Y-axis). This phenomenon is known as Larmor precession.\n*   **Oscillation Frequency:** The z-component of the spin, which was initially constant, will begin to oscillate as the spin precesses around the Y-axis. The angular frequency (ω) of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency. The energy difference between the spin-up and spin-down states in the new field determines this frequency. The energy levels are split by the magnetic field (Zeeman effect), and the energy difference is ΔE = γħB. The oscillation frequency is given by the Bohr frequency rule, ω = ΔE/ħ.\n*   **Calculation:** By applying the Bohr frequency rule, the oscillation frequency is calculated as:\n    ω = (γħB) / ħ = γB.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is γB.\n\n<<<D>>>"
