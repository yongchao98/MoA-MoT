  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nB) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\nC) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\nD) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results to determine the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of Gene G2:**\n    *   The single-mutant `g2` results in a complete loss of resistance (0%). This is the most severe phenotype observed.\n    *   The double-mutant `g1g2` also shows 0% resistance. The phenotype of the `g2` knockout completely masks the phenotype of the `g1` knockout (75% resistance).\n    *   Similarly, the double-mutant `g2g3` shows 0% resistance, meaning the `g2` phenotype also masks the `g3` phenotype (50% resistance).\n    *   This phenomenon, where the mutation in one gene (G2) masks the effect of mutations in other genes (G1 and G3), is called **epistasis**. The epistatic gene (G2) typically functions upstream in the genetic pathway. Given the problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor, it is logical to conclude that **G2 is the transcription factor** that regulates the expression of G1 and G3.\n\n2.  **Analyze the relationship between G1 and G3:**\n    *   The single mutant `g1` has a partial loss of resistance (75% remaining).\n    *   The single mutant `g3` has a more significant loss of resistance (50% remaining).\n    *   The double mutant `g1g3` shows a drastic loss of resistance (10% remaining), which is much more severe than either of the single mutants alone.\n    *   This synergistic effect, where the combined effect of two mutations is greater than the sum of their individual effects, suggests that G1 and G3 likely function in parallel pathways that both contribute to resistance, or they have partially overlapping, similar functions. This relationship is best described as **gene redundancy**. If G1 and G3 were in a simple linear pathway, the double mutant would show the same phenotype as one of the single mutants.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:**\n        *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": This is strongly supported by the data.\n        *   \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\": This is also strongly supported, as the double mutant has a much more severe phenotype than the single mutants.\n        *   \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\": This part is incorrect. For G1 to be epistatic to G3, the `g1g3` double mutant's phenotype (10% resistance) would have to be the same as the `g1` single mutant's phenotype (75% resistance), which it is not. However, the first two conclusions in this option are the most accurate description of the results.\n\n    *   **B) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:**\n        *   \"G1 is a transcription factor\": This is incorrect. G2 is the transcription factor.\n\n    *   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:**\n        *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": This is correct.\n        *   \"G1 and G3 has the same promoter\": This cannot be determined from the provided genetic interaction data.\n        *   \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\": This is incorrect, as the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50%).\n\n    *   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:**\n        *   \"G2 is a transcription factor\": This is correct.\n        *   \"G1 and G3 show pleiotropy\": Pleiotropy is when one gene influences multiple traits. This experiment only measures one trait (disease resistance), so we cannot conclude anything about pleiotropy.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOption A contains two correct and strongly supported conclusions derived directly from the experiment's data (\"G2 is a transcription factor\" and \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\"). The other options contain definitively incorrect statements or conclusions that cannot be drawn from the given information. Despite the inaccurate statement about epistasis between G1 and G3, option A is the best and most comprehensive choice among the alternatives.\n\n<<<A>>>"
