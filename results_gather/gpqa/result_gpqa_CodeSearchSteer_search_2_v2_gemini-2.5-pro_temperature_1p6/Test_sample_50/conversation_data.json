    "The problem asks for the net potential energy of a system consisting of a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`). This is a classic electrostatics problem that can be solved using the method of image charges.\n\n### Method of Image Charges\n\nA grounded conducting sphere has a constant potential of zero (V=0) everywhere on its surface. The electric field outside the sphere, created by the point charge `q` and the induced charges on the sphere's surface, can be simplified by replacing the sphere with a single \"image charge,\" `q'`.\n\n1.  **Location and Magnitude of the Image Charge**: For the potential on the surface of the sphere to be zero, the image charge `q'` must be placed inside the sphere at a distance `b` from the center, on the line connecting the center and the external charge `q`. The values are given by:\n    *   Image charge magnitude: `q' = -q (R/d)`\n    *   Image charge position from the center: `b = R² / d`\n\n### Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from an infinite distance to the distance `d` from the center of the sphere. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charges on the sphere, which is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\nIt is important to note that the potential energy of interaction is not simply the potential energy between `q` and `q'`. This is because `q'` is not a fixed charge; its magnitude and position depend on the position of `q`. A correct method is to calculate the potential energy as half of the charge `q` multiplied by the potential at its location created by the image charge (`V_induced`). The factor of 1/2 is crucial and arises because the induced charge distribution is created by the field of `q` itself.\n\n1.  **Potential at `d` due to the image charge**: The distance between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b`. The potential at the location of `q` due to `q'` is:\n    *   `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n    *   Substituting the values for `q'` and `b`:\n        `V_induced = k * [-q(R/d)] / [d - (R²/d)]`\n        `V_induced = k * [-qR/d] / [(d² - R²)/d]`\n        `V_induced = -k * qR / (d² - R²)`\n\n2.  **Potential Energy of the System**: The potential energy `U` is given by `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`.\n    *   `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d² - R²)]`\n    *   `U = -(1/2) * k * q² * R / (d² - R²)`\n\nThis result can also be obtained by integrating the force on the charge `q` as it is brought from infinity to the distance `d`. The negative sign indicates that the force between the point charge and the grounded sphere is attractive, as expected.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2) - Incorrect.\nB) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2) - Correct.\nC) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect.\nD) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) - Incorrect.\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
