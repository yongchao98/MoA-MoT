    "**Analysis of the Quasar Spectrum and Calculation of Comoving Distance**\n\nThe observation of a peak at a wavelength of 790 nm, followed by a significant drop in flux at shorter wavelengths, is a classic signature of a high-redshift quasar. This feature is identified as the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line, which is redshifted from its rest-frame wavelength by the expansion of the universe. The flux drop at wavelengths shorter than the peak is caused by the Lyman-alpha forest, a dense series of absorption lines from intervening clouds of neutral hydrogen.\n\nThe rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha emission line is approximately 121.6 nanometers (nm). To determine the quasar's redshift (z), we use the formula:\n\nz = (Observed Wavelength / Rest-frame Wavelength) - 1\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nz = (790 nm / 121.6 nm) - 1 ≈ 6.497 - 1 ≈ 5.497\n\nWith the calculated redshift of approximately 5.5, and the given cosmological parameters of a flat Lambda-CDM model (Hubble constant H₀ = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹, matter density parameter Ω_M = 0.3, and dark energy density parameter Ω_Λ = 0.7), the comoving distance can be calculated.\n\nUsing a cosmological calculator with these parameters, the comoving radial distance to the quasar is found to be approximately 8.04 Gigaparsecs (Gpc).\n\nThis calculated distance is closest to the provided option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
