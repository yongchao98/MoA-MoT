    "To find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle, we first need to analyze the potential `V(r, θ)`. It is often advantageous to work in Cartesian coordinates (x, y) if the potential simplifies.\n\n### 1. Conversion of the Potential to Cartesian Coordinates\nThe given potential is:\n`V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)`\n\nThe relationships between polar coordinates `(r, θ)` and Cartesian coordinates `(x, y)` are:\n`x = r cos(θ)`\n`y = r sin(θ)`\n`r^2 = x^2 + y^2`\n\nLet's substitute these into the potential expression.\nThe first term is `1/2 kr^2 = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2)`.\nThe second term can be rewritten as `3/2 k * (r cos(θ))^2`. Substituting `x = r cos(θ)`, this becomes `3/2 kx^2`.\n\nNow, we combine the terms to get the potential in Cartesian coordinates:\n`V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 kx^2`\n`V(x, y) = 1/2 kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2 + 3/2 kx^2`\n`V(x, y) = (1/2 + 3/2)kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2`\n`V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2`\n\n### 2. Separation of the Schrödinger Equation\nThe potential `V(x, y)` is a sum of a function of `x` only and a function of `y` only: `V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)`, where `V_x(x) = 2kx^2` and `V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2`.\n\nThis means the 2D time-independent Schrödinger equation can be separated into two independent 1D Schrödinger equations. The total energy `E` will be the sum of the energies from the x and y motions, `E = E_x + E_y`.\n\n**For the x-direction:**\nThe potential is `V_x(x) = 2kx^2`, which can be written as `1/2 k_x x^2` where the effective spring constant is `k_x = 4k`.\nThis is the potential for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator. The angular frequency is `ω_x = sqrt(k_x / m) = sqrt(4k / m) = 2*sqrt(k/m)`.\nThe energy eigenvalues for a 1D harmonic oscillator are `E_n = (n + 1/2)ℏω`.\nSo, for the x-direction, with quantum number `n_x`:\n`E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ℏω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ℏ * (2*sqrt(k/m)) = (2n_x + 1)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)`.\n\n**For the y-direction:**\nThe potential is `V_y(y) = 1/2 ky^2`.\nThis is already in the standard 1D harmonic oscillator form with a spring constant `k_y = k`.\nThe angular frequency is `ω_y = sqrt(k_y / m) = sqrt(k/m)`.\nThe energy eigenvalues for the y-direction, with quantum number `n_y`, are:\n`E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ℏω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)`.\n\n### 3. Total Energy Spectrum\nThe total energy `E` is the sum of the energies for the x and y components:\n`E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}`\n`E = (2n_x + 1)ℏ*sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)`\n`E = [(2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ℏ*sqrt(k/m)`\n`E = (2n_x + n_y + 1 + 1/2) * ℏ*sqrt(k/m)`\n`E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ℏ*sqrt(k/m)`\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
