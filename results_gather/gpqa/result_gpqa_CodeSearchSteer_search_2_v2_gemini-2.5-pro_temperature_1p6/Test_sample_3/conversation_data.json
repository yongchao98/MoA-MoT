    "In a universe with magnetic monopoles (isolated north or south poles), two of Maxwell's equations would be fundamentally different. The altered equations are the ones concerning the divergence of the magnetic field and the circulation (or curl) of the electric field.\n\n### The Affected Equations:\n\n1.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism (Divergence of B):**\n    In our universe, this law is expressed as ∇ ⋅ B = 0, which mathematically states that magnetic monopoles do not exist. The divergence of a magnetic field is always zero because magnetic field lines are continuous loops without a starting or ending point. If an isolated magnetic charge (a monopole) existed, it would act as a source or sink for magnetic field lines, similar to how an electric charge acts for electric fields. Consequently, the divergence of the magnetic field would be proportional to the magnetic charge density (ρₘ), and the equation would change to ∇ ⋅ B = ρₘ.\n\n2.  **Faraday's Law of Induction (Circulation/Curl of E):**\n    This law describes how a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field (∇ × E = -∂B/∂t). To maintain the symmetry seen in electromagnetism, the existence of magnetic monopoles would imply the existence of a \"magnetic current\" (Jₘ), which is the flow of these magnetic charges. This is analogous to how the flow of electric charges (an electric current) creates a circulating magnetic field in the Ampère-Maxwell law. Therefore, a magnetic current term would be added to Faraday's law, modifying it to something like ∇ × E = - (Jₘ + ∂B/∂t). This changes the equation related to the circulation of the electric field.\n\nIn summary, the presence of magnetic monopoles would introduce a magnetic charge density, altering Gauss's law for magnetism (related to the divergence of the magnetic field), and a magnetic current density, which would in turn modify Faraday's law (related to the circulation of the electric field).\n\n<<<D>>>"
