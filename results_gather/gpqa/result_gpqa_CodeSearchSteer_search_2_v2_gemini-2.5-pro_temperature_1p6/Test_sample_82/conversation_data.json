    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at both stages of the titration.\n\n### **1. Initial State and Dilution**\n\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid (CH₃COOH):**\n    *   Volume = 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n    *   Concentration = 0.05 M\n    *   Moles = 0.0200 L \\* 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 moles\n\n*   **Dilution:** The 20.00 cm³ of acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    *   New total volume = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L\n    *   New concentration of acetic acid = 0.001 moles / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M\n\n### **2. pH at 25% Titration**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form its conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This creates a buffer solution containing both the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻).\n\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH remaining:** 75% of initial moles = 0.75 \\* 0.001 = 0.00075 moles\n*   **Moles of CH₃COO⁻ formed:** 25% of initial moles = 0.25 \\* 0.001 = 0.00025 moles\n\nThe pH of this buffer can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\n**pH = pKa + log ( [Conjugate Base] / [Weak Acid] )**\n\n*   First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka:\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\n*   Now, substitute the values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The ratio of concentrations is the same as the ratio of moles.\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log (0.00025 / 0.00075)\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log (1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    *   pH ≈ 4.256\n\nThe pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n### **3. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH to form 0.001 moles of sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) is a weak base that reacts with water (hydrolyzes), producing hydroxide ions (OH⁻) and making the solution basic.\n\n*   **Volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point:**\n    *   Moles of NaOH = Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.001 moles\n    *   Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n*   **Total volume of the solution at the equivalence point:**\n    *   Initial acid solution volume + volume of NaOH added\n    *   40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.050 L\n\n*   **Concentration of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻):**\n    *   [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 moles / 0.050 L = 0.02 M\n\n*   **Calculate Kb for the acetate ion:**\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\n*   **Calculate the hydroxide ion concentration [OH⁻] from the hydrolysis of acetate:**\n    *   CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    *   5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    *   Assuming x is very small, we simplify to: x² ≈ (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02\n    *   x² ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n*   **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n\nThe pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.\n\nBased on the calculations, the pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52.\n\n<<<D>>>"
