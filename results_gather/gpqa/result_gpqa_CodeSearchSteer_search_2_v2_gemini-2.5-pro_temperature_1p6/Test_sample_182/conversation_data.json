    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactant and Reagents\n\n*   **Reactant:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and excess hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Structure and Molecular Formula of the Reactant\n\nLet's break down the name to draw the structure:\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene:** A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and 4.\n*   **carboxylic acid:** A -COOH group is attached, which we'll place at C1.\n*   **2-formyl:** A -CHO group is at C2.\n*   **5-vinyl:** A -CH=CH2 group is at C5.\n\nThe reactant has the following functional groups and features:\n*   One carboxylic acid group (-COOH)\n*   One aldehyde (formyl) group (-CHO)\n*   Two carbon-carbon double bonds (one in the ring, one in the vinyl group)\n*   One ring structure\n\nThe molecular formula of the reactant is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Chemical Reaction\n\nThe combination of red phosphorus and excess HI is a powerful reducing agent. It is known for its ability to reduce a wide variety of functional groups to simple alkanes. Specifically:\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Alkenes (C=C double bonds) are reduced to alkanes (C-C single bonds).\n*   All oxygen-containing groups are completely removed.\n\nApplying this to the reactant:\n*   The **carboxylic acid** group at C1 is reduced to a **methyl group**.\n*   The **formyl group** at C2 is reduced to a **methyl group**.\n*   The **double bond in the cyclohexene ring** is reduced to a **single bond**, forming a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The **vinyl group's** double bond is reduced, converting it to an **ethyl group** (-CH₂CH₃).\n\nThe overall carbon skeleton remains unchanged. The original molecule has 10 carbon atoms, and so will the final product. The final product is a substituted cyclohexane, specifically an isomer of ethyl-dimethylcyclohexane.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Molecular Formula of the Product\n\nThe reaction removes all double bonds and oxygen atoms, resulting in a saturated cycloalkane. A saturated acyclic alkane has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ₊₂. Since the product has one ring, two hydrogen atoms are removed from the saturated formula. Therefore, a saturated monocyclic alkane has the general formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n\nGiven that the reactant has 10 carbon atoms (n=10), the molecular formula of the saturated product will be C₁₀H₂₀.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. It can be calculated from the molecular formula C_c H_h N_n O_o X_x using the following equation:\n\nIHD = c - (h/2) + (n/2) + 1\n\nFor the product with the molecular formula C₁₀H₂₀:\n*   c = 10 (number of carbons)\n*   h = 20 (number of hydrogens)\n\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\nIHD = 10 - 10 + 1\nIHD = 1\n\nAlternatively, the IHD can be determined by inspecting the final structure. The product is a substituted cyclohexane. It contains only single bonds and one ring. A ring accounts for an IHD of 1. Since there are no double or triple bonds, the total IHD is 1.\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
