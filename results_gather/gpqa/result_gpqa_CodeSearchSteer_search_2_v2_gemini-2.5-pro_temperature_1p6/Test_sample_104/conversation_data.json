    "The calculations performed seem robust and the underlying physics principles are standard for this type of problem.\n\n1.  **Stellar Brightness Variation due to Spots**:\n    *   The problem involves calculating the change in brightness as a star rotates, showing one spotted hemisphere and one unspotted one.\n    *   The brightness (or more accurately, the flux) is related to temperature by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, `F = σT⁴`.\n    *   The maximum flux (F_max) comes from the unspotted hemisphere: `F_max ∝ T_eff⁴`.\n    *   The minimum flux (F_min) comes from the hemisphere with a spot filling factor `f_spot`. This flux is a weighted average of the flux from the unspotted part and the spotted part of that hemisphere: `F_min ∝ (1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴`.\n    *   The relative amplitude of the brightness variation is `(F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n    *   This simplifies to `f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`, which matches my derivation.\n\n2.  **Exoplanet Transit Depth**:\n    *   When a planet transits its star, it blocks a portion of the light.\n    *   The depth of the transit signal is the ratio of the planet's projected area to the star's projected area.\n    *   This is given by the formula: `Transit Depth = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`. This is a standard and widely confirmed formula.\n\n3.  **Equating the Signals**:\n    *   The problem requires the two signals to have the same amplitude. Therefore, we can set the two derived expressions equal to each other.\n    *   `(R_pl / R_star)² = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)`\n\n4.  **Plugging in the Values**:\n    *   Star effective temperature, T_eff = 6000 K\n    *   Spot temperature, T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n    *   Spot filling factor, f_spot = 20% = 0.20\n    *   `(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)`\n    *   `(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)`\n    *   `(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.20 * (1 - 625 / 1296)`\n    *   `(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.20 * ((1296 - 625) / 1296)`\n    *   `(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.20 * (671 / 1296)`\n    *   `(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.20 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355`\n    *   `R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThe result is approximately 0.32, which strongly corresponds to option A. The search results confirm that the fundamental formulas used for both the exoplanet transit depth and the general principles of stellar brightness variation are correct. Therefore, the calculation is sound.\n\nFinal check of the question: \"what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?\". The calculation has yielded exactly this ratio.\n\nThe options are:\nA) ~0.32\nB) ~0.39\nC) ~0.07\nD) ~0.11\n\nMy calculated value of ~0.3218 matches option A.\n\nTo produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve as a rotating star with a spotted hemisphere, the hypothetical exoplanet's radius relative to the star's radius can be calculated by equating the flux drop from both scenarios.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the flux drop caused by the rotating spotted star.\nThe star has two hemispheres: one pristine and one with dark spots.\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** Occurs when the pristine hemisphere is facing the observer. The flux is proportional to the projected area (A) and the fourth power of the effective temperature (T_eff).\n    `F_max ∝ A * T_eff⁴`\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** Occurs when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer. This hemisphere has a spot filling factor (`f_spot`) of 20% (or 0.2), meaning 20% of its area is covered by cooler spots and 80% is at the normal effective temperature. The temperature of the spots (T_spot) is 1000K cooler than the effective temperature, so `T_spot = 6000K - 1000K = 5000K`.\n    `F_min ∝ A * [(1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴]`\n\nThe amplitude of the signal (`ΔF_star`) from the star's rotation is the normalized difference between the maximum and minimum flux:\n`ΔF_star / F_max = (F_max - F_min) / F_max = 1 - (F_min / F_max)`\n`= 1 - [((1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴]`\n`= 1 - (1 - f_spot + f_spot * (T_spot/T_eff)⁴)`\n`= f_spot - f_spot * (T_spot/T_eff)⁴`\n`= f_spot * (1 - (T_spot/T_eff)⁴)`\n\nNow, let's calculate the signal amplitude for a transiting exoplanet.\nThe drop in brightness during a transit is the ratio of the planet's disk area to the star's disk area. This is known as the transit depth.\n`ΔF_planet / F_star = (Area_planet) / (Area_star) = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²`\n\nTo find the planet-to-star radius ratio that produces the same signal, we equate the two amplitudes:\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot/T_eff)⁴)`\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   `f_spot` = 0.20\n*   `T_eff` = 6000 K\n*   `T_spot` = 5000 K\n\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.20 * (1 - (5000/6000)⁴)`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.20 * (1 - 625/1296)`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.20 * ((1296 - 625)/1296)`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.20 * (671/1296)`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.20 * 0.51775`\n`(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355`\n\n`R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<A>>>"
