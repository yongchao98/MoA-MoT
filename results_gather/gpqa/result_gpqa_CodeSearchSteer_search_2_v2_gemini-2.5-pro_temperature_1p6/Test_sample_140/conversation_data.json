    "The reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base like sodium amide (NaNH2) proceeds through an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate. The steps involved are:\n\n1.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates:**\n    *   The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. The amide ion (NH₂⁻) from NaNH₂ is a strong base that abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom.\n    *   There are two *ortho* positions in the starting molecule:\n        *   **Position 6:** This position has a hydrogen atom (H). Abstraction of this proton is one possibility.\n        *   **Position 2:** This position has a deuterium atom (D). Abstraction of this deuteron is another possibility.\n    *   Due to the kinetic isotope effect, breaking a C-H bond is faster and requires less energy than breaking a C-D bond. However, both abstractions are possible and will lead to two different benzyne intermediates.\n        *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** When the proton at position 6 is removed, a benzyne intermediate is formed with the triple bond between carbons C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is retained. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n        *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** When the deuteron at position 2 is removed, a different benzyne intermediate is formed with the triple bond between carbons C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is lost from the aromatic ring. This intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates:**\n    *   The amide ion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent, ammonia (NH₃).\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n        *   Attack at C1: This places the amino group (-NH₂) at C1 and the deuterium at C2. After protonation at C6, the product is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   Attack at C6: This places the amino group at C6. The deuterium remains at C2. After protonation at C1, the product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n        *   Attack at either C1 or C2 of the non-deuterated benzyne intermediate will, after protonation, lead to the formation of a single product: **aniline** (which contains no deuterium).\n\nIn summary, the reaction produces three distinct possible organic products:\n*   Aniline\n*   2-Deuteroaniline\n*   3-Deuteroaniline\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
