    "### Step-by-Step Identification of Compound E\n\nThe problem requires the identification of compound E through a series of chemical reactions. Let's analyze the reaction scheme step-by-step, using the provided hints.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence and IR Data (Hint b)**\n\n*   **Compound A to B:** A ketone (Compound A) reacts with hydrogen cyanide (HCN) to produce a cyanohydrin (Compound B).\n*   **Compound B to C:** The cyanohydrin is reduced. The nitrile group (-CN) is reduced to a primary amine (-CH₂NH₂), forming a β-amino alcohol (Compound C).\n*   **Compound C to E:** The reaction of a β-amino alcohol (C) with nitrous acid (HNO₂) followed by the elimination of nitrogen gas is characteristic of the **Tiffeneau–Demjanov rearrangement**. This reaction typically results in a ring expansion, converting a cycloalkanol into a cycloketone with one additional carbon atom in the ring.\n*   **IR Spectroscopy:** Hint (b) provides crucial information.\n    *   The IR spectrum of **Compound A** shows a strong absorption peak around **1750 cm⁻¹**. This frequency is characteristic of the carbonyl (C=O) stretch in a **cyclopentanone** (a five-membered ring ketone) due to ring strain.\n    *   The IR spectrum of **Compound E** shows a strong absorption peak around **1715 cm⁻¹**. This value is typical for the C=O stretch in a **cyclohexanone** (a six-membered ring ketone), which has less ring strain.\n\nCombining these points, we can deduce that Compound A is a cyclopentanone derivative, and it undergoes a ring expansion to form Compound E, a cyclohexanone derivative.\n\n**2. Identification of Compound A (Hint a)**\n\n*   Hint (a) states that Compound A reacts with a phosphorus ylide to form **1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane**. This is a **Wittig reaction**, which converts a ketone into an alkene.\n*   The product's name indicates a cyclopentane ring with methyl groups at positions 1 and 2, and a \"propan-2-ylidene\" group [=C(CH₃)₂] at position 4.\n*   To find the precursor ketone (Compound A), we replace the C=C(CH₃)₂ double bond with a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   Placing the carbonyl group at position 4 of a 1,2-dimethylcyclopentane ring gives **4,5-dimethylcyclopentan-1-one** (if the carbonyl is C1) or, by renumbering to give the methyl groups the lowest possible locants relative to the carbonyl, **3,4-dimethylcyclopentanone**. The two names describe the same molecule.\n*   Therefore, **Compound A is 3,4-dimethylcyclopentanone**. This is consistent with our conclusion from the IR data that A is a cyclopentanone.\n\n**3. Deducing the Structure of Compound E**\n\n*   Starting with Compound A (**3,4-dimethylcyclopentanone**), the Tiffeneau-Demjanov rearrangement adds one carbon atom (from HCN) into the ring, expanding it from a five-membered ring to a six-membered ring.\n*   The methyl groups at positions 3 and 4 of the original cyclopentanone ring do not participate in the rearrangement. Their positions on the new cyclohexanone ring are determined by the bond migration during the rearrangement.\n*   The mechanism involves the migration of a carbon-carbon bond from the original ring to the newly formed carbocation. Tracing the atoms through this rearrangement confirms that the methyl groups will be located at the 3 and 4 positions of the resulting cyclohexanone.\n*   Thus, the reaction transforms **3,4-dimethylcyclopentanone (A)** into **3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one (E)**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the reaction sequence, the specific nature of the Tiffeneau-Demjanov rearrangement, and corroborating evidence from IR spectroscopy and the Wittig reaction hint, Compound E is identified as **3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one**.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
