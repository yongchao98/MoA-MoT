    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the product:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material and Reagent:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. The name \"7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane\" refers to cyclohexene oxide. The molecule is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across two adjacent carbons (C1 and C6 in the bicyclic nomenclature) and has three methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4 with the specified stereochemistry.\n    *   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi, known as lithium dimethylcuprate or a Gilman reagent, is a source of a methyl nucleophile (Me⁻).\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The reaction between an epoxide and an organocuprate is a nucleophilic ring-opening reaction. Organocuprates are soft nucleophiles that undergo SN2-type reactions with epoxides.\n\n3.  **Establish the Regioselectivity:**\n    *   The prompt and chemical principles state that organocuprates attack the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    *   The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6. C1 is substituted with a methyl group, making it a tertiary carbon center. C6 has no additional substituents besides the ring carbons, making it a secondary carbon center.\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophilic attack by the methyl group from Me₂CuLi will occur at the less hindered C6 position.\n\n4.  **Establish the Stereoselectivity:**\n    *   The reaction proceeds via an SN2 mechanism, which involves a backside attack by the nucleophile. This leads to an inversion of the stereochemical configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n    *   The initial configuration at the attacked carbon, C6, is given as (6S). Due to the inversion, its configuration in the product will become (R).\n    *   The stereocenters that are not directly involved in the bond-breaking or bond-forming process (C3 and C4) will retain their original configurations, which are (3R) and (4R).\n    *   The C1-O bond of the epoxide also breaks (typically during aqueous workup) to form an alcohol (-OH). This process does not invert the stereocenter at C1, so its configuration remains (1R).\n\n5.  **Predict the Product Structure:**\n    *   The cyclohexane ring is opened to form a cyclohexanol derivative.\n    *   A new methyl group is added at the C6 position of the starting material. The original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 remain.\n    *   The epoxide oxygen becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group at the C1 position.\n    *   This results in a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol structure.\n\n6.  **Determine the Final Stereochemistry:**\n    *   Mapping the starting material's stereocenters to the product's:\n        *   C1 remains **(R)**.\n        *   C6 is attacked, inverting from (S) to **(R)**. This carbon becomes C2 in the cyclohexanol product numbering.\n        *   C4 remains **(R)**.\n        *   C3 remains **(R)**. This carbon becomes C5 in the cyclohexanol product numbering.\n    *   Combining these gives the final product stereochemistry: **(1R, 2R, 4R, 5R)**.\n\n7.  **Match with Options:**\n    *   The predicted product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
