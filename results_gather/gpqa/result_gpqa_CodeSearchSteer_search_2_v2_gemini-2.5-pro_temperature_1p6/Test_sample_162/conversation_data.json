    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the molar mass and moles of Fe(OH)₃\n\nFirst, we determine the molar mass of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Molar Mass of Fe = 55.85 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of O = 16.00 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of H = 1.01 g/mol\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.85 + 3 * (16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of moles of Fe(OH)₃ in 0.1 g of the substance:\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 9.356 x 10⁻⁴ moles.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the concentration of Fe³⁺ ions\n\nThe total volume of the solution is 100 cm³, which is equal to 0.1 liters. The concentration of Fe³⁺ ions in the solution will be:\n*   [Fe³⁺] = Moles of Fe(OH)₃ / Total Volume (L) = 9.356 x 10⁻⁴ moles / 0.1 L = 9.356 x 10⁻³ M.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the pH of the resulting solution\n\nThe dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ is an equilibrium reaction:\nFe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n\nThe solubility product constant (Ksp) for Fe(OH)₃ at 25°C is approximately Ksp = 2.6 x 10⁻³⁹ to 1.6 x 10⁻³⁹. Let's use an average value or a commonly cited one, Ksp ≈ 2 x 10⁻³⁹, noting that values can range up to 10⁻³⁶. We can use the Ksp expression to find the maximum hydroxide concentration ([OH⁻]) that can exist in equilibrium with the calculated [Fe³⁺].\n\n*   Ksp = [Fe³⁺] [OH⁻]³\n*   [OH⁻]³ = Ksp / [Fe³⁺] = (2 x 10⁻³⁹) / (9.356 x 10⁻³)\n*   [OH⁻]³ ≈ 2.138 x 10⁻³⁷\n*   [OH⁻] ≈ (2.138 x 10⁻³⁷)^(1/3) ≈ 5.98 x 10⁻¹³ M\n\nNow, we can calculate the pOH and then the pH:\n*   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(5.98 x 10⁻¹³) ≈ 12.22\n*   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 12.22 = 1.78\n\nThis calculated pH of ~1.78 is closest to the pH of 2.04 in option D. Let's recalculate the required volume using a pH of 2.04 to confirm.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the required volume of strong acid\n\nThe total amount of strong acid added serves two purposes:\n1.  **Neutralizing the hydroxide ions** from the dissolution of Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  **Establishing the final acidic pH** of the solution.\n\nThe reaction with the acid is:\nFe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺ → Fe³⁺ + 3H₂O\n\nMoles of H⁺ for neutralization = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 * 9.356 x 10⁻⁴ = 2.807 x 10⁻³ moles.\n\nMoles of H⁺ required to achieve the final pH (let's use pH = 2.04 from option D):\n*   [H⁺]final = 10^(-pH) = 10⁻².⁰⁴ ≈ 9.12 x 10⁻³ M\n*   Moles of excess H⁺ = [H⁺]final * Total Volume (L) = (9.12 x 10⁻³ M) * 0.1 L = 9.12 x 10⁻⁴ moles.\n\nTotal moles of H⁺ needed from the strong acid:\n*   Total Moles H⁺ = (Moles for neutralization) + (Moles for excess)\n*   Total Moles H⁺ = 2.807 x 10⁻³ + 9.12 x 10⁻⁴ = 3.719 x 10⁻³ moles.\n\nFinally, calculate the volume of the 0.1 M strong acid required:\n*   Volume (L) = Total Moles H⁺ / Molarity of acid = 3.719 x 10⁻³ moles / 0.1 mol/L = 0.03719 L\n*   Volume (cm³) = 0.03719 L * 1000 cm³/L = 37.19 cm³\n\nThe calculated values (pH ~1.78 and Volume ~37.19 cm³) do not precisely match any of the options. Let's re-evaluate by testing the provided answers.\n\nLet's assume **Option D (pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³)** is correct and work backwards.\n\n*   Volume of acid = 28.05 cm³ = 0.02805 L\n*   Total moles H⁺ added = 0.1 M * 0.02805 L = 2.805 x 10⁻³ moles.\n\nMoles of H⁺ to neutralize Fe(OH)₃ = 3 * (0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol) = 2.807 x 10⁻³ moles.\n\nThis calculation shows that the 28.05 cm³ of acid provides almost exactly the amount of H⁺ needed for neutralization (2.805 x 10⁻³ moles provided vs. 2.807 x 10⁻³ moles needed). This leaves virtually no excess H⁺ to lower the pH to 2.04, which would require a significant concentration of H⁺ ions.\n\nThere seems to be an inconsistency in the problem statement's values. Let's re-check the stoichiometric calculation.\n\nMoles Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol = 9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol\nMoles H⁺ needed for dissolution = 3 * 9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol\nVolume of 0.1 M acid for dissolution = (2.807 x 10⁻³ mol) / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L = **28.07 cm³**\n\nThis calculated volume (28.07 cm³) is extremely close to the value in option D (28.05 cm³). This suggests the question primarily considers the stoichiometric amount of acid needed for the reaction, with the final pH being a secondary consequence that might include some approximations. If we use this volume, the moles of H⁺ are almost entirely consumed, leading to a solution of Fe³⁺ ions. Fe³⁺ itself hydrolyzes in water, which would lower the pH:\n\nFe³⁺(aq) + 2H₂O(l) ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺(aq) + H₃O⁺(aq)\n\nThis hydrolysis makes the resulting solution acidic, and a pH of 2.04 is a reasonable value for a solution of this concentration of Fe³⁺. Given the close match of the calculated volume with option D, it is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
