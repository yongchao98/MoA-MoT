    "The annihilation of a high-energy gamma-ray with a photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) into an electron-positron pair, represented by the process $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$, is a fundamental interaction in high-energy astrophysics. This process sets a limit on the distance that very high-energy gamma rays can travel through the universe, effectively making the universe opaque to them above a certain energy threshold.\n\nTo determine this threshold energy, we can use the principles of special relativity. The reaction is possible only if the total energy in the center-of-mass frame of the two colliding photons is at least equal to the rest mass energy of the products, which are an electron and a positron.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n*   **Rest Mass Energy:** The rest mass of an electron ($m_e$) is approximately 9.109 × 10⁻³¹ kg. The rest mass energy of an electron ($m_e c^2$) is about 0.511 MeV (Mega-electron Volts). Since an electron-positron pair is produced, the minimum energy required is twice this amount, or about 1.022 MeV.\n*   **Collision Kinematics:** Let the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray be $E_\\gamma$ and the energy of the CMB photon be $\\epsilon_{CMB}$. The most efficient collision for energy conversion is a head-on collision. For this scenario, the condition for the threshold energy is given by the formula:\n    $E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{\\epsilon_{CMB}}$\n*   **Given Values:** The problem provides the average energy for a CMB photon as $\\epsilon_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$. We will use the standard value for the electron's rest mass energy, $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = \\frac{0.2611 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = 0.2611 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\nThis result is often expressed in more convenient units, such as Giga-electron Volts (GeV), where 1 GeV = 10⁹ eV.\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{2.611 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.611 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nTherefore, the lifetime of gamma-rays with energy around $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV would be limited by this pair production process. Comparing this calculated value to the options provided, it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
