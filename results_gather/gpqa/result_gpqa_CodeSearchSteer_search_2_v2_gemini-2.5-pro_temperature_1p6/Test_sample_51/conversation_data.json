    "To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium atoms in two different energy levels changes, we must employ the Boltzmann equation. This equation describes the relative populations of atoms in different energy states in a system that is in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), which is assumed for the stellar photosphere.\n\n**1. The Boltzmann Equation**\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (N₂) to the number of atoms in a lower energy level (N₁) is given by the Boltzmann equation:\n\nN₂/N₁ = (g₂/g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁)/(kT)]\n\nWhere:\n*   N₁ and N₂ are the number of atoms in energy level 1 and level 2, respectively.\n*   g₁ and g₂ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the two energy levels. This ratio (g₂/g₁) is a constant for a given transition.\n*   E₁ and E₂ are the energies of the two levels.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K).\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n**2. Calculating the Energy Difference (ΔE)**\n\nThe problem states that the transition between the two energy levels corresponds to a wavelength (λ) of 1448 Å. We can calculate the energy difference (ΔE = E₂ - E₁) using the Planck-Einstein relation:\n\nΔE = hc/λ\n\nWhere:\n*   h is the Planck constant.\n*   c is the speed of light.\n*   A convenient form of this constant for astrophysical calculations is hc ≈ 12400 eV·Å.\n\nPlugging in the given wavelength:\n\nΔE = 12400 eV·Å / 1448 Å ≈ 8.5635 eV\n\n**3. Setting up the Ratios for Both Temperatures**\n\nWe need to compare the population ratio at the temperature of the unspotted star (T_unspotted = 6000 K) with the ratio at the temperature of the spotted star (T_spotted = 5500 K). Let's denote the population ratio N₂/N₁ as R(T).\n\n*   Ratio without spots: R(6000K) = (g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * 6000)]\n*   Ratio with spots: R(5500K) = (g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * 5500)]\n\n**4. Calculating the Factor of Change**\n\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. This is the ratio of the two ratios calculated above:\n\nFactor = R(6000K) / R(5500K)\n\nFactor = { (g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * 6000)] } / { (g₂/g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * 5500)] }\n\nThe ratio of the statistical weights (g₂/g₁) cancels out:\n\nFactor = exp[-ΔE / (k * 6000)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * 5500)]\nFactor = exp[ (-ΔE/k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) ]\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for ΔE and k:\n\nΔE/k ≈ 8.5635 eV / (8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K) ≈ 99379 K\n\nFactor = exp[ -99379 * (1/6000 - 1/5500) ]\nFactor = exp[ -99379 * (0.00016667 - 0.00018182) ]\nFactor = exp[ -99379 * (-0.00001515) ]\nFactor = exp[1.5058]\n\nFactor ≈ 4.508\n\nThis value is approximately 4.5.\n\n<<<C>>>"
