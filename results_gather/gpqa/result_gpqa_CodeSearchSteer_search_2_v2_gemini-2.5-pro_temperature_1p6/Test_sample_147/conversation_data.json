    "An analysis of the problem leads to the identification of element Y and its five fluorine compounds.\n\n**1. Identification of Element Y**\n\nThe mass fraction of fluorine (ɷF) in substance A2 is given as 31.96%. A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F). Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ.\n\nThe formula for the mass fraction of fluorine is:\nɷF = (n × M(F)) / (M(Y) + n × M(F))\n\nWhere:\n*   M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine, approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n*   M(Y) is the molar mass of element Y.\n*   n is the number of fluorine atoms in the molecule.\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n0.3196 = (n × 19.00) / (M(Y) + n × 19.00)\n\nRearranging for M(Y):\n0.3196 × M(Y) + 0.3196 × n × 19.00 = n × 19.00\n0.3196 × M(Y) = n × 19.00 × (1 - 0.3196)\n0.3196 × M(Y) = n × 19.00 × 0.6804\nM(Y) = (n × 12.9276) / 0.3196\nM(Y) ≈ n × 40.45\n\nWe can test integer values for *n*. If we test n=5:\nM(Y) ≈ 5 × 40.45 = 202.25 g/mol.\n\nThis molar mass is very close to that of gold (Au), which has a molar mass of 196.97 g/mol. Let's assume Y is Gold (Au) and A2 is the gold fluoride AuF₅.\n\nLet's verify the mass fraction of fluorine in AuF₅:\nM(AuF₅) = 196.97 + 5 × 19.00 = 196.97 + 95.00 = 291.97 g/mol.\nɷF = (5 × 19.00) / 291.97 = 95.00 / 291.97 ≈ 0.3253 (32.53%).\nThis is reasonably close to the given 31.96%, with the difference attributable to potential rounding in the problem statement or the use of approximate atomic masses.\n\n**2. Identification of the Five Gold Fluorides (A1 to A5)**\n\nLet's use the other clues to identify the compounds, assuming Y=Au. Gold is known to form several binary fluorides.\n\n*   **A1**: This bright-red substance decomposes at 293 K into A2 (AuF₅) and fluorine. This implies A1 has a higher fluorine content than AuF₅. The reaction is A1 → AuF₅ + F₂. To balance this, A1 must be AuF₇. Gold(VII) fluoride, AuF₇, is known to be a bright-red solid that decomposes to AuF₅ and F₂.\n*   **A2**: As established, A2 is gold(V) fluoride, AuF₅.\n*   **A1 oxidizes xenon**: AuF₇ is an extremely powerful oxidizing agent and would certainly oxidize xenon.\n*   **A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y**: The direct fluorination of gold (Au) typically produces gold(III) fluoride, AuF₃. The reaction is 2Au + 3F₂ → 2AuF₃. So, A3 is AuF₃.\n*   **A3 can also interact with xenon**: AuF₃ is also a strong oxidizing agent capable of reacting with xenon.\n*   **A4**: This substance is involved in the synthesis of A5. A4 has a tetrameric, cyclic structure of (AuF₃)₄. This would make it Au₄F₁₂. However, the problem simplifies reactions, and since A4 is used to create A5 (AuF) from Au, A4 is most likely the molecular unit, AuF₃, which exists as a polymer. The question concerns the *molecular weight of the substance A4*. If A4 refers to the monomeric unit AuF₃, its molecular weight is 196.97 + 3 × 19.00 = 253.97 g/mol. This value does not fit any of the provided ranges.\n    Let's reconsider the identities. Perhaps A3 is AuF₅, as it can be formed by fluorinating Au at high temperatures (~300 °C). If A3=AuF₅, then what is A4?\n    The problem describes five distinct compounds. The known binary gold fluorides or their polymeric forms could be the candidates: AuF, (AuF₂)₂, (AuF₃)₄, AuF₅, AuF₇.\n    Let's assign them systematically:\n    *   A1 = AuF₇ (bright red, decomposes to A2+F₂)\n    *   A2 = AuF₅ (product of A1 decomposition, ɷF ≈ 32.5%)\n    *   A3 = AuF₃ (obtained by fluorination of Au)\n    *   This leaves two compounds, A4 and A5. The known remaining binary fluoride is AuF. What could be the fifth? Research indicates the existence of a dimeric gold(II) fluoride, (AuF₂)₂, which is diamagnetic and consists of Au₂F₄ molecules. So the five compounds are likely AuF, Au₂F₄, AuF₃, AuF₅, and AuF₇.\n\n*   **A5 and A4**: A5 is obtained by adding gold (Y) to a solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio. A5 decomposes in water. This is a comproportionation reaction. Adding Au(0) to a higher oxidation state gold fluoride would yield a lower oxidation state gold fluoride. The reaction `Au + A4 → A5` (1:1 ratio) suggests:\n    *   `Au(0) + Au(III)F₃ → 2Au(I)F` (Here the ratio of reactants is 1:1 but based on Au atoms it is not, maybe it means Au metal to AuF3 molecule). A reaction to form AuF could be `2Au + AuF₃ → 3AuF`.\n    *   `Au(0) + Au(II)F₂ → ...`\n    *   A known reaction is the thermal decomposition of AuF₃ which produces AuF.\n    The statement \"adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\" suggests the reaction: `Au + A4 -> A5`. If A4 is AuF₃ and A5 is AuF, the balanced reaction would be `2 Au + AuF₃ → 3 AuF`. This is not a 1:1 molar ratio of reactants.\n\n    Let's reconsider the species. If A4 is the dimeric gold(II) fluoride, Au₂F₄, and A5 is gold(I) fluoride, AuF, the reaction could be:\n    `2 Au(0) + Au₂F₄ → 4 AuF`\n    This reaction has a 2:1 molar ratio of Au to A4 (Au₂F₄).\n\n    Let's try A4 = AuF₃ and A5 = Au₂F₄:\n    `Au + 3AuF₃ → 2Au₂F₄`\n    This has a 1:3 molar ratio.\n\n    Let's stick with the most straightforward assignment:\n    *   A1: AuF₇\n    *   A2: AuF₅\n    *   A3: AuF₃\n    *   A4: Au₂F₄\n    *   A5: AuF\n    In this case, the reaction to get A5 (AuF) would be the decomposition of A3 (AuF₃), not from A4. This contradicts the problem statement.\n\n    Let's reconsider the synthesis of A5.\n    `Au + A4 -> A5` (1:1). If `Y + YF_n -> YF_{n-x}`.\n    Let A4 = AuF₃. The only way to have a 1:1 reaction producing another fluoride is if A5 is a mixed-valence compound or if there is a misunderstanding of the problem's stoichiometry.\n\n    However, there might be a simpler interpretation. Perhaps the five compounds are simply the five oxidation states: Au(I)F, Au(II)F₂, Au(III)F₃, Au(V)F₅, Au(VII)F₇. This aligns with modern findings, even if some are unstable or exist as polymers/dimers.\n    *   A1 = AuF₇\n    *   A2 = AuF₅\n    *   A3 = AuF₃\n    Now, for A4 and A5. `Au + A4 -> A5` (1:1). Let's assume this means a reaction between 1 mole of Au atoms and 1 mole of A4 molecules. Let A4 be AuF₂ (the monomer of Au₂F₄).\n    `Au(0) + Au(II)F₂ → 2 Au(I)F`\n    This reaction is chemically plausible (comproportionation) and maintains a 1:1 molar ratio of the reactants. Therefore, A4 is AuF₂ and A5 is AuF. AuF is known to disproportionate in water, which aligns with \"A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances\" (`3AuF → AuF₃ + 2Au`).\n\n**3. Calculating the Molecular Weight of A4**\n\nBased on this deduction, substance A4 is gold(II) fluoride, AuF₂.\nThe molecular weight of AuF₂ is:\nM(AuF₂) = M(Au) + 2 × M(F)\nM(AuF₂) = 196.97 + 2 × 19.00 = 196.97 + 38.00 = 234.97 g/mol.\n\nThis molecular weight falls into the range of 220-240.\n\nFinal check of all compounds:\n*   A1: AuF₇ (MW = 329.97)\n*   A2: AuF₅ (MW = 291.97)\n*   A3: AuF₃ (MW = 253.97)\n*   A4: AuF₂ (MW = 234.97)\n*   A5: AuF (MW = 215.97)\n\nThe series of compounds and reactions described in the problem is consistent with the chemistry of gold fluorides.\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 (AuF₂) is approximately 235 g/mol, which falls within the 220-240 range.\n\n<<<D>>>"
