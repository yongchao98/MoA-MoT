    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two compounds in the mixture:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula and Initial Clues\n\nAll potential compounds (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene) have the molecular formula C10H14. The problem states that the ¹H NMR spectrum exhibits only singlets in the alkyl region. This immediately casts doubt on 1,4-diethylbenzene, as its ethyl groups would produce a characteristic quartet and a triplet, not singlets. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated, which also eliminates option C.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for Each Remaining Compound\n\nTo solve this, we must predict the number of signals and the integration for each of the remaining tetramethylbenzene isomers based on their molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two protons at positions 3 and 6. Due to symmetry, they are chemically equivalent and will produce a single signal. Since they have no adjacent non-equivalent protons, this signal will be a **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are also equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** with a total integration of 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** There are two protons at positions 5 and 6. They are chemically equivalent due to the symmetry plane. They will appear as **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent. The methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 are also equivalent to each other, but distinct from the first pair. This results in **two singlets**, each with an integration of 6H (representing two methyl groups).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule lacks symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are in chemically different environments. This will result in **two separate singlets**, each with an integration of 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are in unique positions and are not chemically equivalent. This would produce **four distinct singlets**, each with an integration of 3H.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options Based on the Predicted Spectra\n\nThe observed spectrum of the 1:1 mixture shows:\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's test the remaining options:\n\n**A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB provides one singlet (2H) and 1,2,3,4-TMB provides one singlet (2H). If these two signals appear at different chemical shifts, the mixture will show **two singlets**. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 molar ratio, the integrations (2H vs. 2H) result in a **1:1 ratio**. This matches the experimental data.\n*   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB provides one singlet (12H), and 1,2,3,4-TMB provides two singlets (6H each). In a 1:1 mixture, these will combine to produce **three singlets** (assuming they have different chemical shifts) with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio of these integrations is **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n**B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic Signals:** This mixture would produce three singlets (one from 1,2,3,4-TMB with 2H integration, and two from 1,2,3,5-TMB with 1H integration each). This gives a 2:1:1 proton ratio, which contradicts the observed 1:1 ratio of two singlets.\n\n**D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n*   **Aromatic Signals:** Similar to option B, this mixture would result in three singlets with a 2:1:1 proton ratio, which is inconsistent with the observed spectrum.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only combination that matches the described ¹H NMR spectrum for a 1:1 mixture is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
