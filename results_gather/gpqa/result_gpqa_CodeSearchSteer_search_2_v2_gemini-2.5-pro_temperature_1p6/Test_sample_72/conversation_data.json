    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n### 1. Calculation of the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)\n\nTo find the relative speed of the two astronauts, we use the Lorentz transformation for velocities. The formula for the relative velocity ($v_{rel}$) between two objects moving in the same direction with velocities $v_1$ and $v_2$ in a stationary frame is:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nGiven:\n*   Velocity of the first astronaut, $v_1 = 0.6c$\n*   Velocity of the second astronaut, $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n\n$v_{rel} \\approx 0.1428c$\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Total Energy of the System (E)\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the formula:\n\n$E = \\gamma mc^2$\n\nwhere $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is calculated as:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of the two astronauts ($E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$).\n\n**For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):**\n\n*   Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_1$):\n    $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n*   Calculate the energy ($E_1$):\n    $E_1 = \\gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \\times 2mc^2 = 2.5mc^2$\n\n**For the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):**\n\n*   Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_2$):\n    $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.866} \\approx 1.1547$\n*   Calculate the energy ($E_2$):\n    $E_2 = \\gamma_2 (3m)c^2 \\approx 1.1547 \\times 3mc^2 \\approx 3.464mc^2$\n\n**Total Energy of the System ($E_{total}$):**\n\n*   $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 = 5.964mc^2$\n\nSo, the total energy is approximately **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated values are:\n*   Relative speed ($v_{rel}$) ≈ **0.14c**\n*   Total energy (E) ≈ **5.96 mc²**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
