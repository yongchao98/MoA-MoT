    "To determine the correct reagents, we need to analyze each reaction separately.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction describes the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone. The process begins with the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN on the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms an alkoxide intermediate. The second step is the protonation of this alkoxide intermediate to yield the final hydroxyl group (-OH) of the cyanohydrin. This protonation step requires an acid. Therefore, reagent 'A' must be a source of protons, which is represented by H₃O⁺. Using a controlled amount of acid (often with a pH adjusted to around 4-5) ensures there are enough free cyanide ions for the initial attack while also providing protons for the final step.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation requires harsh conditions, typically heating the nitrile with a strong acid or a strong base in the presence of water. Among the given options for reagent 'B', HCl (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid commonly used to catalyze the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is a weak acid and is generally not effective enough to achieve complete hydrolysis.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   **A** should be **H₃O⁺** to facilitate the cyanohydrin formation.\n*   **B** should be **HCl** to effectively hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of reagents is found in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
