    "Based on the spectral data provided, the unidentified white solid is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\nHere is a detailed analysis of the evidence:\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 corresponds to the molecular weight of the compound. The molecular formula for all four options is C₇H₅ClO₂, which has a molecular weight of approximately 156.57 g/mol.\n    *   The significant peak at m/z = 158, which is about one-third the intensity of the molecular ion peak (a 32% abundance, or a ratio of roughly 3:1), is the characteristic isotopic signature of a molecule containing one chlorine atom (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes). This confirms the presence of chlorine in the molecule.\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is a classic signal for the O-H bond in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid.\n    *   The strong, sharp absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹ is indicative of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch of an aromatic carboxylic acid. This combination strongly suggests a carboxylic acid functional group, eliminating option D (phenyl chloroformate).\n\n*   **¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The singlet at a very downfield chemical shift of 11.0 ppm is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   The aromatic region shows two distinct doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H) and 7.72 ppm (2H). This symmetrical pattern, with two signals each integrating to two protons, is the hallmark of a *para* (1,4) substituted benzene ring.\n    *   Option B, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, would show a more complex and asymmetric splitting pattern in the aromatic region.\n    *   Option A, 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, would lack the carboxylic acid proton signal and would also show a different, more complex aromatic pattern, in addition to an aldehyde proton signal around 9-10 ppm.\n    *   Option C, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, perfectly fits this NMR data. The two protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxyl group are deshielded and appear as the downfield doublet (8.02 ppm), while the two protons adjacent to the chlorine atom appear as the upfield doublet (7.72 ppm).\n\n**Conclusion:** All three pieces of spectral evidence—the molecular weight and chlorine isotope pattern from the mass spectrum, the carboxylic acid signals in the IR spectrum, and the unique pattern of a *para*-substituted aromatic ring plus a carboxylic acid proton in the ¹H NMR spectrum—are in perfect agreement with the structure of 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<C>>>"
