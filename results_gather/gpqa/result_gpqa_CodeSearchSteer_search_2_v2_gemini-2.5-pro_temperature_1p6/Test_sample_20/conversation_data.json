    "### Analysis of the Compounds\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a form of isomerism where two structures can readily interconvert, most commonly through the migration of a proton. A frequent type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (an alpha-hydrogen).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** This molecule has a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of these double bonds and do not have any attached hydrogen atoms. Because it lacks alpha-hydrogens, it cannot undergo standard keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound possesses alpha-hydrogens on the carbons situated between the carbonyl groups. These hydrogens are acidic and can easily move, allowing the compound to convert to its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is an aromatic compound, which makes it particularly stable, thus the equilibrium strongly favors this form. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione exhibits tautomerism.\n\nBased on this analysis, **benzoquinone** is the compound that does not show tautomerism.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are molecules that are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center, a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon atom in the chain is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). This makes the carbon a chiral center. Consequently, the molecule is chiral and will display optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This is the trans-isomer of an ester with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. Due to the double bond, the molecule has a planar geometry. It does not contain any carbon atom bonded to four different groups and possesses a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is not chiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on this analysis, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** is the compound that will show optical isomerism.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**. The compound that shows optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
