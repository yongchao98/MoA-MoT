    "The problem describes a three-dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues for this system are given by the formula:\n\nE_n = (n + 3/2)ħω\n\nwhere `n = n_x + n_y + n_z` is the principal quantum number (with `n_x, n_y, n_z` being non-negative integers), `ħ` is the reduced Planck's constant, and `ω` is the angular frequency.\n\nFirst, we identify the energy states:\n*   **Ground state (lowest energy):** `n = 0`, E_0 = (0 + 3/2)ħω = (3/2)ħω.\n*   **First excited state:** `n = 1`, E_1 = (1 + 3/2)ħω = (5/2)ħω.\n*   **Second excited state:** `n = 2`, E_2 = (2 + 3/2)ħω = (7/2)ħω.\n*   **Third excited state:** `n = 3`, E_3 = (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω.\n\nThus, the energy of the third excited state is (9/2)ħω.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy level, which is its degeneracy. The degeneracy, `g_n`, for an energy level `n` is the number of different combinations of non-negative integers (`n_x`, `n_y`, `n_z`) that sum to `n`. The formula for the degeneracy of the n-th level is:\n\ng_n = (n + 1)(n + 2) / 2\n\nFor the third excited state, `n = 3`. Plugging this into the degeneracy formula:\n\ng_3 = (3 + 1)(3 + 2) / 2 = (4)(5) / 2 = 10.\n\nThe ten possible combinations of (`n_x`, `n_y`, `n_z`) that sum to 3 are:\n*   (3, 0, 0) and its two other permutations (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3).\n*   (2, 1, 0) and its five other permutations (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2).\n*   (1, 1, 1).\n\nIn total, there are 3 + 6 + 1 = 10 independent eigenfunctions.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the third excited state is (9/2)ħω, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for this energy. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
