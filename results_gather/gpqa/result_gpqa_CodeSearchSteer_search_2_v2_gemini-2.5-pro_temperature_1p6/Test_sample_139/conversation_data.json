    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the chemical puzzle and determine the correct answer.\n\n### Analysis of the Clues\n\n1.  **Substance B and its Melting Point:** The melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K. The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 273.15 K (0 °C). Heavy water (D₂O), which contains the heavier hydrogen isotope deuterium (D), has a melting point of 276.97 K, or 3.82 °C. This is extremely close to the given 277 K, strongly suggesting that **substance B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n\n2.  **Substance X and its Analog:** Substance X contains a heavier isotope and, along with its close analog, is a reagent in organic chemistry. This points towards common reducing agents used for isotopic labeling, such as Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄) or Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄). Their non-deuterated analogs, Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) and Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄), are standard reagents in organic synthesis.\n\n3.  **The Reaction:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, producing a gas W and a precipitate G.\n    *   **Gas W:** The molecule of gas W contains an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's examine the possible gases from the reaction of a deuterated hydride.\n        *   If the reaction is with normal water (H₂O), the gas would be Hydrogen Deuteride (HD). An HD molecule contains 2 protons (1 from H, 1 from D) and 1 neutron (from D). This does not fit.\n        *   If the reaction is with heavy water (D₂O), the gas would be Deuterium (D₂). A D₂ molecule contains 2 protons (1 from each D) and 2 neutrons (1 from each D). This fits the clue perfectly.\n    *   Therefore, **Liquid Y must be heavy water (D₂O)**, and **Gas W must be deuterium gas (D₂)**.\n\n4.  **Identifying Substance X and Precipitate G:** Now we can determine Substance X.\n    *   Reaction of NaBD₄ with D₂O: `NaBD₄ + 4D₂O → NaB(OD)₄ + 4D₂`. Sodium borodeuteroxide, NaB(OD)₄, is soluble, so no precipitate would form.\n    *   Reaction of LiAlD₄ with D₂O: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃(s) + 4D₂`. Aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃, is insoluble and would form a precipitate. This matches the clues.\n    *   Therefore, **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)** and **Precipitate G is Aluminum Deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃)**.\n\n5.  **Confirmation of Clues:**\n    *   Heating precipitate G (Al(OD)₃) would cause dehydration, releasing B (D₂O), which aligns with the clues.\n    *   The reaction of a keto acid with LiAlD₄, a strong reducing agent, would reduce both the keto and the acid functional groups to produce a diol, which contains two oxygen atoms. This also fits.\n\n### Calculation\n\nThe final step is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n\n1.  **Elements in LiAlD₄:** The elements are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (H).\n2.  **Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** Based on their position in the periodic table (atomic number), the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminum (Z=13).\n3.  **Isotopes and their Masses:** The question requires summing the masses of all isotopes for these elements as they appear in the molecule. We will use integer mass numbers for the calculation, as the options are integers.\n    *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** In LiAlD₄, hydrogen is present as four atoms of its heavier isotope, Deuterium (²H or D). Deuterium has a mass number of 2 (1 proton, 1 neutron).\n        *   Total mass from Deuterium = 4 atoms × 2 amu/atom = 8 amu.\n    *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminum):** Aluminum is present as one atom. The only stable isotope of aluminum is ²⁷Al, which has a mass number of 27.\n        *   Total mass from Aluminum = 1 atom × 27 amu/atom = 27 amu.\n\n4.  **Cumulative Mass:**\n    *   Sum = (Total mass from Deuterium) + (Total mass from Aluminum)\n    *   Sum = 8 + 27 = 35\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<A>>>"
