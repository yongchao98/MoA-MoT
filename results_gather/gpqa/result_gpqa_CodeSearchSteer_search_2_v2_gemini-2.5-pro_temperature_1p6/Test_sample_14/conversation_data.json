    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting and by what factor.\n\n### 1. Transit Probability Formula\nThe geometric probability of a planet transiting its host star, assuming a circular orbit, is the ratio of the star's radius (R★) to the planet's orbital semi-major axis (a).\n\np ≈ R★ / a\n\n### 2. Kepler's Third Law\nTo find the semi-major axis (a), we use Kepler's Third Law. The law relates the orbital period (P) and the semi-major axis to the mass of the host star (M★). The planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's mass. The formula is:\n\nP² / a³ = 4π² / (G * M★)\n\nWhere G is the gravitational constant.\n\n### 3. Expressing Semi-Major Axis\nWe can rearrange Kepler's Third Law to solve for the semi-major axis (a):\n\na³ = (G * M★ * P²) / 4π²\na = [ (G * M★ * P²) / 4π² ]^(1/3)\n\nSince G and 4π² are constants, we can express this as a proportionality:\n\na ∝ (M★ * P²)^(1/3)\n\n### 4. Relating Transit Probability to Stellar and Orbital Properties\nNow, we substitute this expression for 'a' back into the transit probability formula:\n\np ∝ R★ / [ (M★ * P²)^(1/3) ]\n\n### 5. Calculating the Ratio of Probabilities\nWe want to find the ratio of the transit probability of Planet_1 (p₁) to that of Planet_2 (p₂):\n\np₁ / p₂ = ( R★₁ / (M★₁ * P₁²)^(1/3) ) / ( R★₂ / (M★₂ * P₂²)^(1/3) )\n\nWe are given the following information:\n*   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2: P₂ = 3 * P₁\n*   The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of the host star of Planet_2: M★₁ = 2 * M★₂\n*   Both host stars have the same radii: R★₁ = R★₂\n\nLet's substitute these into the ratio equation:\n\np₁ / p₂ = ( R★₁ / R★₂ ) * [ (M★₂ * P₂²) / (M★₁ * P₁²) ]^(1/3)\np₁ / p₂ = ( 1 ) * [ (M★₂ * (3P₁)² ) / ( (2M★₂) * P₁² ) ]^(1/3)\np₁ / p₂ = [ (M★₂ * 9P₁²) / (2M★₂ * P₁²) ]^(1/3)\n\nThe terms M★₂ and P₁² cancel out:\n\np₁ / p₂ = ( 9 / 2 )^(1/3)\np₁ / p₂ = (4.5)^(1/3)\n\n### 6. Final Calculation\nCalculating the cube root of 4.5:\n\np₁ / p₂ ≈ 1.65096\n\nThis result indicates that the transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the calculation, Planet_1 has a significantly higher probability of transiting. Therefore, the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
