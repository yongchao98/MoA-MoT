    "Here is a step-by-step calculation of the energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system.\n\n### 1. Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nFor a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L, the allowed energy levels are given by:\n*   E_n = (n²π²ħ²) / (2mL²)\n\nThe problem defines E = (π²ħ²) / (2mL²). Therefore, the energy for a single particle in the nth state is:\n*   **E_n = n²E**\n\nWhere *n* = 1, 2, 3, ... is the principal quantum number.\n\n### 2. Pauli Exclusion Principle\n\nThe system contains four identical spin-1/2 particles. These particles are fermions and must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. Since spin is a quantum number, each energy level *n* can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up (+1/2) and one with spin down (-1/2).\n\n### 3. Ground State Energy (E_ground)\n\nTo find the ground state energy, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n*   **Level n=1:** Can hold two particles. Their total energy is 2 × E₁ = 2 × (1²E) = 2E.\n*   **Level n=2:** Can hold the remaining two particles. Their total energy is 2 × E₂ = 2 × (2²E) = 8E.\n\nThe total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n*   E_ground = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n### 4. First Excited State Energy (E_first)\n\nThe first excited state is the lowest possible energy the system can have above the ground state. This is achieved by moving one particle from the highest occupied energy level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n\nThe particle configuration is:\n*   **Level n=1:** Two particles. Energy = 2 × E₁ = 2E.\n*   **Level n=2:** One particle. Energy = 1 × E₂ = 4E.\n*   **Level n=3:** One particle. Energy = 1 × E₃ = 1 × (3²E) = 9E.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n*   E_first = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n### 5. Second Excited State Energy (E_second)\n\nThe second excited state is the next-lowest energy configuration. There are a few possibilities to consider for the excitation from the ground state:\n\n*   **Option A:** Excite one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1²E) + (1 × 2²E) + (1 × 4²E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n*   **Option B:** Excite two particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1²E) + (2 × 3²E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n*   **Option C:** Excite one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × 1²E) + (2 × 2²E) + (1 × 3²E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n\nComparing the energies (15E < 18E < 20E < 22E), the first excited state is 15E and the second lowest excitation energy is 18E.\n\nThus, the energies are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
