    "The key step in converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one, in the context of solving higher-dimensional heat equations with the described numerical methods, is the ability to break down the problem into smaller, independent tasks that can be solved concurrently.\n\nWhen a fractional (rational) approximation is used for the matrix exponential function, it can often be decomposed into a sum of simpler terms through a partial fraction expansion. Each of these terms corresponds to a linear system of equations that can be solved independently of the others. This decomposition is the crucial factor that allows the computational work to be distributed across multiple processors, thus transforming the sequential process into a parallel one. Several papers on numerical methods for the heat equation explicitly state that the algorithm can be parallelized through a partial fraction expansion or splitting technique.\n\nTherefore, the decomposition of the fractional approximation into a sum of linear partial fractions is the fundamental element that enables the parallel algorithm.\n\n<<<D>>>"
