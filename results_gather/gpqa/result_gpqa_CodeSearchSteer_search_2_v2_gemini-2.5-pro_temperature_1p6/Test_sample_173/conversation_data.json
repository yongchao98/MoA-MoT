    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Determine the Rest-Masses of the Fragments\n\nFirst, we establish the rest-masses of the initial nucleus (M) and the two fragments (m₁ and m₂).\n*   The initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy of M*c² = 300 GeV.\n*   The more massive fragment is designated as m₁, and the less massive as m₂.\n*   We are given that m₁ = 2 * m₂.\n*   The sum of the fragments' rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M.\n\nBy substituting the first relation into the second, we get:\n2*m₂ + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n3*m₂ = 0.99 * M\nm₂ = 0.33 * M\n\nFrom this, we find m₁:\nm₁ = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M\n\nNow, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n*   **m₁c²** = 0.66 * (M*c²) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = **198 GeV**\n*   **m₂c²** = 0.33 * (M*c²) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = **99 GeV**\n\n### 2. Calculate the Total Kinetic Energy (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released during the fission, known as the Q-value, is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments. This is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n*   **Q** = (M*c²) - (m₁c² + m₂c²)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = **3 GeV**\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments:\nT_total = T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV\n\n### 3. Calculate T₁ using Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is T = p²/2m, where p is momentum. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total momentum is zero. By the law of conservation of momentum, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta.\n*   p₁ = p₂\n*   Therefore, T₁/T₂ = (p₁²/2m₁) / (p₂²/2m₂) = m₂/m₁\n*   Since m₁ = 2m₂, we have m₂/m₁ = 1/2.\n*   So, T₁/T₂ = 1/2, which means T₂ = 2*T₁.\n\nNow we use the total kinetic energy:\n*   T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV\n*   T₁ + 2*T₁ = 3 GeV\n*   3*T₁ = 3 GeV\n*   **T₁_classical = 1 GeV**\n\n### 4. Calculate T₁ using Relativistic Mechanics\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the relationship between total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is E² = (pc)² + (m*c²)². The kinetic energy (T) is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy (E = T + m*c²).\nFrom this, we can derive the expression for momentum: (pc)² = T(T + 2m*c²).\n\nAgain, using the conservation of momentum (p₁ = p₂), we have p₁² = p₂²:\n*   T₁(T₁ + 2m₁c²) = T₂(T₂ + 2m₂c²)\n*   We know T₂ = 3 GeV - T₁. Substituting this and the rest-mass energies:\n*   T₁(T₁ + 2*198) = (3 - T₁)((3 - T₁) + 2*99)\n*   T₁² + 396T₁ = (3 - T₁)(3 - T₁ + 198)\n*   T₁² + 396T₁ = (3 - T₁)(201 - T₁)\n*   T₁² + 396T₁ = 603 - 201T₁ - 3T₁ + T₁²\n*   T₁² + 396T₁ = T₁² - 204T₁ + 603\n*   Canceling T₁² from both sides: 396T₁ = -204T₁ + 603\n*   396T₁ + 204T₁ = 603\n*   600T₁ = 603\n*   **T₁_relativistic = 603 / 600 GeV = 1.005 GeV**\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation.\n*   Difference = T₁_relativistic - T₁_classical\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nFinally, convert the answer to Mega-electron Volts (MeV), knowing that 1 GeV = 1000 MeV:\n*   Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = **5 MeV**\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
