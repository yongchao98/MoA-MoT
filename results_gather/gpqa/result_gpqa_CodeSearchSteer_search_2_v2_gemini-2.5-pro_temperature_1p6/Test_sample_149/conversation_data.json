    "The step-by-step analysis of the reaction confirms the final product.\n\n1.  **Determination of the Starting Material:** The molecular formula C8H9NO and the provided 1H-NMR data are consistent with 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.\n    *   The degree of unsaturation is 5, suggesting a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.\n    *   Signals at 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H) indicate a para-disubstituted aromatic ring.\n    *   The broad singlet at 6.27 ppm (2H) is characteristic of a primary amine (-NH2).\n    *   The triplet at 9.72 ppm (1H) and the doublet at 3.66 ppm (2H) are indicative of a -CH2CHO group.\n\n2.  **Reaction Sequence:**\n    *   **Step 1 & 2 (NaNO₂ + HCl, then H₂O):** This two-step process converts a primary aromatic amine into a hydroxyl group. The primary amine on 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde is first converted to a diazonium salt, which is then hydrolyzed by water to yield 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    *   **Step 3 (aq. KOH, Heat):** This step involves a base-catalyzed self-condensation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. The presence of aqueous potassium hydroxide (a strong base) and heat promotes an aldol condensation. An aldol condensation is a reaction where two molecules of an aldehyde react to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde, which then dehydrates upon heating to form a more stable α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n3.  **Formation of the Final Product:**\n    *   One molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde forms an enolate at the α-carbon.\n    *   This enolate attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is a β-hydroxy aldehyde, specifically 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (structure B).\n    *   With applied heat, this intermediate readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a conjugated double bond between the α and β carbons (C2 and C3).\n    *   The final, stable product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal. This matches the structure described in option C.\n\nTherefore, the final product identified through this reaction sequence is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<C>>>"
