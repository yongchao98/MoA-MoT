    "To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we must analyze the information obtained through the radial velocity (RV) method.\n\n### Analysis of the Radial Velocity Method\n\nThe radial velocity method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. This shift is caused by the star's \"wobble\" as it orbits the common center of mass with its planet.\n\n1.  **Wavelength Shift and Stellar Velocity:** The observed periodic shift in wavelength (Δλ) is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (the component of its velocity along our line of sight). The maximum measured radial velocity is known as the semi-amplitude, K. Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes of the two stars is equal to the ratio of their maximum wavelength shifts:\n    *   K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 miliangstrom / 5 miliangstrom = 1.4\n\n2.  **Radial Velocity Semi-Amplitude Formula:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude (K) is given by the formula:\n    K ≈ (2πG / T)^(1/3) * (1 / M_s^(2/3)) * (m_p * sin(i))\n    Where:\n    *   T is the orbital period.\n    *   M_s is the mass of the star.\n    *   m_p is the mass of the planet.\n    *   i is the inclination of the orbit (the angle relative to the plane of the sky).\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n    The value that can be measured from the velocity curve is K, and the period (P) corresponds to the period of the curve. The amplitude itself is related to the planet's mass and orbital inclination. The RV method alone cannot separate the planet's true mass (m_p) from the inclination, so it provides a lower limit on the mass, which is m_p\\*sin(i).\n\n### Calculation\n\nTo find the relationship between the orbital periods of the two planets, we can set up a ratio of their radial velocity semi-amplitudes:\n\nK₂ / K₁ = [ (2πG / T₂)^(1/3) * (m_p2 * sin(i₂)) / (M_s2)^(2/3) ] / [ (2πG / T₁)^(1/3) * (m_p1 * sin(i₁)) / (M_s1)^(2/3) ]\n\nAccording to the problem description:\n*   The stars have the same mass: M_s1 = M_s2.\n*   The planets have similar masses: m_p1 ≈ m_p2.\n\nWith these conditions, many terms cancel out:\n\nK₂ / K₁ ≈ (T₁/T₂)^(1/3) * (sin(i₂)/sin(i₁))\n\nA crucial point is the orbital inclination `i`. This parameter is generally unknown for any given system detected by the RV method alone. For the problem to have a single, defined answer, we must assume that the other unknown factors are the same for both systems. This is a common convention in comparative physics problems. Therefore, we assume the orbital inclinations are the same (sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂)).\n\nThis simplifies the relationship to:\n\nK₂ / K₁ ≈ (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)\n\nNow, we can substitute the known value of K₂/K₁:\n\n1.4 ≈ (T₁ / T₂)^(1/3)\n\nTo find the ratio of the periods, we first solve for T₁/T₂ by cubing both sides:\n\nT₁ / T₂ ≈ (1.4)³\nT₁ / T₂ ≈ 2.744\n\nThe question asks for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, which is the ratio T₂ / T₁.\n\nT₂ / T₁ ≈ 1 / 2.744\nT₂ / T₁ ≈ 0.364\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n<<<A>>>"
