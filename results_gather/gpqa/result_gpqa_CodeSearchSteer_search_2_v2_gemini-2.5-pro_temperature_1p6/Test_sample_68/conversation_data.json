    "To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays, we first need to understand what \"observing a decay\" means in this context and then apply the principles of relativistic kinematics.\n\n### 1. Calculation of Key Parameters:\n\nFirst, let's calculate the essential properties of the $X^0$ particle in the laboratory frame.\n\n*   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The Lorentz factor relates the energy of a particle to its rest mass. It's calculated as the ratio of the total energy (E) to the rest mass energy ($mc^2$). In particle physics units where energy and mass are often given in GeV and GeV/$c^2$ respectively, the formula simplifies.\n    *   $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   $m_{X^0} = 3.41$ GeV/$c^2$\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{m_{X^0}c^2} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n*   **Lab-frame Lifetime ($\\tau$):** Due to time dilation, a moving particle's lifetime appears longer in the lab frame than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$).\n    *   Proper lifetime $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   Lab-frame lifetime $\\tau = \\gamma \\times \\tau_0 = 7.918 \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 6.334 \\times 10^{-15}$ s\n\n*   **Mean Decay Length (L):** This is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. For a highly relativistic particle, its velocity is very close to the speed of light ($c = 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s).\n    *   $L \\approx c \\times \\tau = (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (6.334 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.90 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\n### 2. Interpretation of \"Observing 30% of Decays\":\n\nTo \"observe\" a decay, the particle must travel a distance that is at least as large as the detector's spatial resolution. If it decays before traveling this minimum distance, its track cannot be resolved from the production point. The question asks for the minimum resolution required to observe *at least 30%* of the decays.\n\nThis means that for at least 30% of the particles, their individual decay length must be greater than the detector's resolution ($d_{res}$). The decay of particles follows an exponential probability distribution. The fraction of particles that travel a distance `x` or more before decaying is given by $e^{-x/L}$, where L is the mean decay length.\n\nWe need to find the resolution ($d_{res}$) such that:\n$P(\\text{decay length} > d_{res}) \\geq 0.30$\n$e^{-d_{res}/L} \\geq 0.30$\n\nTo find the minimum required resolution, we solve for the equality, which represents the boundary condition:\n$e^{-d_{res}/L} = 0.30$\n$-d_{res}/L = \\ln(0.30)$\n$d_{res} = -L \\times \\ln(0.30)$\n\n### 3. Final Calculation:\n\nUsing the calculated mean decay length L:\n*   $L \\approx 1.90 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n*   $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$\n*   $d_{res} = -(1.90 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.204) \\approx 2.288 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nThis calculated value of $2.288 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is closest to option C. The small discrepancy arises from rounding the intermediate values. Let's recalculate with higher precision:\n\n$L = c \\times \\gamma \\times \\tau_0 = (299792458 \\text{ m/s}) \\times (\\frac{27}{3.41}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) \\approx 1.9003 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\n$d_{res} = -L \\times \\ln(0.3) = -(1.9003 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}) \\times (-1.20397) \\approx 2.2879 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThis result is approximately $2.29 \\times 10^{-6}$ meters. The value in option C is $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Let's check for an alternative interpretation where the percentage refers to the decays we want to capture *within* a certain length. This would mean $1 - e^{-d/L} = 0.3$, leading to $d = -L \\ln(0.7) \\approx 0.357 L \\approx 0.68 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, which is not among the options.\n\nGiven the available options, the initial interpretation is the most likely. The discrepancy between the calculated value ($2.29 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) and the provided option C ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) may stem from slightly different initial constants or a different interpretation intended by the problem's author. However, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is of the correct order of magnitude and is the most plausible answer among the choices. If we assume the intended answer is C, we can check what parameter would lead to it:\n$2.08 \\times 10^{-6} = -L \\times \\ln(0.3) \\Rightarrow L = \\frac{2.08 \\times 10^{-6}}{1.204} \\approx 1.73 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\nThis would correspond to a lab-frame lifetime of $\\tau = L/c \\approx 5.77 \\times 10^{-15}$ s and a Lorentz factor of $\\gamma = \\tau / \\tau_0 \\approx 7.2$, which is close to our calculated 7.9. The physics reasoning remains the same, and option C is the closest match.\n\n<<<C>>>"
