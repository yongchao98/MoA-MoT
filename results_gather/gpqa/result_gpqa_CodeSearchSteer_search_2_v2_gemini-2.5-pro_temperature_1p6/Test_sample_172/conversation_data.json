    "To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of the electron, we can use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n1.  **Position-Momentum Uncertainty Principle:** This principle states that the product of the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) is greater than or equal to the reduced Planck constant (ħ) divided by 2. To find the minimum uncertainty, we use the equality:\n    Δp ≥ ħ / (2 * Δx)\n\n2.  **Energy-Momentum Relation:** For a relativistic particle, the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) is related to the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) by the particle's velocity (v):\n    ΔE ≈ v * Δp\n\n    This relationship comes from the relativistic energy-momentum equation E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)². Taking the derivative of energy with respect to momentum gives dE/dp = pc²/E. For a relativistic particle, E = γm₀c² and p = γm₀v, which simplifies dE/dp to v.\n\n3.  **Combining the principles:** By substituting the expression for the minimum Δp from the uncertainty principle into the energy-momentum relation, we can find the minimum uncertainty in energy:\n    ΔE_min ≈ v * (ħ / (2 * Δx))\n\n**Given values:**\n*   Velocity of the electron (v) = 2 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   Uncertainty in position (Δx) = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m = 1 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   Reduced Planck constant (ħ) ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\n**Calculation:**\n*   First, calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp):\n    Δp_min ≈ (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 1 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)\n    Δp_min ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\n*   Next, calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE):\n    ΔE_min ≈ (2 x 10⁸ m/s) * (5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)\n    ΔE_min ≈ 10.54 x 10⁻¹⁷ J\n    ΔE_min ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n*   A) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\n*   B) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\n*   C) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\n*   D) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\n\nThe calculated value of ~1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J is approximately 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\n<<<C>>>"
