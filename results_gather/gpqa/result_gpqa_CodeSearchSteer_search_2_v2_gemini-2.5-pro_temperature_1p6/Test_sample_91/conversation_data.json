    "To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the given compound, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the Molecular Formula:** First, we identify the chemical formula of the compound (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n    *   Number of Carbon (C) atoms: 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n    *   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms: 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n    *   The molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n2.  **Count the Chemical Bonds:** Next, we count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.\n    *   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22**.\n    *   **C=C double bonds:** The structure clearly shows two carbon-carbon double bonds, so there are **2** C=C bonds.\n    *   **C-C single bonds:** For an acyclic (non-ring) molecule, the total number of bonds in the carbon skeleton is the number of carbon atoms minus one (12 - 1 = 11). Since 2 of these are double bonds, the number of C-C single bonds is 11 - 2 = **9**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound:** This is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound.\n    *   ΔH_atom(compound) = (No. of C-C bonds × BE(C-C)) + (No. of C=C bonds × BE(C=C)) + (No. of C-H bonds × BE(C-H))\n    *   Using the given values:\n        ΔH_atom(compound) = (9 × 200 kJ/mol) + (2 × 300 kJ/mol) + (22 × 400 kJ/mol)\n        ΔH_atom(compound) = 1800 + 600 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements:** This is the energy required to form gaseous atoms from the elements in their standard states (12 moles of solid Carbon and 11 moles of H2 gas).\n    *   ΔH_atom(elements) = (12 × ΔH_atom(C)) + (11 × BE(H-H))\n    *   Using the given values:\n        ΔH_atom(elements) = (12 × 1000 kJ/mol) + (11 × 100 kJ/mol)\n        ΔH_atom(elements) = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ/mol**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf):** The enthalpy of formation is the difference between the enthalpy of atomization of the elements and the enthalpy of atomization of the compound.\n    *   ΔHf = ΔH_atom(elements) - ΔH_atom(compound)\n    *   ΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n6.  **Convert to kJ/g:** The options include answers in kJ/g, so we convert our result.\n    *   Molar Mass of C12H22 = (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = **166 g/mol**.\n    *   ΔHf (in kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**.\n\nComparing our results with the given options, the calculated value of 11.44 kJ/g matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
