    "The search results confirm the use of the Boltzmann equation in astrophysics for describing the excitation of atoms in stellar atmospheres under conditions of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\nThe equation is given as:\nN_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]\n\nWhere:\n*   N_b / N_a is the ratio of the number of atoms in an upper energy state (b) to a lower energy state (a).\n*   g_b / g_a is the ratio of the statistical weights of the two states.\n*   E_b - E_a is the energy difference between the states (ΔE).\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   T is the temperature.\n\nMy derivation followed these steps:\n1.  Set up the Boltzmann equation for each star:\n    *   For Star 1: (N_excited / N_ground)_1 = C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)], where C is the ratio of statistical weights.\n    *   For Star 2: (N_excited / N_ground)_2 = C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)].\n\n2.  Use the given condition: (N_excited / N_ground)_1 = 2 * (N_excited / N_ground)_2.\n\n3.  This leads to: C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * C * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)].\n\n4.  The constant C cancels, and taking the natural log of both sides gives: -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2).\n\n5.  Rearranging gives: ln(2) = ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = (ΔE / k) * [(T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)].\n\n6.  The crucial step is using the provided values: ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J and k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K. This makes the term (ΔE / k) approximately equal to 1.\n\n7.  The final equation is: ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ].\n\nThis matches option B. The reasoning is sound and confirmed by the fundamental physics described in the search results.\n\nI am confident in this derivation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
