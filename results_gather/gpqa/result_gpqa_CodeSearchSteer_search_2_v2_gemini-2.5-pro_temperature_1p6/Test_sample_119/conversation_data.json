    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the relationship between the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) and the parallax itself, under the assumption that stars are uniformly distributed in space.\n\n1.  **Uniform Star Distribution**: The initial assumption is that the density of stars, let's call it ρ (rho), is constant everywhere in space. This means the number of stars in any given volume is the same.\n\n2.  **Volume and Distance**: Consider a thin spherical shell of space around the Earth. Let the inner radius of this shell be a distance *d* from Earth, and let the shell have a small thickness of *dd*. The volume of this thin shell (*dV*) can be approximated by its surface area multiplied by its thickness:\n    *   Surface Area of a sphere = 4πd²\n    *   Volume of the shell (dV) ≈ 4πd² * dd\n\n3.  **Number of Stars in the Shell**: With a uniform star density ρ, the number of stars (*dN*) within this shell is the density multiplied by the volume of the shell:\n    *   dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd\n\n4.  **Relating Distance to Parallax**: Stellar parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to a star. The relationship is given by:\n    *   d = 1 / plx\n    *   This also means we can express the change in distance (*dd*) in terms of the change in parallax (*d(plx)*). By taking the derivative of d with respect to plx, we get:\n    *   dd / d(plx) = -1 / plx²  or  |dd| = (1 / plx²) * d(plx)\n    *   We use the absolute value because we are interested in the magnitude of the number of stars, which cannot be negative.\n\n5.  **Substituting into the Star Count Equation**: Now, we substitute the expressions for *d* and *dd* in terms of *plx* back into our equation for the number of stars (*dN*):\n    *   dN = ρ * 4π * (1 / plx)² * (1 / plx²) * d(plx)\n\n6.  **Simplifying the Expression**: Combining the terms, we get:\n    *   dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)\n\n7.  **Finding Stars per Unit Parallax**: The question asks for how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. This is represented by the term dN / d(plx). From the equation above, we can see:\n    *   dN / d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴\n\n8.  **Conclusion**: Since 4, π, and ρ are all constants, the number of stars per unit parallax is directly proportional to 1/plx⁴. This relationship shows that there are significantly more stars at smaller parallax values (greater distances).\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx as ~ 1/plx⁴.\n\n<<<C>>>"
