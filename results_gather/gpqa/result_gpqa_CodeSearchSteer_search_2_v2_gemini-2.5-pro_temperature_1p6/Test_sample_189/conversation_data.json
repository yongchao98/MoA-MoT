  "question": "The reaction of an electron pair donor, nucleophile (Nu) with an electron pair acceptor is called nucleophilic substitution reaction. An sp3-hybridized electrophile needs to have a leaving group to proceed with the reaction. Substitution reactions have the following two types. One is SN1 and the other is the SN2 reaction. In contrast to the substitution reaction, the elimination reaction involves the removal of a pair or groups of atoms from a molecule. These are chemical reactions in which single carbon-carbon bonded organic compounds are converted to compounds containing double/triple bonds (unsaturated compounds).\nArrange the following nucleophiles more reactive to the poorest reactive in the aqueous solution.\n\n1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate\n2.

    "To arrange the given nucleophiles from most reactive to least reactive in an aqueous (protic) solution, we must consider several factors: charge, the identity of the nucleophilic atom, resonance, and steric hindrance.\n\nHere is the correct order of nucleophilicity from most to least reactive:\n1.  **Ethanethiolate (5):** In a protic solvent like water, nucleophilicity increases down a group in the periodic table. Sulfur is larger and more polarizable than oxygen, and its lone pairs are less tightly held and less hindered by hydrogen bonding with water molecules. This makes ethanethiolate a more powerful nucleophile than the oxygen-based nucleophiles.\n2.  **Hydroxide (2):** Hydroxide is a strong, negatively charged nucleophile. While alkoxides are often slightly stronger bases than hydroxide, the bulky 4-methylcyclohexyl group on the other alkoxide creates significant steric hindrance, making the smaller hydroxide ion more reactive as a nucleophile in this comparison.\n3.  **4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1):** This is an alkoxide, which is a potent nucleophile. Alkoxides are generally considered strong nucleophiles. However, the bulky 4-methylcyclohexyl group introduces steric hindrance, which can impede its ability to attack an electrophile, making it less reactive than the smaller hydroxide ion.\n4.  **Propionate (3):** The negative charge on the propionate ion is delocalized between two oxygen atoms through resonance. This resonance stabilization makes the electron pair less available for donation, significantly weakening it as a nucleophile compared to hydroxide and the alkoxide where the charge is localized on a single oxygen.\n5.  **Methanol (4):** Neutral molecules are much weaker nucleophiles than their corresponding negatively charged (anionic) counterparts. Methanol, being a neutral molecule, is the poorest nucleophile in this group.\n\nBased on this analysis, the order from most reactive to poorest reactive nucleophile is ethanethiolate > hydroxide > 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate > propionate > methanol. This corresponds to the sequence 5, 2, 1, 3, 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
