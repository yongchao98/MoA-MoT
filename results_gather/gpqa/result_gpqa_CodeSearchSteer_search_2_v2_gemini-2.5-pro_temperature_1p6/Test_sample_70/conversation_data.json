    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can use the principles of planetary equilibrium temperature and Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion.\n\n### Equilibrium Temperature\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is the theoretical temperature it would have if it were a perfect black body heated only by its parent star. It is determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from the star and the energy radiated back into space. The formula for equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity, the planet's albedo (the fraction of light reflected), and its distance from the star.\n\nSince the problem states that the five exoplanets have the same albedo and orbit the same star, the primary factor differentiating their equilibrium temperatures is their distance from the star. The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's distance (semi-major axis, 'a') from the star.\n\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 (T_eq4) and Planet_2 (T_eq2) is:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = √(a2 / a4)\n\nWhere a2 and a4 are the semi-major axes of Planet_2 and Planet_4, respectively.\n\n### Kepler's Third Law\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). This can be expressed as:\n\nP² ∝ a³\n\nThis implies that a ∝ P^(2/3).\n\n### Calculation\n\nWe can substitute the relationship from Kepler's Third Law into our temperature ratio equation:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = √( (P2^(2/3)) / (P4^(2/3)) ) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)\n\nThe problem provides the ratio of the orbital periods for Planet_1 through Planet_5 as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. From this, we have:\n*   Orbital period of Planet_2 (P2) = 2 (in relative units)\n*   Orbital period of Planet_4 (P4) = 3.5 (in relative units)\n\nNow, we can calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n\nT_eq4 / T_eq2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3) ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3) ≈ 0.8299\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.\n\nBased on the calculation, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<C>>>"
