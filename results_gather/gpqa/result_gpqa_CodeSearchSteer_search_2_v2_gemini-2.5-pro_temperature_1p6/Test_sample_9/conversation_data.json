    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, we must analyze the physical properties of each option. The key principle at play is gravitational compression, where a planet's own gravity compacts its material, increasing its density.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the options:\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our baseline. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly stated as being about the same as Earth's.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** With less mass, this planet would experience weaker gravitational compression. Therefore, its material would be less compacted, resulting in a lower average density than Earth's.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** For rocky planets with the same composition, density increases with mass. The significantly greater mass of this \"super-Earth\" would cause intense gravitational compression, squeezing the core and mantle to a much greater degree than on Earth. This compression overcomes the increase in volume, leading to a significantly higher overall density. For instance, while Earth has a density of about 5.5 g/cm³, models of rocky planets with 5 Earth masses predict densities that are substantially higher.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the options, the 5-Earth-mass planet (c) will be the densest. Its immense mass leads to the greatest gravitational compression among the choices, resulting in the highest density. The planets in options (a) and (b) have roughly the same density, while the planet in option (d) would be the least dense.\n\n<<<A>>>"
