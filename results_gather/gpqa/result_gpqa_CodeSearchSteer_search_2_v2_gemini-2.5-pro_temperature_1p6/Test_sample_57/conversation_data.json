    "Regularization is a method used in quantum field theory to handle infinite or divergent quantities that arise in calculations, particularly at high energies (ultraviolet divergences). This procedure involves introducing a parameter, known as a regulator or cutoff, to make these calculations finite. The final physical result is obtained in the limit where the regulator is removed.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the given theories in the context of regularization:\n\n*   **A) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory faces its own high-energy problem, specifically the infinite self-energy of a point-like charged particle. While regularization techniques can be applied to address this, the formalism of regularization as a systematic procedure is primarily a cornerstone of *quantum* field theories.\n\n*   **B) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** As the first successful quantum field theory, QED was where the problem of ultraviolet divergences in calculations became apparent. To obtain finite and physically meaningful predictions, QED requires regularization followed by renormalization.\n\n*   **C) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** Similar to QED, QCD is a quantum field theory that describes the strong nuclear force. It also suffers from ultraviolet divergences in calculations, which are handled using non-perturbative methods like lattice QCD, a form of regularization. Various regularization schemes are employed to make calculations in QCD viable.\n\n*   **D) Superstring Theory:** A primary motivation for superstring theory is its potential to resolve the ultraviolet divergences that plague quantum field theories, including those in quantum gravity. It is believed to be a UV-finite theory, meaning it is free from these high-energy divergences. This finiteness is attributed to the extended nature of strings, which \"smears out\" interactions at very short distances, thus avoiding the point-like infinities of other theories. Because it does not have these infinities, it does not require the procedure of regularization.\n\nTherefore, Superstring Theory is the framework that is thought to be free of high-energy divergences and does not necessitate regularization.\n\n<<<D>>>"
