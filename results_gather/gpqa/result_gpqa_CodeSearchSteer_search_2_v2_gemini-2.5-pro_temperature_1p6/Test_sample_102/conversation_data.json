    "To determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful analysis of the directing effects of the substituents is necessary. The target molecule has an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2) at positions 1, 3, and 5, respectively. This means all substituents are in a meta relationship to each other.\n\nA step-by-step evaluation of the provided options based on the principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution reveals the most plausible pathway:\n\n*   **Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects**:\n    *   **-COCH3 (acetyl group)**: This is a deactivating group and a meta-director.\n    *   **-Br (bromo group)**: This is a weakly deactivating group but an ortho, para-director.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro group)**: This is a strongly deactivating group and a meta-director.\n\nThe goal is to add these three groups to the benzene ring in an order that respects their directing effects to achieve the 1,3,5-substitution pattern.\n\n1.  **Option A** starts with bromination, followed by nitration. This would lead to para-bromonitrobenzene as the major product. A subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation on this strongly deactivated ring would be very difficult and yield the wrong isomer.\n2.  **Option B** is incorrect as it involves synthesizing aniline from nitrobenzene, only to convert it back to benzene in step (iv), which is counterproductive.\n3.  **Option C** proposes a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (from step ii). This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group of aniline, deactivating the ring and preventing the desired acylation.\n4.  **Option D** presents the most chemically sound route for the initial steps:\n    *   **i) CH3COCl/AlCl3**: This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation that attaches an acetyl group to the benzene ring, forming acetophenone. The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n    *   **ii) Br2/FeBr3**: This is a bromination reaction. Since the acetyl group is a meta-director, the bromine atom is added to position 3, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   **iii) HNO3/H2SO4**: This is a nitration reaction. On 3-bromoacetophenone, there is a meta-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an ortho,para-director (-Br at C3). When a meta-director and an ortho,para-director are at positions 1 and 3, the incoming electrophile is directed to position 5. The -COCH3 group directs the new group to C5, and the -Br group directs it to C4 and C6. In this case, the nitration predominantly occurs at position 5, which is meta to both existing groups, leading to the desired product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThe initial three steps of option D provide a direct and high-yield pathway to the target molecule. The subsequent steps listed in the option (iv-vii) are superfluous as they would modify the already-formed final product. However, among the choices given, only the sequence in D contains the correct synthetic strategy.\n\n<<<D>>>"
