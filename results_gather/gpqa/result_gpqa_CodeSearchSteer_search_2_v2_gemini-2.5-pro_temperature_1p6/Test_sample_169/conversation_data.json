    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, ⟨S_y⟩.\n\n1.  **Define the Spin State Vector**\n    The unnormalized spin state is given by the vector |χ⟩ = (3i, 4). In column vector notation, this is:\n    \n    |χ⟩ = \n    $$\n    \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    \n\n2.  **Normalize the Spin State**\n    To find the expectation value, the state vector must be normalized. First, we calculate the squared norm of |χ⟩, which is ⟨χ|χ⟩:\n    \n    ⟨χ| = \n    $$\n    \\begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    \n    \n    ⟨χ|χ⟩ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = -9i² + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25.\n    \n    The normalization constant is the reciprocal of the square root of this value, which is 1/√25 = 1/5.\n    \n    The normalized state vector, |ψ⟩, is:\n    \n    |ψ⟩ = (1/5)\n    $$\n    \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    \n\n3.  **Define the Spin Operator S_y**\n    The spin operator along the y-direction is given by S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y, where σ_y is the Pauli Y-matrix provided:\n    \n    S_y = (ħ/2)\n    $$\n    \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    \n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value ⟨S_y⟩**\n    The expectation value is calculated using the formula ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩.\n    \n    ⟨S_y⟩ = [ (1/5)\n    $$\n    \\begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n     ] [ (ħ/2)\n    $$\n    \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n     ] [ (1/5)\n    $$\n    \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n     ]\n    \n    First, let's combine the constants:\n    \n    ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ / (2 * 5 * 5)) \n    $$\n    \\begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    \n    Next, multiply the matrix by the column vector (ket):\n    \n    $$\n    \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n    \\begin{pmatrix} 3i \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) \\\\ (i)(3i) + (0)(4) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -4i \\\\ 3i^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -4i \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    \n    Now, multiply the row vector (bra) by the resulting vector:\n    \n    $$\n    \\begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -4i \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix} = (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) = 12i^2 - 12 = -12 - 12 = -24\n    $$\n    \n    Finally, multiply by the constant factor we set aside earlier:\n    \n    ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/50) * (-24) = -24ħ/50 = -12ħ/25.\n\nTherefore, the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is -12ħ/25.\n\n<<<D>>>"
