    "Rationale Breakdown:\n\nThe goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene, which often requires a careful strategy involving blocking groups or manipulation of directing effects to achieve the desired substitution pattern, especially with sterically bulky groups like tert-butyl.\n\nLet's analyze the substitution pattern of the target molecule:\n*   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strongly activating ortho, para-director.\n*   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu), a bulky activating ortho, para-director.\n*   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2), a strongly deactivating meta-director.\n\nThe groups are arranged with the bulky tert-butyl group positioned between the ethoxy and nitro groups. Synthesizing such a sterically crowded molecule with a 1,2,3-pattern requires a very specific sequence of reactions. Let's evaluate the given options step-by-step to determine which, if any, could produce this molecule in high yield.\n\n**Analysis of the Options:**\n\n*   **Option B:** This sequence is chemically flawed. Step (iii) involves sulfonation, followed by step (iv) which calls for reaction with NaNO2/HCl. This reagent is used for the diazotization of a primary aromatic amine (-NH2). The product from step (iii), 4-t-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid, does not contain an amino group, so this reaction cannot occur. Thus, Option B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence is also chemically flawed. After forming aniline (step ii) and presumably 4-tert-butylaniline (step iii), the sequence proceeds with nitration (iv) and then diazotization (v). Step (vi) attempts to sulfonate the resulting diazonium salt. Diazonium salts are highly reactive intermediates and are not typically subjected to sulfonation; they are usually immediately used in substitution reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis). This step is not a standard or logical transformation. Thus, Option C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** The sequence of reagents listed is chemically illogical. For example, it shows a reduction (Fe/HCl) followed by a nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) and then hydrolysis of a diazonium salt (H3O+, H2O/Heat), which would have to have been formed in a previous, unstated step. The order of reagents as presented does not constitute a viable synthetic pathway. Thus, Option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A:** This is the longest and most complex sequence. Let's trace the likely major products:\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3**: Benzene is alkylated to form **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n    2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. The t-butyl group is an ortho, para-director, but due to its large size, the para product is heavily favored. The product is **1-tert-Butyl-4-nitrobenzene**. Starting a \"high-yield\" synthesis this way locks in a 1,4-substitution pattern that is incompatible with the final 1,2,3-target.\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl**: Reduction of the nitro group gives **4-tert-Butylaniline**.\n    4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4**: Nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to anilinium (-NH3+), which is a meta-director. The t-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. Both direct the incoming nitro group to position 3 (relative to the amine). The product is **4-tert-Butyl-3-nitroaniline**.\n    5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl**: Diazotization of the amine gives a diazonium salt.\n    6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt replaces the N2+ group with an -OH group, yielding **4-tert-Butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr**: Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol into an ether, giving **4-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    8.  **viii) SO3/H2SO4 & ix) dilute H2SO4**: A sulfonation followed by a desulfonation. In this position, these steps appear superfluous.\n\nThe product of the main sequence of steps in Option A is **4-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**, which is an isomer of the target compound, but not the target itself.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nNone of the provided options lead to the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Options B, C, and D contain chemically nonsensical steps. Option A outlines a chemically plausible synthesis, but it yields an isomer of the desired product and contains two redundant final steps. Given that options B, C, and D are fundamentally impossible, Option A stands as the only choice that represents a sequence of valid organic reactions, even though it does not lead to the specified target. In the context of a multiple-choice question, this indicates a high probability of an error in the question itself (either the target name or the options). However, one must select the best possible answer, which is the one that is not chemically impossible.\n\n<<<A>>>"
