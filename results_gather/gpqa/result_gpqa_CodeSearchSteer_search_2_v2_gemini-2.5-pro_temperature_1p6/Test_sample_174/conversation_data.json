    "The problem asks for two things:\n1.  The fraction of maximum radiated power that is radiated at an angle of 30 degrees from the symmetry axis (z-axis).\n2.  A possible functional form for the dependence of the radiated power on the wavelength, λ.\n\nAn oscillating charge distribution, regardless of its specific shape (like a spheroid), will, to a first approximation and for dimensions much smaller than the wavelength, radiate as an electric dipole, provided there is an oscillating net dipole moment. The oscillation along the z-axis creates such a dipole moment.\n\n**Angular Distribution of Power**\n\nFor an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) is given by:\n\ndP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)\n\nwhere θ is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n\n*   The radiated power is maximum when sin²(θ) is maximum. The maximum value of sin²(θ) is 1, which occurs at θ = 90° (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis). Let's denote this maximum power per unit solid angle as A. So, A ∝ sin²(90°) = 1.\n*   We need to find the power radiated at an angle θ = 30°. At this angle, the power is proportional to sin²(30°).\n*   Since sin(30°) = 1/2, sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4.\n*   The fraction of the maximum power A that is radiated at 30° is the ratio of the power at 30° to the power at 90°: (dP/dΩ at 30°)/(dP/dΩ at 90°) = (sin²(30°))/(sin²(90°)) = (1/4)/1 = 1/4.\n\n**Wavelength Dependence of Power**\n\nThe total power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency ω (P ∝ ω⁴). The angular frequency is related to the wavelength λ by the equation ω = 2πc/λ, where c is the speed of light.\n\nTherefore, the radiated power has a dependence on the wavelength as follows:\n\nP ∝ ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴\n\nThis λ⁻⁴ relationship is a fundamental result for electric dipole radiation, also known as Rayleigh's law. The power per unit solid angle (f) will have the same wavelength dependence.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining these two results:\n*   The fraction of the maximum power A radiated at θ = 30° is 1/4.\n*   A possible form of the wavelength dependence, f, is λ⁻⁴.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
