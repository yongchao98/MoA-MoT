    "The user wants me to solve a physics/astronomy problem. I have already reasoned through the steps and arrived at an answer. Now, I will confirm my understanding with the search results and then provide the final answer.\n\n1.  **Parallax and Distance Relationship**: The search results confirm that the distance `d` to a star is inversely proportional to its parallax `p`. Specifically, `d = 1/p` when d is in parsecs and p is in arcseconds. This confirms the first step of my reasoning (`r ∝ 1/plx`).\n\n2.  **Star Counts**: The user states that the number of stars `N` varies with parallax as `1/plx^5`. This is the given premise.\n\n3.  **The Question**: The question asks how the number of stars *per unit range of distance* (let's call this `n(r)`) changes with distance `r`. This is equivalent to asking for the derivative `dN/dr`.\n\n4.  **My Derivation**:\n    *   Given: `N(plx) ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n    *   We know: `plx ∝ r⁻¹`\n    *   Substitute `plx` in the first relation: `N(r) ∝ (r⁻¹)⁻⁵ = r⁵`. This `N(r)` represents the cumulative number of stars out to a distance `r`.\n    *   The number of stars per unit distance is the derivative of `N(r)` with respect to `r`: `dN/dr`.\n    *   If `N(r) = k * r⁵`, then `dN/dr = 5 * k * r⁴`.\n    *   Therefore, `dN/dr ∝ r⁴`.\n\nThis derivation seems sound and is based on fundamental principles confirmed by the search results. The search results do not directly contain a formula for `dN/dr` as a function of `r` given a `1/plx^5` dependency, as this is a specific problem to be solved rather than a general knowledge fact to be looked up. However, the foundational relationship between parallax and distance is very well-supported.\n\nThe reasoning is correct. I can now present the final answer. To be thorough, let's break down the logic again for the final response.\n\n*   The distance to a star, `r`, is inversely proportional to its parallax, `plx`. This can be written as `r ∝ 1/plx`, or `plx ∝ 1/r`.\n*   The problem states that the number of stars, `N`, varies with parallax as `1/plx^5`. This means `N ∝ (plx)⁻⁵`.\n*   We can substitute the relationship between distance and parallax into the given formula for the number of stars. This will tell us how the cumulative number of stars out to a certain distance `r` depends on `r`.\n    *   `N ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵`\n    *   `N ∝ r⁵`\n*   The question asks for how the number of stars changes *per unit range of distance*. This quantity is the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance, which is mathematically represented by the derivative `dN/dr`.\n*   To find this, we differentiate the expression for `N(r)` with respect to `r`.\n    *   If we express the proportionality as an equation with a constant `k`, we have `N = k * r⁵`.\n    *   The derivative is `dN/dr = d/dr (k * r⁵) = 5 * k * r⁴`.\n*   Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r⁴` (`dN/dr ∝ r⁴`).\n*   This corresponds to option D.The final step is to provide the final answer based on the derivation. The derivation is consistent and the foundational principles are confirmed by the search results.\n\nFinal check of the steps:\n- `d ∝ 1/p` -> Confirmed.\n- `N ∝ p⁻⁵` -> Given.\n- Question asks for `dN/dr`.\n- `N(r) ∝ r⁵`. This is the cumulative number.\n- `dN/dr ∝ d(r⁵)/dr ∝ r⁴`. This is the number per unit distance shell.\n\nThe logic is solid.\n\n```\nTo determine how the number of stars per unit range of distance changes, we first need to establish the relationships between the given quantities.\n\n1.  **Parallax and Distance:** The distance to a star (`r`) is inversely proportional to its parallax (`plx`). [1, 3, 6] This fundamental relationship in astronomy can be expressed as:\n    `r ∝ 1/plx`  or, equivalently, `plx ∝ 1/r`. [2, 5]\n\n2.  **Number of Stars vs. Parallax:** The problem provides the specific relationship for this region of the sky, stating that the cumulative number of observed stars (`N`) varies with parallax as:\n    `N ∝ 1/plx^5` or `N ∝ plx⁻⁵`\n\n3.  **Number of Stars vs. Distance:** To find out how the number of stars relates to distance, we can substitute the parallax-distance relationship from step 1 into the expression from step 2:\n    Since `plx ∝ 1/r`, we have `N ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵`.\n    This simplifies to `N ∝ r⁵`.\n    This expression tells us that the *total* number of stars observed up to a distance `r` is proportional to the fifth power of the distance.\n\n4.  **Number of Stars Per Unit Distance:** The question asks for the number of stars *per unit range of distance*, not the total cumulative number. This is the stellar density in a thin spherical shell at distance `r`, which can be found by taking the derivative of the cumulative number of stars `N` with respect to the distance `r` (`dN/dr`).\n\n    If we represent the proportionality `N ∝ r⁵` as an equation `N = k * r⁵` (where `k` is a constant of proportionality), we can differentiate it:\n    `dN/dr = d/dr(k * r⁵) = 5 * k * r⁴`\n\n    Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r⁴`:\n    `dN/dr ∝ r⁴`\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ r^5\nB) ~ r^2\nC) ~ r^3\nD) ~ r^4\n\nThe correct option is D.\n```To find the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance and the distance itself, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Relate Distance and Parallax:** The distance to a star, denoted by `r`, is inversely proportional to its parallax, `plx`. This can be written as:\n    `r ∝ 1/plx` which implies `plx ∝ 1/r`.\n\n2.  **Use the Given Information:** The problem states that the cumulative number of stars, `N`, varies with parallax according to the relation:\n    `N ∝ 1/plx⁵`\n\n3.  **Express Number of Stars in Terms of Distance:** We can substitute the relationship from step 1 into the given formula from step 2 to find how the cumulative number of stars depends on distance:\n    Since `plx ∝ 1/r`, we get `N ∝ (1/r)⁻⁵`, which simplifies to `N ∝ r⁵`. This means the total number of stars out to a distance `r` is proportional to `r⁵`.\n\n4.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:** The question asks for how the number of stars changes *per unit range of distance*, which is not the total number `N`, but the rate of change of `N` with respect to `r`. In calculus, this is represented by the derivative, `dN/dr`.\n\n    To find this, we differentiate the proportionality `N ∝ r⁵`. Let's introduce a constant of proportionality, `k`, so that `N = k * r⁵`.\n    Now, we take the derivative with respect to `r`:\n    `dN/dr = d/dr(k * r⁵) = 5 * k * r⁴`\n\n    This shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r⁴`.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r) as `~ r⁴`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
