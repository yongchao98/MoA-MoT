    "Here is an analysis of each compound to determine if it exhibits optical isomerism:\n\n**1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n\nThis compound is a substituted biphenyl. Optical isomerism in biphenyls can occur due to a phenomenon called atropisomerism, which is caused by restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. For atropisomerism to result in chirality, the bulky groups in the ortho positions (in this case, the nitro and dimethyl dicarboxylate groups) must prevent the two rings from becoming coplanar, and each ring must be asymmetrically substituted. The presence of bulky substituents creates a high enough energy barrier to prevent free rotation, leading to separable, non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). The discovery of atropisomerism was confirmed through the resolution of 6,6'-dinitrodiphenic acid into two optically active forms. Therefore, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate exhibits optical isomerism due to axial chirality.\n\n**2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\nAlso known as methyl lactate, this molecule's potential for optical isomerism depends on the presence of a chiral center. A chiral center is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the second carbon atom is attached to a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methyl ester group (-COOCH3). Since all four of these groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center. The presence of this single chiral center means the molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image, resulting in two enantiomers (D- and L-methyl lactate or (R)- and (S)-methyl lactate). Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.\n\n**3. Benzophenone**\n\nBenzophenone (diphenylmethanone) has a central carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. For a molecule to be chiral, it must not have a plane of symmetry. Benzophenone possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule through the carbonyl group and the bond connecting the two phenyl rings. It does not contain a chiral center. While some heavily substituted benzophenones can be resolved, the parent molecule itself is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n**4. Dimethyl fumarate**\n\nDimethyl fumarate is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid. The double bond prevents free rotation, leading to geometric isomerism (cis/trans), but not necessarily optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate has a center of symmetry and is, therefore, achiral. Its cis-isomer, dimethyl maleate, has a plane of symmetry and is also achiral. Because it is superimposable on its mirror image, dimethyl fumarate does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate exhibit optical isomerism. Benzophenone and dimethyl fumarate do not.\n\n<<<A>>>"
