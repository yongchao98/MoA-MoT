    "To clearly distinguish between two quantum energy levels, the difference in their energies must be greater than the natural linewidth (energy uncertainty) of each state. This is a direct consequence of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nThe relationship is given by the formula: ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ΔE is the energy uncertainty, Δt is the lifetime of the state, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant. The lifetime of the state corresponds to the uncertainty in time (Δt). The shorter the lifetime, the greater the uncertainty in the energy of the state.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the energy uncertainty (natural linewidth) for each quantum state. We can use the more convenient value of the reduced Planck constant, ħ, which is approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n*   **For the first state (E1):**\n    *   Lifetime (τ₁) = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₁) ≈ ħ / τ₁\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **For the second state (E2):**\n    *   Lifetime (τ₂) = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty (ΔE₂) ≈ ħ / τ₂\n    *   ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nTo resolve the two energy levels, the energy separation between them must be larger than both of their individual energy uncertainties. The state with the shorter lifetime (τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s) has the larger energy uncertainty (ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV). Therefore, the energy difference between the two levels must be significantly greater than this value.\n\nNow, we compare this requirement with the given options:\n*   A) 10⁻⁴ eV\n*   B) 10⁻¹¹ eV\n*   C) 10⁻⁹ eV\n*   D) 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nOnly the value 10⁻⁴ eV is significantly larger than the required minimum energy separation of approximately 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. The other options are all smaller than the calculated energy uncertainty of the first state.\n\n<<<A>>>"
