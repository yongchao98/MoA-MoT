    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture:** The problem describes an N-sided regular polygon where all apothems have the same length 'a'. As the number of sides, N, becomes infinitely large, the polygon approaches the shape of a circle. The apothem 'a' becomes the radius of this circle.\n\n2.  **Identify the Physics:** When monochromatic light passes through this aperture, it undergoes diffraction. Since the aperture becomes a circle for an infinitely large N, the phenomenon is Fraunhofer diffraction by a circular aperture. This type of diffraction produces a characteristic pattern known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings.\n\n3.  **Position of Minima:** The dark rings, or minima, in the Airy pattern occur at specific angles. The angular positions of these minima are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function. The formula for the angular position of the minima is:\n    sin(θ) = m * (λ / D)\n    where:\n    *   θ is the angular position of the minimum.\n    *   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n    *   D is the diameter of the circular aperture.\n    *   m is a constant derived from the zeros of the Bessel function.\n\n4.  **Calculate for First and Second Minima:**\n    *   The problem states that the apothem is 'a', which becomes the radius of the circular aperture. Therefore, the diameter D = 2a.\n    *   For the **first minimum** (the first dark ring), the constant m₁ is approximately 1.220.\n    *   For the **second minimum** (the second dark ring), the constant m₂ is approximately 2.233.\n    *   The problem specifies that the small angle approximation (tan θ ≈ sin θ ≈ θ) can be used.\n\n5.  **Angular Position of the First Minimum (θ₁):**\n    θ₁ ≈ 1.220 * (λ / D) = 1.220 * (λ / 2a) = 0.610 * (λ / a).\n\n6.  **Angular Position of the Second Minimum (θ₂):**\n    θ₂ ≈ 2.233 * (λ / D) = 2.233 * (λ / 2a) ≈ 1.1165 * (λ / a).\n\n7.  **Calculate the Angular Distance:** The question asks for the \"angular distance between the first two minima\". This refers to the difference in the angular positions of the second minimum and the first minimum.\n    Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁\n    Δθ ≈ (1.1165 * λ / a) - (0.610 * λ / a)\n    Δθ ≈ (1.1165 - 0.610) * (λ / a)\n    Δθ ≈ 0.5065 * (λ / a)\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated value, 0.5065 λ / a, matches option D, which is 0.506 λ / a.\n\n<<<D>>>"
