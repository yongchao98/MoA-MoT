    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n### 1. Normalize the Initial State |α>\n\nThe given state is proportional to |ψ> = (1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>. To normalize it, we need to find a constant C such that |α> = C|ψ> and <α|α> = 1.\n\nThe inner product <ψ|ψ> is:\n<ψ|ψ> = <(1+i)up + (2-i)down | (1+i)up + (2-i)down>\n<ψ|ψ> = (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)\n<ψ|ψ> = (1 - i²) + (4 - i²) = (1 + 1) + (4 + 1) = 7\n\nThe normalization constant C is 1/√7.\nThe normalized state is:\n|α> = (1/√7) * [(1+i) |up> + (2-i) |down>]\n\nIn vector notation, where |up> = (1, 0) and |down> = (0, 1), the state is:\n|α> = (1/√7) * [ (1+i) , (2-i) ]ᵀ\n\n### 2. Find Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of the Operator A\n\nThe matrix A is defined by Aᵢⱼ = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. This gives the matrix:\nA = (ħ/2) * [,]\nThis operator is proportional to the Pauli-X matrix.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0:\ndet( [[-λ, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -λ]] ) = (-λ)(-λ) - (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = λ² - (ħ/2)² = 0\nThis gives two eigenvalues:\n*   λ₁ = +ħ/2\n*   λ₂ = -ħ/2\n\nNext, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors:\n*   **For λ₁ = +ħ/2:**\n    (A - λ₁I)v₁ = 0  =>  [[-ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -ħ/2]] [x, y]ᵀ =ᵀ\n    This leads to the equation -x + y = 0, or x = y. The unnormalized eigenvector isᵀ.\n    The normalized eigenvector is |v₁> = (1/√2) * (|up> + |down>).\n\n*   **For λ₂ = -ħ/2:**\n    (A - λ₂I)v₂ = 0  =>  [[ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, ħ/2]] [x, y]ᵀ =ᵀ\n    This leads to the equation x + y = 0, or x = -y. The unnormalized eigenvector is [1, -1]ᵀ.\n    The normalized eigenvector is |v₂> = (1/√2) * (|up> - |down>).\n\n### 3. Calculate the Measurement Probabilities\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product of its corresponding eigenvector with the state |α>.\n\n*   **Probability of measuring λ₁ = +ħ/2:**\n    P(+ħ/2) = |<v₁|α>|²\n    <v₁|α> = [(1/√2)(<up| + <down|)] * [(1/√7)((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]\n    <v₁|α> = (1/√14) * [ (1)(1+i) + (1)(2-i) ] = (1/√14) * (3) = 3/√14\n    P(+ħ/2) = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.643\n\n*   **Probability of measuring λ₂ = -ħ/2:**\n    P(-ħ/2) = |<v₂|α>|²\n    <v₂|α> = [(1/√2)(<up| - <down|)] * [(1/√7)((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]\n    <v₂|α> = (1/√14) * [ (1)(1+i) - (1)(2-i) ] = (1/√14) * (-1 + 2i)\n    P(-ħ/2) = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1+4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Average Value of the Operator\n\nThe average or expectation value of operator A, denoted <A>, can be calculated in two ways.\n\n*   **Method 1: Using eigenvalues and probabilities**\n    <A> = Σ P(λᵢ) * λᵢ\n    <A> = P(+ħ/2) * (+ħ/2) + P(-ħ/2) * (-ħ/2)\n    <A> = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2)\n    <A> = (ħ/2) * (9/14 - 5/14) = (ħ/2) * (4/14) = (ħ/2) * (2/7) = ħ/7\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the formula <A> = <α|A|α>**\n    <A> = (1/√7)[(1-i)<up| + (2+i)<down|] * (A) * (1/√7)[(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]\n    <A> = (1/7) * [(1-i), (2+i)] * [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]] * [[1+i], [2-i]]\n    <A> = (ħ/14) * [(1-i), (2+i)] * [[2-i], [1+i]]\n    <A> = (ħ/14) * [ (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) ]\n    <A> = (ħ/14) * [ (2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1) ]\n    <A> = (ħ/14) * [ (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) ] = (ħ/14) * 2 = ħ/7\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of the operator A is ħ/7. Comparing these results with the given options, we find a match.\n\n*   Probabilities: 0.64, 0.36\n*   Average value: ħ/7\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
