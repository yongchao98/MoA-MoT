  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "To determine the reason for the failed protein overexpression, the provided DNA sequence must be analyzed.\n\n1.  **Identify the Start Codon**: The sequence begins with `ATG`, which is the standard start codon for Methionine. Translation will begin here.\n2.  **Identify the HA Tag Sequence**: The influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag has the amino acid sequence YPYDVPDYA. The corresponding DNA sequence is `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCT`. Looking at the provided sequence after the start codon: `5'-ATG TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC...`. This correctly codes for the HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) attached to the initial Methionine.\n3.  **Analyze the Sequence Immediately Following the HA Tag**: The sequence continues as `...GATTACGCC AAATGA TCT...`. Let's analyze this in codons (triplets):\n    *   The HA tag ends with the codon `GCC` (Alanine).\n    *   The next codon is `AAA` (Lysine).\n    *   The next codon is `TGA`.\n4.  **Check the Genetic Code**: According to the standard genetic code, `TGA` is a stop codon (along with `TAA` and `TAG`).\n\nThe presence of a `TGA` stop codon immediately after the sequence for the HA tag and a single additional amino acid will cause the ribosome to halt protein synthesis. This is known as a premature termination codon (PTC). The result would be a tiny, non-functional peptide (Met-HA-Lys) instead of the full-length GADD45G protein. This directly explains why you are \"unable to overexpress your protein as you expected\".\n\nTherefore, the ribosome terminated the translation early due to an unintended, premature stop codon in the engineered sequence.\n\n<<<A>>>"
