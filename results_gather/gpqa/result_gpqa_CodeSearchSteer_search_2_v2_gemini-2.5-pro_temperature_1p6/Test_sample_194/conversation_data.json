    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Transit Condition and Impact Parameter**\n\nA transit occurs when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view. For this to happen, the planet's orbit must be aligned in a way that it intersects the star's disk. The impact parameter, `b`, is the apparent distance between the center of the star and the center of the planet at the point of closest approach, divided by the star's radius.\n\nThe formula for the impact parameter for a circular orbit is:\n`b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s`\nwhere:\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the orbit.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit (where i=90° is an edge-on orbit).\n*   `R_s` is the radius of the star.\n\nFor a transit to occur where the center of the planet crosses the star's disk, the condition is `b ≤ 1`. The maximum possible value for `b` is 1, which represents a grazing transit where the planet's center passes exactly over the star's limb. An occultation (the planet passing behind the star) will also occur if a transit happens in a circular orbit. Therefore, the limiting condition for both events is `b_max = 1`.\n\n**2. Relate the Two Planets**\n\nThe problem states that both planets share the same orbital plane. This means they have the same inclination, `i`. Since they orbit the same star (with radius `R_s`), the term `cos(i) / R_s` is a constant for this system.\n\nThis allows us to establish a ratio between the impact parameters and semi-major axes of the two planets:\n*   For Planet 1: `b1 = (a1 * cos(i)) / R_s`\n*   For Planet 2: `b2 = (a2 * cos(i)) / R_s`\n\nDividing the second equation by the first gives:\n`b2 / b1 = a2 / a1`\n\n**3. Apply Kepler's Third Law**\n\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`a`). For two planets orbiting the same star, the relationship is:\n`(P2 / P1)^2 = (a2 / a1)^3`\n\n**4. Combine the Equations and Solve for the Maximum Period**\n\nWe can now substitute the relationship from step 2 (`a2 / a1 = b2 / b1`) into Kepler's Third Law:\n`(P2 / P1)^2 = (b2 / b1)^3`\n\nWe want to find the maximum possible orbital period for Planet 2 (`P2_max`). This will occur at the maximum possible semi-major axis that still allows for a transit, which corresponds to the maximum impact parameter, `b2_max = 1`.\n\nWe are given:\n*   `P1 = 3` days\n*   `b1 = 0.2`\n*   `b2_max = 1`\n\nNow, we solve for `P2_max`:\n`(P2_max / 3)^2 = (1 / 0.2)^3`\n`(P2_max / 3)^2 = 5^3`\n`(P2_max / 3)^2 = 125`\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n`P2_max / 3 = sqrt(125)`\n`P2_max / 3 = sqrt(25 * 5)`\n`P2_max / 3 = 5 * sqrt(5)`\n\nFinally, solve for `P2_max`:\n`P2_max = 15 * sqrt(5)`\n\nUsing the approximation `sqrt(5) ≈ 2.236`:\n`P2_max ≈ 15 * 2.236`\n`P2_max ≈ 33.54` days\n\nThis value is approximately 33.5 days. The radii of the planets and the star are extra information not needed for this calculation, assuming the standard transit condition `b ≤ 1`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
