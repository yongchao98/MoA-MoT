    "To determine the total energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus, we will follow these steps:\n1.  Determine the rest mass (m₀) of the Lithium-6 nucleus.\n2.  Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ) for the given speed.\n3.  Calculate the total energy using the formula E = γ * m₀ * c².\n\n**Step 1: Determine the rest mass of the Lithium-6 nucleus**\n\nThe nucleus in question is Lithium-6 ($^{6}_{3}Li$), which contains 3 protons and 3 neutrons.\n\nFrom the search results, the atomic mass of a Lithium-6 atom is 6.015122887 u. To find the mass of the nucleus, we must subtract the mass of its 3 electrons.\n\n*   Mass of an electron (mₑ) = 0.511 MeV/c² = 0.000511 GeV/c².\n*   Atomic Mass Unit (u) to GeV/c² conversion: 1 u ≈ 0.9315 GeV/c².\n\nFirst, convert the atomic mass of Lithium-6 to GeV/c²:\n*   Atomic mass of $^{6}Li$ = 6.015122887 u * 0.9315 GeV/c²/u ≈ 5.60309 GeV/c².\n\nNext, calculate the total mass of the 3 electrons in GeV/c²:\n*   Mass of 3 electrons = 3 * 0.000511 GeV/c² = 0.001533 GeV/c².\n\nFinally, subtract the electron mass from the atomic mass to get the nuclear mass (m₀):\n*   m₀ = 5.60309 GeV/c² - 0.001533 GeV/c² = 5.601557 GeV/c².\n\nThis value is the rest mass of the Lithium-6 nucleus. The rest energy (m₀c²) is therefore 5.601557 GeV.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ)**\n\nThe speed of the nucleus is given as v = 0.96c. The Lorentz factor is calculated as:\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (v²/c²))\nγ = 1 / √(1 - (0.96c)²/c²)\nγ = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216)\nγ = 1 / √0.0784\nγ = 1 / 0.28\nγ ≈ 3.5714\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total energy (E)**\n\nThe total relativistic energy is given by E = γ * m₀c².\n*   E = 3.5714 * 5.601557 GeV\n*   E ≈ 20.0051 GeV\n\nLet's re-evaluate using more precise constants for the calculation.\n*   Mass of proton: 0.938272 GeV/c²\n*   Mass of neutron: 0.939565 GeV/c²\n*   Mass of Li-6 atom: 6.015122887 u\n*   1 u = 931.4941 MeV/c² = 0.9314941 GeV/c²\n\nRecalculating the rest energy of the Li-6 nucleus:\n*   Rest energy of Li-6 atom = 6.015122887 u * 931.4941 MeV/u = 5603.0508 MeV = 5.6030508 GeV\n*   Rest energy of 3 electrons = 3 * 0.510999 MeV = 1.532997 MeV = 0.001533 GeV\n*   Rest energy of Li-6 nucleus (m₀c²) = 5603.0508 MeV - 1.533 MeV = 5601.5178 MeV = 5.6015178 GeV\n\nNow, recalculate the total energy with the more precise rest energy:\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.96²) = 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857...\n*   E = 3.57142857 * 5.6015178 GeV\n*   E ≈ 20.00542 GeV\n\nRounding this to three decimal places gives 20.005 GeV. This result is closest to option C. A slight variation might be due to rounding in the provided constants. Let's check the options again.\n\nLet's try to calculate it slightly differently to check for discrepancies. The binding energy of Li-6 is 31.99 MeV.\n*   Mass of 3 protons = 3 * 938.272 MeV = 2814.816 MeV\n*   Mass of 3 neutrons = 3 * 939.565 MeV = 2818.695 MeV\n*   Total mass of nucleons = 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV\n*   Mass of Li-6 nucleus = Total mass of nucleons - Binding energy = 5633.511 MeV - 31.99 MeV = 5601.521 MeV = 5.601521 GeV.\n\nThis is extremely close to the previous calculation.\n\n*   E = 3.57142857 * 5.601521 GeV ≈ 20.00543 GeV.\n\nThe result is consistently around 20.005 GeV. Comparing this to the options:\nA) 18.475 GeV\nB) 23.069 GeV\nC) 20.132 GeV\nD) 21.419\n\nThere is a small discrepancy. Let's re-examine the Lorentz factor calculation, as it's the most likely source of a simple error if the constants are correct.\nv/c = 0.96\n(v/c)² = 0.9216\n1 - (v/c)² = 0.0784\nsqrt(0.0784) = 0.28\n1 / 0.28 is indeed ~3.5714.\n\nLet's assume option C is correct and work backward to see what rest mass it would imply.\n*   E = 20.132 GeV\n*   m₀c² = E / γ = 20.132 GeV / 3.57142857 = 5.63696 GeV.\n\nThis implied rest mass is higher than what was calculated from official data. The difference is about 35.4 MeV, which is significant.\n\nLet's recalculate step-by-step with maximum precision to ensure accuracy.\n*   Rest Mass Energy (Li-6 nucleus) = 5.6015178 GeV\n*   Gamma (γ) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 25/7\n*   Total Energy = (25/7) * 5.6015178 GeV = 20.0054207... GeV\n\nThe calculation based on established physical constants consistently yields a result of approximately 20.005 GeV. Option C (20.132 GeV) is the closest answer, differing by about 0.6%. Given the options, and the possibility of slightly different constants being used to generate the problem, C is the most plausible choice, though my calculation is slightly off. Let me trust the calculated value.\n\nThere seems to be a discrepancy between my detailed calculation and the provided options. However, if forced to choose the closest option, 20.132 GeV is numerically nearest to my calculated 20.005 GeV. Let's consider if there is any other interpretation. Perhaps the mass used in the problem's source was different. For instance, if one naively took the mass number (6) and multiplied by the proton mass: 6 * 0.938 GeV = 5.628 GeV. Then E = (25/7) * 5.628 = 20.1 GeV. This is very close to 20.132 GeV. This is a common approximation. Let's use it.\n\nRest mass m₀ ≈ 6 * m_proton = 6 * 0.93827 GeV/c² = 5.629632 GeV/c²\nE = γ * m₀c² = (25/7) * 5.629632 GeV ≈ 20.1058 GeV. This is closer to 20.132 GeV.\n\nAnother approximation uses the atomic mass unit in GeV.\nm₀ ≈ 6 u ≈ 6 * 0.9315 GeV/c² = 5.589 GeV/c²\nE = (25/7) * 5.589 GeV ≈ 19.96 GeV. This is not closer.\n\nGiven these estimations, the approximation using 6 times the proton mass provides a result very near to option C. It seems likely the question was formulated using this approximation.\n\nFinal check with the most likely intended calculation:\nm₀ ≈ 6 * 0.93827 GeV/c² = 5.6296 GeV/c²\nE = (1/sqrt(1-0.96²)) * 5.6296 GeV = (1/0.28) * 5.6296 GeV = 20.1057 GeV.\n\nThis value is extremely close to 20.132 GeV. The small remaining difference could be due to the exact value of the proton mass used by the source of the question.\n\nFinal conclusion remains that C is the most plausible answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
