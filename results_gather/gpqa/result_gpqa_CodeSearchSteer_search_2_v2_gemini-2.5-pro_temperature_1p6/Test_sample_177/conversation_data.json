    "To determine the mass dimension of κ and the renormalizability of the theory, we first analyze the dimensions of each component of the interaction Lagrangian \\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}. We are working in d=4 spacetime dimensions.\n\n1.  **Mass Dimension of the Lagrangian Density (\\(\\mathcal{L}_{int}\\))**: The action, \\(S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L}\\), must be dimensionless. Since the spacetime volume element \\(d^4x\\) has a mass dimension of [M]⁻⁴, the Lagrangian density \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) must have a mass dimension of [M]⁴.\n\n2.  **Mass Dimension of the Fermion Field (\\(\\psi\\))**: The kinetic term for a Dirac fermion is \\(\\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu - m)\\psi\\). For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, the combination \\(\\bar{\\psi}\\partial_\\mu\\psi\\) must have dimension 4. Given that \\([\\partial_\\mu] = 1\\), it follows that \\([\\bar{\\psi}] + [\\psi] = 3\\). Therefore, the fermion field \\(\\psi\\) and its adjoint \\(\\bar{\\psi}\\) each have a mass dimension of 3/2.\n\n3.  **Mass Dimension of \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\)**: The term \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is defined as \\(\\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_\\mu, \\gamma_\\nu]\\), where \\(\\gamma_\\mu\\) are the Dirac gamma matrices. The gamma matrices are dimensionless. Consequently, \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is also dimensionless.\n\n4.  **Mass Dimension of the Field Strength Tensor (\\(F^{\\mu\\nu}\\))**: The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is \\(-\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}\\). For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, \\([F_{\\mu\\nu}]^2\\) must be 4. This implies that the field strength tensor \\(F^{\\mu\\nu}\\) has a mass dimension of 2.\n\nNow, we can determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \\(\\kappa\\) by ensuring the total mass dimension of \\(\\mathcal{L}_{int}\\) is 4:\n\\[[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa] + [\\bar{\\psi}] + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] + [\\psi] + [F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 4\\]\n\\[[\\kappa] + \\frac{3}{2} + 0 + \\frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4\\]\n\\[[\\kappa] + 3 + 2 = 4\\]\n\\[[\\kappa] + 5 = 4\\]\n\\[[\\kappa] = -1\\]\nThe mass dimension of \\(\\kappa\\) is -1.\n\n**Renormalizability of the Theory**\n\nA key criterion for determining whether a quantum field theory is renormalizable by power-counting is the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n*   If a coupling constant has a positive mass dimension, the theory is super-renormalizable.\n*   If a coupling constant is dimensionless (has a mass dimension of 0), the theory is renormalizable.\n*   If a coupling constant has a negative mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable.\n\nSince the mass dimension of \\(\\kappa\\) is -1, which is negative, the theory is not renormalizable. In non-renormalizable theories, higher-order corrections in perturbation theory introduce new types of divergences that would require an infinite number of counter-terms, thus stripping the theory of its predictive power at high energies.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   The mass dimension \\(\\left[\\kappa\\right]_{M}=-1\\).\n*   The theory is not renormalizable.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
