    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Generation of the Diene**\n\nThe starting material `5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene` is an unusual chemical. In the presence of sodium iodide (NaI) at elevated temperatures, compounds with geminal dibromides often undergo dehalogenation. While the exact mechanism for this specific substrate is not common, the context of the reaction (a double Diels-Alder reaction) strongly suggests that this reagent serves as a precursor to a reactive diene. A common and highly reactive diene used in such syntheses is **o-xylylene** (also known as o-quinodimethane). The problem is likely designed such that this complex starting material is recognized as a generator for o-xylylene. Two equivalents are used.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 1 (Double Diels-Alder Reaction)**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (a norbornadiene derivative). This molecule has two double bonds available for cycloaddition.\n*   **Diene:** o-xylylene (generated in situ).\n*   **Reaction:** Two successive [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloadditions occur, one at each double bond of the norbornadiene derivative. Each o-xylylene molecule adds to a double bond, forming a new six-membered ring fused to both the norbornane framework and a benzene ring. The resulting structure, **Product 1**, is a large, polycyclic molecule containing the tert-butoxy group at the C7 bridge.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 2 (Deprotection)**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄/H₂O).\n*   **Reaction:** The tert-butoxy group is an acid-sensitive protecting group for an alcohol. Aqueous acid protonates the ether oxygen, leading to the departure of a stable tert-butyl cation and formation of a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **Product 2** is the same as Product 1, but with the -O-tBu group replaced by an -OH group at the C7 bridge.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 3 (Oxidation)**\n\n*   **Reagent:** SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO (Parikh-Doering oxidation).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a mild method for oxidizing a secondary alcohol to a ketone. The secondary alcohol at C7 is oxidized to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **Product 3** is the ketone corresponding to the alcohol of Product 2.\n\n**Step 5: Formation of Product 4 (Thermolysis and Extrusion)**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Heat (150 °C).\n*   **Reaction:** Polycyclic ketones with a carbonyl group at a bridge, like the C7 position of a norbornane system, often undergo thermal extrusion of carbon monoxide (CO). This is a type of retro-cheletropic reaction. Upon losing the C=O group, a new covalent bond typically forms between the two carbons that were attached to the carbonyl bridge (C1 and C4 of the original norbornane core).\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a hydrocarbon with the formula C₂₂H₂₂. Its core structure is a **bicyclo[2.2.0]hexane** unit, to which two tetrahydronaphthalene moieties are fused.\n\n**Symmetry and Counting of Distinct Hydrogens in Product 4**\n\nTo find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the symmetry of Product 4.\n\n1.  The molecule possesses a **C₂ axis of symmetry**. This axis bisects the newly formed C1-C4 bond and rotates one half of the molecule (e.g., the part fused at the original C2-C3 positions) onto the other half (the part fused at the original C5-C6 positions).\n\n2.  Additionally, the flexible six-membered rings of the tetrahydronaphthalene units undergo rapid conformational inversion (like a chair flip) on the NMR timescale. This creates time-averaged higher symmetry for these specific parts of the molecule.\n\nLet's count the distinct sets of protons based on this C₂ symmetry and conformational averaging:\n\n*   **Set 1:** The two protons on the central bicyclo[2.2.0]hexane core at positions C1 and C4 are equivalent due to the C₂ rotation. (1 signal)\n*   **Set 2:** The protons at positions C2 and C6 of the core are equivalent. (1 signal)\n*   **Set 3:** The protons at positions C3 and C5 of the core are equivalent. This set is distinct from Set 2 due to their different positions relative to the fused rings. (1 signal)\n*   **Set 4:** The methylene protons (CH₂) of the tetrahydronaphthalene units adjacent to carbons C2 and C6. Due to rapid conformational flipping, the two protons on each of these CH₂ groups become equivalent on average. The C₂ axis makes the CH₂ at C2 equivalent to the one at C6. (1 signal)\n*   **Set 5:** The methylene protons (CH₂) of the tetrahydronaphthalene units adjacent to carbons C3 and C5. These are also averaged by flipping and are equivalent to each other by the C₂ axis. They are in a different chemical environment than those in Set 4. (1 signal)\n*   **Set 6 & 7:** The aromatic protons. Each benzene ring has 4 protons. Due to the chiral nature of the attached bicyclic system and conformational averaging, these 4 protons are resolved into two distinct sets of two protons each (an \"ortho-like\" pair and a \"meta-like\" pair). The C₂ axis makes the sets on one benzene ring equivalent to the corresponding sets on the other. (2 signals)\n\nTotaling these distinct sets: 1 (from C1/C4) + 1 (from C2/C6) + 1 (from C3/C5) + 1 (CH₂ at C2/C6) + 1 (CH₂ at C3/C5) + 2 (aromatic) = **7** distinct types of hydrogen atoms.\n\nThus, there are 7 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on the final product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
