    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Initial State of the Sun\n\nThe Sun produces neutrinos through several nuclear reaction pathways:\n*   **Proton-Proton (pp) I, II, and III chains**: These are the primary ways the sun produces energy. The pp-III chain specifically involves the decay of Boron-8 (⁸B), which creates a continuous spectrum of high-energy neutrinos (up to ~15 MeV). The pp-II chain produces mono-energetic (single-energy) neutrinos from the electron capture of Beryllium-7 (⁷Be) at 0.862 MeV (862 keV).\n*   **CNO cycle**: This cycle also produces neutrinos, but it contributes only about 1% to the Sun's energy production. Its neutrinos have a continuous energy spectrum.\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Hypothetical Scenario\n\nThe question states that the **pp-III branch suddenly stops**.\n*   The pp-III branch is the source of all **⁸B neutrinos**. Therefore, the flux of ⁸B neutrinos drops to zero.\n*   The question explicitly states that all other reactions, including the **pp-II branch**, continue as normal.\n*   This is crucial because the pp-II branch is the source of the **⁷Be neutrinos**.\n\nThe change happened about 8.5 minutes ago, which is the travel time for neutrinos from the Sun to Earth. This means we are observing the effects of this change right now.\n\n### 3. Examining the Neutrino Flux in the Two Energy Bands\n\nWe need to calculate the ratio of the neutrino flux in two specific energy bands after the pp-III branch has stopped. The flux is the number of neutrinos per cm² per second.\n\n*   **Band 1: 700 keV to 800 keV (0.7 MeV to 0.8 MeV)**\n*   **Band 2: 800 keV to 900 keV (0.8 MeV to 0.9 MeV)**\n\nLet's analyze the sources for each band in the new scenario:\n\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):**\n    *   This energy range contains the very strong, single-energy line of neutrinos from ⁷Be decay at **862 keV**.\n    *   Since the pp-II branch is unaffected, this intense source of neutrinos remains.\n    *   The total flux from ⁷Be neutrinos is immense, on the order of 5 x 10⁹ neutrinos/cm²/s. Because these are all at a single energy, this entire flux is effectively concentrated within this band.\n    *   There will also be a very small contribution from CNO cycle neutrinos, which have a continuous spectrum across this band.\n\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):**\n    *   Before the change, this band contained neutrinos from the continuous spectra of ⁸B and the CNO cycle.\n    *   After the change, the ⁸B neutrinos are **gone**.\n    *   The only remaining source of neutrinos in this band is from the **CNO cycle**.\n    *   The total flux from all CNO neutrinos is much smaller than the ⁷Be flux, at about 6.6 x 10⁸ neutrinos/cm²/s. This flux is spread out over a wide energy range (up to about 1.7 MeV). The fraction of this flux that falls within the narrow 100 keV window of Band 1 is very small.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Flux Ratio\n\nWe are asked for the ratio: **Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2)**\n\n*   **Numerator - Flux (Band 1):** This flux is very small. It consists only of a small slice of the continuous CNO neutrino spectrum.\n*   **Denominator - Flux (Band 2):** This flux is enormous. It is overwhelmingly dominated by the entire flux of the mono-energetic ⁷Be neutrinos.\n\nLet's compare the orders of magnitude:\n*   The flux density of CNO neutrinos in the relevant energy range is on the order of 10⁸ neutrinos/cm²/s/MeV. Integrated over the 0.1 MeV width of Band 1, this gives a flux of roughly 10⁷.\n*   The total flux of ⁷Be neutrinos in Band 2 is on the order of 10⁹ to 10¹⁰ neutrinos/cm²/s.\n\nTherefore, the ratio is approximately:\nRatio ≈ (Small CNO fraction) / (Large ⁷Be flux) ≈ 10⁷ / 10⁹ = 10⁻²\n\nThe flux in Band 2 is about 100 times larger than the flux in Band 1.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe ratio of the flux in the 700-800 keV band to the 800-900 keV band will be approximately 0.01 (or 10⁻²). The presence of the strong, single-energy ⁷Be neutrino line at 862 keV completely dominates the flux in the second band, while the first band is left with only a very small contribution from the CNO cycle after the ⁸B neutrinos disappear.\n\n<<<A>>>"
