    "In quantum mechanics, when adding angular momenta, the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This is expressed by the relationship between the magnetic quantum numbers: `m = m₁ + m₂`.\n\nIn this problem, the 2-electron system is in a coupled state described by the quantum numbers `l=2` and `m=-1`. This means the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is 2, and the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum is -1. The eigenvalue of the total orbital angular momentum in the z-direction, `Lz`, is `mħ = -1ħ`.\n\nA measurement of the individual orbital angular momentum components, `L₁z` and `L₂z`, is performed. We want to find the joint probability of obtaining the eigenvalues `-ħ` for both. This corresponds to the measurement outcome where the magnetic quantum number for the first electron is `m₁ = -1`, and for the second electron is `m₂ = -1`.\n\nFor this potential measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers would be:\n`m₁ + m₂ = (-1) + (-1) = -2`\n\nAccording to the rules of angular momentum coupling, the sum of the measured individual z-component quantum numbers (`m₁` and `m₂`) must be equal to the total z-component quantum number (`m`) of the system's state before the measurement.\n\nHere, the initial state has `m = -1`, while the measured outcome would correspond to a total `m` of `-2`. Since `-1 ≠ -2`, there is a contradiction. The state `|l=2, m=-1>` is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operator `Lz` with an eigenvalue of `-1ħ`. It is a linear combination of uncoupled states `|m₁, m₂>` where the condition `m₁ + m₂ = -1` is always met. The state `|m₁=-1, m₂=-1>` does not satisfy this condition and therefore has no contribution to the state `|l=2, m=-1>`.\n\nConsequently, the probability of measuring `m₁ = -1` and `m₂ = -1` simultaneously is zero.\n\n<<<D>>>"
