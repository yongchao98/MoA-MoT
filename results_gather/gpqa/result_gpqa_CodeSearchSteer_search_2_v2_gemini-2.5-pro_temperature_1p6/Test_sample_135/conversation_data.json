    "The problem asks to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of a specific vector field, `∇⋅f`, within a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.\n\nThe vector field is given as `f(r) = (1/r²) * r̂`, where `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction and `r` is the distance from the origin.\n\n**Method 1: Direct Calculation of the Divergence**\n\nThe divergence of a vector field in spherical coordinates is given by the formula:\n`∇⋅f = (1/r²) * ∂(r² * f_r)/∂r + ...` (angular terms)\n\nSince the field `f` is purely radial, its angular components are zero. The radial component is `f_r = 1/r²`.\nSubstituting this into the formula:\n`∇⋅f = (1/r²) * ∂(r² * (1/r²))/∂r = (1/r²) * ∂(1)/∂r = 0`\n\nThis calculation suggests the divergence is zero everywhere. If this were true for all points within the volume, the integral would be zero. However, the vector field `f` is undefined at the origin (r=0), creating a singularity. This means the standard divergence formula doesn't apply at this single point, and a more careful approach is needed. The divergence at the origin is actually infinite, represented by the Dirac delta function.\n\n**Method 2: Using the Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem)**\n\nThe Divergence Theorem provides a more robust way to solve this problem by relating the volume integral of the divergence to the flux of the field through the surface enclosing the volume. The theorem states:\n\n`∫_V (∇⋅f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ n̂) dS`\n\nWhere:\n*   `V` is the volume of the sphere of radius R.\n*   `S` is the spherical surface of radius R that bounds the volume.\n*   `n̂` is the outward-pointing unit normal vector to the surface `S`.\n\nLet's evaluate the surface integral (the right-hand side):\n1.  On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is constant and equal to `R`. So, the vector field on the surface is `f = (1/R²) * r̂`.\n2.  The outward unit normal vector `n̂` for a spherical surface is simply the radial unit vector `r̂`.\n3.  The dot product `f ⋅ n̂` is `((1/R²) * r̂) ⋅ r̂`. Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, this simplifies to `1/R²`.\n4.  The surface integral becomes `∮_S (1/R²) dS`.\n5.  Since `1/R²` is a constant over the entire surface, it can be taken outside the integral: `(1/R²) * ∮_S dS`.\n6.  The integral `∮_S dS` represents the total surface area of the sphere, which is `4πR²`.\n7.  Therefore, the value of the surface integral is `(1/R²) * (4πR²) = 4π`.\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to this result.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nEven though the divergence of the field is zero almost everywhere, the singularity at the origin creates a non-zero result for the volume integral. The Divergence Theorem correctly accounts for this singularity. The value of the integral is 4π.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 0\nC) 4π\nD) 4/3 π R\n\nThe most appropriate answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
