    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the decay probability.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Principle of Radioactive Decay\n\nRadioactive decay is a random, memoryless process. This \"memoryless\" property means that the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. Therefore, the fact that the atom has not decayed for 50 minutes has no impact on its future decay probability. We only need to calculate the probability of it decaying in any 150-minute period.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Decay Constant (λ)\n\nThe probability of a single nucleus surviving for a time *t* is given by the exponential decay law:\nP(survival) = e^(-λt)\n\nThe probability of it decaying within that time is:\nP(decay) = 1 - P(survival) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay is 32% (or 0.32) in 100 minutes. We can use this to find the decay constant, λ.\n\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)\n\nFirst, solve for e^(-λ * 100):\ne^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\nNow, solve for λ by taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\nln(e^(-λ * 100)) = ln(0.68)\n-100λ = ln(0.68)\nλ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Probability of Decay in the Next 150 Minutes\n\nNow we use the calculated decay constant (λ) to find the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150-minute interval.\n\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nSubstitute the expression for λ we found in the previous step:\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^([-ln(0.68) / 100] * 150)\n\nSimplify the exponent:\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(ln(0.68) * [150 / 100])\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(ln(0.68) * 1.5)\n\nUsing the logarithm property that e^(ln(x)) = x, we can rewrite the expression:\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - (e^ln(0.68))^1.5\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\nNow, calculate the final value:\n(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.558\nP(decay in 150 min) ≈ 1 - 0.558\nP(decay in 150 min) ≈ 0.442\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 0.442, or 44.2%. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
