    "To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the final product's 1H NMR spectrum, we must first deduce the structure of product 4 by following the described reaction sequence.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n    Acetic acid is treated with bromine (Br2) in the presence of pyridine and acetic anhydride. This reaction is an alpha-bromination of the carboxylic acid, yielding bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n    Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid. This is a Fischer esterification reaction, which converts the carboxylic acid to an ester. The product is ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n    Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an SN2 reaction to form ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n    Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane. This is a multi-step intramolecular cyclization known as the Thorpe-Ziegler reaction.\n    *   First, the strong base (NaH) deprotonates the carbon atom alpha to both the cyano and ester groups.\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in a nucleophilic substitution.\n    *   The excess NaH then deprotonates the alpha-carbon again.\n    *   The newly formed carbanion performs an intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain and displacing the second bromide ion to form a six-membered ring.\n    *   The final product, 4, is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.\n\nNow, we must determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals for this product. The phrase \"chemically distinct hydrogens\" implies that we should account for stereochemistry.\n\n*   **Chirality Analysis**: The central carbon of the substitution (C1) is attached to four different groups: a cyano group (-CN), an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3), and two different paths around the cyclohexane ring (C1-C2-C3... and C1-C6-C5...). This makes C1 a stereocenter, and therefore, the molecule is chiral.\n\n*   **Symmetry and NMR Signals**: A chiral molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Ring Protons**: Due to the absence of symmetry, all five methylene (CH2) groups on the cyclohexane ring (at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6) are in chemically different environments. Furthermore, within each of these CH2 groups, the two geminal protons are diastereotopic because they are in a chiral molecule. Protons that are diastereotopic are chemically non-equivalent and should, in principle, produce separate signals in an NMR spectrum. Thus, each of the five distinct CH2 groups will give rise to two signals, for a total of 5 x 2 = 10 signals from the ring protons.\n    *   **Ethyl Group Protons**: The ethyl group (-OCH2CH3) consists of a methylene group and a methyl group.\n        *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH3) group are equivalent due to rapid rotation around the C-C single bond and will produce a single signal.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene (-OCH2-) group are technically diastereotopic because of the adjacent chiral center (C1, connected through an oxygen atom). However, in the context of typical exam questions, the diastereotopic effect on protons separated from the chiral center by a heteroatom is often considered negligible and they are counted as a single signal. Following this common simplification, the methylene group gives one signal.\n        *   Therefore, the ethyl group contributes 1 (for -CH2-) + 1 (for -CH3-) = 2 signals.\n\n*   **Total Signals**: Combining the signals from the ring and the ethyl group, the total number of distinct hydrogen signals is 10 (from the ring) + 2 (from the ethyl group) = 12.\n\n<<<B>>>"
