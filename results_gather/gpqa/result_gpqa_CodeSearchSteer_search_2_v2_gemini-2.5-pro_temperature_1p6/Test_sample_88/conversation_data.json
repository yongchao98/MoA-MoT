    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of product 3 and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded proton.\n\n### **Step 1: Identifying Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with an excess of a strong base (KOH) at a high temperature (240°C).\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction is a known, albeit complex, transformation. The high temperature and strong base conditions with a hindered substrate like 1,3-dibromoadamantane favor rearrangement reactions over simple substitution or elimination. This reaction is known in the literature to produce **protoadamantan-4-one**.\n*   **Product 1:** Protoadamantan-4-one (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]decan-4-one).\n*   **Note on provided spectra:** The IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ is consistent with a strained ketone like protoadamantan-4-one. However, the provided ¹H NMR data (especially the signal at 4.79 ppm) does not match the known spectrum for this compound and might be a red herring or an error in the problem description. We will proceed based on the established chemical transformations.\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (protoadamantan-4-one) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which reduces ketones to alcohols. However, the reaction mixture is heated, which facilitates a secondary reaction. The initial product, protoadamantan-4-ol, is a strained alcohol that readily undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) under heat to form a more stable alkene. This elimination reaction is driven by the relief of strain.\n*   **Product 2:** Protoadamantene (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene). The formation of an alkene is crucial for the next step.\n\n### **Step 3: Identifying Product 3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (protoadamantene) is treated with ozone (O₃) at low temperature, followed by dimethylsulfide ((CH₃)₂S).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an ozonolysis reaction with a reductive workup (using DMS). Ozonolysis cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds and, after reductive workup, replaces them with two carbonyl groups. The cleavage of the C=C bond in the protoadamantene cage structure results in a ring-opening that forms a bicyclic diketone.\n*   **Product 3:** The ozonolysis of protoadamantene yields **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyzing the ¹H NMR Spectrum of Product 3**\n\n*   **Structure:** Product 3 is bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione. This molecule is highly symmetric (C₂v symmetry) and exists predominantly in a rigid dual chair-chair conformation.\n*   **Identifying the Most Deshielded Proton:** The most deshielded protons in a molecule are typically those closest to electronegative atoms like oxygen. In this molecule, we have protons alpha to the carbonyl groups (on C2, C4, C6, C8) and protons beta to the carbonyl groups (the bridgehead protons on C1 and C5). In similar caged ketone systems like adamantanone, the bridgehead protons (beta to the carbonyl) are often more deshielded than the alpha-protons. In bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dione, the bridgehead protons are beta to *two* carbonyl groups, which will strongly deshield them. Therefore, the bridgehead protons (H1 and H5) are the most deshielded protons that do not exchange with deuterated solvent. Due to symmetry, H1 and H5 are chemically and magnetically equivalent.\n*   **Determining the Coupling Pattern of the Bridgehead Proton (H1):**\n    1.  We need to identify the neighboring protons that H1 will couple with. H1 is connected to C2, C8, and C9.\n    2.  H1 couples to the two protons on C2 (H2ax and H2eq) and the two protons on C8 (H8ax and H8eq).\n    3.  Due to the molecule's C₂v symmetry, the coupling constant between H1 and H2ax is identical to the coupling constant between H1 and H8ax (J₁).\n    4.  Similarly, the coupling constant between H1 and H2eq is identical to the coupling constant between H1 and H8eq (J₂).\n    5.  Therefore, H1 is coupled to a set of two equivalent protons (H2ax, H8ax) and another set of two equivalent protons (H2eq, H8eq).\n    6.  Coupling to two equivalent protons gives a triplet. Thus, H1 is split into a triplet by (H2ax, H8ax) and is further split into another triplet by (H2eq, H8eq).\n    7.  The resulting pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.\n    8.  (Note: Coupling may also occur with the C9 protons, but these couplings are often smaller and may not be resolved, or are ignored for clarity in this context. The major, resolved coupling will be the triplet of triplets.)\n\nThe most deshielded non-exchangeable proton is the bridgehead proton, which is split into a triplet of triplets by the four neighboring alpha-protons.\n\n<<<B>>>"
