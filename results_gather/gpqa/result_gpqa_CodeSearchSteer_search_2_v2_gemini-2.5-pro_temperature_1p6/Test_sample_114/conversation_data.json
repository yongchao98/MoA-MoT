    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the angle between the two photons produced in the electron-positron annihilation.\n\n### 1. Conservation of Energy and Momentum\nThe fundamental principles governing this interaction are the conservation of total energy and total momentum. In an electron-positron annihilation, an electron and a positron collide and are converted into energetic photons.\n\n*   **Electron (e⁻):** Moves from the left with a Lorentz factor (γe) of 4.\n*   **Positron (e⁺):** Moves from the right with a Lorentz factor (γp) of 2.\n\n### 2. Calculation of Initial Energy\nThe energy of a relativistic particle is given by the formula E = γmc², where 'm' is the rest mass of the particle (me for both electron and positron), 'c' is the speed of light, and 'γ' is the Lorentz factor.\n\n*   **Energy of the electron (Ee):**\n    Ee = γe * me * c² = 4mec²\n*   **Energy of the positron (Ep):**\n    Ep = γp * me * c² = 2mec²\n*   **Total initial energy (E_initial):**\n    E_initial = Ee + Ep = 4mec² + 2mec² = 6mec²\n\n### 3. Calculation of Initial Momentum\nThe momentum of a relativistic particle is p = γmv. We first need to find the velocities (v) from the Lorentz factors. The relationship is γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\n*   **Velocity of the electron (ve):**\n    4 = 1 / √(1 - ve²/c²)\n    16 = 1 / (1 - ve²/c²)\n    1 - ve²/c² = 1/16\n    ve²/c² = 15/16\n    ve = (√15 / 4)c\n*   **Momentum of the electron (pe):**\n    pe = γe * me * ve = 4 * me * (√15 / 4)c = √15mec (in the positive x-direction)\n\n*   **Velocity of the positron (vp):**\n    The positron moves from the right, so its velocity is in the negative direction.\n    2 = 1 / √(1 - vp²/c²)\n    4 = 1 / (1 - vp²/c²)\n    1 - vp²/c² = 1/4\n    vp²/c² = 3/4\n    vp = -(√3 / 2)c\n*   **Momentum of the positron (pp):**\n    pp = γp * me * vp = 2 * me * -(√3 / 2)c = -√3mec (in the negative x-direction)\n\n*   **Total initial momentum (p_initial):**\n    Since the motion is along the horizontal axis, we only consider the x-component.\n    p_initial = pe + pp = (√15 - √3)mec\n\n### 4. Analysis of the Final State (Photons)\nAfter annihilation, two photons with equal energy are produced.\n\n*   **Energy of the photons:**\n    From the conservation of energy, the total initial energy equals the total final energy.\n    E_initial = E_photon1 + E_photon2\n    6mec² = 2 * E_photon\n    E_photon = 3mec² (This is the energy of each photon).\n\n*   **Momentum of the photons:**\n    The momentum of a photon is p = E/c.\n    p_photon = (3mec²) / c = 3mec\n\nThe problem states one photon moves to the upper-right and the other to the lower-right. Due to the conservation of momentum in the vertical (y) direction (which was initially zero), the photons must be emitted at equal and opposite angles (θ and -θ) to the horizontal axis.\n\n### 5. Applying Conservation of Momentum to Find the Angle\nThe total final momentum must equal the total initial momentum.\n\n*   **Final momentum in the x-direction (p_final_x):**\n    The x-component of each photon's momentum is p_photon * cos(θ).\n    p_final_x = p_photon * cos(θ) + p_photon * cos(-θ) = 2 * p_photon * cos(θ)\n    p_final_x = 2 * (3mec) * cos(θ) = 6mec * cos(θ)\n\n*   **Equating initial and final momentum:**\n    p_initial = p_final_x\n    (√15 - √3)mec = 6mec * cos(θ)\n\n*   **Solving for the angle θ:**\n    cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\n    Using the approximate values √15 ≈ 3.873 and √3 ≈ 1.732:\n    cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 = 2.141 / 6 ≈ 0.3568\n    θ = arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69.1°\n\n### 6. Finding the Angle Between the Photons\nThe question asks for the total angle between the two photons, which is 2θ.\n\n*   **Total Angle:**\n    Angle = 2 * θ ≈ 2 * 69.1° ≈ 138.2°\n\nThis value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
