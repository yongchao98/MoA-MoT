    "Spontaneously broken symmetry results in the emergence of massless particles known as Goldstone bosons (or Nambu-Goldstone bosons). Examining each option reveals its connection to this phenomenon.\n\n*   **A) Magnon:** In magnets, the rotational symmetry of spin is spontaneously broken when the material becomes ferromagnetic, with spins aligning in a particular direction. The resulting Goldstone bosons are magnons, which are quantized spin waves.\n*   **B) Pion:** Pions are understood in quantum chromodynamics as the pseudo-Goldstone bosons that arise from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. They are not perfectly massless because chiral symmetry is also explicitly broken, but they are significantly lighter than other mesons.\n*   **D) Phonon:** In a crystalline solid, the continuous translational symmetry of free space is broken because the atoms are fixed in a lattice. The Goldstone bosons associated with this broken symmetry are phonons, which are quantized lattice vibrations.\n\nIn contrast, a **Skyrmion** is not a Goldstone boson. It is a topologically protected, particle-like excitation. While skyrmions arise in systems where symmetries are broken, their existence and stability are due to their topological properties, not a direct consequence of the Goldstone theorem in the same way as magnons, pions, and phonons.\n\n<<<C>>>"
