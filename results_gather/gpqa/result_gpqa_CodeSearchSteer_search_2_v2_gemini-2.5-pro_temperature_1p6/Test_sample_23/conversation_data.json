    "Based on a logical deduction from the problem statement and verification with established chemical principles, the solution is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance Z:** The problem states Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. This percentage corresponds to the general formula for cycloalkanes, (CnH2n), as the mass ratio of hydrogen to carbon is 2:12, or 1:6, making the hydrogen mass fraction 1/(1+6) = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. Given that Z is a widely used solvent and the final product of hydrogenation, **cyclohexane (C6H12)** is the most logical candidate.\n\n2.  **Identify Mixture Y:** Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from X. It does not decolorize bromine water, indicating it is composed of saturated compounds or aromatic compounds, which are unreactive with bromine water under these conditions. Z (cyclohexane) is one component of Y. Hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. If Y consists of cyclohexane and another compound, this second compound must also convert to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. **Benzene (C6H6)** fits this description perfectly. Benzene is a liquid, does not react with bromine water, and its hydrogenation yields cyclohexane. Therefore, Mixture **Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n3.  **Identify Mixture X:** Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, meaning its components are unsaturated. The problem also specifies that there are no conjugated multiple bonds. When heated with platinum, X undergoes disproportionation to form Y (cyclohexane and benzene). This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. For the reaction to be stoichiometrically balanced (equimolar X to equimolar Y), the total number of atoms must be conserved.\n    *   **Reactants:** A + B (from Mixture X)\n    *   **Products:** Cyclohexane (C6H12) + Benzene (C6H6) (from Mixture Y)\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms in the products is 12 + 6 = 18. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two molecules from mixture X must also be 18.\n    *   Since hydrogenation of X leads to cyclohexane (a C6 ring), the components of X must also be C6 molecules. Let them be C6Hx and C6Hy.\n    *   This gives the equation x + y = 18.\n    *   Both components must be unsaturated (decolorize bromine water), so x and y must be less than 12 (the number of hydrogens in the saturated cyclohexane). The only pair of even integers for x and y that satisfies these conditions is 8 and 10.\n    *   Thus, the components of X are C6H8 and C6H10.\n    *   C6H10 is **cyclohexene**. It has one double bond and thus no conjugated system.\n    *   C6H8 is a cyclohexadiene. To satisfy the \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" condition, it must be **1,4-cyclohexadiene**, not 1,3-cyclohexadiene.\n    *   The disproportionation reaction is: C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) + C6H10 (cyclohexene) → C6H6 (benzene) + C6H12 (cyclohexane). In this reaction, 1,4-cyclohexadiene acts as a hydrogen donor to become benzene, and cyclohexene acts as a hydrogen acceptor to become cyclohexane. This type of reaction is known to occur over platinum catalysts.\n    *   Therefore, Mixture **X consists of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**. Both are liquids at standard conditions and decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of both cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene produces only cyclohexane.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms:** The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Hydrogen atoms in cyclohexene (C6H10) = 10\n    *   Hydrogen atoms in 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) = 8\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
