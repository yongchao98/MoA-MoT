    "To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X, its mass must be greater than or equal to the sum of the masses of its decay products. The interaction Lagrangian indicates that the boson X decays into a fermion-antifermion pair ($X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$). Therefore, the condition for a decay to be kinematically allowed is:\n\n$m_{X} \\ge 2 \\cdot m_{f}$\n\nGiven that the mass of the boson X is $m_{X} = 6$ GeV, a decay into a fermion-antifermion pair is possible only if the mass of the fermion $m_{f}$ is less than or equal to 3 GeV.\n\nLet's examine the masses of the fundamental fermions (leptons and quarks) to see which ones satisfy this condition.\n\n### Lepton Masses:\n*   **Electron ($e$):** The mass of an electron is approximately 0.511 MeV/c². The combined mass of an electron-positron pair ($e^{+}e^{-}$) is about 1.022 MeV/c², which is significantly less than 6 GeV/c². Thus, the decay $X \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$ is allowed.\n*   **Muon ($\\mu$):** The mass of a muon is about 105.7 MeV/c². The combined mass of a muon-antimuon pair ($\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$) is about 211.4 MeV/c², well below 6 GeV/c². This decay is allowed.\n*   **Tau ($\\tau$):** The mass of a tau lepton is approximately 1.777 GeV/c² (or 1777 MeV/c²). The total mass of a tau-antitau pair ($\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$) is about 3.554 GeV/c², which is less than 6 GeV/c². Therefore, this decay channel is also kinematically allowed.\n\n### Quark Masses:\nThe determination of quark masses is more complex due to color confinement. For high-energy processes like particle decay, we use the current quark masses.\n\n*   **Up ($u$), Down ($d$), and Strange ($s$) quarks:** These are the \"light\" quarks with masses in the MeV/c² range (~2.2 MeV/c² for up, ~4.7 MeV/c² for down, and ~95 MeV/c² for strange). The combined mass of $u\\bar{u}$, $d\\bar{d}$, and $s\\bar{s}$ pairs are all well below the 6 GeV/c² threshold, making these decays allowed.\n*   **Charm ($c$) quark:** The mass of the charm quark is approximately 1.27 GeV/c². A charm-anticharm ($c\\bar{c}$) pair has a total mass of about 2.54 GeV/c². Since this is less than 6 GeV/c², the decay $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$ is kinematically allowed.\n*   **Bottom ($b$) quark:** The mass of the bottom quark is about 4.18 GeV/c². The combined mass of a bottom-antibottom ($b\\bar{b}$) pair is roughly 8.36 GeV/c². This is greater than the 6 GeV/c² mass of the X boson, so the decay $X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ is **kinematically forbidden**.\n*   **Top ($t$) quark:** The top quark is the most massive fundamental particle, with a mass of about 173 GeV/c². The decay into a top-antitop pair is far beyond the kinematic limit.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on this analysis, the boson X can decay into the following fermion-antifermion pairs:\n*   $e^{+}e^{-}$\n*   $\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$\n*   $\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$\n*   $u\\bar{u}$\n*   $d\\bar{d}$\n*   $s\\bar{s}$\n*   $c\\bar{c}$\n\nThe decay channels involving bottom ($b\\bar{b}$) and top ($t\\bar{t}$) quarks are forbidden because their combined masses exceed the mass of the X boson.\n\nComparing this list with the given options:\n*   A) Includes the forbidden $b\\bar{b}$ and omits the allowed $c\\bar{c}$ and $\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$.\n*   B) Includes the forbidden $b\\bar{b}$ and omits the allowed $c\\bar{c}$.\n*   C) Includes the forbidden $t\\bar{t}$.\n*   D) $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c},s\\bar{s},u\\bar{u},d\\bar{d},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}$. This option correctly lists all the kinematically allowed decays into quarks and charged leptons, while excluding the forbidden ones.\n\n<<<D>>>"
