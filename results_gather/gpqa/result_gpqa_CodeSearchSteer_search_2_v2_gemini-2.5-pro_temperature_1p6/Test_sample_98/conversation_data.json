  "question": "You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. A strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens.

    "The provided analytical data will be used to determine the correct structure from the four options.\n\n### 1. FTIR Spectrum Analysis\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadness is a result of intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, which is also a key feature of a carboxylic acid.\n\nConclusion from FTIR: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible options (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid group, so this data is consistent with all choices.\n\n### 2. ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis\nThe key to identifying the correct structure lies in analyzing the complex splitting patterns described. The absence of vinyl-hydrogen signals confirms that there are no C=C double bonds, which is consistent with all four structures.\n\nA splitting pattern arises from the magnetic influence of non-equivalent protons on neighboring carbon atoms. A complex multiplet like a \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" (dtq) or a \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" (dtt) occurs when a proton is coupled to multiple, different sets of neighboring protons.\n\n*   **Doublet of Triplets of Quartets (dtq):** A proton showing this signal is split by three different neighboring groups:\n    *   One neighboring proton (giving a doublet)\n    *   A group of two equivalent protons (giving a triplet)\n    *   A group of three equivalent protons (giving a quartet)\n*   **Doublet of Triplets of Triplets (dtt):** A proton showing this signal is also split by three different neighboring groups:\n    *   One neighboring proton (giving a doublet)\n    *   A group of two equivalent protons (giving a triplet)\n    *   Another, different group of two equivalent protons (giving a second triplet)\n\n### 3. Structural Analysis of Candidates\n\nLet's analyze the proton environments in each proposed structure to see which one would produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is adjacent to the C2-H (1H), the C3-CH₃ (3H), and the C4-CH₂ (2H). This would result in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule is adjacent to one proton and two different sets of two protons. Therefore, a `dtt` signal is not expected.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is adjacent to the C4-H (1H), the C3-CH₃ (3H), and the C2-CH₂ (2H). This would result in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   Similar to option A, there is no proton environment that would lead to a `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n    Let's draw the structure and label the key protons:\n    ```\n          Et   Et\n          |    |\n    CH₃ - CH - CH - CH₂ - COOH\n          H₄   H₃\n    ```\n    *   **Proton H₃:** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   H₄ (1 neighbor → doublet)\n        *   The adjacent -CH₂- group at C2 (2 neighbors → triplet)\n        *   The -CH₂- group of its own ethyl substituent (2 neighbors → triplet)\n        This combination perfectly creates a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   **Proton H₄:** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   H₃ (1 neighbor → doublet)\n        *   The terminal -CH₃ group at C5 (3 neighbors → quartet)\n        *   The -CH₂- group of its own ethyl substituent (2 neighbors → triplet)\n        This combination creates a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n\n    This structure is the only one that accounts for both of the complex splitting patterns observed in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid):**\n    *   The proton at C3 is adjacent to H2 (1H), the C4-CH₂ group of the main chain (2H), and the -CH₂- group of its ethyl substituent (2H). This would produce a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   However, analyzing the other protons reveals none that would give a clear `dtq` signal. Other protons would be doublets of triplets or more complex multiplets, but the specific `dtq` pattern is not readily apparent.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe compound that matches all the spectroscopic data is 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, as it is the only structure with protons that would exhibit both a doublet of triplets of triplets (`dtt`) and a doublet of triplets of quartets (`dtq`). This corresponds to formula C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
