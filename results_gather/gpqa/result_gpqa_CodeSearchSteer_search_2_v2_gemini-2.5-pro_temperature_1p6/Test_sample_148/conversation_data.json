    "Here is an analysis of the provided data and options:\n\n**Analysis of Observations**\n*   **Â¹H NMR Data**: The presence of two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, which together integrate to the expected value of one proton, is a key observation. Because spin-spin coupling has been ruled out, this strongly suggests the presence of two different, but very similar, chemical species in the sample. The roughly equal integrals indicate that these two species are present in an approximately 1:1 ratio.\n*   **LC-MS Data**: The liquid chromatography (LC) results show two separable peaks, confirming the presence of two distinct compounds. The mass spectrometry (MS) data is crucial: both peaks give the same mass spectrum, which corresponds to the target molecule. This proves that the two species are isomers (they have the same chemical formula and thus the same mass) and not an impurity like a precursor, which would almost certainly have a different mass.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options**\n*   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor**: This is inconsistent with the MS data, as a precursor would have a different molecular weight and mass spectrum.\n*   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**: This explanation fits all the observations perfectly.\n    *   **Definition**: Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in the 3D arrangement of their atoms at one or more (but not all) chiral centers.\n    *   **NMR**: Diastereoisomers are chemically distinct and are expected to have different NMR spectra, including different chemical shifts for corresponding protons. It is common for these differences to be small, resulting in duplicate peaks with similar chemical shifts.\n    *   **LC-MS**: Because they have different physical properties, diastereoisomers can be separated by standard chromatographic techniques like reversed-phase LC. Since they are isomers, they have the same mass and would produce identical mass spectra.\n    *   **Formation**: A 1:1 mixture of diastereoisomers can easily be formed during a chemical synthesis if one of the chiral starting materials was used as a racemic (1:1) mixture while other chiral centers in the molecule were stereochemically pure. Another common source of diastereomerism in peptides is **atropisomerism**, which is hindered rotation around a single bond (like a sterically bulky amide bond), creating stable, separable conformers known as rotamers or atropisomers. These rotamers are in a diastereomeric relationship to one another and give rise to separate peaks in both NMR and LC.\n*   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction**: This term usually refers to a procedural step to ensure a reaction goes to completion. It does not describe a specific, stable isomeric product that would be isolable. Side products formed during coupling would typically have a different mass than the desired product.\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**: Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they would not produce separate peaks in a standard NMR experiment or on a standard (achiral) LC column. They would appear as a single substance. To separate them, a chiral LC column or a chiral resolving agent in the NMR is required.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe observation of two isomers with the same mass that are separable by LC and distinguishable by NMR points directly to the presence of diastereomers.\n\n<<<B>>>"
