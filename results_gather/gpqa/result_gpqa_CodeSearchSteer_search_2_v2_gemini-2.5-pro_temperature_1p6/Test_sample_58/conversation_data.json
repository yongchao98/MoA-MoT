    "Here is a step-by-step determination of the pH of the final solution.\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial moles of acid and base species.**\n    *   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n        Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol CH3COOH\n    *   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n        Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol HCl\n        Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.080 moles of H⁺ ions.\n    *   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)₂), a strong base:**\n        Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol Ba(OH)₂\n        Since Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, it dissociates completely to yield two hydroxide ions per formula unit: Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻.\n        Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol OH⁻.\n\n2.  **Account for the neutralization reactions.**\n    The strong base (OH⁻) will first neutralize the strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) and then the weak acid (CH3COOH). We can sum the total moles of protons that will react with the strong base.\n    *   Total moles of acidic protons = Moles of H⁺ (from HCl) + Moles of CH3COOH\n    *   Total moles of acidic protons = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = 0.130 mol\n\n    Now, compare the total moles of acidic protons with the total moles of hydroxide ions.\n    *   Total moles of OH⁻ = 0.180 mol\n    *   Total moles of acidic protons = 0.130 mol\n\n    Since there are more moles of OH⁻ than acidic protons, the base is in excess.\n\n3.  **Calculate the moles of excess hydroxide ions.**\n    *   Excess moles of OH⁻ = Total OH⁻ - Total acidic protons\n    *   Excess moles of OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = 0.050 mol\n\n4.  **Calculate the final concentration of the excess hydroxide ions.**\n    *   Total volume of the mixed solution = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n    *   Concentration of OH⁻, [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n5.  **Calculate the pOH and pH of the solution.**\n    *   The pOH is the negative logarithm of the hydroxide ion concentration.\n        pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n    *   The pH is related to the pOH by the equation: pH + pOH = 14.\n        pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nTherefore, the pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>"
