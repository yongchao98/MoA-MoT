    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction series to determine the final product E and the number of signals in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n**Reaction Analysis**\n\n1.  **Propionaldehyde + EDT / BF3 → A:** This reaction forms a cyclic thioacetal. Propionaldehyde (CH₃CH₂CHO) reacts with 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT, HSCH₂CH₂SH) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst (BF₃) to protect the aldehyde group. The product, A, is 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n\n2.  **A + BuLi → B:** Butyllithium (BuLi) is a strong base that deprotonates the most acidic proton in compound A. The proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms (C2) is acidic, and its removal creates a stabilized carbanion. Product B is the lithium salt of 2-ethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n\n3.  **B + Bromoethane → C:** The carbanion of B acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon of bromoethane (CH₃CH₂Br) in an alkylation reaction. This adds a second ethyl group to the C2 position. Product C is 2,2-diethyl-1,3-dithiane.\n\n4.  **C + HgCl₂ / H₂O / H⁺ → D:** This step is the deprotection of the thioacetal group using mercuric chloride (HgCl₂) in the presence of water and acid. This process regenerates the carbonyl group. Product D is the ketone formed from the carbon that was part of the dithiane ring, which is now bonded to two ethyl groups. Thus, D is 3-pentanone (diethyl ketone).\n\n5.  **D + PPh₃ / 3-bromopentane / BuLi → E:** This is a Wittig reaction, a method for synthesizing alkenes.\n    *   First, the Wittig reagent (ylide) is prepared. Triphenylphosphine (PPh₃) reacts with 3-bromopentane to form a phosphonium salt. A strong base, BuLi, then deprotonates the carbon adjacent to the phosphorus, forming the phosphorus ylide: (CH₃CH₂)₂C=P(C₆H₅)₃.\n    *   Next, this ylide reacts with the ketone from the previous step, D (3-pentanone, (CH₃CH₂)₂C=O). The oxygen atom of the ketone and the P(C₆H₅)₃ group of the ylide are exchanged.\n    *   The final product, E, is formed by creating a double bond between the carbonyl carbon of 3-pentanone and the carbanionic carbon of the ylide.\n\n**Final Product Structure and 13C-NMR Analysis**\n\nThe reaction between 3-pentanone and the ylide from 3-bromopentane results in the formation of **3,4-diethylhex-3-ene**.\n\nThe structure of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene is:\n\n```\n      CH₃-CH₂     CH₂-CH₃\n              \\   /\n               C=C\n              /   \\\n      CH₃-CH₂     CH₂-CH₃\n```\n\nTo determine the number of 13C-NMR signals, we must identify the number of unique carbon environments in the molecule. Due to the high degree of symmetry in 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene, several carbon atoms are chemically equivalent.\n\nThe molecule has a C₂ axis of symmetry perpendicular to the central carbon-carbon double bond, as well as a plane of symmetry through the double bond. This symmetry makes the carbons in the four ethyl groups equivalent.\n\nWe can classify the carbon atoms into three distinct groups:\n1.  **Alkene Carbons (C=C):** The two sp² hybridized carbons forming the double bond are in identical chemical environments. This will produce one signal.\n2.  **Methylene Carbons (-CH₂-):** The four methylene (CH₂) carbons of the ethyl groups are all equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. Each is an sp³ carbon attached to an equivalent sp² carbon. This will produce a second signal.\n3.  **Methyl Carbons (-CH₃):** The four terminal methyl (CH₃) carbons of the ethyl groups are also equivalent. Each is part of an ethyl group that is attached to an equivalent sp² carbon. This will produce a third signal.\n\nTherefore, despite having a total of 10 carbon atoms, the high symmetry of 3,4-diethylhex-3-ene results in only **3** unique signals in its 13C-NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
