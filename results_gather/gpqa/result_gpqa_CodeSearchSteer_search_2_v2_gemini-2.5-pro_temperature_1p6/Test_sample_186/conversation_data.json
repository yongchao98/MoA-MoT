    "To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph on a VLT telescope, we must evaluate each star's visibility from the Paranal Observatory and whether its brightness allows for the required signal-to-noise ratio.\n\n### Key Detection Criteria:\n\n1.  **Observability from Paranal:** The Paranal Observatory is located in the Atacama Desert in Chile, at a latitude of approximately 24.6 degrees South. This location dictates which stars are visible in the sky. An object's declination (celestial latitude) is the primary factor; stars with very high northern declinations are not visible from the Southern Hemisphere.\n2.  **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** A star's apparent magnitude is its brightness as seen from Earth. The fainter a star, the higher its magnitude. ESPRESSO can detect faint objects, but there is a limit.\n3.  **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (S/N):** The problem states a star is \"detectable\" if an S/N of at least 10 is achieved in a one-hour exposure. According to the official ESPRESSO Exposure Time Calculator documentation, an S/N of 10 for a one-hour observation corresponds to a limiting apparent magnitude of approximately V = 19.\n\n### Analysis of Each Star:\n\n**a) Canopus:**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** Canopus is the second-brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent visual magnitude of about -0.74.\n*   **Declination:** Its declination is approximately -52° 41'.\n*   **Detectability:** Being a very bright southern star, Canopus is easily observable from Paranal. Its magnitude of -0.74 is significantly brighter than the V=19 limit. **Canopus is detectable.** In fact, it is so bright it would likely be used as a reference or guide star rather than a primary science target for such a long exposure.\n\n**b) Polaris:**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude:** Polaris has an apparent magnitude of about 2.0.\n*   **Declination:** Its declination is almost +89° 16', placing it very close to the North Celestial Pole.\n*   **Detectability:** As the North Star, Polaris is not visible from the Southern Hemisphere. The Paranal Observatory at -24.6° latitude cannot observe it. **Polaris is not detectable from Paranal.**\n\n**c) Star with M_V = 15 at 10 pc:**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** Using the distance modulus formula, m_V = M_V + 5*log10(d) - 5, where M_V=15 and d=10 pc.\n    m_V = 15 + 5*log10(10) - 5 = 15 + 5(1) - 5 = 15.\n*   **Declination:** The star is at DEC = 0°, the celestial equator, which is ideally placed for observation from Paranal.\n*   **Detectability:** With an apparent magnitude of 15, which is brighter than the V=19 limit, this star is easily within reach of ESPRESSO. **This star is detectable.**\n\n**d) Star with M_V = 15 at 200 pc:**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** m_V = 15 + 5*log10(200) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5(2.3) - 5 = 15 + 11.5 - 5 = 21.5.\n*   **Declination:** DEC = 0°, so it is observable.\n*   **Detectability:** An apparent magnitude of 21.5 is fainter than the V=19 limit for achieving the required S/N in one hour. **This star is not detectable under the specified conditions.**\n\n**e) Star with M_V = 15 at 5 pc:**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** m_V = 15 + 5*log10(5) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5(0.7) - 5 = 15 + 3.5 - 5 = 13.5.\n*   **Declination:** DEC = 0°, so it is observable.\n*   **Detectability:** With an apparent magnitude of 13.5, this star is well within the detection limit of V=19. **This star is detectable.**\n\n**f) Star with M_V = 15 at 50 pc:**\n*   **Apparent Magnitude (m_V):** m_V = 15 + 5*log10(50) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5(1.7) - 5 = 15 + 8.5 - 5 = 18.5.\n*   **Declination:** DEC = 0°, so it is observable.\n*   **Detectability:** The apparent magnitude of 18.5 is brighter than the V=19 limit. **This star is detectable.**\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis, the following stars are detectable:\n1.  **Canopus**\n2.  **Star (c)** (m_V = 15)\n3.  **Star (e)** (m_V = 13.5)\n4.  **Star (f)** (m_V = 18.5)\n\nThis gives a total of 4 detectable stars.\n\n<<<C>>>"
