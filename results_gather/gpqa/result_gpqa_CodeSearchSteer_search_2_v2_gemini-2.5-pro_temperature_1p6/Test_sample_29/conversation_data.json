    "To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we must first find the color of the light it emits. The relationship between the energy of a photon and its wavelength is the key to identifying its color.\n\nFirst, calculate the wavelength (λ) of the emitted light using the given energy (E) of 2.3393 eV. The formula for this conversion is:\n\nλ (nm) = 1240 / E (eV)\n\nPlugging in the given energy:\n\nλ = 1240 / 2.3393 eV ≈ 530.07 nm\n\nNext, we identify the color corresponding to a wavelength of approximately 530 nm by looking at the visible light spectrum. Wavelengths in the range of 495–570 nm are perceived as green. Therefore, the textile dye emits green light.\n\nWhen a substance appears to be a certain color, it is because it is reflecting or emitting those wavelengths of light. The colors that are *absorbed* are the complementary colors to the ones we see. The complementary color of green is red (or magenta). When an object absorbs light in the red portion of the spectrum, the remaining light that is reflected or transmitted appears green.\n\nTherefore, the organic compound absorbs red light.\n\n<<<A>>>"
