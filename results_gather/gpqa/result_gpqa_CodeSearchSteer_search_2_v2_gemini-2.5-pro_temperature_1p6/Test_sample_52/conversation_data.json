    "To identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, the information from the FTIR and ¹H NMR spectra must be systematically analyzed.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   **FTIR:** An absorption peak for an ester group (-COO-) is present.\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This indicates a benzene ring with two substituents, having the base formula -C₆H₄-.\n    *   **¹H NMR - Aromatic Protons:** There are two signals for aromatic hydrogens. A di-substituted benzene ring with two aromatic signals strongly suggests a *para* (1,4) substitution pattern. This arrangement results in two sets of chemically equivalent protons, leading to two signals.\n    *   **¹H NMR - Vinyl Protons:** There are two signals for vinyl hydrogens (-CH=CH-). One signal is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). The vinyl proton adjacent to the ring is split into a doublet by the other vinyl proton. This second vinyl proton is split into a doublet by the first vinyl proton and into a quartet by the three protons of the adjacent methyl group, resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n    *   **¹H NMR - Methyl Protons:** There are two signals for methyl (-CH₃) groups. One of these is part of the propenyl group. The second methyl group must be part of the ester, as no other molecular fragments are indicated.\n    *   **¹H NMR - Methylene Protons:** Crucially, there are no signals for methylene (-CH₂-) groups. This rules out substituents like ethyl (-CH₂CH₃) or longer alkyl chains.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   The core is a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₄).\n    *   One substituent is a propenyl group (-CH=CHCH₃), which has a formula of C₃H₅ when attached to the ring.\n    *   The other substituent is an ester that contains a methyl group and no methylene groups. This leaves two possibilities for the ester group: a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃).\n\n3.  **Determine the Chemical Formula:**\n    Let's calculate the molecular formula for the two possible structures:\n    *   **Structure 1:** Methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate. This consists of the benzene ring (C₆H₄), the propenyl group (C₃H₅), and the methyl ester group (-COOCH₃, which contributes C₂H₃O₂).\n        *   Carbons: 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n        *   Hydrogens: 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n        *   Oxygens: 2\n        *   The formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n    *   **Structure 2:** 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)phenyl acetate. This consists of the benzene ring (C₆H₄), the propenyl group (C₃H₅), and the acetate group (-OCOCH₃, which contributes C₂H₃O₂).\n        *   Carbons: 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n        *   Hydrogens: 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n        *   Oxygens: 2\n        *   The formula is also **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\nBoth plausible structures derived from the spectral data correspond to the same chemical formula.\n\n4.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ matches option B. The other options can be ruled out as they do not align with the structural features, particularly the absence of -CH₂- groups and the specific vinyl splitting pattern.\n\n<<<B>>>"
