    "The provided data indicates that the unknown compound is Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. A detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data confirms this identification.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    The degree of unsaturation is calculated to be 5. This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectrum**\n    *   The two bands at **3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1** are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2).\n    *   The strong band at **1720 cm-1** is in the typical range for a carbonyl group, specifically an α,β-unsaturated ester. The conjugation with the benzene ring slightly lowers the frequency from a typical aliphatic ester (1735-1750 cm-1).\n\n*   **¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** This triplet signal for three protons is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH3) that is adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2), indicating an ethyl group.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons in this region is typical for the protons of an aromatic primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to quadrupolar relaxation and exchange with trace amounts of water.\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This quartet for two protons results from the methylene group (-CH2-) of the ethyl group being split by the adjacent methyl group (3 protons). Its downfield shift to 4.5 ppm indicates it is attached to an electronegative oxygen atom, confirming the presence of an ethoxy group as part of an ester (-OCH2CH3).\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The protons closer to the electron-donating amino group are shielded and appear upfield (around 7.0 ppm), while the protons closer to the electron-withdrawing ethyl ester group are deshielded and appear downfield (around 8.0 ppm).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined data points unequivocally to the structure of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, also known as benzocaine.\n\n*   The formula C9H11NO2 matches.\n*   The IR data confirm a primary amine and a conjugated ester carbonyl.\n*   The ¹H NMR data show an ethyl group attached to the ester oxygen, a primary amine, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nThe other isomers can be ruled out:\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Would be a secondary amide (one N-H IR stretch) and show a formyl proton (H-C=O) in the NMR.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Would show a more complex splitting pattern for the aromatic protons (meta-substitution) and the carbonyl IR stretch would likely be at a lower frequency for a primary amide.\n*   **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** The NMR would show a propionyl group (CH3CH2C=O), not an ethyl ester group.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
