    "### Analysis of the Chemical Reactions\n\nThe problem describes a two-step sequence for the dihydroxylation of two different isomers of oct-4-ene. This process, involving epoxidation with mCPBA followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, is known as **anti-dihydroxylation**. The stereochemical outcome of this reaction depends on the stereochemistry of the starting alkene.\n\n#### **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene)**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation.** The reaction of a trans-alkene with mCPBA is a *syn*-addition, which produces a trans-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is achiral, this step yields a racemic mixture of the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers of 4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-Catalyzed Hydrolysis.** The acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide by water is an *anti*-attack.\n    *   Hydrolysis of the (4R,5R)-epoxide involves water attacking either C4 or C5, causing an inversion of stereochemistry at the point of attack. This results in the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, which is a meso compound.\n    *   Similarly, hydrolysis of the (4S,5S)-epoxide also yields the same meso compound, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Therefore, the anti-dihydroxylation of a symmetric trans-alkene produces a single, achiral, meso compound.\n\n**Product of Reaction 1: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (a single meso compound).**\n\n#### **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene)**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Epoxidation.** The *syn*-addition of mCPBA to the cis-alkene forms a cis-epoxide. Since (Z)-oct-4-ene has a plane of symmetry, this reaction produces a single, achiral meso-epoxide: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n2.  **Step 2: Acid-Catalyzed Hydrolysis.** The *anti*-attack of water on the protonated meso-epoxide occurs with equal probability at the two enantiotopic carbons (C4 and C5).\n    *   Attack at C4 (with R configuration) leads to inversion, resulting in the (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at C5 (with S configuration) leads to inversion, resulting in the (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   These two products are enantiomers and are formed in equal amounts.\n\n**Product of Reaction 2: A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.**\n\n### Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture therefore contains three distinct molecules:\n1.  **Meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1).\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2).\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2).\n\nThe meso compound is a diastereomer of the two enantiomers.\n\n### Chromatographic Observation\n\n#### **Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC**\nA standard HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties like polarity and size. It cannot differentiate between enantiomers, as they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. However, it can separate diastereomers.\n*   The two enantiomers, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diol, will co-elute and appear as a single peak.\n*   The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have different physical properties, thus eluting at a different time.\nTherefore, the chemist will observe **two peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\nA chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n*   The column will separate the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-diol, into two distinct peaks.\n*   The meso-diol, being a diastereomer of the other two compounds, will also be separated and appear as its own peak.\nTherefore, the chemist will observe **three peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe experiment will result in 2 peaks on the standard HPLC and 3 peaks on the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<C>>>"
