    "To definitively identify the unknown organic compound, we must analyze the provided 1H NMR data and compare it to the expected spectra of the four possible options: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate.\n\n### Analysis of the 1H NMR Data:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet peak integrating to three protons at this chemical shift is characteristic of the methyl group in an acetate functional group (CH₃-C=O). All four possible compounds contain an acetate group, so this signal is consistent with all options.\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal is a doublet, indicating a methyl group (3H) that is adjacent to a single proton. The chemical shift in the allylic region suggests a methyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C-CH₃). This structural feature is present in propenyl acetate but not in butenyl acetate, which would have an ethyl group (CH₂CH₃) attached to the double bond (in the case of 1-butenyl acetate) or an O-CH₂ group (in the case of 2-butenyl acetate), neither of which fits the data. This finding strongly points towards a propenyl acetate structure.\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal for a single proton is a doublet of quartets. This splitting pattern arises from the proton being coupled to one adjacent proton (giving the doublet) and a methyl group of three protons (giving the quartet). This matches the vinyl proton (=CH-CH₃) in a propenyl group.\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This doublet represents a single vinyl proton coupled to one other proton. The key piece of information is the coupling constant (J) of 16.0 Hz. In alkenes, the coupling constant between two vicinal protons on a double bond is indicative of their stereochemistry. A trans configuration typically shows a large coupling constant, in the range of 12-18 Hz. In contrast, a cis configuration shows a smaller coupling constant, usually between 6-12 Hz.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the detailed analysis:\n1.  The signals at 2.1, 1.6, and 5.5 ppm are all consistent with the structure of a propenyl acetate. The butenyl acetate options are inconsistent with the signals.\n2.  The large coupling constant of J = 16.0 Hz for the vinyl proton at 7.0 ppm clearly indicates a *trans* relationship between the two protons on the double bond.\n\nTherefore, the unknown compound is identified as Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
