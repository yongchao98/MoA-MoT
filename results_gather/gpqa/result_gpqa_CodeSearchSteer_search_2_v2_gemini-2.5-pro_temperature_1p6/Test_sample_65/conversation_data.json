    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as a model-independent framework to parameterize potential effects of new physics at energy scales higher than the electroweak scale. The construction of the SMEFT Lagrangian relies on a set of fundamental principles and symmetries.\n\nAll operators in the SMEFT must be constructed from the Standard Model fields and respect the following symmetries:\n\n*   **Lorentz and Poincaré Symmetry:** The SMEFT is a quantum field theory defined on Minkowski spacetime and is required to be consistent with the principles of special relativity. Therefore, all operators must be invariant under Poincaré transformations, which include both Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) and spacetime translations. This is a foundational assumption in the construction of the theory.\n\n*   **CPT Symmetry:** The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in quantum field theory which states that any local, unitary, and Lorentz-invariant theory must be symmetric under the combined action of Charge conjugation (C), Parity inversion (P), and Time reversal (T). Since SMEFT is constructed to be a local and Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, it inherently respects CPT symmetry. A violation of CPT would imply a violation of Lorentz invariance.\n\n*   **CP Symmetry:** Unlike the other symmetries listed, CP symmetry (the combination of Charge and Parity transformations) is **not** a required symmetry of the SMEFT. The Standard Model itself contains sources of CP violation. SMEFT extends this by allowing for new, and potentially larger, sources of CP violation to be parameterized by higher-dimensional operators. In fact, a significant area of research within the SMEFT framework is the study and classification of these CP-violating operators.\n\nTherefore, Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT.\n\n<<<B>>>"
