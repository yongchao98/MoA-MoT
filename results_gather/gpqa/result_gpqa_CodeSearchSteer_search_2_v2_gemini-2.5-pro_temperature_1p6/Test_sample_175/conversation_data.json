    "To determine the probability of obtaining 0 for the measurement of observable P and subsequently -1 for the observable Q, we must follow the principles of quantum mechanics for sequential measurements. This involves calculating the probability of the first outcome, determining the new state of the system after this measurement, and then calculating the probability of the second outcome from this new state. The final probability is the product of these individual probabilities.\n\n**1. Initial State and Operators**\n\nThe initial state of the system, `|ψ⟩`, is given by the column matrix:\n`|ψ⟩ = (-1, 2, 1)ᵀ`\n\nThe operators for the observables P and Q are:\n`P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n`Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\nFirst, we normalize the initial state vector. The squared norm is `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 6`. The normalized state, `|ψ_norm⟩`, is:\n`|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * (-1, 2, 1)ᵀ`\n\n**2. Measurement of Operator P**\n\nThe possible outcomes for the measurement of P are its eigenvalues. The eigenvalues `p` are found by solving the characteristic equation `det(P - pI) = 0`, which yields the eigenvalues `p = 0, 1, -1`.\n\nWe are interested in the outcome `p = 0`. The next step is to find the corresponding eigenvector `|v_p=0⟩`:\n`(P - 0*I)|v_p=0⟩ = 0`\nThis gives the equation `x = -z` and `y = 0`. The normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue 0 is:\n`|v_p=0⟩ = (1/√2) * (1, 0, -1)ᵀ`\n\nThe probability of measuring `p = 0` is given by the square of the magnitude of the projection of the initial state onto this eigenvector, a principle known as the Born rule.\n`Prob(P=0) = |⟨v_p=0|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n`⟨v_p=0|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√2)(1, 0, -1) * (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1)ᵀ = (1/√12) * (-1 - 1) = -2/√12`\n`Prob(P=0) = |-2/√12|² = 4/12 = 1/3`\n\n**3. State Collapse and Measurement of Operator Q**\n\nUpon measuring `P=0`, the system's state collapses to the corresponding eigenvector `|v_p=0⟩`. This becomes the new state of the system, `|ψ'⟩`:\n`|ψ'⟩ = |v_p=0⟩ = (1/√2) * (1, 0, -1)ᵀ`\n\nNow, we measure the observable Q in this new state. The operator Q is diagonal, so its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements: `q = 1, 0, -1`. We want to find the probability of obtaining `q = -1`.\n\nThe eigenvector for `q = -1`, `|v_q=-1⟩`, is:\n`|v_q=-1⟩ = (0, 0, 1)ᵀ`\n\nThe probability of measuring `q = -1` from the state `|ψ'⟩` is:\n`Prob(Q=-1) = |⟨v_q=-1|ψ'⟩|²`\n`⟨v_q=-1|ψ'⟩ = (0, 0, 1) * (1/√2)(1, 0, -1)ᵀ = -1/√2`\n`Prob(Q=-1) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2`\n\n**4. Final Probability**\n\nThe combined probability of measuring `P=0` and then `Q=-1` is the product of the individual probabilities calculated in sequence:\n`Total Probability = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1)`\n`Total Probability = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\n<<<A>>>"
