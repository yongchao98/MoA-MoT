    "To determine the lower limit on the redshift for detecting Lyman-alpha absorption from ground-based optical telescopes, we need to consider the rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line and the atmospheric cutoff for optical observations from the ground.\n\n1.  **Lyman-alpha Wavelength:** The Lyman-alpha spectral line, which results from the transition of an electron in a hydrogen atom from the n=2 to the n=1 energy level, has a rest wavelength of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å) or 121.6 nanometers (nm). This wavelength falls within the ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which is strongly absorbed by Earth's atmosphere.\n\n2.  **Atmospheric Cutoff:** Ground-based optical telescopes are limited by the Earth's atmosphere, which absorbs most light with wavelengths shorter than the optical window. The atmosphere becomes opaque below a certain wavelength, largely due to ozone. This cutoff is not perfectly sharp but is generally considered to be around 3200-3400 Å (320-340 nm). To observe the Lyman-alpha feature from the ground, it must be redshifted to a wavelength longer than this atmospheric cutoff.\n\n3.  **Redshift Calculation:** The redshift (z) is related to the rest wavelength (λ_rest) and the observed wavelength (λ_obs) by the formula:\n    `1 + z = λ_obs / λ_rest`\n\n    To find the minimum redshift (z_min), we use the minimum observable wavelength from the ground as λ_obs and the rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line as λ_rest.\n    *   λ_rest = 1216 Å\n    *   λ_obs_min ≈ 3300 Å (a reasonable estimate for the atmospheric cutoff)\n\n    Now, we can calculate the lower limit for the redshift:\n    `z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1`\n    `z = (3300 Å / 1216 Å) - 1`\n    `z ≈ 2.71 - 1`\n    `z ≈ 1.71`\n\n    Looking at the options provided, the value of 1.9 (Option D) is the closest lower limit above the calculated physical minimum of ~1.7. Observational sources confirm that ground-based observations of the Lyman-alpha forest typically require a redshift of z ≳ 1.7 to 2.5.\n\nTherefore, based on the atmospheric cutoff and the redshift calculation, the estimated lower limit for the redshift of these objects to be detectable with optical ground-based telescopes is approximately 1.9.\n\n<<<D>>>"
