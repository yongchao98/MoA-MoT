    "The user is asking to compare the total energy spectrum of the particle 'E' in two different nuclear decays. This problem is a direct analogy to the real-world physics of double-beta decay.\n\n*   **Original Decay:** `2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V` is analogous to two-neutrino double beta decay (2νββ). In this process, two nucleons (A) convert into two other nucleons (B), emitting two electrons (E) and two antineutrinos (V). The total kinetic energy of the two outgoing electrons has a broad, continuous spectrum because the two unobserved neutrinos carry away a variable amount of energy. The spectrum ends at a specific maximum value, known as the Q-value of the decay.\n\n*   **Exotic Decay:** `2A -> 2B + 2E + M` is analogous to neutrinoless double beta decay with the emission of a Majoron (0νββM). The Majoron (M) is a hypothetical, neutral, massless particle. In this variant, a single Majoron is emitted instead of two antineutrinos.\n\nHere's how the energy spectra compare:\n\n1.  **Spectrum Shape:**\n    *   In the first decay, the available energy is shared among four light particles (2E, 2V).\n    *   In the second decay, the same total energy is shared among only three light particles (2E, M).\n    *   Because the energy is distributed among fewer particles in the exotic decay, the two E particles, on average, receive a larger share of the energy. This means the peak of the energy spectrum is shifted to a higher energy compared to the original decay. However, since the energy carried by the particle M can vary, the resulting spectrum for the two E particles is still continuous.\n\n2.  **Endpoint Energy:**\n    *   The total energy released by the conversion of the heavy nucleons is determined by the mass difference between the initial (2A) and final (2B) nucleons. This energy must account for the creation of the rest mass of all emitted particles, with the remainder appearing as kinetic energy.\n    *   The Q-value represents the total kinetic energy available to the final particles. For the original decay, this is `Q_original = [Mass(2A) - Mass(2B)] - 2*Mass(E) - 2*Mass(V)`. The problem states the endpoint of the E-particle spectrum is Q, so we identify `Q = Q_original`.\n    *   For the exotic decay, the new Q-value is `Q_exotic = [Mass(2A) - Mass(2B)] - 2*Mass(E) - Mass(M)`.\n    *   The particle M is stipulated to be *massless* (`Mass(M) = 0`), while V is a \"much lighter particle,\" which, like a real neutrino, has a small but non-zero mass (`Mass(V) > 0`).\n    *   Comparing the two endpoints: `Q_exotic = Q_original + 2*Mass(V)`.\n    *   Since the mass of particle V is greater than zero, the energy previously required to create the mass of the two V particles is now available as kinetic energy in the exotic decay.\n    *   Therefore, the new endpoint energy is higher than the original endpoint energy.\n\nCombining these points, the spectrum for the exotic decay remains continuous with a shape shifted towards higher energies, and its kinematic endpoint increases.\n\n<<<C>>>"
