    "I have analyzed the provided information.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product from the NMR Spectra:**\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** The signal at δ 197.7 ppm is characteristic of a ketone carbonyl carbon. The signals between δ 126-145 ppm are typical for aromatic and alkene carbons. The signals at δ 21.3 and 28.4 ppm are in the aliphatic region, corresponding to methyl carbons.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** There are two singlets at δ 2.28 (3H) and δ 2.31 (3H), indicating two methyl groups that are not adjacent to any protons. The four signals in the δ 6.75-7.71 ppm range are characteristic of aromatic and vinylic protons. Specifically, the pattern of two doublets integrating to 2 protons each (δ 7.08 and δ 7.71) is strongly indicative of a para-substituted benzene ring. The remaining two signals at δ 6.75 (1H, d) and δ 7.68 (1H, d) are vinylic protons on a double bond, coupled to each other.\n    *   **Putting it together:** The product is an α,β-unsaturated ketone. The structure that fits all the data is (E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n        *   The *p*-tolyl group (CH₃-C₆H₄-) accounts for the singlet at δ 2.31 and the two aromatic doublets (δ 7.08 and δ 7.71).\n        *   The acetyl group (-C(=O)CH₃) accounts for the other methyl singlet at δ 2.28 and the ketone carbon at δ 197.7.\n        *   The trans double bond (-CH=CH-) accounts for the two vinylic doublets at δ 6.75 (α to the carbonyl) and δ 7.68 (β to the carbonyl).\n    *   The proposed product structure is `p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃`, which has the molecular formula C₁₁H₁₂O, matching the starting material.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction:**\n    *   The starting material, Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O), is an epoxide. It reacts with DABCO (a non-nucleophilic base) at high temperature. This reaction is a known base-catalyzed isomerization of a vinylic epoxide to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound.\n\n3.  **Identify Compound X by Considering the Rearrangement of Each Option:**\n    *   **Option A: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane** (`Ph-CH=CH-CH(O)CH(CH₃)`). Rearrangement would likely lead to products like 1-phenylpent-1-en-3-one or 5-phenylpent-3-en-2-one. Neither of these products' predicted NMR spectra would show two methyl singlets.\n    *   **Option B: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane** (`p-CH₃-C₆H₄-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`). Base-catalyzed abstraction of a proton from the terminal -CH₂ of the epoxide, followed by ring-opening and tautomerization, yields the identified product, (E)-4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. This perfectly matches the spectral data.\n    *   **Option C: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane** (`Ph-CH=C(CH₃)-CH(O)CH₂`). Rearrangement would lead to 3-methyl-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one. The ¹H NMR spectrum of this product would show a multiplet for 5 phenyl protons, not the pair of doublets observed for a *p*-substituted ring.\n    *   **Option D: 2-styrylepoxide** (`Ph-CH=CH-CH(O)CH₂`). The molecular formula is C₁₀H₁₀O, which does not match the given formula for Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O).\n\nConclusion: The product's NMR data definitively points to 4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one. This product can only be formed from the rearrangement of 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Therefore, Compound X is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
