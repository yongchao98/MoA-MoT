    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### Reaction 1: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\nThis reaction is a Michael addition.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Enolate:** The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), is a strong, sterically hindered base. It will abstract an α-proton (a proton on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group) to form an enolate. The starting material, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, has two α-carbons, at positions C2 and C6.\n    *   The carbon at C2 is quaternary (bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C1, and C3) and has no protons.\n    *   The carbon at C6 is tertiary and has one proton.\n    *   Therefore, the only possible enolate is formed by removing the proton from the C6 position.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The C6 of the enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate (an α,β-unsaturated ester). This is a conjugate addition reaction.\n\n3.  **Product A Structure:** A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. The resulting structure has the cyclohexanone ring with the C1 carbonyl, the ethyl and methyl groups at C2, and now two substituents at C6: the original methyl group and the newly added ethyl propanoate chain (-CH₂CH₂COOEt). The two quaternary centers, C2 and C6, are separated by the carbonyl carbon (C1).\n\n4.  **Nomenclature of Product A:** According to IUPAC rules, the naming of this complex product can be approached by treating the ester as the parent functional group. This requires renumbering the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locant numbers. The correct IUPAC name derived from this analysis is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### Reaction 2: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)\n\nThis is also a Michael addition reaction.\n\n1.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:** The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂). The α-protons are acidic due to the electron-withdrawing nitro group. This forms a nitronate anion, [CH₃CH₂CHNO₂]⁻, which acts as the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Michael Addition:** The nucleophilic carbon of the nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN), which is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n3.  **Product B Structure:** A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the original nitropropane and the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. After protonation by water, the product is CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN.\n\n4.  **Nomenclature of Product B:** To name this product, we identify the longest carbon chain that includes the principal functional group, the nitrile (-CN).\n    *   Numbering starts from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   The chain is six carbons long, so the parent name is hexanenitrile.\n    *   There is a methyl group on C3 and a nitro group on C4.\n    *   Therefore, the correct IUPAC name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The major product **A** is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   The major product **B** is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing these results with the given options, option D correctly identifies both products.\n\n<<<D>>>"
