    "To eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar, the most effective mutation would be one that completely inactivates the gene responsible for its synthesis. This is most reliably achieved by a \"knockout\" mutation that prevents the production of a functional protein. Let's analyze the effects of each mutation on the gene's protein-coding sequence.\n\nThe intact gene sequence begins:\n5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...-3’\nThis translates to the amino acid sequence:\nMet - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly...\n\nNow, let's examine each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...-3’\n    *   This sequence contains two changes compared to the original. The second codon, `TTT`, has become `TTC`. Both `TTT` and `TTC` code for the amino acid Phenylalanine (Phe), so this is a silent mutation.\n    *   The third codon, `CTC` (Leucine), has become `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a missense mutation, as it changes one amino acid for another. A single amino acid change might alter the protein's function, but it may not eliminate it.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...-3’\n    *   This sequence also has a change in the third codon. The original `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAA`.\n    *   `TAA` is one of the three \"stop\" codons in the genetic code. The introduction of a premature stop codon is known as a nonsense mutation. This mutation will cause protein synthesis (translation) to halt after only two amino acids have been joined. The result is a severely truncated and non-functional protein, which is highly effective at knocking out gene function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3’\n    *   In this mutant, the third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the sixth codon `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine), among other changes. These are missense mutations. While multiple amino acid changes are more likely to disrupt protein function than a single one, it is not as definitive as a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT...-3’\n    *   Here, the third codon `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and the fifth codon `GGT` (Glycine) becomes `ACT` (Threonine). Like the other mutants, these are missense mutations that swap one amino acid for another. This may or may not eliminate the protein's function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMutant 2 is the most likely candidate to successfully eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. The nonsense mutation introduces a premature stop codon very early in the gene sequence. This effectively halts protein production, ensuring that the final, functional enzyme responsible for synthesizing the compound cannot be made. The other mutants only introduce missense mutations, which substitute amino acids and might only alter or reduce the protein's function rather than completely eliminating it.\n\n<<<C>>>"
