    "To find the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν), we apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum. The rest masses are given as m(π⁺) = 139.6 MeV/c² and m(μ⁺) = 105.7 MeV/c². The muon neutrino (ν) is considered to be massless.\n\nThe decay process is:\nπ⁺ → μ⁺ + ν\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy:**\nSince the pion is stationary, its total initial energy is its rest energy.\nE_initial = m(π⁺)c²\n\nThe final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\nE_final = E(μ⁺) + E(ν)\n\nTherefore:\nm(π⁺)c² = E(μ⁺) + E(ν)\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum:**\nThe initial momentum is zero because the pion is at rest. Due to the conservation of momentum, the two product particles must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.\np(μ⁺) = -p(ν)\nThe magnitudes of their momenta are equal: |p(μ⁺)| = |p(ν)| = p.\n\n**3. Relativistic Kinematics Calculation:**\n\nWe can express the total energy of the particles in terms of their rest mass and momentum (p):\n*   **Neutrino (massless):** E(ν) = pc\n*   **Muon (with mass):** E(μ⁺) = √((pc)² + (m(μ⁺)c²)²)\n\nSubstituting these into the energy conservation equation:\nm(π⁺)c² = √((pc)² + (m(μ⁺)c²)²) + pc\n\nTo solve for the momentum (p), we rearrange and square the equation:\n(m(π⁺)c² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m(μ⁺)c²)²\n(m(π⁺)c²)² - 2(m(π⁺)c²) (pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m(μ⁺)c²)²\n\nSimplifying by canceling the (pc)² terms:\n(m(π⁺)c²)² - 2(m(π⁺)c²) (pc) = (m(μ⁺)c²)²\n\nNow, we solve for pc:\npc = [(m(π⁺)c²)² - (m(μ⁺)c²)²] / [2 * m(π⁺)c²]\n\nPlugging in the given values:\npc = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\npc = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2\npc = 8315.67 / 279.2\npc ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\n**4. Calculating Kinetic Energies (KE):**\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_ν):**\n    For a massless particle, the kinetic energy is equal to its total energy.\n    KE(ν) = E(ν) = pc ≈ 29.8 MeV\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_μ):**\n    The total energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference in rest energies, which must be shared between the products.\n    Q = KE(μ⁺) + KE(ν) = m(π⁺)c² - m(μ⁺)c²\n    Q = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV\n    KE(μ⁺) = Q - KE(ν)\n    KE(μ⁺) = 33.9 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 4.1 MeV.\n\n    Alternatively, we can calculate the muon's total energy and subtract its rest energy.\n    E(μ⁺) = m(π⁺)c² - E(ν) = 139.6 MeV - 29.8 MeV = 109.8 MeV\n    KE(μ⁺) = E(μ⁺) - m(μ⁺)c² = 109.8 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 4.1 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This matches option D. A slightly more precise calculation gives 4.12 MeV for the muon's kinetic energy.\n\n<<<D>>>"
