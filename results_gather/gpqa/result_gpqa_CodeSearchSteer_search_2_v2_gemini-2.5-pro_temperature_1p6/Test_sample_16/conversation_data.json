    "To determine the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], in the solution, we first need to consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by the equilibrium:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe formation constant (K_f), also known as the stability constant, for this reaction is given as 5.0 x 10¹⁰. The problem asks for the concentration of free Ca²⁺ in a 0.02 M solution of the complex, which means we need to look at the reverse reaction—the dissociation of the complex:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this dissociation (K_d) is the inverse of the formation constant (K_f):\nK_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5.0 x 10¹⁰) = 2.0 x 10⁻¹¹\n\nWe can set up an equilibrium table to find the concentration of the dissociated ions. Let 'x' be the concentration of free Ca²⁺ ions at equilibrium.\n\n| Species | Initial Concentration (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium Concentration (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| EDTA⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the dissociation constant, K_d:\nK_d = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻] / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]\n2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n\nBecause the dissociation constant K_d is extremely small, the amount of the complex that dissociates, x, will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. Therefore, we can make the simplifying assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\nThe equation then becomes:\n2.0 x 10⁻¹¹ = x² / 0.02\n\nNow, we solve for x²:\nx² = (2.0 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\nx² = 4.0 x 10⁻¹³\n\nFinally, we solve for x, which represents the concentration of Ca²⁺:\nx = √(4.0 x 10⁻¹³)\nx = √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis calculated concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 2.0x10⁻² M\nB) 1.0x10⁻² M\nC) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nD) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
