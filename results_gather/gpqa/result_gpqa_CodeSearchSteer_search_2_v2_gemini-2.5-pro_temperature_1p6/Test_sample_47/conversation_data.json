    "The reaction sequence described involves a key rearrangement in the second step. Let's trace the transformations to identify the final product and then determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogens.\n\n1.  **Cyclohexanone treated with bromine:** This is an α-bromination reaction. The bromine atom is added to the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n    *   **Product 1: 2-bromocyclohexanone**\n\n2.  **Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide:** When an α-halo ketone with an available proton on the other side of the carbonyl is treated with a strong base like NaOH, it undergoes a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a cyclopropanone intermediate, followed by ring-opening to yield a ring-contracted carboxylic acid. In this case, the six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to a five-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 2: Cyclopentane carboxylic acid**\n\n3.  **Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine:** This is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride provides the chlorine, and pyridine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct.\n    *   **Product 3: Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**\n\n4.  **Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAl(OtBu)3H):** This is a mild reducing agent known for selectively reducing acid chlorides to aldehydes, preventing over-reduction to an alcohol.\n    *   **Product 4: Cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**\n\n**Analyzing the Final Product**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde**. Now we must determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on this molecule. The structure consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\nLet's analyze the symmetry and chemical environments of the hydrogens:\n*   **Aldehyde hydrogen (H-α):** The single hydrogen in the -CHO group is chemically unique. (Set 1)\n*   **Hydrogen on the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde (H-1):** This hydrogen is on a tertiary carbon and is unique. (Set 2)\n*   **Hydrogens on the adjacent ring carbons (H-2, H-5):** The two carbons next to the aldehyde-bearing carbon (C2 and C5) are equivalent due to the molecule's plane of symmetry. However, on each of these carbons, the two hydrogens are diastereotopic because of the adjacent chiral center (C1). This makes them chemically non-equivalent. The two \"cis\" hydrogens (relative to the aldehyde group) are equivalent to each other, and the two \"trans\" hydrogens are equivalent to each other. This results in two distinct sets of hydrogens. (Set 3 and Set 4)\n*   **Hydrogens on the farther ring carbons (H-3, H-4):** Similarly, the two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic, as are the two on C4. By symmetry, the \"cis\" hydrogens on C3 and C4 are equivalent, and the \"trans\" hydrogens are equivalent. This gives another two distinct sets. (Set 5 and Set 6)\n\nIn total, we have six sets of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms:\n1.  The aldehyde proton.\n2.  The proton on C1 of the ring.\n3.  The two cis-protons on C2 and C5.\n4.  The two trans-protons on C2 and C5.\n5.  The two cis-protons on C3 and C4.\n6.  The two trans-protons on C3 and C4.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
