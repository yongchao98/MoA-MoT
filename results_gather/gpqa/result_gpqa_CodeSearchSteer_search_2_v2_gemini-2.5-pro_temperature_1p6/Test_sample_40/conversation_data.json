    "To determine the speed of light in the moving glass relative to a stationary observer in the laboratory, we must use the relativistic velocity addition formula. This is necessary because the classical addition of velocities is not valid at speeds approaching the speed of light.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Define the frames of reference and velocities:**\n    *   Let the laboratory be the stationary frame of reference (S).\n    *   Let the moving glass be the moving frame of reference (S').\n    *   The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the lab (frame S) is `v`.\n    *   The speed of light within the glass, as measured in its own rest frame (S'), is `u'`. The refractive index `n` is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to its speed in the medium (`u'`), so `n = c/u'`. The problem states `c = 1`, which means the speed of light in the glass, relative to the glass, is `u' = 1/n`.\n\n2.  **Apply the Einstein Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The formula for adding velocities in special relativity is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u'*v)/c^2)`\n\n    Where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) as seen by the stationary observer in the lab. This is the value we want to find.\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object in the moving frame (the speed of light in the glass), which is `1/n`.\n    *   `v` is the velocity of the moving frame (the glass) relative to the stationary observer.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum, which is set to `1`.\n\n3.  **Substitute the values into the formula:**\n    We substitute `u' = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the equation:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + ((1/n)*v)/1^2)`\n\n4.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To eliminate the fractions within the numerator and denominator, we can multiply both by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result matches option B. This formula was confirmed by the Fizeau experiment, which measured the speed of light in moving water.\n\n<<<B>>>"
