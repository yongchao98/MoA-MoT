    "### Analysis of the Compound\n\n1.  **Molecular Composition:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (C6). It contains a total of 8 carbon atoms. This leaves 2 carbons for the substituents.\n2.  **Functional Groups:** The FTIR spectrum reveals a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X).\n3.  **Structure Determination:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the benzene ring.\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group. A group that fits this description is the acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   Therefore, the compound is a haloacetophenone. The molecular formula is C8H7XO.\n4.  **Isomerism:** With two substituents on a benzene ring, three positional isomers are possible: ortho, meta, and para.\n5.  **1H NMR Spectroscopy Prediction:**\n    *   The acetyl group's methyl protons (-CH3) will produce a singlet (since there are no adjacent protons) integrating to 3 hydrogens. Its typical chemical shift is around 2.3-2.6 ppm.\n    *   The aromatic protons will appear in the region of 7.0-8.5 ppm. The pattern depends on the substitution:\n        *   **Ortho and Meta Isomers:** Would typically show complex, asymmetric multiplets for the 4 aromatic protons.\n        *   **Para Isomer:** Due to the symmetry of the *para* substitution, the 4 aromatic protons are present as two chemically equivalent sets. This results in a characteristic A2B2 (or AA'BB') system, which appears as two distinct doublets, each integrating to 2 hydrogens.\n\n### Evaluation of NMR Data Options\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    This data is inconsistent. The signals at 4.6-4.8 ppm are not in the typical aromatic proton range (>6.5 ppm).\n\n*   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    This is also inconsistent. It shows signals outside the aromatic range and unusual integrations (2H singlet).\n\n*   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    This spectrum is a perfect match for a *para*-haloacetophenone.\n    *   **2.3 (3H, s):** This singlet integrating to three protons is characteristic of the methyl protons of an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   **7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d):** These two doublets, each integrating to two protons, are the classic signature of a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring. For example, the reported 1H NMR data for 4'-Chloroacetophenone is δ 7.90 (d, 2H), 7.44 (d, 2H), 2.59 (s, 3H), and for 4'-Bromoacetophenone is δ 7.82 (d, 2H), 7.61 (d, 2H), 2.57 (s, 3H). The data in option C is highly consistent with these known values.\n\n*   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    This data suggests a different isomer, *p*-halophenylacetaldehyde (X-C6H4-CH2CHO). While the aromatic pattern and carbon count fit, the multiplicities are incorrect. The aldehyde proton (-CHO) at 9.9 ppm should be a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent methylene (-CH2-) protons, and the methylene protons at 3.7 ppm should be a doublet. The data incorrectly lists both as singlets.\n\nBased on the analysis, option C provides the only correct and consistent 1H NMR data for the described compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
