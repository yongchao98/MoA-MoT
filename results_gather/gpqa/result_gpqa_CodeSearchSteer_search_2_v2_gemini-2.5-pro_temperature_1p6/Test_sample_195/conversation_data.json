    "The problem asks for the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. To solve this, we will use the principle of conservation of energy, adapted for special relativity.\n\n1.  **Total Relativistic Energy**: The total energy ($E$) of a particle of rest mass $m$ moving at speed $v$ in a potential $U(x)$ is the sum of its relativistic energy and potential energy:\n    $E = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$\n    where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor, $c$ is the speed of light, and $U(x)$ is the potential energy. For a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where $k$ is the spring constant and $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\n2.  **Conservation of Energy**: The total energy of the system remains constant throughout the oscillation. We can equate the total energy at two specific points in the motion: the point of maximum amplitude and the equilibrium position.\n\n3.  **Energy at Maximum Amplitude (x = A)**:\n    *   At the maximum displacement, $x = A$, the mass is momentarily at rest, so its velocity is $v = 0$.\n    *   With $v=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = 1$.\n    *   The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n4.  **Energy at Equilibrium Position (x = 0)**:\n    *   At the equilibrium position, $x = 0$, the potential energy is zero: $U(0) = 0$.\n    *   The speed of the mass is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n    *   The total energy at this point is entirely relativistic kinetic energy:\n        $E_{total} = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n5.  **Equating the Energies**: By the law of conservation of energy, the total energy at both points must be the same:\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\n6.  **Solving for v_max**: Now, we rearrange the equation to solve for $v_{max}$.\n    *   Divide by $mc^2$:\n        $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n    *   Invert both sides:\n        $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n    *   Square both sides:\n        $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n    *   Rearrange to isolate the $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$ term:\n        $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n    *   Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root:\n        $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nThis result matches option B. As a check, in the classical limit where the potential energy is much less than the rest mass energy ($kA^2 \\ll mc^2$), this formula correctly reduces to the classical result $v_{max} = \\sqrt{kA^2/m}$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
