    "The search results confirm the general approach for solving buffer problems involving polyprotic acids like phosphoric acid. Several sources describe using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the relevant dissociation step. In this case, the solution contains significant amounts of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, making the second dissociation of phosphoric acid the key equilibrium for determining the pH.\n\nH₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ (governed by Ka₂)\n\nThe search results provide various values for the dissociation constants of phosphoric acid. The prompt gives Ka₂ as 6.2x10⁻⁸ and Ka₃ as 1.8x10⁻¹². My planned calculation uses these exact values. The search results also confirm that for a buffer system near a pKa, you can generally ignore the other dissociation steps when calculating the pH, but those equilibria are still present.\n\nThe orthophosphate ion, PO₄³⁻, is produced in the third dissociation step:\n\nHPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻ (governed by Ka₃)\n\nMy planned calculation, where I first find the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺] from the main buffer equilibrium (Ka₂) and then use that [H⁺] in the Ka₃ expression to solve for [PO₄³⁻], is a standard and valid method confirmed by the principles outlined in the search results.\n\nI will now proceed with the final calculation as planned.\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of each substance:**\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles of H₂PO₄⁻\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles of HPO₄²⁻\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial concentrations in the 200.00 cm³ (0.200 L) solution:**\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n3.  **Use the equilibrium for Ka₂ to find the [H⁺]:**\n    *   H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   6.2 x 10⁻⁸ = [H⁺] * (0.02809 M) / (0.03674 M)\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸ * 0.03674) / 0.02809\n    *   [H⁺] ≈ 8.109 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n4.  **Use the equilibrium for Ka₃ to find the [PO₄³⁻]:**\n    *   HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * [HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺]\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹² * 0.02809) / (8.109 x 10⁻⁸)\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.235 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nRounding the result to three significant figures gives 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
