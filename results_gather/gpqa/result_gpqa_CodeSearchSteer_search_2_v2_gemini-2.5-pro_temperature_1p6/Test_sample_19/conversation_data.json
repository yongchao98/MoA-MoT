    "The \"impulse\" approximation in many-body nuclear calculations simplifies a complex interaction between a probe (like a lepton in an electroweak interaction) and a nucleus into a more manageable problem. The core idea is to treat the interaction as if it occurs with a single, isolated nucleon, ignoring the complexities of the nuclear environment. This approximation rests on several key assumptions.\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons:** This is the foundational principle of the impulse approximation. The probe is assumed to interact with only one nucleon at a time. This is also known as the one-body current approximation, which neglects the effects of two-body currents carried by exchanged particles like mesons.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon:** This assumption means that neither the incoming probe nor the outgoing struck nucleon re-interacts with the remaining (A-1) nucleons of the nucleus. These other nucleons are treated as mere \"spectators\" to the primary interaction.\n\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces:** During the very brief moment of the high-energy interaction, the nucleon is treated as a free particle. The potential energy that binds the nucleon within the nucleus is considered negligible compared to the energy of the interaction. This means the nucleon's binding forces are effectively \"switched off\" for the duration of the event.\n\nThe third statement, concerning the non-relativistic nature of quarks within the nucleon, is not a foundational assumption of the impulse approximation itself. The impulse approximation operates at the level of nucleons as the fundamental degrees of freedom, largely abstracting away their internal quark-gluon structure. While the nuclear environment can modify the internal structure of a bound nucleon compared to a free one (an effect that challenges the simplest form of the impulse approximation), the quark dynamics are not a prerequisite for defining the approximation.\n\nTherefore, the three assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
