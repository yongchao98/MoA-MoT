    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star radiating as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio:** We want to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to that of Star_2 (L₂):\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2 (R₁ = 1.5 * R₂). Therefore:\n    (R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio from Wien's Law:** Wien's Displacement Law relates the surface temperature (T) of a black body to the peak wavelength (λ_emit) of its emitted spectrum:\n    λ_emit = b / T\n    where b is Wien's constant. This means the temperature is inversely proportional to the emitted peak wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_emit).\n    The ratio of the temperatures is therefore:\n    T₁ / T₂ = λ_emit₂ / λ_emit₁\n\n5.  **Relating Emitted and Observed Wavelengths:** The astronomers determined that the *observed* peak wavelengths (λ_obs) are the same for both stars (λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂). The observed wavelength is affected by the star's radial velocity due to the Doppler effect.\n\n    *   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0 km/s, so there is no Doppler shift. Its emitted peak wavelength is equal to its observed peak wavelength:\n        λ_emit₁ = λ_obs₁\n\n    *   For Star_2, the radial velocity is v₂ = 700 km/s. This velocity causes a redshift of its spectrum. The relationship between the observed and emitted wavelength is given by the formula for Doppler shift (using the non-relativistic approximation, which is sufficient here):\n        λ_obs₂ = λ_emit₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n        where c is the speed of light (approximately 299,792 km/s).\n\n6.  **Calculating the Temperature Ratio:** Since λ_obs₁ = λ_obs₂, we can set the expressions for the emitted wavelengths equal:\n    λ_emit₁ = λ_emit₂ * (1 + v₂/c)\n    Now, we can find the ratio of the emitted wavelengths, which we need for the temperature ratio:\n    λ_emit₂ / λ_emit₁ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n    Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n    T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the radius and temperature ratios back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n    Now, plug in the values for v₂ and c:\n    v₂/c = 700 km/s / 299,792 km/s ≈ 0.002335\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 0.002335)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002335)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.009366\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The information about the stars' masses is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
