    "In a synthetic organic chemistry lab, chemists often use a technique called chromatography to separate and purify the compounds they have made. A common type of chromatography is Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC), where a small amount of the reaction mixture is spotted onto a plate coated with a stationary phase, often silica gel. The plate is then placed in a developing chamber with a solvent, known as the mobile phase.\n\nAs the solvent moves up the plate by capillary action, it carries the compounds from the mixture with it. How far and how fast each compound travels up the plate depends on a variety of factors, most notably its polarity. The stationary phase (silica gel) is polar. Polar compounds will stick more strongly to the polar stationary phase and will therefore not travel very far up the plate. Less polar compounds have a weaker interaction with the stationary phase and will be carried further up the plate by the mobile phase.\n\nWhen a chemist says their \"compounds are on top of each other,\" they are most likely referring to the spots on a TLC plate or the fractions collected from column chromatography. If the compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel at nearly the same rate, resulting in spots that are very close together or even overlapping on a TLC plate. This makes it difficult to separate them and obtain pure samples of each compound. This phenomenon is often described as co-elution in column chromatography, where different compounds elute from the column at the same time.\n\nLet's consider the other options:\n\n*   **A) The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations.** Optical rotation is a physical property of chiral molecules and is measured using a polarimeter. While it is used to characterize compounds, it is not a separation technique in the same way as chromatography. Similar optical rotations would not cause the compounds to be \"on top of each other\" during a separation process.\n*   **B) The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points.** Similar boiling points can make separation by distillation difficult, but the phrase \"on top of each other\" is characteristically used to describe the results of a chromatographic separation.\n*   **D) The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.** While non-covalent interactions are the basis for how compounds interact with the stationary and mobile phases in chromatography, the statement implies a failure to separate, not that the compounds are necessarily forming a stable complex with each other. The root cause of the failed separation is the similar affinity of the individual compounds for the chromatographic system due to their similar polarity.\n\nTherefore, the most probable reason for the chemist's complaint is that the compounds have similar polarities, leading to poor separation during chromatography.\n\n<<<C>>>"
