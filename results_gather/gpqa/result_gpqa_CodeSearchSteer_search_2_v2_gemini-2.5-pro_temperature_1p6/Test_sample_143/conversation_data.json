    "To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we need to perform a series of calculations based on the principles of special relativity and particle physics.\n\nFirst, we calculate the particle's lifetime in its own rest frame, known as the proper lifetime ($\\tau$). This is inversely related to its decay width ($\\Gamma_{X}$) by the reduced Planck constant ($\\hbar$). The search results confirm that the relationship between lifetime and decay width is given by $\\Gamma = \\hbar / \\tau$.\n\nNext, we must account for the effects of special relativity, as the particle is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light. The particle's lifetime as observed in the laboratory frame ($\\tau'$) is longer than its proper lifetime due to time dilation, given by the formula $\\tau' = \\gamma \\tau$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor. The mean decay distance ($d$) is then the product of the particle's velocity ($v$) and its lifetime in the lab frame.\n\nThe formula for the mean decay distance is $d = v \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\tau$. This can be conveniently expressed using the particle's momentum ($p$), mass ($m_X$), and speed of light ($c$) as $d = \\frac{pc}{m_{X}c^2} \\cdot c\\tau$.\n\nHere are the step-by-step calculations:\n\n1.  **Consolidate the given values in consistent units.**\n    *   Production Energy ($E_{X}$): 8 GeV\n    *   Mass ($m_{X}$): 1.2 GeV/cÂ², which means the rest energy ($m_{X}c^2$) is 1.2 GeV.\n    *   Decay Width ($\\Gamma_{X}$): 320 MeV, which is equal to 0.320 GeV.\n\n2.  **Calculate the particle's momentum ($p$).**\n    The relativistic energy-momentum relation is $E_{X}^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_{X}c^2)^2$.\n    *   $(pc)^2 = E_{X}^2 - (m_{X}c^2)^2 = (8 \\text{ GeV})^2 - (1.2 \\text{ GeV})^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 \\text{ GeV}^2$\n    *   $pc = \\sqrt{62.56} \\text{ GeV} \\approx 7.9095 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n3.  **Calculate the mean decay length in the rest frame ($c\\tau$).**\n    The proper lifetime is related to the decay width by $\\tau = \\hbar / \\Gamma_{X}$. We can calculate $c\\tau$ using the value of $\\hbar c$.\n    *   $c\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_{X}}$\n    *   The value of $\\hbar c$ is approximately $1.973 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ GeV} \\cdot \\text{m}$.\n    *   $c\\tau = \\frac{1.973 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ GeV} \\cdot \\text{m}}{0.320 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 6.166 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ m}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the mean decay distance in the lab frame ($d$).**\n    Now, we combine the results to find the mean decay distance.\n    *   $d = \\frac{pc}{m_{X}c^2} \\cdot c\\tau$\n    *   $d = \\frac{7.9095 \\text{ GeV}}{1.2 \\text{ GeV}} \\times (6.166 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ m})$\n    *   $d \\approx 6.59125 \\times 6.166 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ m}$\n    *   $d \\approx 4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ m}$\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\nB) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\nC) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\nD) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
