    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Structure Determination of Compound X from Spectral Data:**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum:**\n        *   The broad absorption from **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is a distinct feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is hydrogen-bonded.\n        *   The strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   Absorptions at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are characteristic of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n        *   Conclusion from IR: The compound contains a carboxylic acid group and an aromatic ring.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet far downfield is definitive for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a *para* (1,4)-disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group.\n        *   **Alkyl Substituent Signals:** The remaining signals describe the other substituent on the ring.\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** This is a methine (-CH) proton, and its chemical shift suggests it is directly attached to the benzene ring (a benzylic proton). The multiplet splitting indicates it's coupled to several neighboring protons.\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** This is a methyl (-CH₃) group coupled to a single proton, resulting in a doublet. This fits with it being attached to the benzylic -CH group.\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** This is a methylene (-CH₂-) group, seen as a multiplet because it is adjacent to both the benzylic -CH group and a terminal methyl group.\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** This is a methyl (-CH₃) group seen as a triplet, indicating it is adjacent to a -CH₂- group.\n        *   **Assembling the Alkyl Group:** The fragments ` -CH- `, ` -CH₃` (from doublet), ` -CH₂- `, and ` -CH₃` (from triplet) form a *sec*-butyl group: -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃). This structure perfectly matches all the splitting patterns and integrations.\n    *   **Conclusion for Compound X:** The molecule is a *para*-substituted benzoic acid with a *sec*-butyl group. Therefore, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option A.\n\n2.  **Reaction and Final Product Identification:**\n\n    *   **Reagents:** The reaction is carried out with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce carboxylic acids completely down to the corresponding alkane (R-COOH → R-CH₃). The reaction effectively removes all oxygen atoms from the carboxyl group and replaces them with hydrogen.\n    *   **Transformation:** The starting material, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, will have its carboxylic acid group (-COOH) reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The sec-butyl group and the benzene ring will remain unchanged under these conditions.\n    *   **Final Product:** The resulting product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**. This corresponds to option C.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe spectral data identifies the starting compound (X) as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is a strong reduction that converts the carboxylic acid group into a methyl group. Thus, the final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
