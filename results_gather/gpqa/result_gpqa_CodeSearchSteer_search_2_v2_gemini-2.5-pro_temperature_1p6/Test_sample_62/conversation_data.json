    "### Calculation of Photon Momentum for Molecular Transition\n\nTo determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we first need to identify the initial and final energy states of the diatomic molecule and calculate the energy difference between them. This energy difference corresponds to the energy of the absorbed photon.\n\n#### 1. Energy Model and States\n\nThe energy of a diatomic molecule in the quantum rotation-vibration model is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n\n*   **E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + [ħ² / (2I)] * J(J + 1)**\n\nWhere:\n*   `v` is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   `J` is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...).\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   `ω` is the angular frequency of vibration.\n*   `I` is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n\nThe molecule is initially in its fundamental (ground) state, which is the lowest possible energy state. This corresponds to `v = 0` and `J = 0`.\n\n#### 2. Selection Rules and the Final State\n\nFor a diatomic molecule to absorb a photon, it must obey specific selection rules for the change in quantum numbers:\n*   **Δv = +1** (for absorption in a harmonic oscillator).\n*   **ΔJ = ±1**.\n\nStarting from the ground state (J=0), the rotational quantum number `J` can only increase. Therefore, the only allowed rotational transition is **ΔJ = +1**. This means the final rotational state must be `J' = 1`. Consequently, the transition to the next state involves changes in both vibrational and rotational numbers, from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=1).\n\n#### 3. Calculation of Photon Energy\n\nThe energy of the absorbed photon (`ΔE`) is the difference between the final and initial energy states:\n\n*   `E_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + [ħ² / (2I)] * 0(1) = (1/2)ħω`\n*   `E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + [ħ² / (2I)] * 1(2) = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I`\n*   `ΔE = E_final - E_initial = [(3/2)ħω + ħ²/I] - [(1/2)ħω] = ħω + ħ²/I`\n\nThis rovibrational transition is primarily a vibrational one, with a much smaller rotational component superimposed.\n\n#### 4. Numerical Calculation\n\n**Given values:**\n*   Mx = 20 amu\n*   My = 2 amu\n*   R = 2 Å = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   ω = 4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s\n*   1 amu = 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n*   ħ = 1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   c (speed of light) = 2.998 x 10⁸ m/s\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the reduced mass (μ).**\n`μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu`\n`μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg`\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the moment of inertia (I).**\n`I = μR² = (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²`\n`I ≈ 1.208 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the energy of the photon (ΔE).**\nThe two components of the energy change are:\n*   Vibrational part: `ħω = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) ≈ 4.218 x 10⁻²⁰ J`\n*   Rotational part: `ħ²/I = (1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.208 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.21 x 10⁻²³ J`\n\nThe total energy is the sum:\n`ΔE ≈ 4.218 x 10⁻²⁰ J + 0.009 x 10⁻²⁰ J ≈ 4.227 x 10⁻²⁰ J`\n(Note: The rotational energy contribution is about 1000 times smaller than the vibrational energy but is included for accuracy).\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the photon's momentum (p).**\nThe momentum of a photon is related to its energy by `p = E / c`.\n`p = ΔE / c = (4.227 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.998 x 10⁸ m/s)`\n`p ≈ 1.410 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s`\n\nThis calculated value is very close to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
