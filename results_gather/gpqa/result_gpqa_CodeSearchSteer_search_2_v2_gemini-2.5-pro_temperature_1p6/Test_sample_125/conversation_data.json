    "### Analysis of the Reactions and Products\n\n**Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\nThe starting material, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, is a ketone with an existing chiral center at the C5 position. The reduction of the ketone at the C3 position with Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LAH) introduces a new chiral center at C3. Since the hydride ion can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces, two possible stereoisomers are formed. The existing (S) stereocenter at C5 directs the formation of two diastereomers: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other and have different physical properties.\n\n**Reaction II: Reduction of pentane-2,4-dione**\nPentane-2,4-dione is a symmetric and achiral diketone. The reduction of both ketone groups by sodium borohydride (NaBH4) creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4. This leads to the formation of three stereoisomers:\n*   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (which is a meso compound and identical to (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol)\n\nThe (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers. The meso compound is achiral and is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.\n\n### Chromatographic Separation Analysis\n\nAfter both reactions are complete, the product mixtures are combined. In total, there are five different stereoisomeric compounds:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (from Reaction II)\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\nA normal-phase HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in polarity, but it cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n*   The two products from Reaction I are diastereomers, which have different physical and chemical properties and can be separated by normal-phase HPLC. This will result in **two peaks**.\n*   The three products from Reaction II consist of a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound. Enantiomers have identical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as a single peak. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different retention time, resulting in a separate peak. This will contribute **two peaks**.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks observed in the normal-phase HPLC will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC**\nAn HPLC column with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   The two diastereomers from Reaction I are both chiral and not mirror images, so they will be resolved into **two separate peaks**.\n*   The enantiomeric pair from Reaction II, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will interact differently with the chiral stationary phase and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II is achiral. As a diastereomer to the other products, it will elute as a single, separate peak, resulting in **one peak**.\n\nTherefore, the total number of peaks observed in the chiral HPLC will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from the enantiomers of Reaction II) + 1 (from the meso compound of Reaction II) = **5 peaks**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>"
