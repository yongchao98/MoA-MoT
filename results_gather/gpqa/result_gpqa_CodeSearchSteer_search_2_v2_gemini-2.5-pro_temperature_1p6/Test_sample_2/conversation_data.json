    "To determine the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx, we first need to define the quantum state and the operators in a matrix representation. The spin-up |↑⟩ and spin-down |↓⟩ states can be represented as column vectors:\n\n*   |↑⟩ = `[[1], [0]]`\n*   |↓⟩ = `[[0], [1]]`\n\nThe given linear superposition state is |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩. In vector form, this is:\n\n|ψ⟩ = `[[0.5], [sqrt(3)/2]]`\n\nThe corresponding bra-vector ⟨ψ| is the conjugate transpose:\n\n⟨ψ| = `[0.5, sqrt(3)/2]`\n\nThe Pauli matrices, which represent the spin operators, are:\n\n*   **σz** (spin projection onto the z-axis) = `[[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n*   **σx** (spin projection onto the x-axis) = `[[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\nThe operator for which we want to find the expectation value is O = 10σz + 5σx. First, let's find the matrix for this operator:\n\nO = 10 * `[[1, 0], [0, -1]]` + 5 * `[[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\nO = `[[10, 0], [0, -10]]` + `[[0, 5], [5, 0]]`\nO = `[[10, 5], [5, -10]]`\n\nThe expectation value ⟨O⟩ is calculated using the formula ⟨O⟩ = ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩.\n\nWe can calculate this in two parts: first, by calculating the expectation value of σz and σx separately, and then combining them.\n\n**1. Expectation value of σz (⟨σz⟩):**\n⟨σz⟩ = ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩ = (|c↑|² - |c↓|²)\nWith |ψ⟩ = c↑|↑⟩ + c↓|↓⟩, we have c↑ = 0.5 and c↓ = √3/2.\n⟨σz⟩ = (0.5)² - (√3/2)² = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5\n\n**2. Expectation value of σx (⟨σx⟩):**\n⟨σx⟩ = ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩\n⟨σx⟩ = `[0.5, sqrt(3)/2]` * `[[0, 1], [1, 0]]` * `[[0.5], [sqrt(3)/2]]`\nFirst, `[[0, 1], [1, 0]]` * `[[0.5], [sqrt(3)/2]]` = `[[sqrt(3)/2], [0.5]]`\nThen, `[0.5, sqrt(3)/2]` * `[[sqrt(3)/2], [0.5]]` = (0.5 * √3/2) + (√3/2 * 0.5) = √3/4 + √3/4 = 2√3/4 = √3/2.\n\n**3. Total Expectation Value ⟨O⟩:**\n⟨O⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩\n⟨O⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2)\n⟨O⟩ = -5 + (5√3)/2\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value. Using √3 ≈ 1.732:\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + (5 * 1.732) / 2\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 8.66 / 2\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -0.67\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is -0.7.\n\n<<<D>>>"
