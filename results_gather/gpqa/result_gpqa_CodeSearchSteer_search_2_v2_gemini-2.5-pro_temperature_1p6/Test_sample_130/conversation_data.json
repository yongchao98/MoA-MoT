    "Here is a breakdown of the solution based on the provided chemical reaction and spectral data.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction\nThe problem describes the dehydration of a *cis*-dicarboxylic acid to an anhydride. The anhydride's spectral data (¹H NMR: one peak at 7 ppm; ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm) are characteristic of **maleic anhydride**. Maleic anhydride is a classic dienophile in the Diels-Alder reaction.\n\nThe anhydride reacts with **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This compound serves as the diene.\n\nThe reaction between a diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which forms a six-membered ring. Since the diene is cyclic, the product is a bridged bicyclic compound. The molecular formula of the products, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, confirms this, as it is the sum of the atoms in maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) and the diene (C₉H₁₄).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Structure of the Major and Minor Products\nThe Diels-Alder reaction between a cyclic diene and a dienophile can produce two diastereomeric products: *endo* and *exo*.\n*   The **endo product** is generally the major product because it forms faster (it is the kinetic product). This preference is due to favorable secondary orbital interactions between the diene and the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile during the reaction.\n*   The **exo product** is typically more stable (the thermodynamic product) but forms more slowly, making it the minor product under kinetic control.\n\nTherefore, the major product is the *endo* adduct, and the minor product is the *exo* adduct.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemistry and Expected NMR Signals\nLet's visualize the structures and predict the key signals in the ¹H NMR spectrum of the adducts. The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene core structure.\n*   **Proton Signals:**\n    *   **H-succinic (2H):** These two protons originate from the maleic anhydride. In the product, they are attached to the carbon atoms that formed a new bond with the diene. Due to the symmetry of the molecule, they are chemically equivalent and should appear as a **2H singlet** at approximately **3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Me-alkene (6H):** These are the two methyl groups attached to the double bond of the bicyclic system. They are equivalent and should appear as a **6H singlet** at around **1.7 ppm**.\n    *   **Me-bridgehead (6H):** These are the two methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons. They are equivalent and will be a **6H singlet** at a more upfield chemical shift, around **1.0 ppm**.\n    *   **CH₂-bridge (2H):** The two protons on the C7 bridge of the bicyclic system.\n\n### Step 4: Use NOESY Data to Distinguish Isomers\nThe Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) is observed between protons that are close to each other in space (< 5 Å). A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks connecting these spatially close protons. This technique is ideal for distinguishing *endo* and *exo* isomers.\n*   In the **endo adduct (major product)**, the anhydride ring is oriented \"under\" the C=C double bond of the bicycloheptene ring system. This places the **H-succinic protons** (at ~3.5 ppm) in close proximity to the **Me-alkene protons** (at ~1.7 ppm). A NOESY cross-peak is expected between these two signals.\n*   In the **exo adduct (minor product)**, the anhydride ring points away from the C=C double bond and is close to the CH₂ bridge. Therefore, the H-succinic protons are far from the Me-alkene protons, and the corresponding NOESY cross-peak would be absent or very weak.\n\nThe problem states that a cross-peak is present in the major product's spectrum but absent in the minor product's spectrum. This distinguishing cross-peak must be the one between the H-succinic protons and the Me-alkene protons.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe cross-peak in the major (*endo*) product connects the resonances for the Me-alkene protons and the H-succinic protons. Based on our chemical shift predictions:\n*   **Me-alkene:** 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n*   **H-succinic:** 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
