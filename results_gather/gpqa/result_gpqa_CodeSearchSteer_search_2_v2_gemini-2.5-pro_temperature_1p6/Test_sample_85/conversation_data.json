    "### Analysis of the Reactions\n\nTo determine the correct starting materials, we must analyze the two separate reduction reactions. The key to this problem lies in understanding the selectivity of the two different reducing agents, Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) and Borane (BH₃), and how they interact with the functional groups present in the proposed starting materials.\n\nThe potential starting material is an acid-ester: 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid (a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid). This molecule contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an ester group (-COO-isobutyl). The final product in both reactions is a lactone (a cyclic ester), specifically a stereoisomer of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This six-membered ring lactone is formed when a 5-hydroxy carboxylic acid undergoes intramolecular cyclization.\n\nThe stereochemistry of the final product depends on the stereochemistry of the starting material because the reactions do not affect the chiral center at the C-3 position (which becomes the C-4 position in the lactone). Therefore, the configuration (R or S) of the starting material will be retained in the product.\n\n### Reaction A\n\n*   **Reagents:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺\n*   **Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Selectivity of LiBH₄:** Lithium borohydride is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. It will reduce the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group intact.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The starting material A is treated with LiBH₄, which reduces the ester to a primary alcohol.\n    2.  This creates a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid intermediate.\n    3.  The subsequent addition of acid (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization), where the alcohol group attacks the carboxylic acid group to form the six-membered lactone ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the reaction pathway does not involve the chiral center, the stereochemistry is retained. To obtain the (R)-lactone product, the starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Reaction B\n\n*   **Reagents:** B + BH₃ + H⁺\n*   **Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Selectivity of BH₃:** Borane is a reducing agent known for its ability to selectively reduce carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The starting material B is treated with BH₃, which preferentially reduces the carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol.\n    2.  This creates an isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate intermediate.\n    3.  The subsequent acid workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed alcohol group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the chiral center is not affected. To yield the (S)-lactone product, the starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the selectivity of the reducing agents and the retention of stereochemistry:\n*   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
