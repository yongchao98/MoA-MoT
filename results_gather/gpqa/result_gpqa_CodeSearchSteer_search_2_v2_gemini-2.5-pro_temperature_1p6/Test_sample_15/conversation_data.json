    "A compound exhibits optical activity if it is chiral and not a meso compound (an achiral compound with stereocenters). The analysis of each compound is as follows:\n\n*   **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule does not contain any chiral centers. Therefore, it is optically inactive.\n*   **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The \"R\" and \"S\" in the name denote specific stereochemistry at chiral centers. The presence of these specific configurations indicates that the molecule is a single stereoisomer. Without an internal plane of symmetry, this complex bicyclic compound is optically active.\n*   **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This compound has two chiral centers. However, the (2R,3S) isomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid is a meso compound. It possesses an internal plane of symmetry, which makes it achiral and, therefore, optically inactive.\n*   **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso form. The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers are enantiomers of each other and are optically active.\n*   **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The \"(R)\" designation indicates that this is a single enantiomer of a chiral compound. The carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group is a chiral center, and the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. Thus, it is optically active.\n*   **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: Also known as *cis*-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, this molecule has the three hydroxyl groups on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement gives the molecule a plane of symmetry, making it an achiral meso compound and optically inactive.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An examination of the structure, (cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2, reveals that there are no chiral centers. Therefore, the compound is optically inactive.\n\nCounting the optically active compounds from the list:\n1.  (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<B>>>"
