    "To determine the factor by which `system_1` is more massive than `system_2`, we can use the principles of orbital mechanics for binary star systems. The total mass of a double-lined spectroscopic, eclipsing binary system is related to its orbital period (P) and the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes (K) of its component stars.\n\nFor a binary system, the total mass (M) can be expressed by the following relationship:\n\nM = (P / (2πG * sin³(i))) * (Ka + Kb)³\n\nwhere:\n*   P is the orbital period.\n*   G is the gravitational constant.\n*   Ka and Kb are the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities for the two stars.\n*   i is the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight.\n\nSince both systems are described as exhibiting eclipses, it is a standard assumption that their orbital planes are very close to our line of sight, meaning the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90 degrees. In this case, sin(i) is approximately 1, and sin³(i) is also approximately 1. This simplifies the mass relationship to being directly proportional to the period and the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes.\n\nM ∝ P * (Ka + Kb)³\n\nNow, we can calculate this value for each system and then find their ratio.\n\n**For system_1:**\n*   Orbital Period (P₁) = 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K₁) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**For system_2:**\n*   Orbital Period (P₂) = 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K₂) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nThe ratio of the mass of system_1 (M₁) to the mass of system_2 (M₂) is:\n\nM₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K₁)²] / [P₂ * (K₂)²]\nM₁ / M₂ = [2 years * (15 km/s)³] / [1 year * (25 km/s)³]\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (15/25)³\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3/5)³\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125\nM₁ / M₂ = 0.432\n\nThis calculated value of approximately 0.432 is closest to the provided option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
