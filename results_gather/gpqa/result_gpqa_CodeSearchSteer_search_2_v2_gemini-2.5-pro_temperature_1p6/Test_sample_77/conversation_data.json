    "The expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These are derived from Maxwell's equations and represent the complete, relativistically correct electromagnetic field for a point charge in arbitrary motion.\n\nThe standard formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials at an observation point $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$ are given in terms of the charge's state at a \"retarded\" time $t_r$. The retarded time is the time at which the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted from the charge to reach the observer at time $t$.\n\nLet's match the user's notation to the standard formulation:\n*   The position of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n*   The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt}|_{t=t_r}$.\n*   The vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point is $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$.\n*   The magnitude of this vector is $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n*   The retarded time condition is $t - t_r = d/c$.\n\nThe scalar potential $V(\\vec{r}, t)$ is given by:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nTo match the format of the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n$V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{qc}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nThe vector potential $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t)$ is given by:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n\nAgain, multiplying the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 c}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}$\n\nIt is also a known property of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials that the vector potential is related to the scalar potential by $\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2}V$, which can be verified using the relation $\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 = 1/c^2$.\n\nComparing these derived expressions with the given options, we find that option A matches perfectly.\n\n*   **Option A:** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$. This is correct.\n*   **Option B:** The expressions are for a stationary charge and incorrect.\n*   **Option C:** The sign in the denominator is positive ($+$), which would correspond to an advanced potential, not the physical retarded potential.\n*   **Option D:** The expression for V is for a stationary charge, which is incorrect, although the relationship between A and V is correctly stated.\n\nTherefore, the correct expressions for the scalar and vector potentials are given in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
