    "Here is the step-by-step derivation for the transition of the H-atom:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial and final states**: The initial state is \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\) (\\(n=3, l=0, m=0\\)), and the final state after two transitions is \\(|1,0,0\\rangle\\) (\\(n=1, l=0, m=0\\)).\n\n2.  **Apply selection rules for the first dipole transition**: For an electric dipole transition, the selection rules for the quantum numbers are:\n    *   \\(\\Delta l = \\pm 1\\)\n    *   \\(\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1\\)\n    *   \\(\\Delta n\\) can be any integer, but it must be non-zero.\n\n    Starting from \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\):\n    *   Since the initial orbital angular momentum is \\(l=0\\), the intermediate state must have \\(l'=1\\) (\\(\\Delta l = +1\\)).\n    *   Since the initial magnetic quantum number is \\(m=0\\), the intermediate state can have \\(m' = 0, \\pm 1\\).\n    *   The principal quantum number \\(n\\) must decrease. A transition to \\(n=2\\) is the most probable cascade.\n\n    Therefore, the possible intermediate states are \\(|2,1,1\\rangle\\), \\(|2,1,0\\rangle\\), and \\(|2,1,-1\\rangle\\).\n\n3.  **Apply selection rules for the second dipole transition**: This transition goes from the intermediate state \\(|2,1,m'\\rangle\\) to the final state \\(|1,0,0\\rangle\\).\n    *   Initial state (intermediate): \\(n=2, l=1, m' \\in \\{ -1, 0, 1 \\}\\).\n    *   Final state: \\(n=1, l=0, m=0\\).\n    *   Let's check the rules:\n        *   \\(\\Delta l = 0 - 1 = -1\\). This satisfies the \\(\\Delta l = \\pm 1\\) rule.\n        *   \\(\\Delta m = 0 - m'\\). Since \\(m'\\) can be -1, 0, or 1, the change \\(\\Delta m\\) will be +1, 0, or -1, respectively. All of these are allowed by the \\(\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1\\) rule.\n\n    All three possible intermediate states can transition to the \\(|1,0,0\\rangle\\) ground state via a dipole transition. This means the decay routes \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle\\), \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle\\), and \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle\\) are all valid.\n\n4.  **Determine the probability of the transition route**: The question asks for the probability of a *specific* route. This corresponds to a branching ratio.\n    *   The first decay is from the \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\) (3s) state. This state is spherically symmetric. According to the Wigner-Eckart theorem, when a system in a spherically symmetric state (\\(l=0\\)) decays, it has an equal probability of transitioning to any of the allowed, degenerate magnetic sublevels of the final state.\n    *   The three possible intermediate states, \\(|2,1,-1\\rangle\\), \\(|2,1,0\\rangle\\), and \\(|2,1,1\\rangle\\), form a degenerate manifold. Therefore, the probability is split equally among them.\n    *   The total probability of transitioning from \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\) to one of these three states is 1 (assuming no other decay channels like 3s -> 1s, which is a forbidden two-photon process and much slower). The probability of transitioning to any *specific* \\(m'\\) state is therefore \\(1/3\\).\n    *   The second transition is from a \\(|2,1,m'\\rangle\\) (2p) state to the \\(|1,0,0\\rangle\\) (1s) state. This is the only allowed radiative decay path from the 2p level. Thus, any atom that reaches a 2p state is certain to decay to the 1s state. The probability of this step is 1.\n    *   The total probability for the specific cascade \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle\\) is the product of the probabilities of each step: \\(P = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n5.  **Compare with the given options**:\n    *   A) \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\). This matches our calculation.\n    *   B) \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle\\) and \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). The probability is incorrect.\n    *   C) \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\). The path is valid, but the probability should be \\(1/3\\).\n    *   D) \\(|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\). The path is valid, but the probability should be \\(1/3\\).\n\nBased on this analysis, option A correctly identifies a valid decay route and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<A>>>"
