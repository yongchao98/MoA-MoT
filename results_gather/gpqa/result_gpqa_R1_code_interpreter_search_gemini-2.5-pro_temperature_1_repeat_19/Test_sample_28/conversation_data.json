    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process to determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to inactivate a gene that produces an unwanted compound. The most effective way to completely inactivate a gene and prevent the synthesis of its protein product is to introduce a mutation that causes a total loss of function. The most severe types of mutations are:\n*   **Nonsense mutation:** A change in the DNA sequence that results in a premature stop codon. This halts protein synthesis (translation), leading to a severely shortened and almost always non-functional protein.\n*   **Frameshift mutation:** An insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not a multiple of three. This alters the \"reading frame\" of the gene, scrambling the entire amino acid sequence downstream of the mutation and often leading to a premature stop codon as well.\n\nOther mutations, like missense (changes one amino acid) or silent (no change in amino acid), are less likely to cause a complete loss of function.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Intact Gene\nFirst, let's break down the beginning of the intact gene's coding sequence into codons (groups of three nucleotides). The sequence starts with `ATG`, which is the universal start codon.\n\n*   **Intact Gene Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ... -3’`\n*   **Amino Acid Sequence:** Methionine (M) - Phenylalanine (F) - Leucine (L) - Alanine (A) - Glycine (G) - Threonine (T) ...\n\n### 3. Analyze Each Mutant\n\nWe will now compare each mutant to the intact gene, identify the type of mutation, and predict its effect.\n\n#### Mutant 1\n*   **Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ... -3’`\n*   **Comparison:**\n    *   The second codon `TTT` is changed to `TTC`. Both `TTT` and `TTC` code for Phenylalanine (F). This is a **silent mutation**.\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**.\n*   **Effect:** The resulting protein will have one amino acid (Leucine) replaced by another (Tyrosine). While this *could* disrupt protein function, it might also have little to no effect. It is not guaranteed to eliminate the compound.\n\n#### Mutant 2\n*   **Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ... -3’`\n*   **Comparison:**\n    *   The second codon `TTT` is changed to `TTC` (silent mutation).\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n*   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. The ribosome will stop translation after adding the second amino acid (Phenylalanine). The result is a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe), which will be completely non-functional. This mutation is extremely likely to eliminate the production of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n#### Mutant 3\n*   **Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT ... -3’`\n*   **Comparison:**\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**.\n    *   The sixth codon `ACT` (Threonine) is changed to `GTC` (Valine). This is another **missense mutation**.\n*   **Effect:** The protein will have two amino acid changes. This is more disruptive than one change, but still does not guarantee a complete loss of function.\n\n#### Mutant 4\n*   **Sequence:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT ... -3’`\n*   **Comparison:** By aligning with the intact sequence, we can see that the codon `GGT` (Glycine) has been deleted, and the codon `CTC` has been changed to `TAC`.\n    *   Intact: `... CTC GCT GGT ACT ...` (Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr)\n    *   Mutant: `... TAC GCT --- ACT ...` (Tyr - Ala - Thr)\n*   **Effect:** This represents a missense mutation (Leu -> Tyr) and an **in-frame deletion** (deletion of 3 nucleotides, which removes one amino acid without shifting the reading frame). While this is a significant change, the rest of the protein downstream will be synthesized correctly. It is less certain to cause a complete loss of function compared to a premature stop codon.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nComparing the effects of the four mutations:\n*   Mutant 1: Missense mutation (uncertain outcome).\n*   **Mutant 2: Nonsense mutation (premature stop codon). Guaranteed loss of function.**\n*   Mutant 3: Two missense mutations (uncertain outcome).\n*   Mutant 4: Missense + In-frame deletion (uncertain outcome).\n\nThe nonsense mutation in **Mutant 2** is the most drastic and the one most likely to completely abolish the function of the gene, thereby eliminating the production of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nTo verify this, let's use a Python script to translate the DNA sequences.\n```python\ndef translate_dna(seq):\n    \"\"\"Translates a DNA sequence into a protein sequence.\"\"\"\n    table = {\n        'ATA':'I', 'ATC':'I', 'ATT':'I', 'ATG':'M',\n        'ACA':'T', 'ACC':'T', 'ACG':'T', 'ACT':'T',\n        'AAC':'N', 'AAT':'N', 'AAA':'K', 'AAG':'K',\n        'AGC':'S', 'AGT':'S', 'AGA':'R', 'AGG':'R',\n        'CTA':'L', 'CTC':'L', 'CTG':'L', 'CTT':'L',\n        'CCA':'P', 'CCC':'P', 'CCG':'P', 'CCT':'P',\n        'CAC':'H', 'CAT':'H', 'CAA':'Q', 'CAG':'Q',\n        'CGA':'R', 'CGC':'R', 'CGG':'R', 'CGT':'R',\n        'GTA':'V', 'GTC':'V', 'GTG':'V', 'GTT':'V',\n        'GCA':'A', 'GCC':'A', 'GCG':'A', 'GCT':'A',\n        'GAC':'D', 'GAT':'D', 'GAA':'E', 'GAG':'E',\n        'GGA':'G', 'GGC':'G', 'GGG':'G', 'GGT':'G',\n        'TCA':'S', 'TCC':'S', 'TCG':'S', 'TCT':'S',\n        'TTC':'F', 'TTT':'F', 'TTA':'L', 'TTG':'L',\n        'TAC':'Y', 'TAT':'Y', 'TAA':'_STOP_', 'TAG':'_STOP_',\n        'TGC':'C', 'TGT':'C', 'TGA':'_STOP_', 'TGG':'W',\n    }\n    protein = \"\"\n    # Ensure sequence length is a multiple of 3 for simplicity\n    seq_len = len(seq) - (len(seq) % 3)\n    for i in range(0, seq_len, 3):\n        codon = seq[i:i+3]\n        amino_acid = table.get(codon, 'X') # Use X for unknown codons\n        protein += amino_acid\n        if amino_acid == '_STOP_':\n            break\n    return protein\n\n# Note: The sequences in the prompt have slight variations. We analyze the functional codons shown.\nintact_codons = \"ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT\"\nmutant1_codons = \"ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACT\"\nmutant2_codons = \"ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACT\" # This shows a premature TAA stop codon\nmutant3_codons = \"ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACT\"\nmutant4_codons = \"ATGTTTTACGCTACT\" # This represents a deletion of GGT\n\nprint(f\"Intact protein start:  {translate_dna(intact_codons)}\")\nprint(f\"Mutant 1 protein start:  {translate_dna(mutant1_codons)}\")\nprint(f\"Mutant 2 protein start:  {translate_dna(mutant2_codons)}\")\nprint(f\"Mutant 3 protein start:  {translate_dna(mutant3_codons)}\")\nprint(f\"Mutant 4 protein start:  {translate_dna(mutant4_codons)}\")\n\n```\n> Intact protein start:  MFLAGT\n> Mutant 1 protein start:  MFYAGT\n> Mutant 2 protein start:  MF_STOP_\n> Mutant 3 protein start:  MFYAGVT\n> Mutant 4 protein start:  MFYAT\n\nThe output clearly shows that Mutant 2 results in a premature stop codon, terminating the protein after only two amino acids. This confirms it is the most effective mutation for eliminating the gene's function.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The goal is to find the mutation most likely to eliminate the function of a gene that produces an anti-nutritional compound. A complete loss of gene function is most reliably achieved by introducing a mutation that stops the production of the full-length protein. Let's analyze the effect of each mutation on protein synthesis.\n\nThe process of converting a gene's DNA sequence into a protein is called translation, where the genetic code is read in three-nucleotide units called codons. Each codon specifies a particular amino acid, except for special \"stop\" codons that terminate protein synthesis. The sequence always begins with a start codon, which is `ATG` in this case.\n\n1.  **Intact Gene Analysis:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT... -3’`\n    *   Breaking it into codons gives: `ATG` (Start-Methionine), `TTT` (Phenylalanine), `CTC` (Leucine), `GCT` (Alanine), `GGT` (Glycine), `ACT` (Threonine).\n    *   The resulting protein starts with the amino acid sequence: Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly-Thr...\n\n2.  **Mutant 1 Analysis:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT... -3’`\n    *   Compared to the intact gene, the third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   This is a **missense mutation**: it changes one amino acid in the protein chain. While this could potentially disrupt the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to do so. The protein is still produced at full length.\n\n3.  **Mutant 2 Analysis:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT... -3’`\n    *   Compared to the intact gene, the third codon `CTC` (Leucine) is changed to `TAA`.\n    *   The codon `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n    *   This is a **nonsense mutation**. When the cellular machinery reads this codon, it will stop protein synthesis prematurely. The resulting product will be a tiny, truncated peptide of only two amino acids (Met-Phe), which will be completely non-functional. This is the most effective way to eliminate the gene's product among the given options.\n\n4.  **Mutant 3 Analysis:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT... -3’`\n    *   This mutant has two changes: `CTC` (Leucine) becomes `TAC` (Tyrosine), and `ACT` (Threonine) becomes `GTC` (Valine).\n    *   These are two **missense mutations**. Similar to Mutant 1, this changes amino acids but does not guarantee a complete loss of function. The full-length protein is still produced, albeit with two incorrect amino acids.\n\n5.  **Mutant 4 Analysis:**\n    *   Sequence: `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT... -3’`\n    *   Aligning this to the intact gene shows that the codon `GGT` has been deleted.\n    *   This is an **in-frame deletion** because a full codon (3 nucleotides) was removed. This removes one amino acid (Glycine) from the protein but does not change the reading frame for the rest of the gene. There is also a missense mutation (`CTC` to `TAC`). While this alters the protein, it is less likely to cause a complete functional knockout than introducing a premature stop codon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon, which will terminate protein synthesis very early. This is the most definitive way to ensure the gene produces no functional protein, thereby eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<D>>>"
