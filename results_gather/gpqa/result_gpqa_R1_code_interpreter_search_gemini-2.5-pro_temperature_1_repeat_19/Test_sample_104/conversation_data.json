    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe core of the problem is to compare two different phenomena that cause a star's brightness to dim:\n*   **Rotational Modulation:** A star with a non-uniform surface (cool, dark spots on one side) will appear dimmer when the spotted side faces us and brighter when the unspotted side faces us.\n*   **Exoplanet Transit:** A planet passing in front of its star blocks a small fraction of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness.\n\nWe need to find the size of a hypothetical exoplanet (`Rpl`) relative to its star (`Rstar`) that would produce the same brightness dip as the star's rotation.\n\n**2. Model the Brightness Variation from Starspots**\n\nThe amount of light (flux, `F`) emitted by a surface is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that flux is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature (`F ∝ T⁴`).\n\n*   **Star's Temperature (Photosphere):** `Teff = 6000 K`\n*   **Spot Temperature:** The spots are 1000 K cooler, so `T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K`.\n*   **Spot Filling Factor:** The spots cover 20% of the visible hemisphere's area. Let's call this `f_spot = 0.20`.\n\nWe need to calculate the relative change in flux between the star's brightest and dimmest states.\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (`F_max`):** This happens when the bright, unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer. The flux is proportional to the star's effective temperature:\n    `F_max ∝ Teff⁴`\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (`F_min`):** This happens when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. The total light is a combination of the light from the hot photosphere (80% of the area) and the cooler spots (20% of the area).\n    `F_min ∝ (1 - f_spot) * Teff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴`\n\nThe amplitude of the variation is the relative difference in flux: `Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`.\n\nLet's calculate this:\n`Amplitude = 1 - (F_min / F_max)`\n`Amplitude = 1 - [ (1 - f_spot) * Teff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴ ] / Teff⁴`\n`Amplitude = 1 - [ (1 - f_spot) + f_spot * (T_spot / Teff)⁴ ]`\n`Amplitude = 1 - 1 + f_spot - f_spot * (T_spot / Teff)⁴`\n`Amplitude = f_spot * [ 1 - (T_spot / Teff)⁴ ]`\n\nNow, we plug in the values:\n`Amplitude = 0.20 * [ 1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴ ]`\n`Amplitude = 0.20 * [ 1 - (5/6)⁴ ]`\n\n**3. Model the Brightness Dip from an Exoplanet Transit**\n\nWhen a planet transits its star, it blocks an amount of light equal to the ratio of its own projected area (`A_planet = π * Rpl²`) to the star's projected area (`A_star = π * Rstar²`). This is called the transit depth.\n\n`Transit Depth = A_planet / A_star = (π * Rpl²) / (π * Rstar²) = (Rpl / Rstar)²`\n\n**4. Equate the Two Signals and Solve**\n\nThe problem states that the amplitude of the signal from the spots is the same as the transit depth.\n\n`Transit Depth = Spot Amplitude`\n`(Rpl / Rstar)² = f_spot * [ 1 - (T_spot / Teff)⁴ ]`\n\nWe can now solve for the relative radius `Rpl / Rstar` by taking the square root of the spot amplitude. Let's perform the final calculation using a Python script for precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Star and spot parameters\nTeff = 6000.0  # Effective temperature of the star in Kelvin\nT_spot = 5000.0  # Temperature of the spots in Kelvin\nf_spot = 0.20  # Filling factor of the spots on one hemisphere\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation due to spots.\n# The formula for relative flux drop is: f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / Teff)**4)\nspot_amplitude = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / Teff)**4)\n\n# Step 2: The spot amplitude is equal to the transit depth of the hypothetical exoplanet.\n# Transit depth = (Rpl / Rstar)**2\n# Therefore, (Rpl / Rstar)**2 = spot_amplitude\n\n# Step 3: Solve for the relative radius (Rpl / Rstar) by taking the square root.\nrelative_radius = math.sqrt(spot_amplitude)\n\nprint(f\"The calculated relative radius (Rpl/Rstar) is: {relative_radius:.4f}\")\n```\n>>>\nThe calculated relative radius (Rpl/Rstar) is: 0.3218\n\nThe calculated relative radius is approximately 0.3218. This value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "To determine the relative radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, we must first calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the starspots and then equate it to the dimming caused by an exoplanet transit.\n\n**1. Calculate the Brightness Variation from Starspots**\n\nThe flux (brightness) of a star is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann law, F ∝ T⁴).\n\n*   **Star's effective temperature (Teff):** 6000 K\n*   **Spot temperature (Tspot):** 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K\n*   **Spot filling factor (f_spot):** 20% or 0.20\n\nThe maximum flux (F_max) occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. We can normalize this to 1 for simplicity, assuming the flux is proportional to Teff⁴.\n`F_max ∝ Teff⁴`\n\nThe minimum flux (F_min) occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. This hemisphere is 80% photosphere (at Teff) and 20% spots (at Tspot).\n`F_min ∝ (1 - f_spot) * Teff⁴ + f_spot * Tspot⁴`\n\nThe relative amplitude of the brightness drop is the difference between the maximum and minimum flux, divided by the maximum flux:\n`Amplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max`\n`Amplitude = 1 - (F_min / F_max)`\n`Amplitude = 1 - [ ( (1 - f_spot) * Teff⁴ + f_spot * Tspot⁴ ) / Teff⁴ ]`\n`Amplitude = 1 - [ (1 - f_spot) + f_spot * (Tspot / Teff)⁴ ]`\n`Amplitude = f_spot * [ 1 - (Tspot / Teff)⁴ ]`\n\nNow, plug in the values:\n`Amplitude = 0.20 * [ 1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴ ]`\n`Amplitude = 0.20 * [ 1 - (5/6)⁴ ]`\n`Amplitude ≈ 0.20 * [ 1 - 0.48225 ]`\n`Amplitude ≈ 0.20 * 0.51775`\n`Amplitude ≈ 0.10355`\n\n**2. Relate the Amplitude to an Exoplanet Transit**\n\nThe dimming caused by an exoplanet transit (the transit depth) is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n`Transit Depth = (Area_planet) / (Area_star)`\n`Transit Depth = (π * Rpl²) / (π * Rstar²)`\n`Transit Depth = (Rpl / Rstar)²`\n\n**3. Equate the Signals and Solve for the Radius**\n\nThe problem states that the amplitude from the spots is the same as the transit depth from the hypothetical planet.\n`(Rpl / Rstar)² = Amplitude`\n`(Rpl / Rstar)² ≈ 0.10355`\n\nTo find the relative radius (Rpl/Rstar), we take the square root of the amplitude:\n`Rpl / Rstar = sqrt(0.10355)`\n`Rpl / Rstar ≈ 0.3218`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<D>>>"
