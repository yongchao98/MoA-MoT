    "The user wants me to solve a quantum mechanics problem.\nThe problem is about normalizing a wave function.\n\n**1. Understand the core concept:**\nThe fundamental principle of quantum mechanics is that the total probability of finding a particle in all possible locations must be 1. This is known as the normalization condition. Mathematically, it's expressed as:\n∫ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\nwhere the integral is taken over all space where the particle can exist.\n\n**2. Identify the given information:**\n*   Wave function: ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i\n*   The particle is only found in the region 1 ≤ x ≤ 3. This means the integral for normalization should be from x=1 to x=3.\n*   'a' is the normalization constant we need to find.\n*   'i' is the imaginary unit.\n\n**3. Calculate the probability density, |ψ(x)|²:**\nThe wave function is a complex number. For any complex number z = Real + Imaginary*i, its squared modulus is |z|² = (Real)² + (Imaginary)².\nIn our case:\n*   Real part: Re(ψ) = a / sqrt(1 + x)\n*   Imaginary part: Im(ψ) = -0.5\n\nSo, the probability density is:\n|ψ(x)|² = [a / sqrt(1 + x)]² + (-0.5)²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n**4.

Solve the integral:**\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = 1\n\n*   **First part:** ∫ (a² / (1 + x)) dx = a² * ∫ (1 / (1 + x)) dx = a² * ln(1 + x)\n*   **Second part:** ∫ 0.25 dx = 0.25 * x\n\nNow, evaluate the definite integral from 1 to 3:\n[ a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25 * x ] from 1 to 3\n\n*   **Evaluate at the upper limit (x=3):**\n    a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3 = a² * ln(4) + 0.75\n\n*   **Evaluate at the lower limit (x=1):**\n    a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1 = a² * ln(2) + 0.25\n\n*   **Subtract the lower limit from the upper limit:**\n    (a² * ln(4) + 0.75) - (a² * ln(2) + 0.25)\n    = a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + (0.75 - 0.25)\n    = a² * ln(4/2) + 0.5  (using the logarithm property ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B))\n    = a² * ln(2) + 0.5\n\n**6. Solve for 'a':**\nNow we set this result equal to 1, as per the normalization condition:\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\na = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))\n\n**7.
