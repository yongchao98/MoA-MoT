    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify compound D.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A**\n\n*   **Analyze the 1H NMR data:** The spectrum shows two signals.\n    *   A signal at 0.9 ppm with an integration of 6H, split into a triplet.\n    *   A signal at 1.3 ppm with an integration of 4H, split into a quartet.\n*   **Interpret the data:**\n    *   The integration ratio is 6H:4H, which simplifies to 3:2.\n    *   A triplet for 6H suggests two equivalent methyl groups (2 x -CH3), each adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-), because the number of adjacent protons (n) is 2, leading to a splitting of n+1=3 (triplet).\n    *   A quartet for 4H suggests two equivalent methylene groups (2 x -CH2-), each adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3-), because the number of adjacent protons (n) is 3, leading to a splitting of n+1=4 (quartet).\n*   **Deduce the structure of A:** The data strongly suggests the presence of two equivalent ethyl groups (CH3-CH2-). However, if compound A were diethyl ether (CH3CH2OCH2CH2CH3), the quartet for the -CH2- groups would be much further downfield (around 3.5 ppm). The chemical shifts (0.9 and 1.3 ppm) are characteristic of an alkane.\n*   Let's consider simple alkanes. The total number of protons is 10. The simplest alkane with 10 protons is butane (C4H10).\n*   **Structure of n-butane:** CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3.\n    *   By symmetry, the two -CH3 groups are equivalent (6H). They are adjacent to a -CH2- group (2 protons), so their signal should be a **triplet**. This matches the data (0.9 ppm, 6H, triplet).\n    *   By symmetry, the two -CH2- groups are equivalent (4H). Each -CH2- group is adjacent to a -CH3 group (3 protons) and the other -CH2- group (2 protons), for a total of 5 adjacent protons. The signal should be a sextet (n+1=6).\n*   **Discrepancy:** The problem states the 4H signal is a quartet, not a sextet. This is likely a simplification or a low-resolution measurement where the sextet might appear as a quartet. Given the subsequent reaction sequence, n-butane is the most logical structure for compound A.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compounds B and C**\n\n*   **Reaction 1: A -> B (Monobromination)**\n    *   Compound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination. Free-radical bromination is selective and will preferentially occur at the more substituted carbon.\n    *   CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3 + Br2 --(hv)--> CH3-CH(Br)-CH2-CH3 (2-bromobutane, major product) + CH3-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br (1-bromobutane, minor product).\n    *   So, **Compound B is 2-bromobutane**.\n*   **Reaction 2: B -> C (Elimination)**\n    *   Compound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic KOH. This is a strong base, favoring an E2 elimination reaction.\n    *   Elimination can occur by removing a beta-hydrogen from either C1 or C3. According to Zaitsev's rule, the more substituted alkene is the major product.\n    *   Removal of H from C3: CH3-CH=CH-CH3 (but-2-ene, major product).\n    *   Removal of H from C1: CH2=CH-CH2-CH3 (but-1-ene, minor product).\n*   The problem states that **Compound C has two geometrical isomers**. But-2-ene exists as *cis*-but-2-ene and *trans*-but-2-ene. This confirms that **Compound C is but-2-ene**.\n\n**Step 3: The Diels-Alder Reaction to form Compound D**\n\n*   The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between a diene and a dienophile.\n    *   **Dienophile:** The *cis*-isomer of C, which is **cis-but-2-ene**.\n    *   **Diene:** **(1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol**.\n*   **Product Structure:** The reaction forms a six-membered ring (a cyclohexene derivative).\n    *   The diene provides carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4. The dienophile provides carbons 5 and 6.\n    *   The product is **4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**. This basic structure eliminates options A and D, which have a 4,6,6-trimethyl substitution pattern.\n\n**Step 4: Stereochemistry of Compound D**\n\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction is stereospecific. The stereochemistry of the reactants determines the stereochemistry of the product.\n    1.  **Stereospecificity from the dienophile:** The dienophile is *cis*-but-2-ene. This means the two methyl groups (which end up at positions C5 and C6) must be *cis* to each other in the final product.\n    2.  **Analyzing the options:** We need to determine which options have *cis* methyl groups at C5 and C6.\n        *   Option B: (1S,4R,**5S,6R**)-...\n        *   Option C: (1S,4R,**5S,6S**)-...\n        *   Let's determine if (5S, 6R) and (5S, 6S) correspond to a *cis* or *trans* relationship. By drawing the structures and assigning Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priorities, it can be determined that the **(5S, 6R) configuration corresponds to the two methyl groups being *cis***. Conversely, the (5S, 6S) configuration corresponds to a *trans* relationship.\n    3.  **Conclusion:** Since the dienophile was *cis*-but-2-ene, the C5 and C6 methyl groups must be *cis* in the product. This means the stereochemistry at these centers must be (5S, 6R) or (5R, 6S). This eliminates option C.\n\n*   **Final Confirmation (Endo/Exo Selectivity):**\n    *   The relative stereochemistry between the diene's substituents (at C1 and C4) and the dienophile's substituents (at C5 and C6) is determined by whether the transition state is *endo* or *exo*.\n    *   The *endo* rule (kinetic product) would place all four substituents (*cis*) on the same face of the ring.\n    *   The *exo* pathway (often the thermodynamic product) places the diene's substituents *trans* to the dienophile's substituents.\n    *   Let's analyze the stereochemistry of option B: (1S, 4R, 5S, 6R). As determined above, (5S, 6R) means the C5 and C6 methyls are *cis* (e.g., both \"up\"). Assigning the remaining configurations reveals that (1S) places the C1-OH \"down\" and (4R) places the C4-methyl \"down\".\n    *   This means the (C1-OH, C4-Me) pair is *cis* to each other, but *trans* to the (C5-Me, C6-Me) pair. This corresponds to the *exo* product. Given the steric hindrance of having four substituents all-cis, the exo product is a very plausible outcome.\n\nBased on the required *cis* relationship of the C5 and C6 methyl groups (which must come from the *cis*-but-2-ene dienophile), only option B is possible.\n\nFinal Answer is therefore (1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol.\n\n<<<B>>>"
