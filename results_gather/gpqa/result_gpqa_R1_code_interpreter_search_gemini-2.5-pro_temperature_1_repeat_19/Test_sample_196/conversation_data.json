  "response_list": [
    "*   **Step 1: Elucidate the structure of the starting material, Compound X, from the provided spectroscopic data.**\n\n    *   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   The very broad absorption in the range of **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group, where hydrogen bonding causes significant peak broadening.\n        *   The strong, sharp absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** is typical for the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n        *   The absorptions at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are indicative of C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n        *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n        *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** This broad singlet, far downfield, corresponds to the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid group (-CO**H**). This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n        *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, strongly suggest a *para*-substituted benzene ring. The doublet at 8.0 ppm is significantly downfield, indicating these protons are adjacent to a strong electron-withdrawing group, which is the carboxylic acid (-COOH). The doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons adjacent to the other substituent, which must be an electron-donating alkyl group.\n        *   **Alkyl Group Structure Determination:**\n            *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This points to an ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n            *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet integrating to 3 protons indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a methine group, -CH-).\n            *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2 protons corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) of the ethyl fragment. It is a multiplet because it is coupled to both the adjacent methyl group (3H) and the methine proton (1H).\n            *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1 proton corresponds to the methine (-CH-) group. It is shifted downfield because it is in a benzylic position (directly attached to the benzene ring). It appears as a multiplet because it is coupled to the adjacent methyl group (3H) and the methylene group (2H).\n        *   **Assembling the structure:** We have a *para*-substituted benzene ring with a -COOH group and an alkyl group. The alkyl group consists of a methine proton attached to the ring, a methyl group, and an ethyl group. This arrangement forms a *sec*-butyl group: -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃.\n\n    *   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (D).\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the reaction and predict the final product.**\n\n    *   **Reaction:** The starting material, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, is reacted with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n    *   **Reagents Function:** The combination of Red P and HI is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce carboxylic acid functional groups (-COOH) to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n    *   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group on the benzene ring will be reduced to a methyl group, while the rest of the molecule (the benzene ring and the *sec*-butyl group) will remain unchanged.\n        *   Reactant: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n        *   Product: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare the predicted product with the given options.**\n\n    *   The predicted product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n    *   This matches option (C).\n\n    A) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene: Incorrect alkyl group.\n    B) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid: Incorrect structure and the carboxylic acid is not reduced.\n    C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene: Correct. The carboxylic acid is reduced to a methyl group.\n    D) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid: This is the starting material (Compound X), not the final product.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>"
