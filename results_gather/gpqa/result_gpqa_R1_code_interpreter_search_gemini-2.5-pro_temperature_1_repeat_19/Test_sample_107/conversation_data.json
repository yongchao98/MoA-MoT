    "The user wants to compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with a specific transition energy in a Hydrogen atom.\n\n**1. Calculate the Paramagnetic Coupling Energy (`E_p`)**\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the paramagnetic coupling of an electron's orbital magnetic moment with an external magnetic field `B` is given by:\n$H_p = -\\vec{\\mu}_L \\cdot \\vec{B}$\n\nThe orbital magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu}_L$ is related to the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ by:\n$\\vec{\\mu}_L = -\\frac{e}{2m_e}\\vec{L} = -\\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar}\\vec{L}$\nwhere $\\mu_B = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$ is the Bohr magneton.\n\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian expression:\n$H_p = \\left(-\\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar}\\vec{L}\\right) \\cdot \\vec{B} = \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar}(\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B})$\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is parallel to the z-axis, so $\\vec{B} = B\\hat{z}$. The dot product becomes:\n$\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{B} = L_z B$\n\nThus, the Hamiltonian is:\n$H_p = \\frac{\\mu_B B}{\\hbar}L_z$\n\nThe energy of this interaction is the expectation value of the Hamiltonian, $\\left\\langle H_p\\right\\rangle$. The eigenvalues of the $L_z$ operator are $m\\hbar$, where $m$ is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Therefore, the energy levels are quantized as:\n$E_p = \\left\\langle H_p\\right\\rangle = \\frac{\\mu_B B}{\\hbar}(m\\hbar) = m \\mu_B B$\n\nWe are given:\n*   $B = 1 \\text{ T}$\n*   $m$ is a small integer. For an order-of-magnitude calculation, let's take $m=1$.\n\nThe value of the Bohr magneton $\\mu_B$ is approximately $5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T}$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the paramagnetic energy:\n$E_p = (1) \\times (5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/T}) \\times (1 \\text{ T}) = 5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}$\n\nSo, the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling energy is $10^{-5} \\text{ eV}$.\n\n**2. Calculate the Transition Energy (`Î”E`)**\n\nThe transition energy corresponds to a photon with a given wavelength $\\lambda$. The relationship between energy and wavelength is:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$\n\nWe are given:\n*   $\\lambda = 0.4861 \\, \\mu\\text{m} = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nThe value of the product $hc$ (Planck's constant times the speed of light) is conveniently expressed as $1240 \\text{ eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}$.\nLet's convert the wavelength to nanometers:\n$\\lambda = 0.4861 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m} = 486.1 \\text{ nm}$\n\nNow, we can calculate the transition energy:\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{1240 \\text{ eV} \\cdot \\text{nm}}{486.1 \\text{ nm}} \\approx 2.55 \\text{ eV}$\n\nThis wavelength corresponds to the blue-green line in the hydrogen spectrum (the Balmer series transition from $n=4$ to $n=2$). The order of magnitude of this transition energy is approximately $1 \\text{ eV}$.\n\n**3. Compare the Orders of Magnitude**\n\nNow we compare the two energy values:\n*   Paramagnetic coupling energy: $E_p = \\left\\langle H_p\\right\\rangle \\approx 5.8 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}$\n*   Atomic transition energy: $\\Delta E \\approx 2.55 \\text{ eV}$\n\nLet's find the ratio:\n$\\frac{\\left\\langle H_p\\right\\rangle}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{5.788 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV}}{2.55 \\text{ eV}} \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nThis ratio is very small, which means the paramagnetic coupling energy is many orders of magnitude smaller than the atomic transition energy.\nTherefore, we can conclude that $\\left\\langle H_p\\right\\rangle \\ll \\Delta E$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
