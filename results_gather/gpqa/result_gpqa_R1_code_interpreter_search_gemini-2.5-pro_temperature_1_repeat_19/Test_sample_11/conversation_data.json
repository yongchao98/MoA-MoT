    "This problem involves the decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν). To solve this, we will use the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the process and given values:**\n    *   Decay reaction: π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν\n    *   Initial state: The pion (π⁺) is stationary.\n    *   Rest mass of π⁺ (m_π): 139.6 MeV/c²\n    *   Rest mass of μ⁺ (m_μ): 105.7 MeV/c²\n    *   We will assume the muon neutrino (ν) is massless (m_ν = 0), which is a standard approximation in such problems.\n\n2.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   The total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\n    *   **Initial Energy (E_initial):** Since the pion is stationary, its kinetic energy is zero. The total initial energy is its rest energy.\n        E_initial = m_π * c² = 139.6 MeV\n    *   **Final Energy (E_final):** The final energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon (E_μ) and the neutrino (E_ν). The total energy of a particle is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy (KE).\n        E_final = E_μ + E_ν = (m_μ*c² + KE_μ) + (m_ν*c² + KE_ν)\n    *   Assuming the neutrino is massless (m_ν = 0), its rest energy is zero, so E_ν = KE_ν.\n        E_final = (m_μ*c² + KE_μ) + KE_ν\n    *   Equating initial and final energies:\n        m_π*c² = m_μ*c² + KE_μ + KE_ν\n        139.6 MeV = 105.7 MeV + KE_μ + KE_ν\n        The total kinetic energy of the products is:\n        KE_μ + KE_ν = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV\n\n3.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   The total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\n    *   **Initial Momentum (p_initial):** Since the pion is stationary, the initial momentum is zero.\n    *   **Final Momentum (p_final):** The final momentum is the vector sum of the muon's momentum (p_μ) and the neutrino's momentum (p_ν).\n    *   To conserve momentum (p_initial = p_final = 0), the muon and neutrino must be emitted in opposite directions with equal magnitude of momentum.\n        |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p\n\n4.  **Relate Energy and Momentum and Solve:**\n    *   We use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n    *   For the massless neutrino: E_ν² = (p_νc)² + 0, so E_ν = p_νc = pc. Since E_ν = KE_ν, we have KE_ν = pc.\n    *   For the massive muon: E_μ² = (p_μc)² + (m_μc²)², so E_μ = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²).\n    *   Now substitute these into the energy conservation equation (E_π = E_μ + E_ν):\n        m_πc² = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²) + pc\n    *   Rearrange to solve for `pc` (the momentum-energy of the particles):\n        m_πc² - pc = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n    *   Square both sides:\n        (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n    *   The (pc)² terms cancel out:\n        (m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) = (m_μc²)²\n    *   Isolate `pc`:\n        (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² = 2(m_πc²)(pc)\n        pc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2(m_πc²)]\n\n5.  **Calculate the Numerical Values:**\n    *   We will use a Python script for precise calculation.\n\n```python\n# Given rest mass energies in MeV\nm_pi_c2 = 139.6\nm_mu_c2 = 105.7\n\n# Calculate pc (momentum-energy) using the derived formula\n# pc = [(m_pi*c^2)^2 - (m_mu*c^2)^2] / [2 * (m_pi*c^2)]\npc = (m_pi_c2**2 - m_mu_c2**2) / (2 * m_pi_c2)\n\n# The kinetic energy of the massless neutrino is equal to its total energy, which is pc.\nKE_nu = pc\n\n# The kinetic energy of the muon is the difference between its total energy and its rest energy.\n# Total energy of muon E_mu = sqrt((pc)^2 + (m_mu*c^2)^2)\n# KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu*c^2\nimport math\nKE_mu = math.sqrt(pc**2 + m_mu_c2**2) - m_mu_c2\n\n# Print the results rounded to two decimal places\nprint(f\"KE_mu = {KE_mu:.2f} MeV\")\nprint(f\"KE_nu = {KE_nu:.2f} MeV\")\n```\nKE_mu = 4.12 MeV\nKE_nu = 29.78 MeV\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon (μ⁺) and 29.8 MeV (rounding 29.78) for the neutrino (ν).\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nB) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nC) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\nD) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n\nOur calculated values (KE_μ = 4.12 MeV, KE_ν = 29.8 MeV) match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "This problem involves the decay of a stationary positive pion into a positive muon and a muon neutrino. We can solve this by applying the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\n**1. Initial State:**\n*   Particle: Positive Pion (π⁺)\n*   State: Stationary (at rest)\n*   Rest Mass Energy (m_πc²): 139.6 MeV\n*   Initial Total Energy (E_initial): Since it's at rest, the total energy is just its rest mass energy. E_initial = m_πc² = 139.6 MeV.\n*   Initial Momentum (p_initial): Since it's at rest, the initial momentum is zero.\n\n**2. Final State:**\n*   Particles: Positive Muon (μ⁺) and Muon Neutrino (ν)\n*   Rest Mass Energy of Muon (m_μc²): 105.7 MeV\n*   Rest Mass Energy of Neutrino (m_νc²): Assumed to be 0 (a standard and very good approximation).\n\n**3. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total energy before the decay must equal the total energy after the decay.\nE_initial = E_final\nm_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\nWhere E_μ and E_ν are the total energies of the muon and neutrino, respectively.\nThe total energy of a particle is the sum of its kinetic energy (KE) and its rest mass energy (mc²).\nE = KE + mc²\nSo, the energy conservation equation becomes:\nm_πc² = (KE_μ + m_μc²) + (KE_ν + m_νc²)\nSubstituting the known values and m_νc² = 0:\n139.6 MeV = (KE_μ + 105.7 MeV) + (KE_ν + 0)\nRearranging this, we find the total kinetic energy of the products:\nKE_μ + KE_ν = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV\n\n**4. Conservation of Momentum:**\nThe total momentum before the decay must equal the total momentum after the decay.\np_initial = p_final\nSince the pion is stationary, p_initial = 0. Therefore, the final total momentum must also be zero.\n0 = **p_μ** + **p_ν** (where the bold indicates vector quantities)\nThis means the muon and neutrino must travel in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude.\n|**p_μ**| = |**p_ν**| = p\n\n**5. Relating Energy and Momentum to Find Individual KEs:**\nWe use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².\n\n*   **For the neutrino (massless):**\n    E_ν² = (p_νc)² + (m_νc²)²\n    Since m_ν = 0, E_ν² = (pc)². Thus, E_ν = pc.\n    Also, for a massless particle, the total energy is purely kinetic, so KE_ν = E_ν = pc.\n\n*   **For the muon (massive):**\n    E_μ = KE_μ + m_μc²\n    We can also write E_μ = √( (p_μc)² + (m_μc²)² ) = √( (pc)² + (m_μc²)² )\n\nNow, substitute these expressions back into the energy conservation equation (m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν):\nm_πc² = √( (pc)² + (m_μc²)² ) + pc\nRearrange to solve for pc:\nm_πc² - pc = √( (pc)² + (m_μc²)² )\nSquare both sides:\n(m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\nThe (pc)² terms cancel out:\n(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) = (m_μc²)²\n2(m_πc²)(pc) = (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²\npc = [ (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² ] / [ 2(m_πc²) ]\n\n**6. Calculation:**\nNow, we plug in the values:\npc = [ (139.6)² - (105.7)² ] / [ 2 * 139.6 ]\npc = [ 19488.16 - 11172.49 ] / [ 279.2 ]\npc = 8315.67 / 279.2\npc ≈ 29.78 MeV\n\nNow we can find the kinetic energies:\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino (KE_ν):**\n    KE_ν = pc ≈ **29.8 MeV**\n\n*   **Kinetic Energy of the Muon (KE_μ):**\n    We know that the total KE is 33.9 MeV.\n    KE_μ = 33.9 MeV - KE_ν\n    KE_μ = 33.9 - 29.78 ≈ **4.12 MeV**\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. These values match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
