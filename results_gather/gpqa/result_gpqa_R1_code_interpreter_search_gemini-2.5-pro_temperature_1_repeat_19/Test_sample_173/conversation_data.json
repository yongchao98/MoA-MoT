    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem and Find Rest-Mass Energies**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is `M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n*   **Mass Relationship 1:** One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Let's designate `m1` as the more massive fragment, so `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n*   **Mass Relationship 2:** The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. So, `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\nWe can use these relationships to find the rest-mass energies of the fragments, `m1*c^2` and `m2*c^2`.\n\nFirst, let's find the sum of the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n`m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = (m1 + m2) * c^2 = (0.99 * M) * c^2 = 0.99 * (M*c^2)`\n`m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV`.\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n1.  `m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n2.  `m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2` (from `m1 = 2*m2`)\n\nSubstitute (2) into (1):\n`(2 * m2*c^2) + m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n`3 * m2*c^2 = 297 GeV`\n`m2*c^2 = 99 GeV`\n\nNow find `m1*c^2`:\n`m1*c^2 = 2 * m2*c^2 = 2 * 99 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n\nSo, the rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (`m1`) is 198 GeV, and the less massive one (`m2`) is 99 GeV.\n\n### **2. Calculate Total Kinetic Energy Released (Q-value)**\n\nThe total energy is conserved in the fission process. The initial energy is the rest energy of the parent nucleus. The final energy is the sum of the total energies (rest energy + kinetic energy) of the two fragments.\n\n*   `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`\n*   `E_final = (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2)`\n\nBy conservation of energy, `E_initial = E_final`:\n`300 GeV = (198 GeV + T1) + (99 GeV + T2)`\n`300 GeV = 297 GeV + T1 + T2`\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q-value) released is:\n`Q = T1 + T2 = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`.\n\n### **3. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) Kinetic Energy T1**\n\nFor the correct value, we must use relativistic mechanics.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial nucleus is at rest, so the initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the final total momentum must also be zero. The two fragments must fly off in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let this momentum magnitude be `p`.\n    `p1 = p2 = p`\n*   **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:** `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`.\n\nWe can write this for each fragment:\n*   `E1^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m1*c^2)^2`\n*   `E2^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m2*c^2)^2`\n\nFrom these, we can state that `(p*c)^2 = E1^2 - (m1*c^2)^2 = E2^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`.\nRearranging gives: `E1^2 - E2^2 = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`.\n\nWe also know from the conservation of total energy that `E1 + E2 = E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV`.\n\nNow we can solve for `E1`:\n` (E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1*c^2)^2 - (m2*c^2)^2`\n` (E1 - E2) * (300 GeV) = (198 GeV)^2 - (99 GeV)^2`\n` (E1 - E2) * 300 = (39204) - (9801) = 29403`\n` E1 - E2 = 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations for `E1` and `E2`:\n1.  `E1 + E2 = 300 GeV`\n2.  `E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV`\n\nAdding the two equations together:\n`2 * E1 = 398.01 GeV`\n`E1 = 199.005 GeV`\n\nThe kinetic energy `T1` is the total energy `E1` minus the rest-mass energy `m1*c^2`:\n`T1 = E1 - m1*c^2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV`.\n\n### **4. Calculate the Classical Approximation for T1**\n\nFor the classical approximation, we use non-relativistic formulas.\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** `p_c1 = p_c2 = p_c`.\n*   **Classical Kinetic Energy:** `T_c = p_c^2 / (2m)`.\n\nThe total kinetic energy released is the same: `T1_c + T2_c = 3 GeV`.\n\nWe can find the ratio of the classical kinetic energies:\n`T1_c / T2_c = (p_c^2 / (2*m1)) / (p_c^2 / (2*m2)) = m2 / m1`\n\nSince `m1 = 2 * m2`, the ratio is `m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`.\nSo, `T1_c / T2_c = 1/2`, which means `T2_c = 2 * T1_c`.\n\nNow substitute this into the total kinetic energy equation:\n`T1_c + T2_c = 3 GeV`\n`T1_c + (2 * T1_c) = 3 GeV`\n`3 * T1_c = 3 GeV`\n`T1_c = 1 GeV`.\n\n### **5. Find the Difference**\n\nThe final step is to find the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation.\n\n*   Correct T1 = 1.005 GeV\n*   Classical T1_c = 1 GeV\n*   Difference = `T1 - T1_c = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV`.\n\nThe question asks for the answer in MeV. We use the conversion `1 GeV = 1000 MeV`.\nDifference = `0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
