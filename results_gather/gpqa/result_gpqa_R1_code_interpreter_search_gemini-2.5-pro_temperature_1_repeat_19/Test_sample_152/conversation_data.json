    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reactants and products for each reaction.\n\n### **Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) --> (A)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Dimethyl malonate, CH₂(COOCH₃)₂, has acidic protons on the central carbon (α-carbon) because the resulting negative charge is stabilized by resonance with two adjacent carbonyl groups. The base, sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), deprotonates dimethyl malonate to form a nucleophilic enolate ion:\n    `⁻CH(COOCH₃)₂`\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The p-tolyl group is a benzene ring with a methyl group at the para position.\n    Structure: `p-Tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOCH₃`\n    The β-carbon is the electrophilic site that will be attacked by the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:** The enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. The π electrons of the double bond move to the α-carbon, forming a new enolate intermediate.\n    `p-Tolyl-CH(β)(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - ⁻C(α)H-COOCH₃`\n\n4.  **Protonation:** The enolate intermediate is protonated by the solvent, ethanol (EtOH), to yield the final product (A).\n    `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂(α) - COOCH₃`\n\n5.  **Naming the Product (A):** Let's analyze the structure `p-Tolyl-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂ - COOCH₃`. This can be named as a substituted propane tricarboxylate. The main chain consists of the three carbons that form the backbone of the new molecule: the α-carbon from the malonate and the α and β carbons from the acrylate.\n    *   Let C1 be the carbon from dimethyl malonate, which is bonded to two `-COOCH₃` groups.\n    *   Let C2 be the β-carbon from the acrylate, which is bonded to the `p-tolyl` group.\n    *   Let C3 be the α-carbon from the acrylate, which is bonded to the final `-COOCH₃` group (via its carbonyl carbon).\n    The structure is `(MeOOC)₂CH(1)-CH(p-tolyl)(2)-CH₂(3)-COOMe`. This name corresponds to **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)**\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are excellent nucleophiles at the β-carbon (the C2 of the original cyclohexanone ring). This is a Stork enamine alkylation, which proceeds via a Michael addition mechanism.\n\n2.  **Identify the Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    Structure: `CH₃-CH(β)=CH(α)-CN`\n    The β-carbon is the electrophilic site.\n\n3.  **The Michael Addition Step:** The nucleophilic carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond and an iminium ion intermediate.\n\n4.  **Hydrolysis:** The acidic workup (H₃O⁺) hydrolyzes the iminium ion back into a carbonyl group. This regenerates the cyclohexanone ring. The nitrile group remains intact under these mild conditions. The final product (B) is a cyclohexanone ring substituted at the C2 position. The substituent is derived from the but-2-enenitrile: `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n\n5.  **Naming the Product (B):** The product is 2-(-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN)cyclohexanone. According to IUPAC rules, if a chain attached to a ring has a principal functional group (here, the nitrile -CN), the chain becomes the parent name.\n    *   The parent chain is butanenitrile: `NC(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H-C(4)H₃`.\n    *   At position 3, there is a `2-oxocyclohexyl` substituent.\n    *   Therefore, the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative name in the options, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, represents the enol tautomer. The keto form is the major, more stable product under these conditions.\n\n### **Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction (Retro-Michael Analysis):** We are given the product and one reactant and need to find the other reactant (C). This is a Michael addition.\n2.  **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. This consists of a `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` ring with a `-(CH₂)CH₂C(=O)CH₃` (3-oxobutyl) group attached at C2.\n3.  **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK). Structure: `CH₂=CH-C(=O)CH₃`. Upon Michael addition, this becomes the `-(CH₂)CH₂C(=O)CH₃` group seen in the product.\n4.  **Michael Donor (Reactant C):** The new bond in the product is between the C2 of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring and the β-carbon of the MVK. This means the nucleophile was the enolate of the species at the C2 position. The protons at C2 of `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` are highly acidic because they are flanked by two carbonyl groups. The base (KOH) deprotonates this position to form the nucleophilic enolate. Therefore, reactant C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **A:** trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B:** 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C:** cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n\n*   A) Incorrect (Name for A and B are wrong)\n*   B) **A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione** (Correct for all three)\n*   C) Incorrect (Name for C is wrong)\n*   D) Incorrect (Name for A, B, and C are wrong)\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
