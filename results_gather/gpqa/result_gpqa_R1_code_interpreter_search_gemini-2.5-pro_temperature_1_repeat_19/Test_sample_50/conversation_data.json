    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical System and Method:**\n    The problem describes a point charge `q` near a grounded conducting sphere. This is a classic electrostatic problem that is most easily solved using the **method of images**. The principle of this method is to replace the complex charge distribution induced on the surface of the conductor with a simple, fictitious \"image charge\" placed inside the conductor. This combination of the original charge and the image charge must satisfy the boundary condition that the potential on the surface of the conductor is zero (since it is grounded).\n\n2.  **Determine the Image Charge and its Location:**\n    For a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the equivalent image system consists of:\n    *   The original charge `q` at distance `d` from the center.\n    *   An image charge `q'` of magnitude:\n        `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n    *   The image charge `q'` is located inside the sphere along the same line as the original charge, at a distance `d'` from the center:\n        `d' = R^2 / d`\n\n    This configuration of `q` and `q'` ensures that the potential at any point on the surface of the sphere (at radius `R`) is zero, satisfying the boundary condition of the grounded sphere.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Potential Energy:**\n    The potential energy of the original system (charge `q` and the induced charge on the sphere) is equal to the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`.\n\n    A common pitfall is to simply calculate the interaction energy between the real charge `q` and the image charge `q'`. This is incorrect because the image charge is fictitious, and the electric field only exists outside the sphere in the real problem, whereas the field from the `q-q'` pair exists everywhere.\n\n    The correct way to calculate the potential energy `U` is to consider the work done. The work done in bringing the charge `q` into the presence of the grounded sphere is half the product of the charge and the potential created at its location by the induced charges.\n    \n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\n    Where `V_induced` is the potential at the location of `q` due to the induced charges on the sphere. By the method of images, this potential is exactly the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the location of `q`.\n\n4.  **Calculate V_induced:**\n    *   The potential `V_induced` is the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the position of the real charge `q`.\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `d'`) is:\n        `distance = d - d' = d - (R^2 / d) = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n    *   The potential at the location of `q` due to `q'` is:\n        `V_induced = k * q' / (distance)`\n        where `k = 1 / (4πε₀)` is Coulomb's constant.\n    *   Substituting the expressions for `q'` and the distance:\n        `V_induced = k * [- (R/d) * q] / [(d^2 - R^2) / d]`\n    *   Simplifying the expression by canceling `d` from the numerator and denominator:\n        `V_induced = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Potential Energy U:**\n    Now, substitute the expression for `V_induced` back into the energy formula:\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [- k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated potential energy is `U = - (1/2) * kq^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`.\n    This matches option A.\n\n    *   A) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)  --> **Correct**\n    *   B) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2) --> Incorrect\n    *   C) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)   --> Incorrect\n    *   D) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)          --> Incorrect\n\nThe factor of `1/2` is crucial and arises because the induced charge itself is created by the presence of `q`. The energy is stored in the electric field, and calculating the work done to assemble the system correctly introduces this factor.\n\n<<<A>>>"
