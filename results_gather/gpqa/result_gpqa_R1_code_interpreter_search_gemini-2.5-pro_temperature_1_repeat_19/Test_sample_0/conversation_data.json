    "This problem can be solved using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in a quantum state's energy (ΔE) to its lifetime (Δt).\n\n### **Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principle:** The relationship between the lifetime of a quantum state and the \"sharpness\" or certainty of its energy level is described by the energy-time formulation of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n2.  **State the principle:** The principle is given by the formula:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    where:\n    *   ΔE is the uncertainty in energy (also known as the natural linewidth).\n    *   Δt is the lifetime of the state.\n    *   ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ = h / 2π).\n\n    For order-of-magnitude calculations, this is often simplified to:\n    ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt\n\n3.  **Define the condition for distinguishability:** For two energy levels, E1 and E2, to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguished, the difference in their energies, |E1 - E2|, must be greater than their combined energy uncertainties. A common and practical criterion is that the energy difference must be at least as large as the larger of the two individual energy widths (ΔE1 or ΔE2).\n    *   Energy level 1 has a lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s. Its energy width is ΔE₁.\n    *   Energy level 2 has a lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s. Its energy width is ΔE₂.\n    *   Condition for resolution: |E1 - E2| > max(ΔE₁, ΔE₂)\n\n4.  **Calculate the energy widths:** We need to calculate ΔE for each state. The state with the shorter lifetime will have the larger energy uncertainty.\n    *   For state 1: Δt₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   For state 2: Δt₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n\n    Since τ₁ < τ₂, it follows that ΔE₁ > ΔE₂. Therefore, the dominant uncertainty comes from state 1, and the minimum energy separation required will be on the order of ΔE₁.\n\n5.  **Perform the calculation for ΔE₁:** We will use a Python script to perform the calculation accurately, including the conversion from Joules to electron-volts (eV).\n\n    *   Reduced Planck Constant (ħ) ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   Charge of an electron (e) ≈ 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ C (so 1 eV = 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ J)\n    *   ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁\n\n```python\n# Constants\nhbar_Js = 1.05457e-34  # Reduced Planck constant in J.s\nJ_to_eV = 1.60218e-19   # Conversion factor from Joules to eV\n\n# Lifetimes from the problem\ntau1 = 1e-9   # seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8   # seconds\n\n# Calculate the energy uncertainty (linewidth) for the state with the shorter lifetime (tau1),\n# as this will be the larger uncertainty and thus the limiting factor for resolution.\n# We use the approximation Delta_E ~ hbar / tau.\ndelta_E1_Js = hbar_Js / tau1\ndelta_E1_eV = delta_E1_Js / J_to_eV\n\n# We also calculate the linewidth for the second state for completeness.\ndelta_E2_Js = hbar_Js / tau2\ndelta_E2_eV = delta_E2_Js / J_to_eV\n\nprint(f\"Linewidth of state 1 (τ = {tau1} s): {delta_E1_eV:.3e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Linewidth of state 2 (τ = {tau2} s): {delta_E2_eV:.3e} eV\")\nprint(\"\\nTo clearly resolve the two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than the larger linewidth.\")\nprint(f\"The required energy difference is approximately > {delta_E1_eV:.3e} eV.\")\n```\n<execute_output>\nLinewidth of state 1 (τ = 1e-09 s): 6.582e-07 eV\nLinewidth of state 2 (τ = 1e-08 s): 6.582e-08 eV\n\nTo clearly resolve the two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than the larger linewidth.\nThe required energy difference is approximately > 6.582e-07 eV.\n</execute_output>\n\n6.  **Analyze the result:** The calculation shows that the larger energy width (from the state with the 10⁻⁹ s lifetime) is approximately 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV. To resolve the two levels, their energy difference must be greater than this value.\n\n7.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    A) 10⁻⁴ eV\n    B) 10⁻⁹ eV\n    C) 10⁻⁸ eV\n    D) 10⁻¹¹ eV\n\n    We need an energy difference > 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   10⁻⁴ eV is much larger than 6.58 × 10⁻⁷ eV.\n    *   10⁻⁹ eV is smaller.\n    *   10⁻⁸ eV is smaller.\n    *   10⁻¹¹ eV is smaller.\n\n    Only the value in option A (10⁻⁴ eV) is sufficiently large to ensure the two energy levels can be clearly distinguished.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "To clearly distinguish or resolve two energy levels, their energy difference (ΔE_diff = |E1 - E2|) must be greater than the uncertainty in their energies. The energy uncertainty (or natural linewidth, Γ) of a quantum state is related to its lifetime (τ) by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n\nΓ ⋅ τ ≈ ħ\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s).\n\nThe energy uncertainty for each state is:\n*   **State 1:** τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    Γ₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **State 2:** τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    Γ₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ ≈ (6.582 × 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 × 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nThe state with the shorter lifetime (State 1) has the larger energy uncertainty (Γ₁). For the two energy levels to be clearly resolved, their energy separation must be larger than the largest of these uncertainties.
