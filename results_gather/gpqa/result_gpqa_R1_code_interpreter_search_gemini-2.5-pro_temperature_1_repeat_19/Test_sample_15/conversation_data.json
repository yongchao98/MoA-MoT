    "A molecule is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a racemic mixture (an equal mixture of both enantiomers). A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality is the presence of one or more stereocenters. However, a molecule with stereocenters can be achiral if it has an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion (these are called meso compounds).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH3)-CH2CH3`.\n    *   The molecule has a double bond. The atoms connected to the double bond (Cl, H, C, CH3, C of ethyl) lie in the same plane. This plane acts as a plane of symmetry for the entire molecule.\n    *   Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:\n    *   This is a complex molecule with multiple stereocenters.\n    *   The name explicitly gives the absolute configuration for several of these centers (`3aR`, `7aS`) and for a double bond (`E`).\n    *   When a specific enantiomer or diastereomer is indicated by R/S notations, it implies the molecule is a single stereoisomer.\n    *   A single enantiomer of a chiral compound is, by definition, optically active. While it is possible for a compound with R and S descriptors to be a meso compound (achiral), the complex and asymmetric nature of this bicyclic system, along with the non-equivalent stereocenters (3a and 7a), makes it virtually certain to be chiral. The naming convention confirms we are dealing with a specific, resolved stereoisomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH`. It has two stereocenters at C2 and C3.\n    *   The substituents on C2 are the same as on C3 (-H, -CH3, -COOH, and the other chiral group). This means a meso form is possible.\n    *   The meso form is the one with opposite configurations at the two equivalent stereocenters, i.e., (R,S) or (S,R).\n    *   Let's check for symmetry. The (2R,3S) isomer has a center of inversion when in the anti-periplanar conformation. A center of inversion makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   This is a classic example of a meso compound.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:\n    *   This is a diastereomer of the meso compound described above.\n    *   The (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) isomers form a pair of enantiomers. They are chiral and non-superimposable on their mirror images.\n    *   Since the compound is specified as a single enantiomer (2R,3R), it will rotate plane-polarized light.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (C3=C4) and an alcohol group (at C1).\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, the `-CH2-CH=` part of the ring, and the `-CH=CH-CH2-` part of the ring. These two paths around the ring are different. Thus, C1 is a stereocenter.\n    *   A molecule with a single stereocenter is always chiral. The name specifies the (R)-enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The `s` notation (or assuming it means S for `sinister` or `syn`) indicates that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   This all-cis isomer is highly symmetrical. Whether the OH groups are all axial or all equatorial (in the chair conformations), the molecule possesses a three-fold axis of rotation (C3) and three vertical planes of symmetry (Ïƒv).\n    *   The presence of planes of symmetry makes the molecule achiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:\n    *   The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n    *   We need to check for any stereocenters. A stereocenter is typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   There are no such carbon atoms in this molecule. The `CH` in the `CH(CH3)2` (isopropyl) group is attached to two identical methyl groups. All carbons in the cyclopentyl ring are CH2 groups.\n    *   The molecule lacks any chiral centers or other elements of chirality (like axial or planar chirality). It has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   Therefore, this compound is **optically inactive**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWe have identified three optically active compounds from the list:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nSo, the total number of optically active compounds is 3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
