    "*   **Analysis of the Molecular Formula: C9H11NO2**\n    *   First, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation (DoU) to get an idea of the rings and/or pi bonds.\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) - (X/2) + (N/2)\n    *   DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n    *   A DoU of 5 is a strong indication of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees of unsaturation: 1 ring + 3 double bonds) and one additional double bond, most likely a C=O or C=N bond.\n\n*   **Analysis of the IR Spectrum**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region (3300-3500 cm⁻¹) is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A value of ~1720 cm⁻¹ is typical for an ester, specifically an aromatic ester where the carbonyl is conjugated with the benzene ring. It's a bit high for a simple amide and too low for an acid chloride.\n\n*   **Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** The 't' stands for triplet, and '3H' means it integrates to three protons. A triplet for 3 protons is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This suggests an ethyl group fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** The 'q' stands for quartet, and '2H' means it integrates to two protons. A quartet for 2 protons is characteristic of a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃-). This confirms the presence of an ethyl group. The chemical shift is significantly downfield at 4.5 ppm. A -CH₂- group attached to an oxygen atom in an ester (-O-CH₂-R) typically appears around 4.1-4.7 ppm. This strongly suggests an ethyl ester fragment (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** The 'bs' stands for broad singlet, and '2H' means it integrates to two protons. A broad signal in this region that corresponds to 2 protons is very characteristic of a primary amine (-NH₂). The protons are exchangeable with trace acid/water in the solvent, which causes the signal to broaden. The chemical shift is consistent with an aniline-type amine (an amine attached to a benzene ring).\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The 'd' stands for doublet. Having two doublets, each integrating to two protons, in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm) is the classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two substituents are different, one being electron-donating and the other electron-withdrawing.\n        *   The amine group (-NH₂) is an electron-donating group, which shields the ortho protons, shifting them upfield.\n        *   The ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) is an electron-withdrawing group, which deshields the ortho protons, shifting them downfield.\n        *   Therefore, the doublet at the lower chemical shift (7.0 ppm) corresponds to the two protons ortho to the -NH₂ group.\n        *   The doublet at the higher chemical shift (8.0 ppm) corresponds to the two protons ortho to the -COOCH₂CH₃ group.\n\n*   **Putting the Pieces Together**\n    1.  We have a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  One substituent is a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    3.  The other substituent is an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    4.  This structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n*   **Verifying the Options**\n    *   A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: This is a secondary amine (amide) and would only have one N-H IR band and a different NMR pattern.\n    *   B) 4-aminophenyl propionate: This is a phenyl ester. The ethyl group would be attached to the carbonyl (-COCH₂CH₃), and its -CH₂- signal would be a quartet around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n    *   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** This structure perfectly matches all the spectral data: a primary amine, an ethyl ester, and a 1,4-disubstituted ring with the correct electronic effects reflected in the aromatic proton chemical shifts. The molecular formula C₉H₁₁NO₂ is also correct.\n    *   D) 3-ethoxybenzamide: This is a 1,3-disubstituted (meta) ring, which would give a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR, not two clean doublets.\n\n<<<C>>>"
