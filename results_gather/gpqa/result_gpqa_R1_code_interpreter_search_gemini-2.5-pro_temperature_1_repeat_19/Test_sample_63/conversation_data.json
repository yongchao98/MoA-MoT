    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the mass changes in the tubes to identify the gaseous products.**\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced by the decomposition.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which tests for acidic gases like CO₂ (by forming a precipitate, CaCO₃). Since the mass of the tube did not change, no CO₂ or other acidic gases were formed. This indicates the salts do not contain carbonate ions or organic anions that would decompose into CO₂.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases, most commonly oxygen (O₂), but also others like nitrogen oxides (e.g., N₂O). The reaction with oxygen is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the oxygen that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas C remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas did not react with a desiccant, limewater, or hot copper. The most plausible identity for such an inert gas in the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n**2. Determine the elemental composition of the initial salt mixture.**\n\nThe elements in the products (H₂O, O-atoms, N₂) must have originated from the initial 7.20 g mixture of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** All hydrogen is in the 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n    *   Moles of H = 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.40 mol × 1.0 g/mol = 0.40 g.\n\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** All nitrogen ends up as the final gas C, which we identified as N₂.\n    *   Moles of N = 2 × Moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   Mass of N = 0.20 mol × 14.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** Oxygen is found in the water produced and in the copper oxide formed.\n    *   Moles of O = (Moles of O in H₂O) + (Moles of O reacted with Cu)\n    *   Moles of O = (1 × 0.20 mol) + 0.05 mol = 0.25 mol.\n    *   Mass of O = 0.25 mol × 16.0 g/mol = 4.00 g.\n\n*   **Verify Total Mass:**\n    *   Total mass = Mass(H) + Mass(N) + Mass(O) = 0.40 g + 2.80 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the initial mass of the mixture, confirming that the salts A and B are composed only of hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B.**\n\nThe salts are composed of N, H, and O. They are salts, implying an ionic structure, likely consisting of the ammonium cation (NH₄⁺) and an oxygen-containing anion of nitrogen (oxyanion). The most common such salts are:\n*   Ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂)\n*   Ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let 'n' be the number of moles of salt A and 'n' be the number of moles of salt B. We can use the total moles of each element to find 'n'.\n\nLet's assume A = NH₄NO₂ and B = NH₄NO₃.\n*   Formula of A: N₂H₄O₂\n*   Formula of B: N₂H₄O₃\n\nNow, let's write the balance for total moles of each element in the mixture:\n*   **Total H:** n(moles of H in A) + n(moles of H in B) = n(4) + n(4) = 8n.\n    *   We found total moles of H = 0.40 mol. So, 8n = 0.40 ⇒ n = 0.05 mol.\n*   **Total N:** n(moles of N in A) + n(moles of N in B) = n(2) + n(2) = 4n.\n    *   We found total moles of N = 0.20 mol. So, 4n = 0.20 ⇒ n = 0.05 mol.\n*   **Total O:** n(moles of O in A) + n(moles of O in B) = n(2) + n(3) = 5n.\n    *   We found total moles of O = 0.25 mol. So, 5n = 0.25 ⇒ n = 0.05 mol.\n\nThe value n = 0.05 mol is consistent for all three elements. This confirms that the salts are indeed ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n**4. Calculate the total number of atoms.**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. This refers to the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Number of atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 2 (O) = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Number of atoms = 1 (N) + 4 (H) + 1 (N) + 3 (O) = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms:**\n    *   Total = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThe total number of atoms is 17. This corresponds to option B.\n\nTo be thorough, let's check if the decomposition reactions match the products.\n*   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   0.05 mol → 0.05 mol N₂ + 0.10 mol H₂O\n*   There are two main decomposition paths for NH₄NO₃. Both are consistent with our findings.\n    *   Path 1: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n        *   0.05 mol → 0.05 mol N₂ + 0.025 mol O₂ + 0.10 mol H₂O\n    *   Path 2: NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g), where N₂O then reacts with Cu: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO.\n        *   0.05 mol → 0.05 mol N₂O + 0.10 mol H₂O\n\nTotal products (using Path 1):\n*   Total N₂ = 0.05 (from A) + 0.05 (from B) = 0.10 mol (matches Gas C).\n*   Total H₂O = 0.10 (from A) + 0.10 (from B) = 0.20 mol (matches Tube 1).\n*   Total O₂ = 0.025 mol (from B). This contains 0.05 mol of O atoms (matches Tube 3).\n\nThe analysis is fully consistent.\n\n<<<B>>>"
