    "The user wants to identify the fundamental symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT).\n\n1.  **Analyze the SMEFT framework:** SMEFT is an extension of the Standard Model (SM) that includes higher-dimensional operators. It is built upon the core principles of quantum field theory (QFT) and the known symmetries of the SM. The basic assumptions for constructing the SMEFT Lagrangian are:\n    *   The theory is a local quantum field theory.\n    *   The field content is that of the Standard Model.\n    *   The theory respects the SM gauge symmetry: SU(3)c x SU(2)L x U(1)Y.\n    *   The theory respects the fundamental spacetime symmetries of a relativistic QFT.\n\n2.  **Evaluate each proposed symmetry:**\n\n    *   **1. Lorentz Symmetry:** This is the symmetry of spacetime under rotations and boosts. It is a cornerstone of special relativity and all relativistic quantum field theories, including the Standard Model. SMEFT is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant theory. All operators added to the Lagrangian must be Lorentz scalars to ensure the action is invariant. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n    *   **2. Poincare Symmetry:** This group extends Lorentz symmetry to include spacetime translations. Invariance under translations leads to the conservation of energy and momentum. Like Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry is a fundamental assumption in the construction of the SM and SMEFT. Therefore, Poincare symmetry must be respected.\n\n    *   **3. CP Symmetry:** This is the combination of Charge Conjugation (C) and Parity (P). It is well-established experimentally that CP symmetry is violated in the weak interactions of the Standard Model itself (e.g., via the complex phase in the CKM matrix). Since the SM already violates CP, there is no reason to impose this symmetry on the higher-dimensional operators of SMEFT. In fact, these new operators can introduce new sources of CP violation, which are actively sought in experiments like searches for electric dipole moments. Therefore, CP symmetry is *not* a required symmetry for all SMEFT operators.\n\n    *   **4. CPT Symmetry:** This is the combination of Charge Conjugation (C), Parity (P), and Time Reversal (T). The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in QFT which states that any local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must be CPT invariant. Since SMEFT is formulated as a local and Lorentz-invariant QFT, it must respect CPT symmetry. A violation of CPT would imply a violation of Lorentz invariance, which contradicts the foundational assumptions of SMEFT. Therefore, CPT symmetry must be respected.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the standard formulation of SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4).\n\n4.  **Match with options:** The option that includes 1, 2, and 4 is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
