    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the structure of the final product and the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. This reaction halogenates the α-carbon of a carboxylic acid. The α-carbon in acetic acid is the methyl group. One of the α-hydrogens will be substituted by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (BrCH2COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (BrCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a good nucleophile and will attack the carbon bearing the bromine atom, displacing the bromide ion (Br⁻), which is a good leaving group.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (NCCH2COOCH2CH3) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and then 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a sequential alkylation reaction leading to cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base. It removes an acidic α-hydrogen from the carbon between the cyano (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups, forming a resonance-stabilized carbanion (enolate).\n        `NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na⁺ [NC-CH⁻-COOEt] + H₂`\n    2.  **First Alkylation (Intermolecular):** The carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule in an SN2 reaction.\n        `[NC-CH⁻-COOEt] + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br⁻`\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The problem states \"excess\" NaH is used. This means there is enough base to deprotonate the newly formed mono-alkylated product, which still has one acidic α-hydrogen.\n        `NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → Na⁺ [NC-C⁻(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br] + H₂`\n    4.  **Second Alkylation (Intramolecular):** The new carbanion attacks the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion. This is an intramolecular SN2 reaction that forms a ring. The ring will contain the α-carbon and the five carbons from the dibromopentane, forming a 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n**Structure of Product 4:**\n```\n      CN\n     /\n C1 --(Cyclohexane ring)\n   \\\n    COOCH2CH3\n```\nC1 is a quaternary carbon atom bonded to a cyano group, an ethyl ester group, and C2 and C6 of the cyclohexane ring.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nNow, we must determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n1.  **Symmetry:** The molecule has a chiral center at C1. Therefore, in a static conformation, it has no plane of symmetry or axis of rotation. A strictly rigorous analysis would mean every proton on the ring is unique, and the two protons of the ethyl group's -CH2- are also unique (diastereotopic). This would give: 10 (ring) + 2 (OCH2) + 1 (CH3) = 13 signals. This is not among the options, indicating a simplification is expected.\n\n2.  **Standard Simplifications in NMR:**\n    *   **Conformational Averaging:** At room temperature, cyclohexanes undergo rapid chair-flipping. This creates a time-averaged structure with an \"effective\" plane of symmetry that passes through C1 and C4. This makes the protons on C2 equivalent to those on C6, and the protons on C3 equivalent to those on C5.\n    *   **Diastereotopicity:** Protons on a -CH2- group are diastereotopic if the molecule contains a chiral center and there is no local plane of symmetry. Diastereotopic protons are chemically distinct and should give separate signals. This applies to all the -CH2- groups in the cyclohexane ring and the -CH2- group in the ethyl ester.\n\n3.  **Applying the Simplifications to find the intended answer:**\n    Let's combine these concepts as is common in organic chemistry problems. We'll use the effective symmetry from chair-flipping but must decide how to handle diastereotopicity.\n\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-OCH2CH3):**\n        *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH3) group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   The two protons of the methylene (-OCH2-) group are diastereotopic. However, in many textbook problems, the chemical shift difference for diastereotopic protons in a flexible, acyclic chain is considered negligible, and they are treated as giving a single signal. Let's adopt this simplification. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   Due to the effective symmetry plane, we have three sets of carbons: {C2, C6}, {C3, C5}, and {C4}.\n        *   The two protons on C4 are diastereotopic with respect to the chiral center C1. In the more rigid ring system, this effect is generally considered significant. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   The protons on C3 and C5 are equivalent by symmetry. Within each CH2 group, the two protons are diastereotopic. This results in two distinct signals for this set of four protons. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   The protons on C2 and C6 are equivalent by symmetry. Similar to the C3/C5 case, the two protons within each CH2 group are diastereotopic. This gives **2 signals**.\n        *   Total signals from the ring = 2 (from C4) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C2/C6) = **6 signals**.\n\n4.  **Total Number of Signals:**\n    Adding the signals from all parts of the molecule:\n    Total signals = (Ring signals) + (Ethyl group signals) = 6 + (1 + 1) = **8 signals**.\n\nThis matches option C. This model represents a common level of analysis for such problems, acknowledging diastereotopicity in the rigid ring while simplifying it for the flexible side chain.\n\n<<<C>>>"
