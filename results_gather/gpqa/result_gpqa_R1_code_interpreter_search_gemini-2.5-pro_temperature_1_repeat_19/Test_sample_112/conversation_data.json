    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a hallmark feature of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH). The peak is exceptionally broad due to the strong hydrogen bonding in carboxylic acid dimers. While alcohols also show an O-H stretch, it is typically less broad and centered at a higher wavenumber (around 3200-3600 cm⁻¹).\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls squarely in the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, the C=O stretch of a carboxylic acid is typically found around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a double bond. The presence of these peaks in the ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of a C=C double bond, which supports the conclusion drawn from the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak in the FTIR spectrum.\n\n**Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The compound contains a C=C double bond.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum**\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxylic acid group itself.\n    *   Mass of -COOH = Mass(C) + 2 * Mass(O) + Mass(H) = 12 + 2 * 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n*   This fragment, [COOH]⁺, is readily formed from carboxylic acids via cleavage of the bond adjacent to the carboxyl group. Its presence is strong evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from Mass Spectrometry:** The compound is likely a carboxylic acid.\n\n**4. Synthesizing the Data and Evaluating the Options**\n\nBased on all the evidence, the unknown compound is an **alkenoic acid** (a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and a C=C double bond).\n\n*   The presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) means the molecule must contain **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options A) C₆H₁₀O and B) C₆H₁₂O.\n\nWe are left with two possibilities:\n*   C) C₆H₁₀O₂\n*   D) C₆H₁₂O₂\n\nTo distinguish between these two, we can calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**. The DoU indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\nThe formula is: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2), where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of hydrogens.\n\nFrom our spectral analysis, we know the molecule must contain:\n*   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid), which accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n*   One C=C double bond (from the alkene), which accounts for another 1 degree of unsaturation.\n*   Therefore, the correct formula must have a **total DoU of 2**.\n\nLet's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n\n*   **For C) C₆H₁₀O₂:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n    This DoU of 2 perfectly matches our requirement for one C=O and one C=C bond.\n\n*   **For D) C₆H₁₂O₂:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    A DoU of 1 means there is only one double bond (or ring). If the molecule is a carboxylic acid, this single degree of unsaturation is accounted for by the C=O bond, leaving no room for the C=C bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR. Therefore, this formula is incorrect.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data (FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry) is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>"
