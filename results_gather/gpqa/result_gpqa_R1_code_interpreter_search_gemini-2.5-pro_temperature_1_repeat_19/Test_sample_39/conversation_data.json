    "The user is asking for the meaning of a colloquial phrase used in a specific professional context.\n\n1.  **Analyze the context:** The setting is a synthetic organic chemistry lab. The goal of a synthetic chemist is often to create a new compound (the product). This product is usually mixed with leftover starting materials, byproducts, and catalysts. A crucial step after the reaction is **purification**, which means separating the desired product from all the other unwanted compounds.\n\n2.  **Analyze the phrase:** \"My compounds are on top of each other.\" This language suggests a visualization of the separation process. The chemist is trying to separate multiple compounds, but they are failing to do so because they remain mixed. The phrase \"on top of each other\" is a very common way to describe what happens during **chromatography**.\n\n3.  **Consider Chromatography:** Chromatography is a primary technique for separating compounds in an organic chemistry lab.\n    *   **Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC):** A drop of the mixture is placed on a plate coated with a stationary phase (like silica gel). A solvent (mobile phase) then moves up the plate. Compounds separate based on how strongly they stick to the stationary phase versus how well they dissolve in the mobile phase. This property is primarily determined by the compound's **polarity**. The result is a series of spots at different heights. If two compounds have very similar polarities, their spots will be at the same height, appearing \"on top of each other.\"\n    *   **Column Chromatography:** This is a larger-scale version of TLC used for purification. The mixture is loaded onto the top of a column packed with the stationary phase, and the mobile phase is dripped through. Compounds travel down the column at different rates and are collected in separate fractions. If two compounds have very similar **polarities**, they will travel at nearly the same speed, and their \"bands\" will overlap, co-eluting from the column. A chemist would describe these overlapping bands as being \"on top of each other.\"\n\n4.  **Evaluate the given options:**\n    *   **A) The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points.** This would make separation by *distillation* difficult. While a valid separation problem, the phrase \"on top of each other\" is not the typical way to describe a failed distillation. One might say \"they co-distill\" or \"the boiling points are too close.\" The visual metaphor of \"on top of each other\" strongly points to chromatography.\n    *   **B) The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations.** Optical rotation is a physical property used for characterization, not separation. It doesn't relate to the physical process of separating two different molecules from a mixture.\n    *   **C) The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.** While these forces are the basis for physical properties like polarity and boiling point, this statement is too general. It describes the underlying physics but not the specific experimental problem the chemist is observing and describing with the phrase. The problem isn't that they are bonding, but that the *consequence* of their properties makes them inseparable by a given technique.\n    *   **D) The compounds they are working with have similar polarities.** This is the direct cause of a failed chromatographic separation. Similar polarities mean the compounds behave almost identically during chromatography, resulting in their spots or bands being \"on top of each other.\" This is the most direct and common interpretation of the chemist's statement.\n\n**Conclusion:** The phrase \"on top of each other\" is a classic piece of lab jargon referring to the failure to separate compounds using chromatography. The fundamental property that governs separation in the most common forms of chromatography (normal and reverse-phase) is polarity. Therefore, the chemist is complaining that their compounds have similar polarities.\n\n<<<D>>>"
