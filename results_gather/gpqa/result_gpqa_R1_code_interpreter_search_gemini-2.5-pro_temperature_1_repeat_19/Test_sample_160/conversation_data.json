    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Core Concepts\n\n*   **Mean Free Path (MFP, λ):** This is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is `λ = 1 / (n * σ)`, where `n` is the number density of the target particles and `σ` is the collision cross-section.\n*   **Collision Cross-Section (σ):** This is the effective area that one particle presents to another for a collision to occur. It depends on the size, speed, and nature of the interacting particles.\n*   **λ1:** The mean free path of gas molecules colliding with other gas molecules.\n*   **λ2:** The mean free path of high-energy electrons from the TEM beam colliding with the same gas molecules.\n\n### 2. Analyze λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions)\n\n*   The moving particles are gas molecules.\n*   The target particles are also gas molecules.\n*   The number density of target particles is `n_gas`.\n*   The collision involves two particles of similar mass and speed (determined by temperature). Kinetic theory for a gas of identical molecules shows that the relative motion introduces a factor of `√2`.\n*   The collision cross-section, `σ_gg`, is determined by the size of the molecules. If we model a molecule as a hard sphere with diameter `d`, a collision occurs if the centers of two molecules approach within a distance `d`. The effective target area is thus a circle of radius `d`, so `σ_gg = π * d²`.\n*   The formula for the mean free path is: `λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ_gg) = 1 / (√2 * n_gas * π * d²)`.\n\n### 3. Analyze λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions)\n\n*   The moving particles are high-energy electrons (1000 keV).\n*   The target particles are the gas molecules, with the same number density `n_gas`.\n*   The electrons are moving at nearly the speed of light, while the gas molecules are moving at much slower thermal speeds. Therefore, we can consider the gas molecules to be stationary targets. The `√2` factor does not apply in this case.\n*   The collision cross-section, `σ_eg`, is for an electron hitting a gas molecule. Let's analyze the factors determining `σ_eg`:\n    *   **Size:** The electron is a point-like particle compared to the gas molecule (diameter `d`). In a simple geometric (hard-sphere) model, a collision occurs if the electron hits the molecule. The target area is a circle of radius `r = d/2`. So, `σ_eg ≈ π * r² = π * (d/2)² = π * d² / 4`.\n    *   **Energy:** The electrons are highly energetic (1 MeV). The scattering cross-section for high-energy charged particles (described by Rutherford or Mott scattering) is inversely related to the energy of the particle. A high-energy electron is very \"penetrating\" and less likely to be scattered than a slow-moving particle. This means the actual `σ_eg` is much smaller than the geometric cross-section.\n*   The formula for the mean free path is: `λ2 = 1 / (n_gas * σ_eg)`.\n\n### 4. Compare λ1 and λ2\n\nWe need to compare `λ1` and `λ2`. Let's form the ratio `λ2 / λ1`:\n\n`λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n_gas * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n_gas * σ_gg)]`\n\n`λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * σ_gg) / σ_eg`\n\nNow, let's compare the cross-sections `σ_gg` and `σ_eg`:\n*   From the hard-sphere size argument alone: `σ_gg = π * d²` and `σ_eg = π * d² / 4`. This gives `σ_gg / σ_eg = 4`.\n*   The high energy of the electron further reduces `σ_eg`, making the ratio `σ_gg / σ_eg` even larger than 4.\n\nSo, `σ_gg` is significantly larger than `σ_eg`. Let's denote this as `σ_gg >> σ_eg`.\n\nPlugging this into our ratio for λ:\n\n`λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)`\n\nSince `√2 ≈ 1.414` and `σ_gg / σ_eg >> 1`, it is clear that the ratio `λ2 / λ1` will be significantly greater than 1.\n\nUsing the simple hard-sphere model as a conservative estimate:\n`λ2 / λ1 = √2 * 4 = 4√2 ≈ 5.66`\n\nThis means `λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1`. More realistic physics (considering the high energy) would yield an even larger ratio.\n\n### 5. Evaluate the Options\n\n*   **A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1:** Our calculation shows `λ2 ≈ 5.66 * λ1`. Since 5.66 is greater than 1.22, this option is consistent with our physical analysis.\n*   **B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1:** This option implies that `λ2` is only slightly larger than `λ1` (less than 22% larger). This contradicts our finding that `λ2` is several times larger than `λ1`.\n*   **C) λ2 = λ1:** This is incorrect, as the projectile and its energy are different, leading to different cross-sections.\n*   **D) λ2 < λ1:** This would imply `σ_eg > σ_gg`, which is physically incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe physical principles governing particle collisions dictate that the mean free path for a high-energy electron in a gas (`λ2`) is significantly longer than the mean free path for the gas molecules themselves (`λ1`). Our quantitative estimate shows `λ2` is about 5 to 6 times larger than `λ1`, and possibly much more. Therefore, the only option that correctly describes this relationship is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
