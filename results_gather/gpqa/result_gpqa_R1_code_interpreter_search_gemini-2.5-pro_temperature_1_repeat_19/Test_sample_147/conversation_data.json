    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y from Compound A2.**\n    The problem states that A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with a formula YFₙ. The mass percentage of fluorine (ωF) in A2 is 31.96%.\n    The molar mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol.\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ωF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for the molar mass of Y, M(Y):\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * (n * 19.00) = n * 19.00\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 19.00 * (1 - 0.3196)\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = n * 19.00 * 0.6804\n    M(Y) = n * (12.9276 / 0.3196)\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    Now we test integer values for n (the oxidation state of Y in A2):\n    *   If n = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to Ca, Ar).\n    *   If n = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.90 g/mol (close to Br, Kr).\n    *   If n = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is extremely close to the molar mass of Antimony (Sb), which is 121.76 g/mol.\n    *   If n = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.80 g/mol.\n    *   If n = 5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol.\n\n    The excellent match for n=3 strongly suggests that **Y is Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 is Antimony trifluoride (SbF₃)**.\n    Let's verify the mass percentage for SbF₃:\n    M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    ωF = (3 * 19.00) / 178.76 = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188 or 31.88%. This is very close to the given 31.96%, confirming our identification.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Other Compounds and Reactions.**\n    *   **A3**: It's obtained by fluorinating Y (Sb) and it can oxidize xenon. The reaction of Sb with excess fluorine produces SbF₅. Antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅) is a powerful oxidizing agent and Lewis acid known to react with xenon. So, **A3 = SbF₅**.\n    *   **A1**: It decomposes into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine (F₂). This implies A1 is a higher fluoride than SbF₃. The reaction would be `SbF₅ -> SbF₃ + F₂`. A1 also oxidizes xenon, which is consistent with it being SbF₅. The problem describes A1 as a \"bright-red substance\" that decomposes at 293 K (20 °C). While standard SbF₅ is a stable colorless liquid, this might refer to a specific unstable form or be a deliberately confusing detail. The chemical transformations point to **A1 = SbF₅**.\n    *   **A4**: This is a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". It reacts with element Y (Sb). Since we are looking for binary fluorides of antimony, A4 must be one of them. The two main ones are SbF₃ (solid, m.p. 292 °C) and SbF₅ (liquid, b.p. 149.5 °C). A \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" could be molten SbF₃ or liquid SbF₅.\n    *   **A5**: It is formed by reacting Y (Sb) with A4. This is a comproportionation reaction, where Sb(0) reacts with Sb in a positive oxidation state to form a compound with an intermediate oxidation state.\n\n3.  **Determine the Identity and Molecular Weight of A4.**\n    The question asks for the range in which the molecular weight of A4 falls. We have two primary candidates for A4: SbF₃ and SbF₅. Let's calculate their molecular weights and check the given ranges.\n\n    *   **Candidate 1: A4 = SbF₃**\n        Molecular Weight (M) = M(Sb) + 3 * M(F) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = **178.76 g/mol**.\n        Let's check the ranges:\n        A) 110-130\n        B) 220-240\n        C) 140-160\n        D) 160-180\n        The value 178.76 g/mol falls perfectly within range **D**.\n\n    *   **Candidate 2: A4 = SbF₅**\n        Molecular Weight (M) = M(Sb) + 5 * M(F) = 121.76 + 5 * 19.00 = **216.76 g/mol**.\n        Let's check the ranges:\n        This value does not fall into any of the given ranges. It is close to range B (220-240), but it is not within it.\n\n4.  **Conclusion.**\n    Based on the calculations, the only candidate for A4 whose molecular weight fits one of the provided ranges is SbF₃. The description of A4 as a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" is consistent with molten SbF₃. Therefore, the molecular weight of A4 falls into the range of 160-180 g/mol.\n\n<<<D>>>"
