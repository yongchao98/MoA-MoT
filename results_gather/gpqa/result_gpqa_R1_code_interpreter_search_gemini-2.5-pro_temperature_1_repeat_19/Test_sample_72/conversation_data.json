    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Goal:**\nThe problem asks for two quantities:\n- The relative speed (`v_rel`) between the two astronauts.\n- The total energy (`E`) of the system.\n\n**2. List the Given Information:**\n- Mass of astronaut 1: `m1 = 2m`\n- Speed of astronaut 1: `v1 = 0.6c` (in the positive x-direction)\n- Mass of astronaut 2: `m2 = 3m`\n- Speed of astronaut 2: `v2 = 0.5c` (in the positive x-direction)\n- `c` is the speed of light.\n\n**3. Calculate the Relative Speed (`v_rel`):**\nSince both astronauts are moving at relativistic speeds, we must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula for relative speed. For two objects moving in the same direction, the formula is:\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nSubstitute the given values into the formula:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3 * c^2 / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7`\n`v_rel = (1/7) * c`\n\nNow, convert the fraction to a decimal:\n`v_rel ≈ 0.142857... c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Energy (`E`):**\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of each astronaut. The formula for the total energy of a relativistic particle is:\n`E = γ * m_rest * c^2`\nwhere `m_rest` is the rest mass and `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is given by:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)`\n\n**a. Calculate the energy of astronaut 1 (`E1`):**\n- First, find the Lorentz factor `γ1` for astronaut 1:\n  `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v1^2 / c^2)`\n  `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2)`\n  `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36)`\n  `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(0.64)`\n  `γ1 = 1 / 0.8`\n  `γ1 = 1.25`\n- Now, calculate the energy `E1`:\n  `E1 = γ1 * m1 * c^2`\n  `E1 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2`\n  `E1 = 2.5 mc^2`\n\n**b. Calculate the energy of astronaut 2 (`E2`):**\n- First, find the Lorentz factor `γ2` for astronaut 2:\n  `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v2^2 / c^2)`\n  `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2)`\n  `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25)`\n  `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(0.75)`\n  `γ2 = 1 / (sqrt(3)/2)`\n  `γ2 = 2 / sqrt(3)`\n  `γ2 ≈ 1.1547`\n- Now, calculate the energy `E2`:\n  `E2 = γ2 * m2 * c^2`\n  `E2 = (2 / sqrt(3)) * (3m) * c^2`\n  `E2 = (6 / sqrt(3)) * mc^2`\n  `E2 = (6 * sqrt(3) / 3) * mc^2`\n  `E2 = 2 * sqrt(3) * mc^2`\n  `E2 ≈ 2 * 1.732 * mc^2`\n  `E2 ≈ 3.464 mc^2`\n\n**c. Calculate the total energy of the system (`E_total`):**\n`E_total = E1 + E2`\n`E_total = 2.5 mc^2 + 2 * sqrt(3) * mc^2`\n`E_total = (2.5 + 2 * sqrt(3)) * mc^2`\n`E_total ≈ (2.5 + 3.464) * mc^2`\n`E_total ≈ 5.964 mc^2`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc^2`.\n\n**5. Compare with Options:**\n- Calculated `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`\n- Calculated `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc^2`\n\nThese results match option D.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nc = 1 # We can work in units where c=1\n\n# Astronaut 1\nm1 = 2\nv1 = 0.6 * c\n\n# Astronaut 2\nm2 = 3\nv2 = 0.5 * c\n\n# --- Calculate Relative Speed ---\n# Using the relativistic velocity subtraction formula\nv_rel_numerator = v1 - v2\nv_rel_denominator = 1 - (v1 * v2) / (c**2)\nv_rel = v_rel_numerator / v_rel_denominator\n\n# --- Calculate Total Energy ---\n# Lorentz factor gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\ngamma1 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v1**2 / c**2))\ngamma2 = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (v2**2 / c**2))\n\n# Energy E = gamma * m * c^2\n# Since we let c=1, E is in units of m*c^2\nE1 = gamma1 * m1 * (c**2)\nE2 = gamma2 * m2 * (c**2)\n\nE_total = E1 + E2\n\nprint(f\"v_rel = {v_rel:.2f}c\")\nprint(f\"E_total = {E_total:.2f}mc^2\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem requires us to calculate two quantities based on the principles of special relativity: the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.\n\n**1. Calculation of the Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nSince the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, we must use the relativistic velocity addition (or subtraction) formula, not simple subtraction. The formula for the relative speed `v_rel` between two objects moving with velocities `v1` and `v2` in the same direction (as measured from a stationary frame) is:\n\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nGiven:\n*   `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   `v2 = 0.5c`\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3c^2 / c^2)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7`\n`v_rel = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`.\n\n**2. Calculation of the Total Energy (E_total)**\n\nThe total energy of a particle moving at a relativistic speed is given by the formula `E = γmc^2`, where `m` is the rest mass and `γ` (the Lorentz factor) is `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`.\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the individual total energies of the two astronauts: `E_total = E1 + E2`.\n\n**For astronaut 1:**\n*   Rest mass `m1 = 2m`\n*   Speed `v1 = 0.6c`\n*   Lorentz factor `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n*   Energy `E1 = γ1 * m1 * c^2 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2 = 2.5 mc^2`\n\n**For astronaut 2:**\n*   Rest mass `m2 = 3m`\n*   Speed `v2 = 0.5c`\n*   Lorentz factor `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) = 1 / (sqrt(3)/2) = 2 / sqrt(3) ≈ 1.155`\n*   Energy `E2 = γ2 * m2 * c^2 = (2 / sqrt(3)) * (3m) * c^2 = 2 * sqrt(3) * mc^2 ≈ 3.464 mc^2`\n\n**Total Energy of the System:**\n`E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2 * sqrt(3) * mc^2`\n`E_total = (2.5 + 2 * sqrt(3)) mc^2`\n`E_total ≈ (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2 ≈ 5.964 mc^2`\n\nRounding to two decimal places, `E_total ≈ 5.96 mc^2`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately `0.14c` and the total energy is approximately `5.96 mc^2`. These values correspond to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
