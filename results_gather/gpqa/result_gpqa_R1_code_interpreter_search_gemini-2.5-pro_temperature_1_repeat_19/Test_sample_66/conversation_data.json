    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial and Final States:**\n    *   The initial state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled angular momentum basis as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n        *   $l_1 = 1$ (electron 1 is in a p-orbital).\n        *   $l_2 = 1$ (electron 2 is in a p-orbital).\n        *   $l = 2$ (total orbital angular momentum quantum number).\n        *   $m = -1$ (z-component of the total orbital angular momentum quantum number).\n    *   The measurement is of the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\n    *   The desired outcome is that the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $m_l\\hbar$ for the $L_z$ operator corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_l$.\n    *   Therefore, the desired outcome corresponds to measuring $m_{l1} = -1$ for electron 1 and $m_{l2} = -1$ for electron 2.\n    *   This final state, in the uncoupled basis, is represented as $|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}\\rangle = |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Relate Probability to Quantum State Overlap:**\n    *   According to the principles of quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring the system to be in a particular final state, given its initial state, is the square of the magnitude of the inner product (or projection) of the initial state vector onto the final state vector.\n    *   Probability $P = |\\langle \\text{final state} | \\text{initial state} \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   In our case, $P = |\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum:**\n    *   A crucial concept in the addition of angular momentum is the conservation of the z-component. The total z-component of angular momentum ($L_z$) is the sum of the individual components ($L_{1z} + L_{2z}$).\n    *   The corresponding quantum numbers are related by the selection rule: $m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$.\n    *   Let's check this rule for our states.\n        *   For the initial state $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, the total magnetic quantum number is $m = -1$.\n        *   For the final state $|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$. The sum is $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Since the total magnetic quantum number of the initial state ($m=-1$) is not equal to the total magnetic quantum number of the final state ($m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -2$), the transition between these states is forbidden by the conservation of the z-component of angular momentum.\n\n4.  **Formal Justification (Orthogonality):**\n    *   Both the initial state $|l, m\\rangle$ and the final state $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}\\rangle$ are eigenstates of the total z-component angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   $L_z |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle = m\\hbar |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle = -1\\hbar |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   $L_z |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle = (L_{1z} + L_{2z})|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle = (m_{l1}\\hbar + m_{l2}\\hbar)|1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle = (-1 - 1)\\hbar |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle = -2\\hbar |1, -1; 1, -1\\rangle$.\n    *   Eigenstates of a Hermitian operator (like $L_z$) corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal.\n    *   Since the eigenvalues $-1\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$ are different, the states are orthogonal.\n    *   Therefore, their inner product is zero: $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    *   The probability is the square of the inner product.\n    *   $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion via Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients:**\n    *   The inner product $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle$ is precisely the definition of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, $C_{-1,-1,-1}^{1,1,2}$.\n    *   A fundamental selection rule for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients $C_{m_{1}m_{2}m}^{l_{1}l_{2}l}$ is that they are non-zero only if $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n    *   In this problem, $m=-1$ and $m_1 + m_2 = -2$. Since $m \\neq m_1 + m_2$, the coefficient is zero. The probability, which is the square of this coefficient, is also zero.\n\nThus, the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is 0.\n\n<<<C>>>"
