    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the System and Basic Principles**\n\n*   **Particles:** The system consists of four identical spin-1/2 particles. According to the spin-statistics theorem, particles with half-integer spin are fermions.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state is defined by its complete set of quantum numbers.\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L.\n*   **Quantum Numbers:** For this system, the state of a particle is defined by two quantum numbers:\n    1.  The principal quantum number `n` (n = 1, 2, 3, ...), which determines the energy level.\n    2.  The spin magnetic quantum number `m_s`, which can be `+1/2` (spin up) or `-1/2` (spin down).\n*   **Energy Levels:** The energy of a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well is given by:\n    E_n = (n² * π² * ħ²) / (2mL²)\n*   **Energy Unit:** The problem defines a base energy unit E = (π² * ħ²) / (2mL²). Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed simply as:\n    E_n = n² * E\n*   **State Occupancy:** Due to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up (`m_s` = +1/2) and one with spin down (`m_s` = -1/2).\n\n### **2. Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_ground)**\n\nThe ground state is the lowest possible total energy configuration for the system. To achieve this, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles.\n\n*   **Level n=1 (Energy E₁ = 1²E = E):** We can place two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down).\n*   **Level n=2 (Energy E₂ = 2²E = 4E):** We place the remaining two particles in this level (one spin up, one spin down).\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_ground = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₂)\nE_ground = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 4E)\nE_ground = 2E + 8E = **10E**\n\n### **3. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)**\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the smallest possible energy increase from the ground state. This is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n\n*   **Ground State Configuration:** 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=2.\n*   **Highest Occupied Level:** n=2.\n*   **Lowest Unoccupied Level:** n=3.\n\nWe move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n*   **New Configuration:** 2 particles in n=1, 1 particle in n=2, 1 particle in n=3.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_1st = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃)\nE_1st = (2 × 1²E) + (1 × 2²E) + (1 × 3²E)\nE_1st = (2 × E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E)\nE_1st = 2E + 4E + 9E = **15E**\n\n### **4. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)**\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider all possible promotions that result in an energy higher than the first excited state (15E).\n\nLet's analyze the possible low-energy configurations (excitations from the ground state):\n\n*   **Configuration A (First Excited State, calculated above):** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Setup: (2 particles in n=1), (1 particle in n=2), (1 particle in n=3).\n    *   Energy = 2E₁ + 1E₂ + 1E₃ = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n*   **Configuration B:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Setup: (1 particle in n=1), (2 particles in n=2), (1 particle in n=3).\n    *   Energy = 1E₁ + 2E₂ + 1E₃ = (1×1E) + (2×4E) + (1×9E) = E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n\n*   **Configuration C:** Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Setup: (2 particles in n=1), (2 particles in n=3).\n    *   Energy = 2E₁ + 2E₃ = (2×1E) + (2×9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n\n*   **Configuration D:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Setup: (2 particles in n=1), (1 particle in n=2), (1 particle in n=4).\n    *   Energy = 2E₁ + 1E₂ + 1E₄ = (2×1E) + (1×4E) + (1×16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n\nComparing the energies of these excited states:\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E (from Configuration A)\n*   Second Excited State: 18E (from Configuration B)\n*   Third Excited State: 20E (from Configuration C)\n\nThe energy of the second excited state is the next lowest value after the first excited state, which is **18E**.\n\n### **5. Final Result**\n\nThe energies of the three states are:\n*   **Ground State:** 10E\n*   **First Excited State:** 15E\n*   **Second Excited State:** 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
