    "*   **Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n    Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. For a molecule to be chiral, it must not have any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. Let's analyze each molecule to determine if it is chiral.\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative where the two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond.\n    *   **Chirality Source:** In certain substituted biphenyls, free rotation around the single bond connecting the two rings is hindered by bulky groups at the ortho positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6'). This restricted rotation can lead to a type of chirality called atropisomerism, where the molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable isomers (enantiomers).\n    *   **Analysis:** In this molecule, the ortho positions are substituted with large groups: two methyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3) and two nitro groups (-NO2). These groups are bulky enough to prevent the two phenyl rings from becoming coplanar through free rotation. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. As a result, it is chiral and will exist as a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is an ester, commonly known as methyl lactate. Its chemical structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n    *   **Chirality Source:** The most common source of chirality in organic molecules is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  A methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH3)\n    *   Since all four groups attached to this carbon are different, it is a chiral center. The presence of this single chiral center makes the entire molecule chiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   **Structure:** The structure is C6H5-C(=O)-C6H5. A central carbonyl group is bonded to two phenyl rings.\n    *   **Chirality Source:** We need to check for chiral centers or other sources of chirality and for elements of symmetry.\n    *   **Analysis:** There are no chiral centers in the molecule. The central carbon is double-bonded to an oxygen and single-bonded to two identical phenyl groups. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that bisects the angle between the two phenyl rings and contains the C=O bond. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. It is the *trans* isomer, meaning the two ester groups (-COOCH3) are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   **Chirality Source:** We check for elements of symmetry.\n    *   **Analysis:** Dimethyl fumarate is a planar molecule. It possesses a center of inversion (also called a center of symmetry) at the midpoint of the C=C double bond. Any point on the molecule can be reflected through this center to an identical point on the opposite side. The presence of a center of inversion makes a molecule achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This compound does not show optical isomerism.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   Compound 1: Shows optical isomerism (atropisomerism).\n*   Compound 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral center).\n*   Compound 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Compound 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, only compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n<<<A>>>"
