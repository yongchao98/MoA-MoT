    "Here is my thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet 1 and Planet 2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Equilibrium Temperature:** The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by:\n    T_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\n    Where:\n    *   `T_star` is the effective temperature of the star.\n    *   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n    *   `R_star` is the radius of the star.\n    *   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n3.  **Set up the Ratio:** I need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem states that the planets orbit the same star, so `T_star` and `R_star` are the same for both and will cancel out. It also states that both planets have the same albedo (`A_1` = `A_2`), so the `(1 - A)^(1/4)` terms will also cancel out.\n    This simplifies the ratio significantly:\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a_1) / sqrt(1 / a_2)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\n5.  **Relate Semi-Major Axis to Given Information:** The problem does not provide the semi-major axes (`a_1`, `a_2`) directly. However, it gives information from the radial velocity (RV) method: the mass of the planets and the Doppler shift they induce on the star.\n\n6.  **Use the Radial Velocity Formulas:**\n    a.  The maximum radial velocity of the star (the semi-amplitude, K) is related to the observed Doppler shift (Δλ) by the formula:\n        K = c * (Δλ / λ₀)\n        where `c` is the speed of light and `λ₀` is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\n    b.  For a planet in a circular orbit, the radial velocity semi-amplitude `K` is also related to the planet's mass (`M_p`), the star's mass (`M_star`), and the semi-major axis (`a`). Assuming the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (`M_p << M_star`) and the orbit is viewed edge-on (inclination `i` ≈ 90°, which is a reasonable assumption for planets detected by the transit method), the formula is:\n        K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n        where `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n7.  **Solve for the Semi-Major Axis (a):** I need to rearrange the formula to solve for `a` in terms of the known quantities.\n    K² ≈ (M_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a)\n    K² ≈ (M_p² * G) / (M_star * a)\n    a ≈ (M_p² * G) / (M_star * K²)\n\n8.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (a₂ / a₁):** Now I can find the ratio `a₂ / a₁` using the formula derived in the previous step.\n    a₂ / a₁ = [ (M_p2² * G) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (M_p1² * G) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\n\n9.  **Simplify the `a₂ / a₁` Ratio:** The terms for the gravitational constant `G` and the star's mass `M_star` are the same for both planets, so they cancel out.\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2² / K₂²) / (M_p1² / K₁²)\n    a₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n10. **Calculate the Intermediate Ratios:**\n    a.  **Ratio of masses (M_p2 / M_p1):**\n        M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n        M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n        M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n    b.  **Ratio of radial velocities (K₁ / K₂):**\n        From the formula K = c * (Δλ / λ₀), the ratio K₁ / K₂ is simply the ratio of the Doppler shifts Δλ₁ / Δλ₂.\n        Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n        Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n        K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\n11. **Substitute Ratios back into the `a₂ / a₁` Equation:**\n    a₂ / a₁ = (5 / 7)² * (3 / 4)²\n    a₂ / a₁ = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\n    a₂ / a₁ = 225 / 784\n\n12. **Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio:**\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\n    T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n13. **Compute the Numerical Value:** I will use a short Python script to perform the final division.\n\n```python\n# Given values\n# Planet 1\nMp1 = 7  # Earth masses\nd_lambda1 = 0.03  # Angstrom\n\n# Planet 2\nMp2 = 5  # Earth masses\nd_lambda2 = 0.04  # Angstrom\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 is given by sqrt(a2 / a1).\n# The semi-major axis 'a' is proportional to (Mp/K)^2, where K is the radial velocity semi-amplitude.\n# K is proportional to the doppler shift d_lambda.\n# So, a is proportional to (Mp/d_lambda)^2.\n# Therefore, a2 / a1 = (Mp2 / d_lambda2)^2 / (Mp1 / d_lambda1)^2\n# a2 / a1 = (Mp2/Mp1)^2 * (d_lambda1/d_lambda2)^2\n\n# The ratio of temperatures is sqrt(a2 / a1)\n# T_ratio = sqrt((Mp2/Mp1)**2 * (d_lambda1/d_lambda2)**2)\n# T_ratio = (Mp2/Mp1) * (d_lambda1/d_lambda2)\n\nT_ratio = (Mp2 / Mp1) * (d_lambda1 / d_lambda2)\nprint(T_ratio)\n\n# Also calculating it step-by-step to be sure\nratio_a2_a1 = (Mp2/Mp1)**2 * (d_lambda1/d_lambda2)**2\nratio_T_sqrt = ratio_a2_a1**0.5\n# print(f\"a2/a1 = {ratio_a2_a1}\")\n# print(f\"T1/T2 = {ratio_T_sqrt}\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "The user wants to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between two planets (Planet1 and Planet2).\n\n**1. Formula for Equilibrium Temperature**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is given by the formula:\nT_eq = T_star * (1 - A)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a))\nwhere:\n- T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n- A is the planet's albedo.\n- R_star is the star's radius.\n- a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\n**2. Form the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n\nWe need to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * (1 - A_1)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_1))] / [T_star * (1 - A_2)^(1/4) * sqrt(R_star / (2 * a_2))]\n\n**3. Simplify the Ratio**\n\nThe problem states that:\n- Both planets orbit the same star, so T_star and R_star are the same for both.\n- Both planets have the same albedo (A_1 = A_2).\nTherefore, the terms T_star, (1-A)^(1/4), R_star, and 2 cancel out, leaving:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(1 / a_1) / sqrt(1 / a_2) = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\n**4. Relate Semi-Major Axis (a) to Radial Velocity (RV) Data**\n\nThe semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) induced by a planet on its star is given by:\nK ≈ (M_p / M_star) * sqrt(G * M_star / a)\n(Assuming a circular orbit and M_p << M_star)\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis (a):\nK² ≈ (M_p² / M_star²) * (G * M_star / a)\na ≈ (M_p² * G) / (M_star * K²)\n\n**5. Find the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes (a₂ / a₁)**\n\na₂ / a₁ = [ (M_p2² * G) / (M_star * K₂²) ] / [ (M_p1² * G) / (M_star * K₁²) ]\n\nThe gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) are the same for both, so they cancel out:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2² / K₂²) / (M_p1² / K₁²) = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K₁ / K₂)²\n\n**6. Relate Radial Velocity (K) to Doppler Shift (Δλ)**\n\nThe radial velocity (K) is directly proportional to the observed Doppler shift (Δλ) via the formula K = c * (Δλ / λ₀), where c is the speed of light and λ₀ is the rest wavelength. Therefore, the ratio of the radial velocities is equal to the ratio of the Doppler shifts:\nK₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂\n\n**7. Substitute and Calculate**\n\nNow substitute the Doppler shift ratio back into the equation for a₂ / a₁:\na₂ / a₁ = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)²\n\nFinally, substitute this into our simplified temperature ratio:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a₂ / a₁) = sqrt( (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)² )\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ₁ / Δλ₂)\n\n**8. Plug in the Given Values**\n- M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n- M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n- Δλ₁ = 0.03 Å\n- Δλ₂ = 0.04 Å\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\n\n**9. Final Calculation**\n\nLet's compute the final value.\n```python\n# M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n# M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n# d_lambda1 = 0.03 Angstrom\n# d_lambda2 = 0.04 Angstrom\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_eq1 / T_eq2 is (M_p2 / M_p1) * (d_lambda1 / d_lambda2)\nratio = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<<<A>>>",
