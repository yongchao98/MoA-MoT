    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Observational Data**: The problem provides data from the Radial Velocity (RV) method. This method measures the Doppler shift of a star's spectral lines. The magnitude of this shift, $\\Delta \\lambda$, is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity, $v_r$, along our line of sight. The maximum periodic shift corresponds to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, denoted as $K$.\n    *   The relationship is: $K \\propto \\Delta \\lambda_{max}$.\n    *   For planet #1, $\\Delta \\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom.\n    *   For planet #2, $\\Delta \\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes is:\n        $K_2 / K_1 = \\Delta \\lambda_2 / \\Delta \\lambda_1 = 7 / 5 = 1.4$.\n\n2.  **Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters**: The amplitude of the star's radial velocity ($K$) for a circular orbit is given by:\n    $K = v_{star} \\sin(i) = \\frac{2\\pi a_{star}}{P} \\sin(i)$\n    where:\n    *   $v_{star}$ is the orbital speed of the star around the system's center of mass.\n    *   $P$ is the orbital period of the planet (and the star).\n    *   $a_{star}$ is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the center of mass.\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n\n3.  **Use the Center of Mass Relation**: The star and planet orbit a common center of mass. For a system with star mass $M_{star}$ and planet mass $M_p$, and a total separation (semi-major axis) of $a$, the star's orbital radius is:\n    $a_{star} = a \\frac{M_p}{M_{star} + M_p}$\n    Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass ($M_p \\ll M_{star}$), we can approximate this as:\n    $a_{star} \\approx a \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}}$\n\n4.  **Incorporate Kepler's Third Law**: Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period $P$ and the semi-major axis $a$:\n    $P^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G(M_{star} + M_p)} a^3$\n    Again, using the approximation $M_{star} + M_p \\approx M_{star}$, we have:\n    $P^2 \\approx \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M_{star}} a^3$\n    We can rearrange this to express $a$ in terms of $P$:\n    $a \\approx \\left( \\frac{G M_{star} P^2}{4\\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3}$\n\n5.  **Derive the Final Relationship**: Now, substitute the expressions for $a_{star}$ and $a$ back into the formula for $K$:\n    *   First, substitute $a_{star}$: $K \\approx \\frac{2\\pi \\sin(i)}{P} \\left( a \\frac{M_p}{M_{star}} \\right)$\n    *   Next, substitute $a$: $K \\approx \\frac{2\\pi \\sin(i) M_p}{P M_{star}} \\left( \\frac{G M_{star} P^2}{4\\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3}$\n    *   Let's simplify this expression:\n        $K \\approx \\frac{2\\pi \\sin(i) M_p}{P M_{star}} \\frac{(G M_{star})^{1/3} P^{2/3}}{(4\\pi^2)^{1/3}}$\n        $K \\approx (2\\pi)^{1/3} G^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin(i)}{M_{star}^{2/3}} P^{-1/3}$\n\n6.  **Analyze the Proportionality**: We can see that $K$ is proportional to several factors. The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$).\n    *   The planets have the same mass ($M_{p1} = M_{p2}$).\n    *   For the problem to be solvable, we must assume the viewing geometry (inclination) is the same for both systems ($i_1 = i_2$).\n    *   $G$ and $2\\pi$ are constants.\n\n    Under these conditions, the relationship simplifies to:\n    $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Period Ratio**: Now we can use the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes ($K_2/K_1$) to find the ratio of the periods ($P_2/P_1$):\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3}$\n\n    We want to solve for $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^{-3}$\n\n    Substitute the known values:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = (1.4)^{-3} = \\frac{1}{1.4^3}$\n\n8.  **Final Calculation**:\n    $1.4^2 = 1.96$\n    $1.4^3 = 1.96 \\times 1.4 = 2.744$\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\frac{1}{2.744} \\approx 0.3644$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.36.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes\nK2_over_K1 = 7 / 5\n\n# The relationship between the RV amplitude K and the period P is K ‚àù P^(-1/3).\n# Therefore, (P2/P1) = (K2/K1)^(-3).\nP2_over_P1 = K2_over_K1 ** -3\n\nprint(P2_over_P1)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.3644314868804665\n</execute_code>\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.364, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Radial Velocity (RV) Method:** The RV method measures the change in a star's velocity towards or away from us. This change is detected as a Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines. A larger shift in wavelength ($\\Delta \\lambda$) implies a larger radial velocity amplitude ($K$) of the star. The relationship is directly proportional:\n    $K \\propto \\Delta \\lambda_{max}$\n\n2.  **Determine the Ratio of Radial Velocity Amplitudes:** We are given the maximum periodic wavelength shifts for the two stars:\n    *   Star 1: $\\Delta \\lambda_1 = 5$ miliangstrom\n    *   Star 2: $\\Delta \\lambda_2 = 7$ miliangstrom\n    The ratio of their radial velocity amplitudes is therefore:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_2}{\\Delta \\lambda_1} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$\n\n3.  **Relate RV Amplitude (K) to Orbital Parameters:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the star's RV semi-amplitude ($K$) is given by the formula:\n    $K = \\frac{2\\pi M_p \\sin i}{P M_{star}} a$\n    where:\n    *   $M_p$ is the planet's mass.\n    *   $M_{star}$ is the star's mass.\n    *   $P$ is the orbital period.\n    *   $a$ is the semi-major axis (the distance between the star and the planet).\n    *   $i$ is the inclination of the orbit (the angle to our line of sight).\n\n4.  **Incorporate Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law relates the orbital period ($P$) to the semi-major axis ($a$):\n    $P^2 \\propto \\frac{a^3}{M_{star}}$\n    We can rearrange this to solve for $a$:\n    $a \\propto (P^2 M_{star})^{1/3}$\n\n5.  **Derive the Key Relationship between K and P:** Now, substitute the expression for $a$ from Kepler's Law into the formula for $K$:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{P M_{star}} (P^2 M_{star})^{1/3}$\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{P M_{star}} P^{2/3} M_{star}^{1/3}$\n    Combine the terms for $P$ and $M_{star}$:\n    $K \\propto \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_{star}^{2/3}} P^{-1/3}$\n\n6.  **Simplify Based on the Problem's Conditions:** The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass ($M_{star1} = M_{star2}$).\n    *   The planets have the same mass ($M_{p1} = M_{p2}$).\n    *   For the problem to be solvable with the given information, we assume the orbital inclinations are the same ($i_1 = i_2$).\n\n    Given these conditions, all terms except the period ($P$) are constant for both systems. Therefore, the relationship simplifies to:\n    $K \\propto P^{-1/3}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio of the Orbital Periods:** We can now use the ratio of the RV amplitudes to find the ratio of the orbital periods:\n    $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{-1/3}$\n\n    We want to find $\\frac{P_2}{P_1}$, so we rearrange the equation:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{K_2}{K_1}\\right)^{-3}$\n\n    Substitute the value of $\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = 1.4$:\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = (1.4)^{-3} = \\frac{1}{1.4^3} = \\frac{1}{2.744}$\n    $\\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\approx 0.3644$\n\n8.  **Match with the Options:** The calculated value of approximately 0.36 matches option C.\n\nThe previous python code confirms this calculation: `(7/5)**-3` equals `0.3644314868804665`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
