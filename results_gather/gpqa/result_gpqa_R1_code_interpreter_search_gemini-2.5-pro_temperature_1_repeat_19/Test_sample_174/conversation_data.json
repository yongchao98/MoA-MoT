    "An oscillating charge distribution acts as a source of electromagnetic radiation. The characteristics of this radiation in the far-field (radiation zone) can be determined by considering the multipole expansion of the source. The lowest order and typically dominant term in this expansion is the electric dipole radiation, unless the oscillating electric dipole moment is zero due to some specific symmetry.\n\nThe problem describes an oscillating charge distribution with a spheroid shape, with the oscillation occurring along the symmetry axis (the z-axis). This setup describes an oscillating electric dipole moment, `p(t)`, directed along the z-axis. We will, therefore, model the source as a simple oscillating electric dipole.\n\n**1. Angular Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nFor an electric dipole `p(t) = p₀ cos(ωt) z_hat` oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` is given by:\n\n`dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n\nwhere `θ` is the angle with respect to the axis of oscillation (the z-axis), and `C` is a constant that depends on the amplitude of the dipole moment (`p₀`) and the frequency (`ω`).\n\nThe function `f` in the question is this power per unit solid angle, so `f(λ, θ) ∝ sin²(θ)`.\n\nThe maximum radiated power, `A`, occurs when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which happens at `θ = 90°` (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n\nSo, `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = C * sin²(90°) = C * 1 = C`.\n\nWe need to find the fraction of `A` that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. We calculate the power at this angle:\n\n`P(30°) = C * sin²(30°)`\n\nWe know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`. Therefore:\n\n`sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`\n\nSo, the power radiated at 30° is `P(30°) = C * (1/4) = A/4`.\n\nThe fraction of the maximum power `A` is:\n\n`Fraction = P(30°) / A = (A/4) / A = 1/4`.\n\nTo be certain, we can use Python to compute this value.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Angle in degrees\ntheta_deg = 30\n\n# Convert angle to radians\ntheta_rad = np.deg2rad(theta_deg)\n\n# Calculate sin^2(theta)\n# The maximum value is sin^2(90) = 1.\n# So the fraction is simply sin^2(30).\nfraction = np.sin(theta_rad)**2\n\nprint(f\"The value of sin^2(30 degrees) is: {fraction}\")\n```\n\n**2. Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power**\n\nThe constant `C` in the power formula is not truly constant but depends on the frequency `ω` of oscillation. The theory of electric dipole radiation shows that the total radiated power is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency:\n\n`P_total ∝ ω⁴`\n\nThe power per unit solid angle has the same frequency dependence:\n\n`dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`\n\nThe question asks for the dependence on the wavelength `λ`. The angular frequency `ω` and wavelength `λ` are related through the speed of light `c` by the formula `ω = 2πf = 2π(c/λ)`.\n\nSubstituting this into the proportionality for power:\n\n`dP/dΩ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\nSo, a possible form for the function `f(λ, θ)` is one where the dependence on `λ` is `λ⁻⁴`. This dependence is characteristic of Rayleigh scattering, which is essentially radiation from induced dipoles.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining our two results:\n- The fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n- A possible form for the wavelength dependence of the radiated power per unit solid angle `f` is **`λ⁻⁴`**.\n\nMatching these results with the given options:\nA) 1/2, `λ⁻⁴`\nB) 3/4, `λ⁻⁶`\nC) 1/4, `λ⁻³`\nD) 1/4, `λ⁻⁴`\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem asks for two quantities related to the radiation from an oscillating spheroid charge distribution: the fraction of maximum power radiated at `θ = 30°` and the dependence of the radiated power on wavelength `λ`.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Model the Radiating System:**\n    An oscillating charge distribution with a symmetry axis (z-axis) and oscillation along that axis can be modeled as a simple oscillating electric dipole. The electric dipole moment `p(t)` is oriented along the z-axis. This is the lowest and most dominant order of radiation for such a system.\n\n2.  **Angular Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    The theory of electric dipole radiation states that the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` is not uniform in all directions. For a dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the formula is:\n    `dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)`\n    where `θ` is the polar angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis), and `C` is a constant that depends on the oscillation frequency and the amplitude of the dipole moment.\n\n    The question defines `A` as the *maximum* power radiated per unit solid angle. We need to find the angle `θ` where the power is maximum. The function `sin²(θ)` has a maximum value of 1, which occurs when `sin(θ) = 1`, i.e., at `θ = 90°` (the equatorial plane).\n    So, `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = C * sin²(90°) = C * 1 = C`.\n\n    Now, we need to find the power radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`.\n    `P(at 30°) = C * sin²(30°)`\n\n    We know the trigonometric value `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n\n    The power at 30° is `P(at 30°) = C * (1/4) = A/4`.\n\n    The fraction of the maximum power `A` that is radiated at `θ = 30°` is:\n    `Fraction = P(at 30°) / A = (A/4) / A = 1/4`.\n\n    The Python code output `0.24999999999999994` is a floating-point approximation of `1/4`, which confirms this calculation.\n\n3.  **Wavelength Dependence of Radiated Power:**\n    The constant `C` in the power formula `dP/dΩ = C * sin²(θ)` is not independent of the oscillation frequency. The full formula for the time-averaged power per unit solid angle from an electric dipole is:\n    `dP/dΩ = (μ₀ * p₀² * ω⁴) / (32 * π² * c) * sin²(θ)`\n    where `p₀` is the amplitude of the dipole moment, `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation, `c` is the speed of light, and `μ₀` is the permeability of free space.\n\n    From this formula, we can see that the radiated power per unit solid angle is directly proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ ω⁴`\n\n    The question asks for the dependence on the wavelength `λ`. The angular frequency `ω` and wavelength `λ` are related by `ω = 2πf = 2π(c/λ)`, where `f` is the linear frequency.\n    Substituting this relationship into the proportionality:\n    `dP/dΩ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`\n\n    This `λ⁻⁴` dependence is famously known from Rayleigh scattering, which describes the scattering of light by particles much smaller than the wavelength of light (like air molecules scattering sunlight), a process that is fundamentally based on radiation from induced oscillating dipoles.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The fraction of maximum power at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n    *   A possible form for the dependence of the radiated power on wavelength is **`λ⁻⁴`**.\n\n    Comparing these results with the given options:\n    A) 1/2, `λ⁻⁴`\n    B) 3/4, `λ⁻⁶`\n    C) 1/4, `λ⁻³`\n    D) 1/4, `λ⁻⁴`\n\n    The correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
