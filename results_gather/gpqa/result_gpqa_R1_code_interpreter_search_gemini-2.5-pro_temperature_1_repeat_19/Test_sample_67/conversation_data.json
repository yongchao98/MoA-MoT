    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state:**\n    *   The particle is a spin-1/2 particle. Its magnetic moment is related to its spin `S` by `μ = γS`, where `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio. The problem states `mu (= gamma*Sz)`, which is likely a typo for the standard vector relation `μ = γS`. We will proceed with the standard definition, as the alternative leads to no oscillation.\n    *   Initially, there is a magnetic field `B_i = B * z_hat` (pointing in the +Z direction).\n    *   The particle's magnetic moment is \"aligned\" with this field. This means the particle is in its lowest energy state. The Hamiltonian is `H_i = -μ · B_i = -γS · (B * z_hat) = -γB * S_z`.\n    *   The energy levels are `E = -γB * m_s * ħ`, where `m_s = ±1/2` are the eigenvalues of `S_z/ħ`.\n    *   Alignment of the magnetic moment `μ` with `B` (in the +Z direction) means `μ_z` is positive. Since `μ_z = γS_z`, the sign of `S_z` depends on the sign of `γ`.\n        *   If `γ > 0`, `S_z` must be positive, so the spin is \"up\". The initial state is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`, which is the eigenstate of `S_z` with eigenvalue `+ħ/2`.\n        *   If `γ < 0`, `S_z` must be negative for `μ_z` to be positive. The initial state is `|ψ(0)> = |-z>`, the eigenstate of `S_z` with eigenvalue `-ħ/2`.\n    *   For now, let's assume `γ > 0` and the initial state is `|ψ(0)> = |+z>`. We will see that the result for the frequency is independent of this choice.\n\n2.  **Identify the new Hamiltonian:**\n    *   At time `t=0`, the Z-field is turned off and a new field `B_f = B * y_hat` (pointing in the +Y direction) is turned on. The magnitude `B` is the same.\n    *   For `t > 0`, the system evolves under the new Hamiltonian `H = -μ · B_f = -γS · (B * y_hat) = -γB * S_y`.\n\n3.  **Determine the time evolution of the expectation value:**\n    *   We want to find the oscillation frequency of the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z(t)>`.\n    *   `<μ_z(t)> = γ <S_z(t)>`. So we need to find `<S_z(t)> = <ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)>`.\n    *   A powerful way to solve this is to think about the dynamics in terms of precession. The equation of motion for the expectation value of the spin vector is given by the Ehrenfest theorem, which for this Hamiltonian yields the classical torque equation:\n        `d<S>/dt = γ (<S> x B_f)`\n    *   This equation describes the precession of the average spin vector `<S>` around the magnetic field vector `B_f` with an angular frequency `ω = |γB|`. This frequency is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\n4.  **Visualize the precession:**\n    *   At `t=0`, the spin is pointing in the +Z direction: `<S(0)> = (ħ/2) * z_hat`.\n    *   The magnetic field is in the +Y direction: `B_f = B * y_hat`.\n    *   The spin vector `<S>` will precess around the Y-axis. It will rotate in the X-Z plane.\n    *   The z-component of the spin vector, `<S_z(t)>`, will be the projection of the precessing vector onto the Z-axis. This projection will oscillate.\n    *   If the vector `<S>` starts along the Z-axis and precesses around the Y-axis with angular frequency `ω`, its components will be:\n        *   `<S_x(t)> = -(ħ/2) * sin(ωt)`\n        *   `<S_y(t)> = 0` (it stays perpendicular to the precession axis)\n        *   `<S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)`\n    *   The z-component `<S_z(t)>` oscillates with angular frequency `ω`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the frequency:**\n    *   From the Larmor precession, the angular frequency is `ω = |γB|`. Since the options are all positive, we can write `ω = γB`, assuming `γ` and `B` represent positive quantities.\n    *   Therefore, `<μ_z(t)> = γ <S_z(t)> = γ(ħ/2)cos(γBt)`.\n    *   The oscillation frequency is the coefficient of `t` in the argument of the cosine function, which is `γB`.\n\n6.  **Alternative Method: Energy Eigenstates**\n    *   Any oscillating expectation value in a two-level system oscillates at a frequency `ω = ΔE/ħ`, where `ΔE` is the energy difference between the two energy eigenstates of the Hamiltonian.\n    *   The Hamiltonian is `H = -γB * S_y`. Its eigenstates are the eigenstates of `S_y`, which are `|+y>` and `|-y>`, with `S_y` eigenvalues of `+ħ/2` and `-ħ/2`.\n    *   The energy eigenvalues are `E_+ = -γB(+ħ/2)` and `E_- = -γB(-ħ/2)`.\n    *   The energy difference is `ΔE = |E_+ - E_-| = |-γBħ/2 - (γBħ/2)| = |-γBħ| = |γ|Bħ`.\n    *   The oscillation frequency is `ω = ΔE/ħ = |γ|Bħ / ħ = |γ|B`.\n    *   This confirms the previous result. The oscillation frequency is `γB`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) gamma*B\nB) sqrt(2)*gamma*B\nC) gamma*B/2\nD) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nThe calculated frequency `γB` matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
