    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Structure**\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\". This is a benzene ring (C6) with two substituents, so its formula is C6H4.\n*   **Total Carbon Atoms:** The compound has 8 carbon atoms in total. Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbon atoms (8 - 6 = 2).\n*   **Functional Groups (from FTIR):**\n    *   A **carbonyl group** (C=O) is present.\n    *   An **aromatic-halogen bond** is present. This means a halogen atom (like Cl, Br, I) is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Assembling the Substituents:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen atom (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining atoms, which are 2 carbons and a carbonyl group. The only common and stable arrangement for this is an **acetyl group** (-COCH3).\n*   **Putting it all together:** The compound is a haloacetophenone. The molecular formula is C8H7XO (where X is a halogen).\n\n**2. Consider the Isomers**\n\nA di-substituted benzene ring can exist as three positional isomers: *ortho* (1,2-), *meta* (1,3-), and *para* (1,4-). The 1H NMR spectrum is highly dependent on the substitution pattern.\n\n*   ***ortho*-haloacetophenone:** The two substituents are adjacent. There is no plane of symmetry bisecting the C-C bonds of the ring. This results in four chemically distinct aromatic protons, which would produce a complex splitting pattern (e.g., multiplets, doublets of doublets, etc.).\n*   ***meta*-haloacetophenone:** The substituents are at positions 1 and 3. Again, there is no plane of symmetry, leading to four distinct aromatic protons and a complex spectrum.\n*   ***para*-haloacetophenone:** The substituents are at positions 1 and 4, opposite each other. The molecule has a plane of symmetry. This makes the two protons next to the acetyl group equivalent to each other, and the two protons next to the halogen equivalent to each other. This symmetry drastically simplifies the spectrum.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for *para*-haloacetophenone**\n\n*   **Aromatic Protons:**\n    *   There are two sets of equivalent protons.\n    *   The protons ortho (adjacent) to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group (-COCH3) will be deshielded and shifted downfield. They are split by their neighbors (the other set of protons), so they will appear as a **doublet (d)**. The integration will be for **2H**. Chemical shift (δ) is expected around 7.8-8.0 ppm.\n    *   The protons ortho to the halogen (-X) will be less downfield. They are also split by their neighbors, appearing as a **doublet (d)**. The integration will be for **2H**. Chemical shift is expected around 7.4-7.6 ppm.\n*   **Aliphatic Protons:**\n    *   The acetyl group has a methyl group (-CH3). These three protons have no adjacent protons to couple with, so they will appear as a **singlet (s)**. The integration will be for **3H**. Its proximity to the carbonyl group shifts it downfield to about 2.3-2.6 ppm.\n\n**Predicted Spectrum Summary:**\n*   A doublet for 2H around 7.8 ppm.\n*   A doublet for 2H around 7.6 ppm.\n*   A singlet for 3H around 2.3 ppm.\n\n**4. Analyze the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) 1H NMR: δ 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   The chemical shifts are in the 4-5 ppm range, not the 7-8 ppm range expected for aromatic protons. This is incorrect.\n*   **B) 1H NMR: δ 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n    *   This spectrum shows two doublets in the aromatic region, each for 2H. It also shows a singlet for 3H at a chemical shift typical for an acetyl methyl group. This perfectly matches the prediction for *para*-haloacetophenone.\n*   **C) 1H NMR: δ 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n    *   The splitting pattern and integrations are inconsistent with any of the haloacetophenone isomers. This is incorrect.\n*   **D) 1H NMR: δ 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n    *   The singlet at δ 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an **aldehyde proton** (-CHO), not a ketone. The proposed structure is a ketone. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only option that correctly describes the 1H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted 8-carbon aromatic compound with a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond (*para*-haloacetophenone) is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
