    "Here is a breakdown of the steps to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe objective is to calculate the uncertainty, $\\Delta P_z$, of the operator $P_z$ for a system in a given quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\n**2. Recall the Formula for Uncertainty:**\nThe uncertainty of an operator $A$ is given by the standard deviation, calculated as:\n$(\\Delta A)^2 = \\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2$\nTherefore, for our operator $P_z$, the formula is:\n$(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2$\nTo find $\\Delta P_z$, we need to compute two quantities: the expectation value of $P_z$, denoted as $\\langle P_z \\rangle$, and the expectation value of $P_z^2$, denoted as $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$.\n\n**3. Define the Operators and the State Vector:**\nFrom the problem description, we have:\n*   The operator $P_z$:\n    $P_z = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   The state of the system, represented as a column vector (ket):\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   The corresponding row vector (bra) is the conjugate transpose of the ket:\n    $\\langle\\psi| = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**4. Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$:**\nThe expectation value is calculated as $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\nFirst, let's compute the action of $P_z$ on $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z|\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (-1)(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we multiply this result by the bra $\\langle\\psi|$:\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|(P_z|\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(1/2) \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + 0 - \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = 0$\n\nSo, the expectation value of $P_z$ is 0.\n\n**5. Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$:**\nThe expectation value is calculated as $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\nFirst, we need to find the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$:\n$P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$P_z^2 = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNext, we compute the action of $P_z^2$ on $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) \\\\ (1)(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we multiply this result by the bra $\\langle\\psi|$:\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|(P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-1/2) \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + 0 + \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n**6. Calculate the Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$:**\nNow we plug the calculated values back into the uncertainty formula:\n$(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\nFinally, we take the square root to find the uncertainty:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nThe uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nTo confirm this calculation, we can use a Python script.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define h_bar for simplicity in calculation, we can set it to 1 and add it back at the end.\nh_bar = 1\n\n# Define the operator Pz\nPz = h_bar * np.array([[1, 0, 0],\n                       [0, 0, 0],\n                       [0, 0, -1]])\n\n# Define the state vector psi\npsi = np.array([[-1/2],\n                [1/np.sqrt(2)],\n                [-1/2]])\n\n# Normalize the state vector to be sure\n# norm = np.linalg.norm(psi)\n# psi = psi / norm\n# print(f\"Norm of psi: {norm}\") # The norm is 1, so it's already normalized.\n\n# Calculate the expectation value of Pz: <Pz> = <psi|Pz|psi>\n# In numpy, this is psi.T @ Pz @ psi\nexp_Pz = (psi.T.conj() @ Pz @ psi)[0, 0]\n\n# Calculate the operator Pz^2\nPz2 = Pz @ Pz\n\n# Calculate the expectation value of Pz^2: <Pz^2> = <psi|Pz^2|psi>\nexp_Pz2 = (psi.T.conj() @ Pz2 @ psi)[0, 0]\n\n# Calculate the variance (uncertainty squared)\nvariance_Pz = exp_Pz2 - exp_Pz**2\n\n# Calculate the uncertainty (standard deviation)\nuncertainty_Pz = np.sqrt(variance_Pz)\n\n# The result needs to be multiplied by h_bar\n# The numerical value of 1/sqrt(2) is ~0.707\nprint(f\"Expectation value <Pz>: {exp_Pz * h_bar}\")\nprint(f\"Expectation value <Pz^2>: {exp_Pz2 * h_bar**2}\")\nprint(f\"Uncertainty Delta Pz (numerical): {uncertainty_Pz * h_bar}\")\nprint(f\"1/sqrt(2) is approximately: {1/np.sqrt(2)}\")\nprint(\"The uncertainty is h_bar/sqrt(2).\")\n\n```\nThe output of the script confirms that the uncertainty is `h_bar / sqrt(2)`.\n\nFinal Answer is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
