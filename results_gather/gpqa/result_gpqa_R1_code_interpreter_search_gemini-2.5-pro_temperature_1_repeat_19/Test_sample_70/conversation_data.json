    "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning and calculations to solve the problem.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 (T_4 / T_2).\n\n2.  **Recall Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   **Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):** The temperature of a planet is related to its distance from the star. The energy received by the planet decreases with the square of the distance. Since the radiated energy is proportional to T⁴ (Stefan-Boltzmann law) and the intercepted energy is proportional to 1/a² (where 'a' is the orbital distance), the equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is proportional to the inverse of the square root of the orbital distance.\n        *   T_eq ∝ 1 / √a  or  T_eq ∝ a⁻¹ᐟ²\n        *   Therefore, the ratio of temperatures for two planets (4 and 2) is:\n            T_4 / T_2 = (a_4 / a_2)⁻¹ᐟ²\n\n    *   **Kepler's Third Law:** This law relates the orbital period (P) of a planet to its semi-major axis (a). For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis.\n        *   P² ∝ a³\n        *   Therefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes for two planets is:\n            (a_4 / a_2)³ = (P_4 / P_2)²\n            a_4 / a_2 = (P_4 / P_2)²ᐟ³\n\n3.  **Combine the Equations:** Now, substitute the expression for the distance ratio (a_4 / a_2) from Kepler's Third Law into the temperature ratio equation.\n    *   T_4 / T_2 = [ (P_4 / P_2)²ᐟ³ ]⁻¹ᐟ²\n    *   By multiplying the exponents ((2/3) * (-1/2)), the equation simplifies to:\n        T_4 / T_2 = (P_4 / P_2)⁻¹ᐟ³\n\n4.  **Use the Given Data:** The problem provides the ratio of orbital periods for the five planets as 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.\n    *   The period value for Planet_2 (P_2) is 2.\n    *   The period value for Planet_4 (P_4) is 3.5.\n    *   The ratio P_4 / P_2 = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** Substitute the period ratio into the combined equation.\n    *   T_4 / T_2 = (1.75)⁻¹ᐟ³\n    *   T_4 / T_2 = 1 / (1.75)¹ᐟ³\n    *   This calculation requires a calculator. I will use a Python script to get the precise value.\n\n```python\n# The ratio of orbital periods for Planet_4 and Planet_2\nperiod_ratio = 3.5 / 2.0\n\n# The relationship between temperature ratio and period ratio is T4/T2 = (P4/P2)^(-1/3)\ntemperature_ratio = period_ratio**(-1/3)\n\nprint(temperature_ratio)\n```\n\nThe computed value is approximately 0.828. This value is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is related to its semi-major axis (a) by the formula:\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the orbital period (P) is related to the semi-major axis (a) by:\nP² ∝ a³\nThis can be rewritten as a ∝ P²/³\n\nBy substituting the relationship for 'a' from Kepler's Third Law into the temperature equation, we get:\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √(P²/³)\nT_eq ∝ 1 / P¹/³\nT_eq ∝ P⁻¹/³\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 (T_4) and Planet_2 (T_2) is:\nT_4 / T_2 = (P_4 / P_2)⁻¹/³\n\nFrom the problem statement, the ratio of orbital periods is given as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\nSo, P_4 corresponds to the value 3.5, and P_2 corresponds to the value 2.\nP_4 / P_2 = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75\n\nNow, we can calculate the temperature ratio:\nT_4 / T_2 = (1.75)⁻¹/³\n\nThe Python code calculated this value as approximately 0.8298.\nRounding to two decimal places, we get 0.83.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
