    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure:\n*   It's a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n\nThe substituents are all in a *meta* relationship to each other (1,3,5-substitution pattern).\n\n### 2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents\n\nWe need to consider how each substituent directs incoming electrophiles during electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating (weakly) and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Deactivating (strongly) and a *meta*-director.\n\nThe desired 1,3,5-pattern is challenging to achieve directly because we have a mix of meta-directing and ortho,para-directing groups. The key is to introduce the groups in the correct order.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Potential Synthetic Routes\n\nA good strategy for a 1,3,5-substituted product with two *meta*-directors and one *ortho,para*-director is to introduce the *ortho,para*-director last, onto a ring already bearing two *meta*-directors that can reinforce its position. However, this would involve an electrophilic substitution on a very strongly deactivated ring, which usually results in very low yields.\n\nLet's consider the most plausible routes by adding groups one by one and check if they match the options.\n\n**Possible Route 1: Acetylation -> Nitration -> Bromination**\n1.  **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n2.  **Acetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 3-Nitroacetophenone:** The acetyl group directs the nitro group to the meta position. Now we have two *meta*-directing groups on the ring at positions 1 and 3.\n3.  **3-Nitroacetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromo-5-nitroacetophenone (Target):** Both the acetyl group (at C1) and the nitro group (at C3) direct the incoming bromine to C5. While the directing effects are perfect, the ring is extremely deactivated by two strong electron-withdrawing groups, making this reaction very slow and low-yield. Therefore, this is not a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\n**Possible Route 2: Acetylation -> Bromination -> Nitration**\n1.  **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n2.  **Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group directs the bromine to the meta position. The ring is now disubstituted with an acetyl group (meta-director) and a bromo group (ortho,para-director).\n3.  **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one (Target):** This is the crucial step. We have competing directors.\n    *   The acetyl group (-COCH3 at C1) directs the incoming -NO2 group to C5.\n    *   The bromo group (-Br at C3) directs the incoming -NO2 group to its ortho (C2, C4) and para (C6) positions.\n    *   To determine the major product, we must analyze the stability of the intermediate carbocation (arenium ion).\n        *   Attack at positions C2, C4, or C6 (directed by -Br) would result in a resonance structure where the positive charge is on C1, adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group. This is highly destabilizing.\n        *   Attack at C5 (directed by -COCH3) results in an intermediate where the positive charge is never adjacent to C1. This path is kinetically much more favorable.\n    *   Therefore, nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone gives the desired 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone as the major product. This route is also more favorable than Route 1 because the ring in the final step is less deactivated (Br is less deactivating than NO2). This represents a viable, high-yield synthesis.\n\n### 4. Evaluate the Given Options\n\nNow let's see which option matches our derived high-yield route.\n\n*   **A) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n    The first three steps of this sequence exactly match our \"Possible Route 2\", which we determined to be the most logical and high-yield synthesis. The subsequent steps (iv to vii) are nonsensical; they seem to reduce the product and then perform other reactions that would undo the synthesis or lead to different products. It appears the question might be flawed by including these extra steps, but the core synthesis (steps i-iii) is correct.\n\n*   **B) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n    1.  Bromobenzene → p-Bromonitrobenzene (major).\n    2.  Friedel-Crafts acylation of p-bromonitrobenzene is attempted. The ring is strongly deactivated by the -NO2 group, so this reaction would have a very low yield, if it works at all. Furthermore, the directing groups (-Br is o,p; -NO2 is m) would place the acetyl group at position 2 (ortho to Br, meta to NO2), yielding 2-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone, which is the wrong isomer. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...**\n    The first four steps (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, then to a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene. This sequence is pointless and incorrect.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n    1.  Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n    2.  Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (a strong base) with AlCl3 (a Lewis acid) does not proceed as a simple ring acylation. The amine reacts with the catalyst. Even if it could be made to work under specific conditions to produce 3-aminoacetophenone, the subsequent bromination would be directed by the powerful activating -NH2 group to positions ortho and para to it (positions 2, 4, 6), not the desired position 5. This option is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe sequence of reactions outlined in the first three steps of **Option A** represents the most chemically sound and high-yield pathway to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Despite the superfluous and incorrect additional steps listed in the option, it is the only choice that contains a correct synthetic core.\n\n<<<A>>>"
