    "Here's my thinking process to solve this chemical equilibrium problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the percentage of a specific cobalt complex, dithiocyanato cobalt(II) which is `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total amount of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **List the Knowns:**\n    *   Total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M.\n    *   Thiocyanate ion concentration, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.\n    *   Stepwise overall stability constants for the formation of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes:\n        *   Co²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺ ; β₁ = 9\n        *   Co²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂] ; β₂ = 40\n        *   Co²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ ; β₃ = 63\n        *   Co²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ ; β₄ = 16\n\n3.  **Formulate the Equations:**\n    The total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all species containing cobalt:\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\n    The stability constants (β) relate the concentration of each complex to the concentration of the free metal ion ([Co²⁺]) and the free ligand ([SCN⁻]):\n    *   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]¹\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³\n    *   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴\n\n4.  **Develop a Strategy:**\n    The desired quantity is the percentage of `[Co(SCN)₂]`:\n    Percentage = ( [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co) ) * 100\n\n    I can substitute the expressions from step 3 into the equation for c(Co):\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + (β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]) + (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) + (β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³) + (β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n    Now, I can factor out the [Co²⁺] term:\n    c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\n    Now, let's look at the percentage formula again:\n    Percentage = ( β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² / [Co²⁺](1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴) ) * 100\n\n    The `[Co²⁺]` term appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out. This is very convenient and means the total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10⁻² M, is actually not needed for the calculation, as long as we can assume the free ligand concentration is [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M. This is a reasonable assumption because the ligand concentration (0.1 M) is significantly higher than the metal ion concentration (0.01 M), so the amount of ligand that gets bound in complexes won't change the free ligand concentration drastically.\n\n    The simplified formula is:\n    Percentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = ( β₂[SCN⁻]² / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴) ) * 100\n\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    I will set up a Python script to perform the calculation accurately, avoiding any manual arithmetic errors.\n\n    *   Define the variables: `beta1`, `beta2`, `beta3`, `beta4`, and `scn_conc`.\n    *   Calculate the numerator: `term2 = beta2 * scn_conc**2`.\n    *   Calculate the denominator, which is the sum of all terms: `denominator = 1 + (beta1 * scn_conc**1) + (beta2 * scn_conc**2) + (beta3 * scn_conc**3) + (beta4 * scn_conc**4)`.\n    *   Calculate the fraction: `fraction = term2 / denominator`.\n    *   Convert to percentage and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given stability constants\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\n\n# Given thiocyanate concentration\nscn_conc = 0.1  # [SCN-] in M\n\n# The distribution of species is determined by the fraction of each species relative to the total.\n# The term for the free Co(II) ion is 1 * [Co^2+]\nterm0 = 1\n\n# The term for [Co(SCN)]+ is beta1 * [SCN-]\nterm1 = beta1 * scn_conc**1\n\n# The term for [Co(SCN)2] is beta2 * [SCN-]^2\nterm2 = beta2 * scn_conc**2\n\n# The term for [Co(SCN)3]- is beta3 * [SCN-]^3\nterm3 = beta3 * scn_conc**3\n\n# The term for [Co(SCN)4]2- is beta4 * [SCN-]^4\nterm4 = beta4 * scn_conc**4\n\n# The sum of all terms (proportional to the total cobalt concentration)\n# This is often called the alpha function denominator.\nsum_of_terms = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4\n\n# The fraction of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)2], is the term for this species divided by the sum of all terms.\nfraction_CoSCN2 = term2 / sum_of_terms\n\n# Convert the fraction to a percentage\npercentage_CoSCN2 = fraction_CoSCN2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"{percentage_CoSCN2:.1f}%\")\n```\n\n<<<16.9%\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we need to calculate the fraction of this species relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n**1. Identify all cobalt-containing species:**\nThe species present in the solution are the free Co(II) ion and its complexes with thiocyanate (SCN⁻):\n*   Free ion: Co²⁺\n*   Monothiocyanato complex: [Co(SCN)]⁺\n*   Dithiocyanato complex: [Co(SCN)₂]\n*   Trithiocyanato complex: [Co(SCN)₃]⁻\n*   Tetrathiocyanato complex: [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻\n\n**2. Express the concentration of each species:**\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of all these species:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nWe can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free Co²⁺ ion concentration, the free ligand concentration [SCN⁻], and the overall stability constants (β):\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\n**3. Formulate the fraction of the desired complex:**\nThe percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)₂], is given by:\nPercentage = ( [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co) ) * 100\n\nSubstitute the expressions from step 2 into the formula for c(Co):\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nNow, substitute this into the percentage formula:\nPercentage = ( β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² / ([Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴) ) * 100\n\nNotice that [Co²⁺] is a common factor in every term in the numerator and denominator, so it can be cancelled out. This means the result does not depend on the total cobalt concentration. The calculation only requires the stability constants and the free ligand concentration. Since the thiocyanate concentration (0.1 M) is ten times higher than the total cobalt concentration (0.01 M), we can approximate the free ligand concentration [SCN⁻] as 0.1 M.\n\nThe simplified formula is:\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = ( β₂[SCN⁻]² / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴) ) * 100\n\n**4. Perform the calculation:**\nUsing the given values:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nLet's calculate each term in the denominator:\n*   1\n*   β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * (0.1)¹ = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nSum of terms (denominator) = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\nThe numerator is the term for the desired complex: β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\nFraction = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\nPercentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThe calculation confirms the result from the code execution.\n\n<<<C>>>"
