You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the provided DNA sequence.**\n    The user provides a DNA sequence that is supposed to code for a fusion protein: an N-terminal HA tag followed by the mouse GADD45G protein. The experiment failed because the protein was not overexpressed. I need to find the error in the sequence.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the components of the engineered gene.**\n    The sequence should contain:\n    1.  A start codon (ATG).\n    2.  The DNA sequence for the HA tag.\n    3.  The coding sequence for GADD45G.\n    4.  A stop codon at the very end of the GADD45G sequence.\n\n*   **Step 3: Examine the beginning of the sequence.**\n    The sequence starts with `5'-ATG...`. This is the correct start codon for Methionine.\n\n*   **Step 4: Examine the HA tag sequence.**\n    The problem states the tag is a \"single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant\". The amino acid sequence for this tag is YPYDVPDYA. A common DNA sequence for this is `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCT`.\n    Let's look at the sequence provided in the problem, right after the `ATG` start codon:\n    `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC`\n    This translates to the amino acid sequence YPYDVPDYA. The last codon, `GCC`, is a synonymous codon for Alanine (the other common one being `GCT`). So, the HA tag sequence is functionally correct.\n\n*   **Step 5: Translate the sequence immediately following the HA tag.**\n    Let's read the sequence codon by codon from the beginning:\n    `ATG` (Start)\n    `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC` (This is the HA tag, YPYDVPDYA)\n    The very next codon is `AAA` (Lysine).\n    The codon after that is `TGA`.\n\n*   **Step 6: Identify the problematic codon.**\n    The codon `TGA` is a stop codon (in mRNA, this would be UGA). When the ribosome encounters a stop codon, it terminates translation. This `TGA` codon appears immediately after the HA tag and one additional amino acid (Lysine). Therefore, the ribosome starts translation, produces a very short peptide (Met-HA-Lys), and then stops. The full GADD45G protein is never synthesized.\n\n*   **Step 7: Evaluate the given options based on the finding.**\n    *   **A) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This is correct. A premature `TGA` stop codon caused early termination.\n    *   **B) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** This is incorrect. The mutation in the HA tag sequence (`GCC` instead of `GCT`) is silent/synonymous; it does not change the amino acid sequence.\n    *   **C) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This is incorrect for two reasons. First, the stop codon is `TGA`, not `TAA`. Second, stop codons are recognized by protein release factors, not tRNAs.\n    *   **D) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** This is incorrect. The problem is that the full-length protein is not being synthesized in the first place, not that it's being degraded after synthesis.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of an accidental, premature stop codon (`TGA`) right after the HA tag sequence is the reason for the failed overexpression. This means the ribosome terminated translation early.\n\n<<<A>>>"
