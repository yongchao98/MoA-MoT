    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to determine which exoplanet has the highest density.\n\n1.  **Analyze the options provided:**\n    *   a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. This is our baseline reference. Earth's average density is approximately 5.51 g/cm³. Let's denote this as ρ_Earth.\n    *   b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. The density is explicitly given as ~5.5 g/cm³, which is nearly identical to Earth's density.\n    *   c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.\n    *   d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.\n\n2.  **Apply the principle of gravitational compression:**\n    The density of a planet is determined by its mass and volume (ρ = M/V). For planets with the same composition (i.e., made of the same \"stuff\"), the overall density is heavily influenced by the planet's mass.\n    *   A more massive planet has stronger gravity.\n    *   This stronger gravity compresses the materials (rock, iron core, etc.) more tightly.\n    *   This compression leads to a smaller volume for a given mass than one would expect otherwise, resulting in a higher overall density.\n\n3.  **Compare the densities based on this principle:**\n    *   **Planet (a):** The reference planet, Earth. Density ρ_a ≈ 5.51 g/cm³.\n    *   **Planet (b):** The density is given as ρ_b ≈ 5.5 g/cm³. This is approximately equal to Earth's density.\n    *   **Planet (c):** This planet has the same composition as Earth but is 5 times more massive. Due to its significantly higher mass, its internal materials will be much more compressed by gravity. Therefore, its density (ρ_c) must be *greater* than Earth's density.\n    *   **Planet (d):** This planet has the same composition as Earth but is only half as massive. With less mass, its gravitational compression will be weaker than Earth's. Therefore, its density (ρ_d) must be *lower* than Earth's density.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the comparison:**\n    *   ρ_d < ρ_Earth\n    *   ρ_a ≈ ρ_Earth\n    *   ρ_b ≈ ρ_Earth\n    *   ρ_c > ρ_Earth\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the analysis, the planet described in option (c) will be the most compressed due to its high mass, and will therefore have the highest density.\n\nTo provide a quantitative estimate, we can use the mass-radius relationship for rocky planets, which is approximately R ∝ M^0.27. Density (ρ) is proportional to M/R³, so ρ ∝ M / (M^0.27)³ = M / M^0.81 = M^0.19.\n\n*   For planet (c), M = 5 M_Earth, so its density would be roughly 5^0.19 ≈ 1.36 times Earth's density (1.36 * 5.51 g/cm³ ≈ 7.5 g/cm³).\n*   For planet (d), M = 0.5 M_Earth, so its density would be roughly 0.5^0.19 ≈ 0.88 times Earth's density (0.88 * 5.51 g/cm³ ≈ 4.8 g/cm³).\n\nThis confirms the qualitative reasoning. The 5-Earth-mass planet is by far the densest.\n\n<<<D>>>"
