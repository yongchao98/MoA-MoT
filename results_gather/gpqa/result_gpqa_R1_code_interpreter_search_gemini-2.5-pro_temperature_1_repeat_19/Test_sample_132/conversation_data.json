    "This problem requires a step-by-step calculation of ion concentrations in a buffer solution.\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of the initial components:**\n    First, we need to determine the number of moles of the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H₂PO₄⁻) from KH₂PO₄ and the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻) from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O.\n\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = mass / molar mass\n        Moles of KH₂PO₄ = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 moles\n        Since KH₂PO₄ dissociates completely into K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻, the moles of H₂PO₄⁻ are also 0.007348 mol.\n\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = mass / molar mass\n        Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 moles\n        Since Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O dissociates completely, the moles of HPO₄²⁻ are also 0.005618 mol.\n\n2.  **Calculate the concentrations of the buffer components:**\n    The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.200 L.\n\n    *   Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ ([H₂PO₄⁻]) = moles / volume\n        [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.03674 M\n\n    *   Concentration of HPO₄²⁻ ([HPO₄²⁻]) = moles / volume\n        [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.02809 M\n\n3.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]:**\n    The solution is a buffer formed by the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻ and its conjugate base HPO₄²⁻. The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n    H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka₂ = 6.2 x 10⁻⁸.\n\n    The equilibrium expression is:\n    Ka₂ = ([H⁺][HPO₄²⁻]) / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for [H⁺]:\n    [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    [H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    [H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO₄³⁻]:**\n    The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻). This corresponds to the third dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n    HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Ka₃ = 1.8 x 10⁻¹².\n\n    The equilibrium expression is:\n    Ka₃ = ([H⁺][PO₄³⁻]) / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, [PO₄³⁻]:\n    [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n\n    Now, we substitute the values we have calculated:\n    [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n    [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nTo ensure precision, we can perform the entire calculation using a script.\n\n```python\n# Molar masses\nmw_kh2po4 = 136.09  # g/mol\nmw_na2hpo4_2h2o = 177.99 # g/mol\n\n# Given masses and volume\nmass_kh2po4 = 1.00  # g\nmass_na2hpo4 = 1.00  # g\nvolume = 0.200  # L (200.00 cm^3)\n\n# Dissociation constants\nKa2 = 6.2e-8\nKa3 = 1.8e-12\n\n# Step 1: Calculate moles\nmoles_h2po4_minus = mass_kh2po4 / mw_kh2po4\nmoles_hpo4_2minus = mass_na2hpo4 / mw_na2hpo4_2h2o\n\n# Step 2: Calculate initial concentrations\nconc_h2po4_minus = moles_h2po4_minus / volume\nconc_hpo4_2minus = moles_hpo4_2minus / volume\n\n# Step 3: Calculate [H+] using the buffer equilibrium (Ka2)\n# Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4-]\n# [H+] = Ka2 * [H2PO4-] / [HPO4^2-]\nconc_H_plus = Ka2 * (conc_h2po4_minus / conc_hpo4_2minus)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate [PO4^3-] using the third dissociation (Ka3)\n# Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]\n# [PO4^3-] = Ka3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+]\n# We assume [HPO4^2-] at equilibrium is approximately its initial concentration\n# because Ka3 is very small, so very little HPO4^2- dissociates further.\nconc_po4_3minus = Ka3 * (conc_hpo4_2minus / conc_H_plus)\n\nprint(f\"{conc_po4_3minus:.2e}\")\n```\n\nThe calculation confirms that the concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in a solution made by dissolving KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O in water.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Identify the species in solution:**\n    *   KH₂PO₄ dissociates completely into K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻ (dihydrogen phosphate).\n    *   Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O dissociates completely into 2 Na⁺, HPO₄²⁻ (hydrogen phosphate), and 2 H₂O.\n    *   The key species for the buffer system are the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻ and its conjugate base HPO₄²⁻.\n\n2.  **Calculate the moles of the buffer components:**\n    *   Molar mass of KH₂PO₄ = 136.09 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007348 mol.\n        This gives 0.007348 moles of H₂PO₄⁻.\n    *   Molar mass of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = 177.99 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005618 mol.\n        This gives 0.005618 moles of HPO₄²⁻.\n\n3.  **Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components:**\n    *   The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L.\n    *   Initial concentration of H₂PO₄⁻: [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.03674 M.\n    *   Initial concentration of HPO₄²⁻: [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L ≈ 0.02809 M.\n\n4.  **Determine the pH and [H⁺] of the buffer solution:**\n    The buffer system is governed by the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄):\n    H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻      Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸\n    We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation or the equilibrium expression directly.\n    Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    Rearranging to solve for [H⁺]:\n    [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n5.  **Calculate the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻):**\n    The orthophosphate ion is formed from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n    HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻      Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹²\n    The equilibrium expression is:\n    Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    Rearranging to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n    [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    We use the concentrations of HPO₄²⁻ and H⁺ that we found for the buffer system. Since Ka₃ is very small, we can assume the concentration of HPO₄²⁻ at equilibrium is approximately its initial concentration (0.02809 M).\n    [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n    [PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculation shows that the concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
