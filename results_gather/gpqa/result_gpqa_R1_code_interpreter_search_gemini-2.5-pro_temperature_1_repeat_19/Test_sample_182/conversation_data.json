    "**1. Analyze the Reactant**\n\n*   **Name:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Structure:** Let's break down the name to draw the molecule.\n    *   `cyclohex-3-ene`: A six-membered carbon ring with a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 4.\n    *   `carboxylic acid`: The principal functional group (-COOH), located at carbon 1 (by convention).\n    *   `2-formyl`: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is attached to carbon 2.\n    *   `5-vinyl`: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is attached to carbon 5.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Let's count the atoms to determine the molecular formula.\n    *   Carbon (C): 6 in the ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO + 2 in -CH=CH2 = 10 carbons (C10).\n    *   Hydrogen (H):\n        *   On C1: 1H\n        *   On C2: 1H\n        *   On C3: 1H\n        *   On C4: 1H\n        *   On C5: 1H\n        *   On C6: 2H\n        *   In -COOH: 1H\n        *   In -CHO: 1H\n        *   In -CH=CH2: 3H\n        *   Total H = 1+1+1+1+1+2+1+1+3 = 12 hydrogens (H12).\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2 in -COOH + 1 in -CHO = 3 oxygens (O3).\n    *   The molecular formula of the reactant is **C10H12O3**.\n\n*   **Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of Reactant:** The IHD (or degree of unsaturation) tells us the number of rings and/or multiple bonds.\n    *   The formula for IHD is: `IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)` for a compound with C, H, and O.\n    *   IHD(reactant) = 10 + 1 - (12/2) = 11 - 6 = 5.\n    *   Let's verify this from the structure: 1 ring + 1 (C=C in ring) + 1 (C=C in vinyl) + 1 (C=O in formyl) + 1 (C=O in carboxyl) = 5. This confirms our structure and formula.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus and excess hydroiodic acid (Red P + excess HI).\n*   **Function:** This combination is an extremely powerful reducing agent. It performs a complete reduction of most oxygen-containing functional groups and unsaturations (double/triple bonds) to the corresponding saturated alkane.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The formyl group (-CHO) will be reduced to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   The double bond in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2) will be reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2-CH3).\n    *   The double bond within the cyclohexene ring (-C=C-) will be reduced to a single bond (-CH-CH-).\n    *   The overall ring structure is maintained.\n\n**3. Determine the Product**\n\n*   The reaction will remove all oxygen atoms and saturate all carbon-carbon double bonds.\n*   The carbon skeleton of the reactant is C10. This will be preserved.\n*   The reactant has one ring. This will be preserved.\n*   Therefore, the product will be a saturated monocyclic hydrocarbon (a substituted cycloalkane) with 10 carbon atoms.\n*   The general molecular formula for a monocyclic alkane is **CnH2n**.\n*   Since our product has 10 carbon atoms (n=10), its molecular formula will be **C10H20**.\n*   The specific structure would be 4-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane, but its exact name is not required to find the IHD.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\n*   The IHD can be calculated from the product's molecular formula (C10H20) or its structural features.\n\n*   **Method 1: Using the molecular formula**\n    *   IHD = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    *   IHD(product) = 10 + 1 - (20/2) = 11 - 10 = **1**.\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the structure**\n    *   The product is a saturated cycloalkane. This means it has no double or triple bonds. Its only feature contributing to the IHD is the ring.\n    *   IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of double bonds) + (Number of triple bonds)\n    *   IHD(product) = 1 + 0 + 0 = **1**.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) 5\nB) 3\nC) 0\nD) 1\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
