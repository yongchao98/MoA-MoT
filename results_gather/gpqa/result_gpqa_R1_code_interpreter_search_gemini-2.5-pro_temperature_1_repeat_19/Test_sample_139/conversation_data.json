    "<search>melting point of D2O in kelvin</search>\n<information>\nHeavy water (D₂O) freezes at 3.82 °C (38.88 °F; 276.97 K), whereas normal water freezes at 0.0 °C (32.0 °F; 273.15 K). This difference in freezing points can be used to separate them by fractional crystallization.\n</information>\n **Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: \"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements...\"** This points towards a deuterated compound, where Deuterium (D or ²H) replaces Protium (¹H). Deuterium is a common heavy isotope used in chemical synthesis and mechanistic studies.\n\n    *   **Clue 2 & 3: \"...reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons...\"**\n        *   Let's analyze Gas W. A molecule with an equal number of protons (P) and neutrons (N).\n        *   Consider D₂ (Deuterium gas). Each D atom has P=1, N=1. So, the D₂ molecule has P=2, N=2. This fits perfectly (P=N).\n        *   The violent reaction producing D₂ suggests X is a powerful deuteride-donating reagent (a strong reducing agent).\n        *   For X to react and produce D₂ gas, it must react with a source of D⁺. The most common \"liquid Y\" that would fit this profile and react violently is heavy water, D₂O. The reaction would be D⁻ (from X) + D⁺ (from D₂O) → D₂.\n        *   So, we can hypothesize: **W = D₂** and **Y = D₂O**.\n\n    *   **Clue 4 & 5 & 6: \"...and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K.\"**\n        *   Melting point of B ≈ 277 K = 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C.\n        *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is an excellent match. So, **B = D₂O**.\n        *   A precipitate G is formed in the reaction of X with D₂O. When heated, G releases D₂O. This is characteristic of a metal hydroxide (or in this case, deuteroxide) decomposing to a metal oxide and water (or heavy water). For example, 2M(OD)₃ → M₂O₃ + 3D₂O.\n        *   So, G is a metal deuteroxide that is insoluble in D₂O.\n\n    *   **Clue 7 & 8: \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\"**\n        *   We are looking for a common deuterated reducing agent. The most powerful and common ones are analogs of sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) and lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄). Let's consider their deuterated versions, NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄.\n        *   The analog of X is very common, which strongly favors LiAlH₄ over other possibilities like CaH₂. LiAlH₄ is one of the most important reducing agents in organic synthesis.\n        *   Let's test **X = LiAlD₄**.\n            *   **Reaction with D₂O (Y):** LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂.\n            *   This reaction is notoriously violent (check).\n            *   It produces D₂ gas (W) (check).\n            *   It produces aluminum deuteroxide, Al(OD)₃. Aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. So, Al(OD)₃ would be the precipitate G (check).\n            *   **Heating G:** 2Al(OD)₃(s) --(heat)--> Al₂O₃(s) + 3D₂O(g). This reaction releases D₂O (B) (check).\n        *   Now, let's test the keto acid reaction. A keto acid contains both a ketone (C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. For example, pyruvic acid (CH₃-CO-COOH).\n        *   LiAlH₄ (the analog of X) is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce both functional groups. A ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-), and a carboxylic acid is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH).\n        *   Therefore, the reaction of a keto acid (which has 3 oxygen atoms) with LiAlD₄ would result in a diol (a molecule with two -OH groups), which contains exactly **2 oxygen atoms**. This perfectly matches the clue.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** All clues point to **Substance X being Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n2.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X\".\n    *   Substance X = LiAlD₄.\n    *   The elements present are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n    *   We use the mass numbers of the specific isotopes involved:\n        *   Deuterium (D = ²H): Mass number = 2\n        *   Lithium (Li): The most common isotope is ⁷Li. Mass number = 7\n        *   Aluminum (Al): The only stable isotope is ²⁷Al. Mass number = 27\n    *   Comparing the masses: D (2) < Li (7) < Al (27).\n    *   The lightest element is **Deuterium (D)**.\n    *   The heaviest element is **Aluminum (Al)**.\n    *   The question specifies: \"...if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\" This means we need to sum the masses of all atoms of the lightest element and all atoms of the heaviest element in the formula.\n    *   Mass from the heaviest element (Al): There is one Al atom. Total mass = 27.\n    *   Mass from the lightest element (D): There are four D atoms. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Cumulative atomic mass = (Total mass of Al) + (Total mass of D) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n3.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    *   The calculated value is 35. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "**Reasoning and Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X contains a heavier isotope.** This strongly suggests a compound where a common element is replaced by its heavier isotope. In organic and inorganic chemistry, the most common example is the replacement of hydrogen (¹H) with deuterium (D or ²H).\n    *   **Clue 2: X reacts violently with liquid Y.** This indicates a very reactive substance X and a protic (or in this case, deuterated) solvent Y.\n    *   **Clue 3: A gas W is released, with an equal number of neutrons and protons.** Let's consider simple diatomic gases.\n        *   H₂ (Protium gas): Each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. H₂ molecule has 2 protons, 0 neutrons. (Doesn't fit).\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): Each D has 1 proton, 1 neutron. D₂ molecule has 2 protons, 2 neutrons. (This fits perfectly).\n        *   N₂: Each ¹⁴N has 7 protons, 7 neutrons. N₂ molecule has 14 protons, 14 neutrons. (This also fits).\n        *   However, the release of D₂ gas is much more consistent with a deuterated reagent reacting with a deuterium source.\n    *   **Clue 4: The reaction is between X and liquid Y, producing gas W (D₂).** For X to produce D₂, it must be a deuteride (D⁻) donor. For Y to react and form D₂, it must be a deuterium cation (D⁺) source. The most common liquid source of D⁺ is heavy water, D₂O. The reaction would be D⁻ + D⁺ → D₂. This reaction is known to be violent for strong deuteride donors. So, let's hypothesize **Y = D₂O** and **W = D₂**.\n    *   **Clue 5: A precipitate G forms, which releases B upon heating.** Many metal hydrides react with water to form metal hydroxides, which are often insoluble (precipitates). By analogy, a metal deuteride would react with heavy water to form a metal deuteroxide. For example: M-D + D₂O → M-OD + D₂. Many metal hydroxides decompose upon heating to form a metal oxide and water. So, G would be a metal deuteroxide, and upon heating, it would release heavy water (B).\n    *   **Clue 6: B has a melting point very close to 277 K.** 277 K is 277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C. The provided search information confirms the melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 276.97 K (3.82 °C). This is an excellent match. Therefore, **B = D₂O**. This confirms our earlier hypotheses that Y is D₂O and G is a metal deuteroxide.\n    *   **Clue 7: X and its analog are common reagents in organic chemistry.** We are looking for a powerful deuteride reducing agent whose hydride analog is very common. The two most prominent hydride reducing agents are Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) and Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated analogs are Sodium Borodeuteride (NaBD₄) and Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄). LiAlH₄ is known for its extremely violent reaction with water, which fits the description well.\n    *   **Clue 8: The product of the reaction of a keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.** A keto acid has the general structure R-CO-COOH, containing one ketone group and one carboxylic acid group, for a total of 3 oxygen atoms. LiAlH₄ (the analog of X) is a very strong reducing agent, capable of reducing both functional groups.\n        *   Ketone (R₂C=O) → Secondary alcohol (R₂CH-OH)\n        *   Carboxylic acid (R-COOH) → Primary alcohol (R-CH₂OH)\n        *   Therefore, reacting a keto acid (3 oxygens) with LiAlD₄ would reduce both groups, resulting in a diol (a compound with two alcohol groups, e.g., R-CH(OD)-CH₂(OD)). The final product contains **2 oxygen atoms**, which perfectly matches the clue.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X and Perform Calculation:**\n    *   Based on all the evidence, Substance X is **Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   The elements present in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D).\n    *   We need the atomic masses of the specific isotopes involved. We use the mass number (protons + neutrons).\n        *   Deuterium (D or ²H): 1 proton + 1 neutron = Mass 2\n        *   Lithium (Li): The most abundant stable isotope is ⁷Li. Mass = 7\n        *   Aluminum (Al): The only stable isotope is ²⁷Al. Mass = 27\n    *   The lightest element is Deuterium (mass 2).\n    *   The heaviest element is Aluminum (mass 27).\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements, summing all instances.\n    *   Total mass from the heaviest element (Al): There is one Al atom. Mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Total mass from the lightest element (D): There are four D atoms. Mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   Cumulative mass = (Mass of Al) + (Mass of D) = 27 + 8 = 35.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The calculated cumulative mass is 35, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
