    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Key Quantities and Assumptions:**\n    *   **Assumption:** Stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, ρ (number of stars per unit volume), is a constant.\n    *   **Parallax (plx):** Parallax is inversely proportional to the distance (d) to a star. The relationship is `plx = 1/d` (where d is in parsecs and plx is in arcseconds). Consequently, `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   **Goal:** We need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which can be written as `dN/d(plx)`, depends on `plx`.\n\n2.  **Relate the Number of Stars to Distance:**\n    *   Consider a sphere of radius `d` centered on the observer.\n    *   The volume of this sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`.\n    *   Since the star density `ρ` is constant, the total number of stars `N` within this distance `d` is `N = ρ * V`.\n    *   So, `N(d) = (4/3)πρd³`.\n\n3.  **Find the Number of Stars in a Thin Shell:**\n    *   Now, let's consider the number of stars `dN` in a thin spherical shell between distance `d` and `d + dd`.\n    *   The volume of this thin shell, `dV`, is the surface area of the sphere (`4πd²`) multiplied by the thickness of the shell (`dd`).\n    *   `dV = 4πd² * dd`\n    *   The number of stars in this shell is `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`.\n\n4.  **Convert from Distance to Parallax:**\n    *   Our expression for `dN` is in terms of `d` and `dd`. We need it in terms of `plx` and `d(plx)`.\n    *   We know `d = 1/plx`.\n    *   We need to find the relationship between the small thickness `dd` and the small parallax interval `d(plx)`. We can get this by differentiating `d` with respect to `plx`.\n    *   `d/d(plx) [1/plx] = d/d(plx) [plx⁻¹] = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n    *   So, `dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²`, which means `dd = - (1/plx²) d(plx)`.\n    *   The negative sign just indicates that as distance `d` increases, parallax `plx` decreases. When we are counting stars in a shell, we only care about the magnitude of the thickness, so we can write `|dd| = (1/plx²) |d(plx)|`.\n\n5.  **Substitute and Solve:**\n    *   Now, substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:\n    *   `dN = ρ * 4π * d² * dd`\n    *   `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * ( (1/plx²) d(plx) )`\n    *   Combine the terms:\n    *   `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Find the Final Relationship:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\", which is `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this by rearranging the equation from the previous step.\n    *   `dN / d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n    *   Since `4πρ` is a constant, we have the proportionality:\n    *   `dN / d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as the fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<A>>>"
