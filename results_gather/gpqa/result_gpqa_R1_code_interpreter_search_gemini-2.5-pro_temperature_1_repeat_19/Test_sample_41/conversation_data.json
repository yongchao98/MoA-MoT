    "Answering this question requires applying the principles of planetary equilibrium temperature and Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n**1. Understand the relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance.**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star is determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from the star and the energy radiated away into space. The formula is:\n\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} (\\frac{R_{star}}{2a})^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $T_{star}$ is the star's temperature.\n*   $R_{star}$ is the star's radius.\n*   $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the orbital radius for a circular orbit).\n*   $A$ is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n\nSince all three planets orbit the same star ($T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constant) and have the same albedo ($A=0.3$), the formula simplifies to show that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital radius:\n\n$T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}$\n\nThis means that for any two planets (i and j) in the system, the ratio of their temperatures is related to the ratio of their orbital radii as follows:\n\n$\\frac{T_{eq,i}}{T_{eq,j}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_j}{a_i}}$\n\n**2. Calculate the ratio of the orbital radii.**\n\nWe are given the temperature ratios and can use the relationship derived above to find the ratios of the orbital radii.\n\n*   **For Planet 1 and Planet 2:**\n    $\\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = 1.4 = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}$\n    Squaring both sides gives:\n    $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96$\n\n*   **For Planet 2 and Planet 3:**\n    $\\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} = 2.3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_3}{a_2}}$\n    Squaring both sides gives:\n    $\\frac{a_3}{a_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29$\n\nTo find the ratio of the orbital radius of Planet 3 to Planet 1 ($\\frac{a_3}{a_1}$), we multiply the two ratios we found:\n\n$\\frac{a_3}{a_1} = \\frac{a_3}{a_2} \\times \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = 5.29 \\times 1.96 = 10.3684$\n\n**3. Apply Kepler's Third Law.**\n\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis ($a$):\n\n$P^2 \\propto a^3$\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\n$P \\propto a^{3/2}$\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the orbital periods of Planet 3 and Planet 1 is:\n\n$\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (\\frac{a_3}{a_1})^{3/2}$\n\n**4. Calculate the final answer.**\n\nNow, we substitute the value of the orbital radii ratio we calculated in step 2:\n\n$\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2}$\n\nLet's compute this value:\n$\\frac{P_3}{P_1} \\approx 33.41$\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4.\n\nThe information about the planet masses and the TTV method is extra information not needed for this specific calculation, as the mass of the planets is negligible compared to the star's mass when applying Kepler's Third Law in this context.\n\n<<<A>>>"
