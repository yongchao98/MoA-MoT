    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the outcome of the HPLC analysis.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  **mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid):** This reagent performs an epoxidation reaction on the alkene. Epoxidation is a *syn*-addition, meaning both new C-O bonds are formed on the same face of the alkene double bond.\n    2.  **Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺):** This reagent causes the ring-opening of the epoxide. The acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an epoxide is an *anti*-addition, where the incoming nucleophile (water) attacks from the side opposite to the epoxide C-O bond.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 1:**\n    *   The overall process (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene.\n    *   There's a well-known stereochemical rule for additions to alkenes: **Trans-alkene + Anti-addition → Meso compound**.\n    *   Let's verify this step-by-step:\n        1.  The *syn*-addition of the epoxide oxygen to the *trans*-alkene can happen from the top or bottom face, producing a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides: (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n        2.  The subsequent *anti*-attack by water on either epoxide enantiomer leads to the same single product. For example, attack on the (4R,5R)-epoxide results in (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Attack on the (4S,5S)-epoxide also results in (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, which is the same molecule.\n        3.  (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol has two chiral centers but is an achiral molecule overall due to an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion. It is a **meso compound**.\n    *   **Product of Reaction 1 (P1):** A single meso compound, meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a *cis*-alkene. It is also an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** The same as in Reaction 1. The overall reaction is again an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction 2:**\n    *   We apply the stereochemical rule: **Cis-alkene + Anti-addition → Racemic mixture (pair of enantiomers)**.\n    *   Let's verify this step-by-step:\n        1.  The *syn*-addition of the epoxide oxygen to the *cis*-alkene produces a single, achiral meso epoxide: (4R,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n        2.  The subsequent *anti*-attack by water on this meso epoxide can occur at either carbon of the epoxide ring (C4 or C5). Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, the product must be achiral or a racemic mixture.\n        3.  Attack at one carbon (e.g., C4) will produce one enantiomer, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Attack at the other carbon (C5) will produce the other enantiomer, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. These two attacks are equally probable.\n    *   **Product of Reaction 2 (P2):** A **racemic mixture** of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nLet's look at the relationships between these isomers:\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).\n*   The meso-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) diol and the (4S,5S) diol (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n**1. Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC:**\n*   An achiral HPLC column separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity).\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and thus can be separated.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will not be separated. They will elute at the same time (co-elute).\n*   In our mixture:\n    *   The meso-diol will be separated from the enantiomeric pair because they are diastereomers. This gives **one peak**.\n    *   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers will co-elute, appearing as a **single peak**.\n*   Therefore, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show a total of **2 peaks**.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC:**\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase. This creates a chiral environment that allows for the separation of enantiomers.\n*   **Diastereomers** are always separable, on both chiral and achiral columns.\n*   **Enantiomers** interact differently with the chiral stationary phase, leading to different retention times, and thus they can be separated.\n*   In our mixture:\n    *   The meso-diol, the (4R,5R)-diol, and the (4S,5S)-diol are all distinct stereoisomers.\n    *   The chiral column will separate the meso compound from the other two (as they are diastereomers).\n    *   The chiral column will also separate the two enantiomers, (4R,5R) and (4S,5S), from each other.\n*   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show a total of **3 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts:\n*   **Standard HPLC:** 2 peaks\n*   **Chiral HPLC:** 3 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
