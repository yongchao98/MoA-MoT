    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Total Number of Protons:**\n\nFirst, let's sum the integrations of all the signals to determine the total number of protons in the molecule.\n*   Signal 1: 1H\n*   Signal 2: 1H\n*   Signal 3: 3H\n*   Signal 4: 3H\n*   **Total Protons = 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8H**\n\nNow, let's determine the number of protons in each of the possible options:\n*   **Propenyl acetate:** The propenyl group is C3H5. The acetate group is CH3CO2. The formula is CH3CO2C3H5, which is C5H8O2. It has **8 protons**.\n*   **Butenyl acetate:** The butenyl group is C4H7. The acetate group is CH3CO2. The formula is CH3CO2C4H7, which is C6H10O2. It has **10 protons**.\n\nSince the NMR data shows a total of 8 protons, we can immediately eliminate the butenyl acetate options (Cis-butenyl acetate and Trans-butenyl acetate). The unknown compound must be either Cis-propenyl acetate or Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze Individual Signals and Assign them to the Propenyl Acetate Structure:**\n\nThe general structure of propenyl acetate is: CH3(a)-C(=O)-O-CH(b)=CH(c)-CH3(d)\n\nLet's assign each signal from the NMR data to the protons in this structure.\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (s - singlet):** This means the methyl group has no adjacent, non-equivalent protons to couple with.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (2.1 ppm):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a methyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon (an acetyl group).\n    *   **Assignment:** This signal corresponds to the acetyl methyl protons, **CH3(a)**.\n\n*   **1.6 ppm (3H, d):**\n    *   **Integration (3H):** Represents a methyl group.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d - doublet):** This means the methyl group is coupled to a single adjacent proton.\n    *   **Assignment:** This signal corresponds to the methyl group attached to the double bond, **CH3(d)**. It is split into a doublet by the adjacent vinylic proton, H(c).\n\n*   **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Represents a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (dq - doublet of quartets):** This proton is split into a doublet by one adjacent proton and into a quartet by three other adjacent protons.\n    *   **Assignment:** This signal corresponds to the vinylic proton **H(c)**. It is coupled to H(b) (giving the doublet) and to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group CH3(d) (giving the quartet).\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):**\n    *   **Integration (1H):** Represents a single proton.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d - doublet):** This proton is coupled to a single adjacent proton. The coupling constant (J) is 16.0 Hz.\n    *   **Chemical Shift (7.0 ppm):** This high chemical shift (deshielding) is typical for a vinylic proton attached to a carbon that is also bonded to an electronegative oxygen atom.\n    *   **Assignment:** This signal corresponds to the vinylic proton **H(b)**. It is coupled only to H(c).\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemistry (Cis vs. Trans):**\n\nThe final step is to distinguish between the cis and trans isomers. The key piece of information is the coupling constant (J value) between the two vinylic protons, H(b) and H(c).\n\n*   The signal for H(b) at 7.0 ppm shows a coupling constant of **J = 16.0 Hz**.\n*   The magnitude of the coupling constant between protons on a double bond is dependent on their geometric relationship:\n    *   **Trans-coupling (J_trans):** Typically large, in the range of **12-18 Hz**.\n    *   **Cis-coupling (J_cis):** Typically smaller, in the range of **6-12 Hz**.\n\nSince the observed coupling constant is 16.0 Hz, it falls squarely within the range for trans protons. Therefore, the protons H(b) and H(c) are in a **trans** configuration.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe compound has 8 protons, an acetyl group, and a propenyl group with a trans double bond. The unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
