    "The user wants to find the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state for a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential.\n\n### 1. Identify the Physical System and Energy Formula\n\nThe potential is given by $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2$. This is the potential for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator.\n\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system can be solved by separating the variables in Cartesian coordinates ($x, y, z$). The Hamiltonian becomes a sum of three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians:\n$H = H_x + H_y + H_z$\nwhere $H_i = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_i^2} + \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x_i^2$.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues of a 1D harmonic oscillator are given by $E_{n_i} = (n_i + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n_i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ are the quantum numbers for each dimension.\n\nThe total energy of the 3D system is the sum of the energies for each dimension:\n$E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega + (n_z + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n$E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$\n\nWe define a principal quantum number $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The energy levels are then given by the formula:\n$E_n = (n + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\n\n### 2. Determine the Energy of the Third Excited State\n\nThe energy levels are determined by the value of the principal quantum number $n$.\n*   **Ground State:** The lowest energy state corresponds to the smallest possible value of $n$. Since $n_x, n_y, n_z$ must be non-negative integers, the minimum value is $n = 0+0+0 = 0$.\n    $E_0 = (0 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **First Excited State:** This corresponds to the next integer value, $n=1$.\n    $E_1 = (1 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Second Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=2$.\n    $E_2 = (2 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{7}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n*   **Third Excited State:** This corresponds to $n=3$.\n    $E_3 = (3 + \\frac{3}{2})\\hbar\\omega = \\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nSo, the energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n\n### 3. Determine the Degeneracy of the Third Excited State\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level $E_n$ is the number of different combinations of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that result in the same value of $n$. For the third excited state, we need to find the number of ways we can choose non-negative integers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ such that their sum is 3:\n$n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$\n\nWe can list the possible combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$:\n1.  One quantum number is 3, and the others are 0.\n    *   (3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3) — This gives 3 states.\n2.  One quantum number is 2, one is 1, and one is 0.\n    *   (2, 1, 0) and all its distinct permutations: (2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2) — This gives $3! = 6$ states.\n3.  All three quantum numbers are 1.\n    *   (1, 1, 1) — This gives 1 state.\n\nThe total number of states (degeneracy) is the sum of these possibilities:\nDegeneracy = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\nAlternatively, the degeneracy $g_n$ for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator can be calculated using the formula:\n$g_n = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$\nFor the third excited state, $n=3$:\n$g_3 = \\frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe energy of the third excited state is $\\frac{9}{2}\\hbar\\omega$, and its degeneracy (the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) is 10. Comparing this result with the given options:\nA) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega , 10\nB) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3\nC) (9/2) \\hbar \\omega, 3\nD) 11 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
