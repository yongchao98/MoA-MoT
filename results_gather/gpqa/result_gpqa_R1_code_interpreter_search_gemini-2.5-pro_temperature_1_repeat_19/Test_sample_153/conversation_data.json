    "*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotope of each element.\n    *   There is a significant M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32%. The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which is very close to 3:1. This isotopic pattern is a definitive indicator of the presence of a single chlorine atom (due to its two major isotopes, ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl, which have a natural abundance ratio of about 3:1).\n    *   Conclusion from MS: The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:**\n    *   A very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. This frequency is within the typical range for a carboxylic acid carbonyl (~1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   Conclusion from IR: The molecule contains a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH).\n\n*   **Analysis of ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is almost always due to the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-CO**H**). It is a singlet ('s') because it does not couple with neighboring protons, and its integration ('1H') confirms it is a single proton.\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (typically 7-8.5 ppm). The pattern of two doublets ('d'), each integrating to two protons ('2H'), is a classic signature for a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry of the para substitution makes the two protons on one side of the ring chemically equivalent to the two protons on the other side, resulting in only two distinct signals for the four aromatic protons.\n\n*   **Putting it all together and evaluating the options:**\n    *   The evidence strongly points to a molecule that is a chlorobenzoic acid. The para-substitution pattern seen in the ¹H NMR specifically points to the chlorine and carboxylic acid groups being at positions 1 and 4 on the benzene ring.\n\nLet's check the proposed structure, **4-chlorobenzoic acid**, against the data:\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with a -COOH group and a -Cl atom in a para arrangement.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₇H₅ClO₂.\n*   **Molecular Weight:** (7×12.01) + (5×1.01) + (1×35.45) + (2×16.00) = 84.07 + 5.05 + 35.45 + 32.00 = 156.57 g/mol. This matches the m/z of 156 for the ³⁵Cl isotope and 158 for the ³⁷Cl isotope. **(Matches MS)**\n*   **Functional Groups:** Contains a carboxylic acid group. **(Matches IR)**\n*   **¹H NMR:** It has a carboxylic acid proton and a para-substituted ring, which would produce the exact signal pattern observed. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOH group would be further downfield (8.02 ppm) than the protons ortho to the -Cl group (7.72 ppm). **(Matches NMR)**\n\nLet's briefly dismiss the other options:\n*   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** Would give a complex pattern of four different signals in the aromatic region of the ¹H NMR, not two doublets.\n*   **C) Phenyl chloroformate:** Lacks the carboxylic acid O-H group, so it would not have the broad IR peak or the ¹H NMR signal at 11.0 ppm.\n*   **D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. The aldehyde proton would appear around 9-10 ppm, not 11.0 ppm. The aromatic region would also show three distinct proton signals, not the symmetrical pattern observed.\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly supports 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<A>>>"
