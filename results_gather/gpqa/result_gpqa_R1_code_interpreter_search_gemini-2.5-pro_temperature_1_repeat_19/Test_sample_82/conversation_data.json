    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the initial state and dilution.**\n    *   Initial volume of acetic acid (CH3COOH), V1 = 20.00 cm3 = 0.0200 L.\n    *   Initial concentration of acetic acid, M1 = 0.05 M.\n    *   Volume of water added = 20.00 cm3.\n    *   The final volume after dilution, V2 = 20.00 cm3 + 20.00 cm3 = 40.00 cm3 = 0.0400 L.\n    *   We use the dilution formula M1V1 = M2V2 to find the new concentration of acetic acid (M2).\n    *   (0.05 M) * (20.00 cm3) = M2 * (40.00 cm3)\n    *   M2 = (0.05 * 20.00) / 40.00 = 0.025 M.\n    *   So, we are titrating a 40.00 mL solution of 0.025 M acetic acid.\n    *   Initial moles of acetic acid = M2 * V2 = 0.025 mol/L * 0.0400 L = 0.001 mol.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH to form its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO-). This creates a buffer solution.\n    *   The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH -> CH3COO- + Na+ + H2O.\n    *   Moles of CH3COO- formed = 0.25 * (initial moles of CH3COOH) = 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol.\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH remaining = 0.75 * (initial moles of CH3COOH) = 0.75 * 0.001 = 0.00075 mol.\n    *   We use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[acid]).\n    *   First, calculate pKa: pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10^-5) ≈ 4.733.\n    *   Now, calculate the pH: pH = 4.733 + log(moles of CH3COO- / moles of CH3COOH)\n    *   pH = 4.733 + log(0.00025 / 0.00075) = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.733 - log(3) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.\n    *   So, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n    *   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO-).\n    *   First, find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.\n    *   Moles of NaOH = Moles of CH3COOH = 0.001 mol.\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 mL.\n    *   The total volume of the solution at the equivalence point is the initial volume of the diluted acid plus the volume of NaOH added: 40.00 mL + 10.00 mL = 50.00 mL = 0.0500 L.\n    *   The concentration of the acetate ion [CH3COO-] at the equivalence point is:\n    *   [CH3COO-] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M.\n    *   The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water, producing OH- ions, which makes the solution basic.\n    *   Reaction: CH3COO-(aq) + H2O(l) ⇌ CH3COOH(aq) + OH-(aq).\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb, for acetate. We can find it from Ka and Kw (the ion product of water, 1.0 x 10^-14 at 25 °C).\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10^-14) / (1.85 x 10^-5) ≈ 5.405 x 10^-10.\n    *   Now we set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis: Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO-].\n    *   Let x = [OH-] = [CH3COOH]. Then [CH3COO-] = 0.02 - x.\n    *   5.405 x 10^-10 = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x).\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can assume x is negligible compared to 0.02, so (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    *   5.405 x 10^-10 = x^2 / 0.02\n    *   x^2 = (5.405 x 10^-10) * 0.02 = 1.081 x 10^-11\n    *   x = [OH-] = √(1.081 x 10^-11) ≈ 3.288 x 10^-6 M.\n    *   Now, calculate the pOH: pOH = -log([OH-]) = -log(3.288 x 10^-6) ≈ 5.483.\n    *   Finally, calculate the pH: pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517.\n    *   So, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52.\n\n*   **Step 4: Compare the results with the given options.**\n    *   Calculated pH at 25% titration ≈ 4.26.\n    *   Calculated pH at the equivalence point ≈ 8.52.\n    *   These values match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
