    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify Compound X:\n\n**1. Analyze the Product from the NMR Data**\n\nFirst, let's deduce the structure of the reaction product from the provided 1H and 13C NMR spectra. The molecular formula of the starting material, Compound X, is C11H12O. Since the reaction is a rearrangement (as suggested by the conditions), the product will have the same molecular formula.\n\n*   **Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):** For C11H12O, the DoU = (2C + 2 + N - H - X)/2 = (2*11 + 2 - 12)/2 = 12/2 = 6. This indicates a high degree of unsaturation, likely involving a benzene ring (4 DoU) and other double bonds or rings.\n\n*   **13C NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 197.7 (1C, s):** This chemical shift is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O), specifically a ketone or aldehyde conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring.\n    *   **δ 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s):** These signals are in the aromatic/alkene region (110-160 ppm). The presence of two signals that each represent two carbons (126.9 and 129.1) strongly suggests a symmetrically substituted aromatic ring, most likely a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   **δ 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s):** These are quaternary carbons, likely the two substituted carbons of the para-disubstituted ring.\n    *   **δ 21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s):** These are aliphatic carbons, characteristic of methyl groups. The problem states they are singlets, but 13C multiplicities are not given from standard broadband decoupled spectra. The chemical shifts are consistent with methyl groups.\n\n*   **1H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   **δ 7.08 (2H, d) and δ 7.71 (2H, d):** This pattern confirms the para-disubstituted benzene ring. The two doublets, each integrating to 2H, form a characteristic AA'BB' system.\n    *   **δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s):** These are two distinct methyl groups, and they are singlets, meaning they have no adjacent protons.\n    *   **δ 6.75 (1H, d) and δ 7.68 (1H, d):** These are two vinylic protons on a double bond (-CH=CH-). They are coupled to each other, resulting in two doublets.\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    1.  We have a para-disubstituted benzene ring.\n    2.  We have two different methyl groups. One must be on the benzene ring to create the p-tolyl group (`CH3-C6H4-`), which corresponds to one of the methyl singlets (e.g., δ 2.31). The large chemical shift difference between the aromatic doublets (7.08 vs 7.71) indicates the ring is substituted with both an electron-donating group (the methyl) and an electron-withdrawing group.\n    3.  The electron-withdrawing group is the conjugated ketone system.\n    4.  The remaining fragments are the ketone C=O, the second methyl group (δ 2.28), and the -CH=CH- group.\n    5.  Let's assemble these pieces. There are two main possibilities for an α,β-unsaturated ketone structure:\n        *   `p-tolyl-C(=O)-CH=CH-CH3`: `1-(p-tolyl)but-2-en-1-one`. This would have a methyl doublet in the 1H NMR, not a singlet. So this is incorrect.\n        *   `p-tolyl-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3`: `4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one`. This structure fits all the 1H NMR data: a singlet for the `p-tolyl-CH3`, a singlet for the acetyl `C(=O)-CH3`, two doublets for the `-CH=CH-` protons, and two doublets for the para-substituted aromatic protons. This structure is also consistent with the 13C data and has the correct molecular formula C11H12O.\n\nSo, the product of the reaction is **4-(4-methylphenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction and Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\n*   **Reaction Conditions:** The reaction uses 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), a non-nucleophilic base, at a high temperature (403 K). This is characteristic of a base-catalyzed rearrangement of an epoxide.\n*   **Transformation:** We need to find the epoxide (Compound X) that rearranges into `4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one`. The transformation is an isomerization of an epoxide into a ketone.\n    `X (C11H12O epoxide)`  ---DABCO, 403K--->  `p-tolyl-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3`\n\n*   **Examine the Options:**\n    *   A) `2-methyl-3-styryloxirane`: `Ph-CH=CH-CH(O)CH-CH3`. This has a phenyl (`Ph`) group, not a p-tolyl group. It cannot be the precursor.\n    *   B) `2-styrylepoxide`: This name is ambiguous and the most likely structure has the wrong formula. It also has a phenyl group.\n    *   C) `2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane`: `Ph-CH=C(CH3)-CH(O)CH2`. This also has a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group.\n    *   D) `2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane`: The 4-methylstyryl group is `p-CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-`. The structure is `p-CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2`. This molecule has the required p-tolyl group and the correct molecular formula (C11H12O).\n\n**3. Confirm the Reaction Pathway**\n\nThe rearrangement of the terminal vinylic epoxide from option D to the identified product is a known chemical transformation.\n\n*   **Starting Material (D):** `p-tolyl-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2`\n*   **Product:** `p-tolyl-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3`\n\nThe `p-tolyl-CH=CH-` part of the molecule remains unchanged. The reaction is the isomerization of the `-[CH(O)CH2]` (terminal epoxide) fragment into the `-[C(=O)CH3]` (methyl ketone) fragment. This is a recognized base-catalyzed rearrangement pathway for terminal vinylic epoxides. The base (DABCO) facilitates the ring-opening and tautomerization to the more stable conjugated ketone.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of the product's NMR spectra and the chemical feasibility of the reaction, Compound X must be the only option that contains the necessary `p-tolyl` structural unit and can undergo a known rearrangement to form the product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
