    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **The Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the observer's frame of reference, which we consider to be stationary.\n    *   **The Glass Frame (S'):** This is the frame of reference of the moving glass. It is moving with a constant velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame (S).\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   **Velocity of the glass relative to the lab (v):** The problem states the glass is moving with velocity `v` in the same direction as the light beam. We will assign this a positive value, `v`.\n    *   **Velocity of light in the glass, relative to the glass (u'):** The index of refraction `n` is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (`c`) to the speed of light in the medium (`u'`). So, `n = c / u'`. The problem specifies that we should take the speed of light in a vacuum `c = 1`. Therefore, `n = 1 / u'`, which means the speed of light within the glass, as measured by an observer in the glass frame S', is `u' = 1/n`. Since the beam propagates in the same direction as the glass is moving, this velocity is also positive.\n    *   **Velocity of light in the glass, relative to the lab (u):** This is the speed of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory. This is the value we need to find.\n\n3.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    To find the velocity `u` in the lab frame (S), we must use the Einstein velocity addition formula, which correctly combines velocities in special relativity. The formula is:\n\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n    where:\n    *   `u` is the velocity of the object (the light beam) in frame S.\n    *   `u'` is the velocity of the object in frame S'.\n    *   `v` is the velocity of frame S' relative to frame S.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values:**\n    We substitute the values we identified in step 2 into the formula:\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    The formula becomes:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    Now, we simplify the algebraic expression:\n    `u = ( 1/n + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n\n    To eliminate the fractions in the numerator and denominator, we can find a common denominator for each part:\n    *   Numerator: `1/n + v = 1/n + vn/n = (1 + vn) / n`\n    *   Denominator: `1 + v/n = n/n + v/n = (n + v) / n`\n\n    Now substitute these back into the expression for `u`:\n    `u = ( (1 + vn) / n ) / ( (n + v) / n )`\n\n    The `n` in the denominator of both the numerator and the denominator cancels out:\n    `u = (1 + vn) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    Let's compare our final result with the multiple-choice options provided:\n    A) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    B) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n    C) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n    D) 1\n\n    Our calculated speed `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)` exactly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
