    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C10H14Br2) is heated with excess KOH at 240°C.\n*   **Product 1 Data:**\n    *   IR: 1720 cm⁻¹ (indicates a carbonyl group, likely a ketone).\n    *   ¹H NMR: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). Total protons = 14H.\n*   **Analysis:** The starting material has 14 protons, and so does the product. The reaction likely involves the substitution of the two bromine atoms with one oxygen atom, possibly with rearrangement, to form a ketone with the formula C10H14O. The reaction is `C10H14Br2 + 2KOH → C10H14O + 2KBr + H2O`.\n*   The molecular formula C10H14O corresponds to 4 degrees of unsaturation. Since adamantane is a tricyclic alkane (3 degrees of unsaturation), the product is a tricyclic ketone (3 rings + 1 C=O = 4 degrees of unsaturation). This means the cage skeleton, although possibly rearranged, is saturated.\n*   The NMR data with a signal at 4.79 ppm is highly unusual for a saturated ketone and may be erroneous or represent a very unusual strained structure. However, the overall reaction sequence is a known pathway in organic chemistry.\n*   The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes with a strong base is known to cause a cage rearrangement (a bishomofavorskii-like mechanism) to form **tricyclo[4.4.0.0³,⁸]decan-2-one**, also known as **2-twistbrendanone**. This structure is consistent with the formula C10H14O and the IR absorption for a ketone in a six-membered ring. We will proceed assuming this is Product 1, despite the strange reported NMR.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (2-twistbrendanone) is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide [Al(O-iPr)₃].\n*   **Analysis:** This reagent is typically used for the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction of ketones to alcohols. So, the ketone group in Product 1 is reduced to a hydroxyl group, forming tricyclo[4.4.0.0³,⁸]decan-2-ol.\n*   The subsequent step is ozonolysis, which cleaves C=C double bonds. This implies that Product 2 must be an alkene.\n*   The formation of an alkene can be explained by the dehydration of the alcohol formed from the MPV reduction. Heating an alcohol with a Lewis acid catalyst (like Al(O-iPr)₃) can cause elimination of water.\n*   The alcohol is tricyclo[4.4.0.0³,⁸]decan-2-ol. Elimination of water can occur towards C1 or C3. Elimination towards the bridgehead carbon C1 would violate Bredt's rule. Elimination towards C3 is possible.\n*   Therefore, **Product 2** is the alkene **tricyclo[4.4.0.0³,⁸]dec-2-ene** (also known as twistbrendene), with the formula C10H14.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3 and Analyze its NMR Spectrum**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (twistbrendene) is treated with ozone (O₃) at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a reductive ozonolysis, which cleaves the C=C double bond and converts the carbons of the double bond into carbonyl groups.\n*   Let's analyze the double bond in twistbrendene (tricyclo[4.4.0.0³,⁸]dec-2-ene). The double bond is between C2 and C3. C2 is bonded to one hydrogen (C2-H), while C3 is bonded to two other carbons (C4 and C8) and has no hydrogens. The double bond is trisubstituted: R₂C=CHR'.\n*   Cleavage of this double bond will yield a ketone at the C3 position and an aldehyde at the C2 position.\n*   The cleavage of the C2-C3 bond opens one of the rings in the tricyclic system, resulting in a bicyclic product. The product is **cis-8-formyl-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-2-one**. Its formula is C10H14O2.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Coupling Pattern of the Most Deshielded Hydrogen**\n\n*   **Product 3:** cis-8-formyl-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-2-one.\n*   **Identify the most deshielded proton:** In a molecule containing alkane, ketone, and aldehyde functional groups, the **aldehyde proton (-CHO)** is by far the most deshielded, with a typical chemical shift (δ) of 9-10 ppm. Other protons, like those alpha to the ketone or aldehyde, appear at much lower chemical shifts (2.5-4.0 ppm). The question specifies excluding protons that exchange with deuterated solvent (like OH), but the aldehyde C-H proton does not exchange.\n*   **Determine the coupling pattern of the aldehyde proton:**\n    1.  The aldehyde proton (H_ald) is attached to the aldehyde carbon. This carbon is attached to C8 of the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ring.\n    2.  The aldehyde proton will couple to the protons on the adjacent carbon, C8. C8 is bonded to C1, C7, and the aldehyde carbon, so it has only **one** proton (H8). This vicinal (3-bond) coupling (`³J`) should split the aldehyde proton's signal into a **doublet**.\n    3.  However, \"doublet\" is not among the options (A, B, C, D). This indicates that further, long-range couplings are significant and must be considered.\n    4.  In rigid cyclic systems like this, 4-bond couplings (`⁴J`) can be significant. The aldehyde proton can couple to protons four bonds away. Let's identify them:\n        *   H1 (path: H-C-O=C-C8-C1-H1)\n        *   The two protons on C7 (H7a and H7b) (path: H-C-O=C-C8-C7-H7)\n    5.  Therefore, the aldehyde proton is coupled to four protons in total: H8, H1, H7a, and H7b. Its signal would be a doublet of doublets of doublets of doublets (dddd), unless some coupling constants are zero or equivalent.\n    6.  The option **triplet of triplets (D)** implies that the proton is coupled to two sets of two equivalent protons. This can happen if there is accidental equivalence of coupling constants (a situation where different types of couplings have similar magnitudes).\n    7.  For the aldehyde proton signal to be a triplet of triplets, we could have the following scenario:\n        *   The coupling to H8 (`³J`) is coincidentally equal to the long-range coupling to H1 (`⁴J`). These two protons would act as an equivalent pair, splitting the signal into a **triplet**.\n        *   The two protons on C7 (H7a and H7b) are magnetically equivalent to each other and couple to the aldehyde proton with the same `⁴J` coupling constant. They would act as a second equivalent pair, splitting the signal further into another **triplet**.\n    8.  The resulting pattern would be a **triplet of triplets**. While this relies on coincidental equivalence, it is the most plausible way to reconcile the derived chemical structure with the given options for the most deshielded proton.\n\nFinal check: Other options like \"doublet of triplets\" (B) are also plausible for other protons in the molecule (e.g., H1), but the question specifically asks for the **most deshielded** proton, which is unequivocally the aldehyde proton. Therefore, we must deduce the aldehyde proton's coupling pattern.\n\n<<<D>>>"
