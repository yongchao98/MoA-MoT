    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the problem and identify the given information.**\n\n*   **Initial State (`|ψ⟩`):** The system is in a state given by the column matrix `[-1, 2, 1]`.\n*   **Operator P:** The observable P is represented by the matrix:\n    ```\n    P = | 0      1/√2     0   |\n        | 1/√2   0      1/√2 |\n        | 0      1/√2     0   |\n    ```\n*   **Operator Q:** The observable Q is represented by the matrix:\n    ```\n    Q = | 1   0   0 |\n        | 0   0   0 |\n        | 0   0  -1 |\n    ```\n*   **Measurement Sequence:**\n    1.  Measure observable P and get the result `0`.\n    2.  Immediately after, measure observable Q and get the result `-1`.\n*   **Goal:** Find the combined probability of this sequence of measurement outcomes.\n\n**2. Normalize the Initial State Vector**\n\nIn quantum mechanics, state vectors must be normalized to have a length of 1.\nThe initial state is `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]`.\nFirst, we calculate the square of its norm (length):\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\nThe normalization constant is `1/√6`.\nThe normalized state vector, `|ψ_norm⟩`, is:\n`|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]`\n\n**3. Measurement of P and State Collapse**\n\nWe first measure the observable P and get the outcome `0`. To find the probability of this, we need the eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue `0`.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector for P=0:**\n    We need to solve the equation `P|v⟩ = 0|v⟩`, where `|v⟩ = [x, y, z]` is the eigenvector.\n    ```\n    | 0      1/√2     0   | |x|   |0|\n    | 1/√2   0      1/√2 | |y| = |0|\n    | 0      1/√2     0   | |z|   |0|\n    ```\n    From the first and third rows, we get `(1/√2)y = 0`, which implies `y = 0`.\n    From the second row, we get `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0`, which implies `x + z = 0`, or `x = -z`.\n    So, the eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]`. We can choose `x=1` to get the unnormalized eigenvector `[1, 0, -1]`.\n    Now, we normalize this eigenvector: `√(1² + 0² + (-1)²) = √2`.\n    The normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue `0`, let's call it `|p_0⟩`, is:\n    `|p_0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring P=0:**\n    The probability is the square of the absolute value of the inner product of the state `|ψ_norm⟩` and the eigenvector `|p_0⟩`.\n    `Prob(P=0) = |⟨p_0|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n    `⟨p_0|ψ_norm⟩ = ( (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1] ) ⋅ ( (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1] )`\n    `= (1/√12) * [1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1]`\n    `= (1/√12) * (-1 - 1) = -2/√12 = -2/(2√3) = -1/√3`\n    `Prob(P=0) = (-1/√3)² = 1/3`\n\n*   **State Collapse:**\n    After measuring `P=0`, the state of the system collapses to the corresponding normalized eigenvector `|p_0⟩`. The new state of the system, `|ψ'⟩`, is:\n    `|ψ'⟩ = |p_0⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`\n\n**4. Measurement of Q**\n\nNow we measure the observable Q on the new state `|ψ'⟩` and want to find the probability of getting the outcome `-1`.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector for Q=-1:**\n    The operator Q is a diagonal matrix. Its eigenvalues are the diagonal entries: `1, 0, -1`.\n    The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `-1` can be found by inspection. It is the third basis vector, `[0, 0, 1]`.\n    This vector is already normalized. Let's call it `|q_-1⟩`.\n    `|q_-1⟩ = [0, 0, 1]`\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring Q=-1:**\n    We are now in the state `|ψ'⟩`. The probability of measuring `Q=-1` is the square of the absolute value of the inner product of the state `|ψ'⟩` and the eigenvector `|q_-1⟩`.\n    `Prob(Q=-1 | state is |ψ'⟩) = |⟨q_-1|ψ'⟩|²`\n    `⟨q_-1|ψ'⟩ = [0, 0, 1] ⋅ ( (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1] )`\n    `= (1/√2) * [0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1)]`\n    `= (1/√2) * (-1) = -1/√2`\n    `Prob(Q=-1 | state is |ψ'⟩) = (-1/√2)² = 1/2`\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Probability**\n\nThe total probability of the sequence of events (measuring `P=0` and then measuring `Q=-1`) is the product of the individual probabilities calculated in each step.\n\n`Total Probability = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 | state is |ψ'⟩)`\n`Total Probability = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\nTo verify the calculations, we can use a Python script.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial state vector\npsi = np.array([[-1], [2], [1]])\n\n# Normalize the initial state\nnorm_psi_sq = np.vdot(psi, psi)\npsi_norm = psi / np.sqrt(norm_psi_sq)\n\n# Eigenvector for P=0\n# From manual calculation, the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 0, -1]\np_0 = (1/np.sqrt(2)) * np.array([[1], [0], [-1]])\n\n# Probability of measuring P=0\nprob_p0 = np.abs(np.vdot(p_0, psi_norm))**2\n\n# After measurement, the new state is the eigenvector p_0\npsi_prime = p_0\n\n# Eigenvector for Q=-1\n# From inspection, the normalized eigenvector is [0, 0, 1]\nq_minus_1 = np.array([[0], [0], [1]])\n\n# Probability of measuring Q=-1 in the new state\nprob_q_minus_1_after_p0 = np.abs(np.vdot(q_minus_1, psi_prime))**2\n\n# Total probability\ntotal_prob = prob_p0 * prob_q_minus_1_after_p0\n\nprint(f\"The probability of getting P=0 is: {prob_p0}\")\nprint(f\"The probability of getting Q=-1 after P=0 is: {prob_q_minus_1_after_p0}\")\nprint(f\"The total probability is: {total_prob}\")\nprint(f\"As a fraction, the total probability is 1/6.\")\n```\n> The probability of getting P=0 is: 0.3333333333333333\n> The probability of getting Q=-1 after P=0 is: 0.5\n> The total probability is: 0.16666666666666666\n> As a fraction, the total probability is 1/6.\n\nThe result of the calculation is 1/6.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the probability of a sequence of two quantum measurements.
