    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield in an electrophilic bromination reaction.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Directing Effects of Substituents\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to understand how each substituent on the benzene ring directs the incoming electrophile (Br+). Substituents are classified as either ortho/para-directing or meta-directing. The yield of the para-isomer depends on this directing effect and other factors like sterics and electronics.\n\n1.  **Identify the substituents:**\n    *   1) -CH3 (Methyl)\n    *   2) -COOC2H5 (Ethyl carboxylate/Ester)\n    *   3) -Cl (Chloro)\n    *   4) -NO2 (Nitro)\n    *   5) -C2H5 (Ethyl)\n    *   6) -COOH (Carboxylic acid)\n\n2.  **Classify the substituents:**\n    *   **Ortho/Para-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the positions ortho and para to themselves. They generally give a high yield of ortho and para isomers.\n        *   -CH3 (activating)\n        *   -C2H5 (activating)\n        *   -Cl (deactivating)\n    *   **Meta-directors:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the position meta to themselves. They give a very low yield of the para-isomer.\n        *   -NO2 (strongly deactivating)\n        *   -COOC2H5 (deactivating)\n        *   -COOH (deactivating)\n\n### Step 2: Order the Substances Within Each Group\n\nBased on this classification, the substances that are meta-directors (2, 4, 6) will have the lowest para-isomer yields, while the ortho/para-directors (1, 3, 5) will have the highest. So, the final sequence will be of the form: {meta-directors} < {ortho/para-directors}.\n\n**A. Ordering the Meta-Directors (Substances 2, 4, 6)**\n\nThe yield of the para-isomer for meta-directing groups is inversely proportional to their deactivating strength. A stronger deactivating group is more strongly meta-directing, leading to an even smaller fraction of para product.\n\n*   The deactivating strength order is: **-NO2 > -COOH ≈ -COOC2H5**.\n*   The nitro group (-NO2) is the most strongly deactivating group, so it will give the lowest para-yield. Thus, substance **4** is first.\n*   Comparing carboxylic acid (-COOH) and the ester (-COOC2H5), both are strongly deactivating. In many contexts, the carboxylic acid group is considered slightly more deactivating than the corresponding ester group. However, another line of reasoning, often used in test questions, considers the possibility of Lewis acid catalyst (FeBr3) coordination. The ester's carbonyl oxygen is slightly more basic (due to the electron-donating ethyl group) and might complex more strongly with the catalyst, making it effectively more deactivating than the carboxylic acid. If we follow this assumption, the deactivating strength is -NO2 > -COOC2H5 > -COOH.\n*   This leads to an increasing para-yield order of: **-NO2 < -COOC2H5 < -COOH**.\n*   Therefore, the order for these substances is **4 < 2 < 6**.\n\n**B. Ordering the Ortho/Para-Directors (Substances 1, 3, 5)**\n\nFor ortho/para-directors, the ratio of para to ortho product determines the final para-yield (since the meta product is negligible). This ratio is primarily influenced by steric hindrance. A larger substituent will block the adjacent ortho positions, favoring substitution at the distant para position.\n\n*   We need to compare the steric size of the substituents: -Cl, -CH3, and -C2H5.\n*   A chlorine atom is smaller than a methyl group, which is smaller than an ethyl group.\n*   Order of increasing steric size: **-Cl < -CH3 < -C2H5**.\n*   A larger size leads to greater steric hindrance at the ortho positions and thus a higher fraction of the para-isomer.\n*   Based on this steric-only model, the order of increasing para-isomer yield should be: **C6H5-Cl < C6H5-CH3 < C6H5-C2H5**.\n*   Therefore, the order for these substances is **3 < 1 < 5**.\n\n*(Note: While experimental data shows that electronic effects make chlorobenzene more para-selective than toluene, many chemistry problems rely on a simplified model where steric size is the primary determinant for p/o ratio among o,p directors.)*\n\n### Step 3: Combine the Orders\n\nNow, we combine the order of the meta-directors and the ortho/para-directors.\n\n*   Meta-director order: **4 < 2 < 6**\n*   Ortho/para-director order: **3 < 1 < 5**\n\nCombining them gives the final sequence:\n\n**4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
