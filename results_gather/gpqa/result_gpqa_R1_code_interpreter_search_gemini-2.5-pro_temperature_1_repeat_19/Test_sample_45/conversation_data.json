    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactant and Reaction:**\n    *   The reactant is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Its structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃.\n    *   The carbon at position 3 is a chiral center.\n    *   The starting material is \"racemic,\" which means it's a 50:50 mixture of (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene.\n    *   The reaction is a self-metathesis catalyzed by Grubbs catalyst. Olefin metathesis involves the cutting and re-forming of carbon-carbon double bonds.\n\n2.  **Determine the Product Structure:**\n    *   In a self-metathesis of a terminal alkene of the form R-CH=CH₂, two molecules react. The =CH₂ fragments combine to form ethene (CH₂=CH₂), which the question asks to exclude. The two R-CH= fragments combine to form a new internal alkene, R-CH=CH-R.\n    *   For 3-methylpent-1-ene, the R group is the sec-butyl group: -CH(CH₃)CH₂CH₃.\n    *   The product formed by combining two of these fragments is:\n        (CH₃CH₂)(CH₃)CH-CH=CH-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)\n    *   The IUPAC name for this structure is **3,6-dimethyl-4-octene**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The product molecule, 3,6-dimethyl-4-octene, has two potential sources of stereoisomerism:\n        *   Two chiral centers at C3 and C6.\n        *   A C=C double bond at C4, which can have E (trans) or Z (cis) geometry.\n    *   Since the starting material is a racemic mixture of (R) and (S) enantiomers, three types of reaction pairings can occur:\n        a) (R)-alkene + (R)-alkene\n        b) (S)-alkene + (S)-alkene\n        c) (R)-alkene + (S)-alkene\n\n4.  **Enumerate the Stereoisomers from Each Pairing:**\n\n    *   **a) (R) + (R) coupling:** This reaction joins two (R)-sec-butyl fragments. The resulting product will have the (3R,6R) configuration. This can exist as two geometric isomers (diastereomers) around the C4=C5 double bond:\n        1.  (E)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene (chiral)\n        2.  (Z)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene (chiral)\n\n    *   **b) (S) + (S) coupling:** This reaction joins two (S)-sec-butyl fragments, resulting in the (3S,6S) configuration. This also gives two geometric isomers, which are the enantiomers of the (3R,6R) products:\n        3.  (E)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene (enantiomer of product 1)\n        4.  (Z)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene (enantiomer of product 2)\n        These are four distinct stereoisomers.\n\n    *   **c) (R) + (S) coupling:** This reaction joins one (R)-sec-butyl fragment and one (S)-sec-butyl fragment. The product has the (3R,6S) configuration. We need to analyze the stereochemistry of its E and Z isomers.\n        *   **(E)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene:** This molecule possesses a center of inversion (an improper rotation axis, S₂) at the midpoint of the C=C bond. A molecule with a center of inversion is achiral. Since it has chiral centers but is achiral overall, it is a **meso compound**. This is one distinct product.\n        5. (E)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene (meso)\n        *   **(Z)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry (a mirror plane, σ) that bisects the C=C bond perpendicularly. A molecule with a plane of symmetry is achiral. Therefore, this isomer is also a **meso compound**. This is another distinct product.\n        6. (Z)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene (meso)\n\n5.  **Count the Total Number of Possible Products:**\n    By summing up all the unique stereoisomers that can be formed from all possible reaction pairings, we get:\n    *   From (R)+(R) and (S)+(S) couplings: 2 pairs of enantiomers = 4 chiral products.\n    *   From (R)+(S) coupling: 2 meso products.\n\n    Total possible products = 4 + 2 = 6.\n\nThe six possible products are:\n1.  (E)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n2.  (E)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n3.  (Z)-(3R,6R)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n4.  (Z)-(3S,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene\n5.  (E)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene (meso)\n6.  (Z)-(3R,6S)-3,6-dimethyl-4-octene (meso)\n\nAll six are stereoisomers of 3,6-dimethyl-4-octene and are all possible products of the reaction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
