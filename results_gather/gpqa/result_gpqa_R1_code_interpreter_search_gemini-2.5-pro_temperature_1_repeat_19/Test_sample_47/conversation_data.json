    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the final product's structure.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclohexanone, a six-membered cyclic ketone.\n*   **Reagent:** Bromine (Br₂).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Alpha-halogenation of a ketone. In this reaction, a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an α-hydrogen) is replaced by a halogen atom.\n*   **Product 1:** The reaction yields 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n\n     \n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide**\n\n*   **Reactant:** 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base, with heating.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic example of the **Favorskii rearrangement**. When an α-halo ketone with at least one α'-hydrogen (a hydrogen on the other side of the carbonyl) is treated with a strong base, it undergoes a ring contraction (if cyclic) to form a carboxylic acid derivative.\n    1.  The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes the acidic α'-hydrogen (at C6) to form an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate performs an intramolecular nucleophilic attack on the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion and forming a strained bicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-one intermediate.\n    3.  The hydroxide ion then attacks the carbonyl carbon of this bicyclic intermediate.\n    4.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, and the strained cyclopropane ring opens to form a more stable carbanion on a five-membered ring.\n    5.  Upon workup (which is implicit in such problems), the resulting carboxylate salt is protonated to give a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 2:** The six-membered ring of cyclohexanone contracts to a five-membered ring, resulting in **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid**.\n\n     \n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n*   **Reagent:** Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride replaces the -OH group of the carboxylic acid with a -Cl atom. Pyridine is a base used to neutralize the HCl gas produced as a byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** **Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride**.\n\n     \n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Reduction of an acid chloride. LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the primary alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** **Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.\n\n     \n\n**Final Analysis: Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**. We need to determine how many unique hydrogen environments exist in this molecule. We can do this by analyzing its symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** A cyclopentane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached.\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (C=O and H), the C1 carbon to which it is attached, the H on C1, and bisects the C3-C4 bond.\n\nLet's label the protons to count the distinct sets:\n\n \n\n1.  **Hₐ (Aldehyde proton):** This single proton is part of the aldehyde functional group. Its chemical environment is unique. (1st type)\n2.  **Hₑ (Methine proton):** This is the proton on C1, the carbon attached to the aldehyde. It lies on the plane of symmetry, and its environment is unique. (2nd type)\n3.  **Protons on C2 and C5:** Due to the plane of symmetry, C2 is equivalent to C5. However, the two protons on C2 (Hբ and Hɢ) are not equivalent to each other. They are diastereotopic because C1 is a stereogenic center in relation to them. One is on the same side of the ring as the aldehyde group (cis-like), and the other is on the opposite side (trans-like). Thus, Hբ is equivalent to Hⱼ, and Hɢ is equivalent to Hₖ. This gives us two more distinct types of protons. (3rd and 4th types)\n4.  **Protons on C3 and C4:** Similarly, C3 is equivalent to C4 by symmetry. The two protons on C3 (Hₕ and Hᵢ) are also diastereotopic. Hₕ is equivalent to Hₘ, and Hᵢ is equivalent to Hₗ. This gives us the final two distinct types of protons. (5th and 6th types)\n\n**Tally of Distinct Hydrogen Types:**\n*   Type 1: Hₐ (1 proton)\n*   Type 2: Hₑ (1 proton)\n*   Type 3: {Hբ, Hⱼ} (2 protons)\n*   Type 4: {Hɢ, Hₖ} (2 protons)\n*   Type 5: {Hₕ, Hₘ} (2 protons)\n*   Type 6: {Hᵢ, Hₗ} (2 protons)\n\nIn total, there are **6** chemically distinct types of hydrogen atoms. This means the ¹H NMR spectrum of this compound would show 6 different signals.\n\n<<<D>>>"
