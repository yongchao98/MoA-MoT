    "This question asks for the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation for space-charge-limited current (SCLC) is valid. Let's break down the equation and the physical model it represents.\n\nThe Mott-Gurney equation is:\n$ J = \\frac{9}{8} \\epsilon \\mu \\frac{V^2}{L^3}$\n\nThis equation describes the current density (J) as a function of voltage (V) in a specific regime. To understand its validity, we need to examine the assumptions made in its derivation.\n\n1.  **Space-Charge-Limited Current (SCLC):** The fundamental concept is that the current is not limited by the material's intrinsic conductivity but by the cloud of charge (space charge) injected from an electrode. This requires an injecting contact that can supply more carriers than the bulk material can transport away for a given voltage.\n\n2.  **Carrier Injection:** For a large number of carriers to be injected and form a space charge, the contact must be \"Ohmic\" or, more precisely, have a negligible energy barrier for charge injection. A Schottky contact, which is rectifying, has a significant energy barrier and would limit the current by injection itself, not by space charge in the bulk. Therefore, an Ohmic or non-blocking contact is a necessary condition.\n\n3.  **Carrier Transport:**\n    *   The equation includes a single mobility term ($\\mu$), which implies it models the transport of only **one type of charge carrier** (either electrons or holes). If both were present and mobile (a two-carrier device), recombination would occur, and the physics would be different.\n    *   The derivation of the Mott-Gurney law starts from the drift current equation ($J = nq\\mu E$) and Poisson's equation. It explicitly **neglects the diffusion current** ($J_{diff} \\propto d n/dx$). This is a valid approximation when the applied voltage is high enough that the drift of carriers in the electric field dominates their random thermal motion (diffusion).\n\n4.  **Material Properties:** The simplest form of the Mott-Gurney law assumes an ideal insulator or semiconductor with **no trap states** within its bandgap. If traps were present, some of the injected carriers would be immobilized in these trap states, reducing the mobile charge and altering the J-V relationship (often leading to a steeper dependence, $J \\propto V^{m}$ where m > 2).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options based on these four key assumptions:\n1.  Ohmic contact (no injection barrier).\n2.  Single-carrier device.\n3.  Negligible diffusion current (drift-dominated).\n4.  Trap-free material.\n\n*   **A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.**\n    This is incorrect. The current in the SCLC regime *is* a drift current. It is the diffusion current that is considered negligible.\n\n*   **B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n    This is incorrect. A Schottky contact limits injection and is the opposite of the Ohmic (injecting) contact required for SCLC.\n\n*   **C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.**\n    This statement correctly combines all the necessary assumptions:\n    *   \"trap-free\": Correct.\n    *   \"single-carrier device\": Correct.\n    *   \"no carrier injection barrier\": This is equivalent to an ideal Ohmic contact. Correct.\n    *   \"negligible diffusion current\": Correct.\n\n*   **D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n    This is incorrect. The equation is derived for a single-carrier device.\n\nTherefore, option C accurately describes the conditions for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
