    "This question asks to identify the set of assumptions that collectively define the \"impulse approximation\" in nuclear physics. Let's break down the meaning of the impulse approximation and then evaluate each of the four statements.\n\nThe **impulse approximation** is a theoretical simplification used to describe high-energy scattering from a bound system, like a nucleus. The core idea is that the interaction between a projectile (e.g., an electron, a neutrino) and a target particle within the bound system (a nucleon) happens so quickly and involves such a large transfer of momentum that the target particle can be treated as if it were free during the brief moment of interaction. The effects of binding forces and interactions with other constituent particles are considered negligible *during* the collision itself.\n\nNow let's analyze the given assumptions:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.**\n    This is a foundational assumption. It posits that the probe interacts with a single nucleon, not with multiple nucleons simultaneously (which would be a \"two-body current\" or \"meson-exchange current\") or with the nucleus as a whole. This is essential to be able to talk about a \"selected nucleon\" at all. This is often called the \"single-nucleon current approximation.\" This assumption is a key part of the impulse approximation framework.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.**\n    This assumption addresses what happens before and after the primary interaction. It means that the incoming probe and the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the ejected nucleon) do not interact with the other \"spectator\" nucleons in the nucleus. These secondary interactions are known as \"final-state interactions\" (FSI). Assuming the nucleus is transparent is equivalent to neglecting FSI. This is a common and crucial part of the simplest form of the impulse approximation, often called the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA).\n\n3.  **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.**\n    This assumption deals with the internal structure of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation is concerned with the behavior of the *nucleon* as a constituent of the *nucleus*. It treats the nucleon as the fundamental entity being struck. Whether that nucleon is internally described by a relativistic or non-relativistic model of quarks is a separate, and deeper, level of theory. The impulse approximation can be used regardless of the specific model chosen for the nucleon's internal structure. Therefore, this is not a defining assumption of the impulse approximation itself.\n\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.**\n    This is the heart of the \"impulse\" concept. The name \"impulse\" comes from classical mechanics (Impulse = Force Ã— time). If the interaction time is extremely short, the impulse due to the binding forces is negligible compared to the impulse from the collision. In other words, the interaction happens so fast that the nucleon doesn't have time to interact with its neighbors or feel the nuclear potential. It is knocked out of the nucleus as if it were a free, stationary particle (with some initial momentum). This is a central tenet of the approximation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nTo construct the impulse approximation, we need to:\n- Isolate the interaction to a single nucleon (Assumption 1).\n- Assume the interaction is instantaneous, so binding forces are irrelevant *during* the collision (Assumption 4).\n- Often, in its simplest form (PWIA), one also assumes the particles are not affected by the rest of the nucleus on their way in or out (Assumption 2).\n\nTherefore, the assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
