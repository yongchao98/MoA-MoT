    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct chemical formula:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Fragments\n\nFirst, let's break down the information provided by the FTIR and 1H NMR spectra to identify the key structural components of the molecule.\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates the presence of a benzene ring with two substituents. The core of this fragment is `C6H4`. The four protons on this ring will appear in the aromatic region of the 1H NMR spectrum. The presence of two distinct signals for these protons is common for para- or meta-substituted rings.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a `-COO-` functional group.\n*   **1H NMR Signal Analysis:**\n    *   **Vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a very specific splitting pattern. A vinyl proton that is a doublet of quartets is coupled to another vinyl proton (giving the doublet) and a methyl group (giving the quartet). This strongly suggests a propenyl group, `-CH=CH-CH3`.\n        *   The proton adjacent to the `-CH3` group is split by the other vinyl proton and the three methyl protons, resulting in a doublet of quartets.\n        *   The other vinyl proton is split only by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet.\n    *   **Two -CH3 signals:** One of these methyl groups is part of the propenyl (`-CH=CH-CH3`) fragment we just identified. The second `-CH3` signal must come from another methyl group elsewhere in the molecule, likely part of the ester (e.g., a methyl ester, `-COOCH3`) or attached to the aromatic ring.\n    *   **No -CH2 groups:** This is a crucial constraint that eliminates many possibilities.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)\n\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (also called the index of hydrogen deficiency) tells us the total number of rings and pi bonds in the molecule. Let's calculate the DBE from the identified fragments:\n\n*   Aromatic ring: 1 ring + 3 double bonds = 4 DBE\n*   Ester group (C=O): 1 double bond = 1 DBE\n*   Vinyl group (C=C): 1 double bond = 1 DBE\n*   **Total required DBE = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6**\n\nNow, let's calculate the DBE for each of the proposed chemical formulas using the formula: `DBE = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C11H14O2:** DBE = 11 + 1 - (14/2) = 12 - 7 = 5. This is inconsistent with the required DBE of 6.\n*   **B) C12H12O2:** DBE = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7. This is inconsistent with the required DBE of 6.\n*   **C) C12H14O2:** DBE = 12 + 1 - (14/2) = 13 - 7 = 6. This is consistent with the required DBE of 6.\n*   **D) C11H12O2:** DBE = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6. This is consistent with the required DBE of 6.\n\nThis analysis eliminates options A and B, leaving C and D as possibilities.\n\n### 3. Assemble the Fragments and Apply Constraints\n\nNow we must decide between `C12H14O2` and `C11H12O2`. Let's assemble the fragments we identified in step 1 and count the atoms.\n\n*   Aromatic ring fragment: `C6H4`\n*   Ester fragment: `CO2`\n*   Propenyl fragment: `C3H5` (from `-CH=CH-CH3`)\n*   Second methyl fragment: `CH3`\n\nSumming the atoms from these fragments gives:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 11\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2\n\nThe formula derived from assembling all the required pieces is **`C11H12O2`**. This matches option D.\n\nLet's check why `C12H14O2` (Option C) is incorrect, even though its DBE is correct.\n*   The formula `C12H14O2` contains one extra carbon and two extra hydrogens (`CH2`) compared to the `C11H12O2` formula we derived.\n*   To incorporate a `CH2` unit into any of the plausible structures for `C11H12O2` (like methyl p-propenylbenzoate, `CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-COOCH3`), one would have to do something like:\n    *   Change a methyl group to an ethyl group (e.g., `-COOCH3` -> `-COOCH2CH3`).\n    *   Insert a methylene bridge (e.g., `-C6H4-` -> `-CH2-C6H4-`).\n*   In all such cases, a `-CH2-` group is introduced into the molecule.\n*   The 1H NMR data explicitly states there are **no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups**.\n*   Therefore, the formula `C12H14O2` is inconsistent with the NMR data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly the formula `C11H12O2` is fully consistent with all the information provided: the presence of a di-substituted aromatic ring, an ester group, a propenyl group, a second methyl group, a total of six NMR signals, and the absence of any `-CH2-` groups.\n\n<<<D>>>"
