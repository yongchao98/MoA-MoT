    "This problem involves mixing a weak acid (CH3COOH), a strong acid (HCl), and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). The final pH is determined by the substance that is in excess after all neutralization reactions have occurred.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of each species.**\nWe use the formula: Moles = Molarity (mol/L) × Volume (L).\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Moles = 0.1 M × 0.500 L = 0.05 moles\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely: HCl -> H+ + Cl-\n    *   Moles of H+ = 0.2 M × 0.400 L = 0.08 moles\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely: Ba(OH)2 -> Ba2+ + 2OH-\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 M × 0.300 L = 0.09 moles\n    *   Moles of OH- = 2 × 0.09 moles = 0.18 moles\n\n**Step 2: Perform the neutralization reactions.**\nThe strong base (OH-) will react with the acids. It's standard to assume the strong acid (H+ from HCl) is neutralized first, followed by the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Acid - Strong Base Neutralization**\n    *   The reaction is: H+ + OH- -> H2O\n    *   Initial moles of H+ = 0.08 moles\n    *   Initial moles of OH- = 0.18 moles\n    *   The H+ is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.18 moles - 0.08 moles = 0.10 moles\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Weak Acid - Remaining Strong Base Neutralization**\n    *   The remaining strong base (OH-) will now react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n    *   The reaction is: CH3COOH + OH- -> CH3COO- + H2O\n    *   Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.05 moles\n    *   Moles of OH- available = 0.10 moles\n    *   The CH3COOH is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n    *   Moles of OH- consumed = 0.05 moles\n    *   Moles of excess OH- remaining = 0.10 moles - 0.05 moles = 0.05 moles\n\nAfter all reactions, the solution contains 0.05 moles of excess OH- ions.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the final concentration of OH- and the pH.**\nThe pH of the solution will be determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH-).\n\n*   **Total Volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Final concentration of OH-:**\n    *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.05 moles / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log10([OH-])\n    *   pOH = -log10(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<B>>>"
