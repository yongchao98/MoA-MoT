    "*   **Analyze the NMR Data:** The key piece of information from the Â¹H NMR is that a single proton (an alpha-proton) gives rise to two distinct peaks. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their combined integral is 1H. This indicates that the proton exists in two different chemical environments and that the two species containing this proton are present in roughly a 1:1 ratio. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, the presence of two distinct molecular species is the most logical conclusion.\n\n*   **Analyze the LC-MS Data:** The LC-MS analysis confirms the presence of two distinct species, as they separate into two peaks on the liquid chromatography column. The mass spectrometry data shows that both peaks have the same mass, and this mass corresponds to the expected product. This tells us two critical things:\n    1.  The two species are not impurities like precursors or side-products with different molecular formulas (ruling out option B and A).\n    2.  The two species are isomers of each other (same molecular formula, different structure).\n\n*   **Evaluate the Isomer Possibilities:** Now we must decide what kind of isomers they are. The main possibilities for a chiral molecule like a peptide are enantiomers and diastereoisomers.\n    *   **Enantiomers (Option C):** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard, achiral environment (like a typical NMR solvent or a standard LC column), enantiomers are indistinguishable. They have identical physical and chemical properties, including identical NMR spectra and identical retention times on an achiral LC column. Therefore, a mixture of enantiomers would show only one set of peaks in the NMR and one peak in the LC. This contradicts the experimental observations.\n    *   **Diastereoisomers (Option D):** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. This occurs in molecules with two or more chiral centers when the configuration differs at some, but not all, of those centers. Unlike enantiomers, diastereoisomers have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **NMR:** Because they are chemically distinct, diastereoisomers will have different NMR spectra. It is expected that corresponding protons in a pair of diastereoisomers will have different chemical shifts. This perfectly explains why the alpha-proton shows two separate peaks.\n        *   **LC:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereoisomers can be separated using standard (achiral) liquid chromatography. This perfectly explains the two peaks observed in the LC run.\n        *   **Formation:** In peptide synthesis, it is a known problem that the chiral center of an amino acid (the alpha-carbon) can undergo epimerization (inversion of stereochemistry) during the coupling reaction, especially under harsh conditions. If the peptide has other chiral centers, this epimerization creates a diastereomer of the intended product. For example, if synthesizing L-Ala-L-Val, epimerization of the valine during coupling would yield a mixture of L-Ala-L-Val and L-Ala-D-Val. These two molecules are diastereoisomers.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of two separable isomers with the same mass, which are also distinguishable by NMR, is the classic signature of a diastereomeric mixture. This is a common outcome in chemical peptide synthesis due to epimerization.\n\n<<<D>>>"
