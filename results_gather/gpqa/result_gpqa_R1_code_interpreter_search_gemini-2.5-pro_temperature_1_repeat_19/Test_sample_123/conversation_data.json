    "This problem involves the concept of time dilation from special relativity and the statistical nature of particle decay.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the core physics principles:**\n    *   **Particle Decay:** Unstable particles decay exponentially. The fraction `N/N₀` of particles remaining after a time `t` in their own rest frame is given by `N/N₀ = exp(-t/τ)`, where `τ` is the mean proper lifetime of the particle.\n    *   **Time Dilation:** A moving clock runs slower than a stationary one. The time `t_lab` measured in the lab frame (the detector) is related to the time `t_proper` experienced by the particle (its proper time) by the formula `t_lab = γ * t_proper`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n2.  **Formulate the equation for particle survival:**\n    *   The particles are created at the center of a spherical detector of radius `d = 30 m`.\n    *   They travel at ultra-relativistic velocities, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`.\n    *   The time it takes for a particle to reach the detector wall, as measured in the lab frame, is `t_lab = d / v ≈ d / c`.\n    *   The time elapsed in the particle's own rest frame during this journey is `t_proper = t_lab / γ = d / (c * γ)`.\n    *   The fraction `F` of particles that survive to reach the detector wall is the probability of a particle not decaying within the time `t_proper`.\n    *   Substituting `t_proper` into the decay equation gives:\n        `F = exp(-t_proper / τ) = exp(-d / (c * γ * τ))`\n\n3.  **Use the initial condition to find a constant value:**\n    *   The problem states that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, the fraction of surviving particles is `F₁ = 1/3`. The radius is `d = 30 m`.\n    *   Let's plug these values into our survival equation:\n        `1/3 = exp(-30 / (c * 20 * τ))`\n    *   The term `c * τ` is the mean decay length of the particle in its rest frame, multiplied by `c`. This is a constant for this specific type of particle. Let's solve for the entire constant term `30 / (c * τ)`.\n        `ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * c * τ)`\n        `-ln(3) = -30 / (20 * c * τ)`\n        `ln(3) = 30 / (20 * c * τ)`\n        `ln(3) = 1.5 / (c * τ)`\n    *   Therefore, the constant `30 / (c * τ) = 30 * (ln(3) / 1.5) = 20 * ln(3)`.\n\n4.  **Use the target condition to solve for the new Lorentz factor:**\n    *   The goal is to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, required for `F₂ = 2/3` of the particles to reach the detector.\n    *   Using the survival equation again with the new values:\n        `2/3 = exp(-30 / (c * γ₂ * τ))`\n    *   We can rewrite this as:\n        `2/3 = exp(-(1/γ₂) * (30 / (c * τ)))`\n    *   Now, substitute the value of the constant term `30 / (c * τ)` we found in the previous step:\n        `2/3 = exp(-(1/γ₂) * (20 * ln(3)))`\n    *   To solve for `γ₂`, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(2/3) = - (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n        `-ln(3/2) = - (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n        `ln(1.5) = (20 * ln(3)) / γ₂`\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for `γ₂`:\n        `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(1.5)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the final numerical value:**\n    *   Now, we compute the value of `γ₂`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value for gamma_2 based on the derived formula\n# gamma_2 = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(1.5)\nln_3 = math.log(3)\nln_1_5 = math.log(1.5)\ngamma_2 = (20 * ln_3) / ln_1_5\n\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n<execute_output>\n54.18511798835122\n</execute_output>\n\nThe calculation shows that the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19.

    "The problem relates the survival probability of a decaying particle to its Lorentz factor (`γ`) through the principle of time dilation.\n\n**1. The Physics of Particle Decay and Time Dilation**\n\n*   The fraction of particles, `F`, that survive after a time `t` in their own reference frame (proper time, `t_proper`) is given by the exponential decay law:\n    `F = exp(-t_proper / τ)`\n    where `τ` is the mean proper lifetime of the particle.\n\n*   From the perspective of the lab (the detector), the time it takes for a particle to travel a distance `d` (the radius of the detector) is `t_lab = d / v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`. So, `t_lab ≈ d / c`.\n\n*   Special relativity states that time for a moving particle is dilated (slowed down) by a factor of `γ` relative to a stationary observer. The relationship is:\n    `t_lab = γ * t_proper`\n    Therefore, the proper time experienced by the particle is `t_proper = t_lab / γ = d / (c * γ)`.\n\n*   Substituting this expression for `t_proper` into the decay equation gives the fraction of particles reaching the detector wall:\n    `F = exp(-d / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n**2. Using the Initial Conditions**\n\nWe are given the following initial conditions:\n*   Detector radius, `d = 30` m\n*   Initial Lorentz factor, `γ₁ = 20`\n*   Fraction of surviving particles, `F₁ = 1/3`\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n`1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * c * τ))`\n\nLet's isolate the constant term `d / (c * τ)` which is characteristic of the particle and the detector setup. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n`ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * c * τ)`\n`-ln(3) = -1.5 / (c * τ)`\n`ln(3) = 1.5 / (c * τ)`\n\nThis gives us a value for the term `1 / (c * τ)`:\n`1 / (c * τ) = ln(3) / 1.5`\n\n**3. Solving for the New Lorentz Factor**\n\nNow, we need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, that results in a survival fraction of `F₂ = 2/3`.\nUsing the same survival equation:\n`2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * c * τ))`\n\nWe can rewrite the exponent as `-30 * (1 / (c * τ)) * (1 / γ₂)`. Now substitute the value for `1 / (c * τ)` we found earlier:\n`2/3 = exp(-30 * (ln(3) / 1.5) * (1 / γ₂))`\n`2/3 = exp(-20 * ln(3) / γ₂)`\n\nTo solve for `γ₂`, take the natural logarithm of both sides again:\n`ln(2/3) = -20 * ln(3) / γ₂`\n`-ln(3/2) = -20 * ln(3) / γ₂`\n`ln(1.5) = 20 * ln(3) / γ₂`\n\nFinally, rearrange to solve for `γ₂`:\n`γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(1.5)`\n\n**4. Calculation**\n\nUsing the known values for the natural logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):\n`γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055`\n`γ₂ ≈ 54.19`\n\nThis calculated value is extremely close to 54.\n\n<<<C>>>"
