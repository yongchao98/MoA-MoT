    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the Information from the 1H NMR Spectrum**\n\nThe problem provides the following data for a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the formula C10H14:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two singlets with an integral ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three singlets with an integral ratio of 2:1:1.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n\n**2. Analyze the Candidate Compounds**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four possible compounds based on their structure and symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical. It has two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n    *   **Summary:** Aromatic: 1s (2H); Aliphatic: 1s (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The four methyl groups are all in unique chemical environments. This would ideally give four separate singlets. However, due to similar environments, some signals may overlap. A common pattern observed is three signals: one for the two most similar methyls (e.g., at C1 and C3) and two separate signals for the others, resulting in signals with a 6H:3H:3H ratio (which is 2:1:1). For our analysis, we will note it produces more than 2 aliphatic signals.\n    *   **Summary:** Aromatic: 2s (1H, 1H); Aliphatic: 3 or 4 singlets.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H2(CH3)4 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** It has a plane of symmetry bisecting the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent due to the symmetry plane. They will produce **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The symmetry makes the methyl groups at C1 and C4 equivalent, and the methyl groups at C2 and C3 equivalent. This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n    *   **Summary:** Aromatic: 1s (2H); Aliphatic: 2s (6H, 6H).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Formula:** C6H4(C2H5)2 = C10H14. (Matches)\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are all equivalent, giving **one singlet** for **4H**.\n    *   **Aliphatic Protons:** The protons of the ethyl groups will show splitting. We would expect a quartet (for the -CH2-) and a triplet (for the -CH3-), not singlets.\n    *   **Summary:** This compound can be ruled out because its aliphatic signals are not singlets.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test which 1:1 mixture of the remaining compounds (Durene, Isodurene, Prehnitene) matches the given spectrum.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region Requirement:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. Since it's a 1:1 mixture of compounds, this means each compound must contribute an equal number of protons to a signal. The simplest way this occurs is if each compound produces one singlet corresponding to 2H.\n    *   Durene: Yes (1 singlet, 2H).\n    *   Prehnitene: Yes (1 singlet, 2H).\n    *   Isodurene: No (2 singlets, 1H each).\n    *   This strongly suggests the mixture must be Durene and Prehnitene.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Region Requirement:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. The total number of aliphatic protons in the 1:1 mixture is 12 (from the first compound) + 12 (from the second compound) = 24H. A 2:1:1 ratio for 24 protons means the integrals of the signals are:\n    *   Signal 1: (2/4) * 24H = 12H\n    *   Signal 2: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    *   Signal 3: (1/4) * 24H = 6H\n    We need a mixture that produces singlets integrating to 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n\nLet's check our proposed mixture: **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**.\n\n*   **Combined Aromatic Spectrum:**\n    *   Durene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   Prehnitene contributes one 2H singlet.\n    *   If these two singlets have different chemical shifts, the mixture will show **two singlets with a 1:1 integral ratio**. This is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Combined Aliphatic Spectrum:**\n    *   Durene contributes one singlet integrating to **12H**.\n    *   Prehnitene contributes two singlets, each integrating to **6H**.\n    *   Assuming these three signals do not overlap, the mixture will show three singlets with integrals of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is **2:1:1**. This is also a perfect match.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that perfectly accounts for all features of the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
