    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n### **1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. The position (1700-1725 cm⁻¹) is characteristic of a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information is consistent with all possibilities.\n\n### **2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe key to distinguishing between the options lies in the complex splitting patterns observed in the proton NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **No vinyl-hydrogens:** This confirms the absence of protons attached to C=C double bonds. All four given structures are saturated, so this information helps eliminate any potential unsaturated isomers but doesn't differentiate between the choices.\n*   **Signal 1: Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This complex splitting pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **doublet (d)**.\n    *   Two neighboring protons (n=2), which split the signal into a **triplet (t)**.\n    *   Three neighboring protons (n=3), which split the signal into a **quartet (q)**.\n*   **Signal 2: Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern arises when a proton is coupled to three different, non-equivalent sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   One neighboring proton (n=1), which splits the signal into a **doublet (d)**.\n    *   Two neighboring protons (n=2), which split the signal into a **triplet (t)**.\n    *   Another set of two neighboring protons (n=2), which splits the signal into another **triplet (t)**.\n\n### **3. Evaluate Each Candidate Structure**\n\nWe need to find a structure that has one proton environment matching the `dtq` pattern and another proton environment matching the `dtt` pattern. The groups in parentheses are branches on the preceding carbon atom.\n\n**A) CH₃CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n```\n      CH₃(e)  CH₃(c)\n       |       |\nCH₃(d)-CH(b) - CH(a) - CH₂(f) - COOH\n```\n*   **Proton H(a):** Coupled to `H(b)` (1H, doublet), `CH₃(c)` (3H, quartet), and `CH₂(f)` (2H, triplet). This gives a **`dqt`** (or `dtq`, the order depends on coupling constants). This signal is present.\n*   **Proton H(b):** Coupled to `H(a)` (1H, doublet), `CH₃(d)` (3H, quartet), and `CH₃(e)` (3H, quartet). This gives a doublet of two different quartets (`dqq`), not a `dtt`.\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure A is incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃CH₂CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)COOH (2,3-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n```\n           Et(d)   Et(c)\n            |       |\nCH₃(f)-CH₂(e)-CH(b) - CH(a) - COOH\n```\n*   **Proton H(a):** Coupled to `H(b)` (1H, doublet) and the `CH₂` of ethyl group `c` (2H, triplet). This gives a doublet of triplets (`dt`).\n*   **Proton H(b):** Coupled to `H(a)` (1H, doublet), `CH₂(e)` (2H, triplet), and the `CH₂` of ethyl group `d` (2H, triplet). This gives a **`dtt`**. This signal is present.\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure B has a `dtt` but lacks a `dtq`. It is incorrect.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)COOH (2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n```\n           CH₃(d)  CH₃(c)\n            |       |\nCH₃(f)-CH₂(e)-CH(b) - CH(a) - COOH\n```\n*   **Proton H(a):** Coupled to `H(b)` (1H, doublet) and `CH₃(c)` (3H, quartet). This gives a doublet of quartets (`dq`).\n*   **Proton H(b):** Coupled to `H(a)` (1H, doublet), `CH₂(e)` (2H, triplet), and `CH₃(d)` (3H, quartet). This gives a **`dtq`**. This signal is present.\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure C has a `dtq` but lacks a `dtt`. It is incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH (3,4-diethylpentanoic acid)**\n```\n      C₂H₅(d) C₂H₅(c)\n       |       |\nCH₃(e)-CH(b) - CH(a) - CH₂(f) - COOH\n```\nLet's analyze the protons on the main chain, `H(a)` and `H(b)`.\n*   **Proton H(a) (on carbon 3):** This proton is coupled to three distinct neighbors:\n    *   `H(b)` on carbon 4 (1H) → **doublet (d)**\n    *   `CH₂(f)` on carbon 2 (2H) → **triplet (t)**\n    *   `CH₂` of the ethyl group `c` on carbon 3 (2H) → **triplet (t)**\n    This combination gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n\n*   **Proton H(b) (on carbon 4):** This proton is also coupled to three distinct neighbors:\n    *   `H(a)` on carbon 3 (1H) → **doublet (d)**\n    *   `CH₂` of the ethyl group `d` on carbon 4 (2H) → **triplet (t)**\n    *   `CH₃(e)` on carbon 5 (3H) → **quartet (q)**\n    This combination gives a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the second observed signal.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Structure D is the only one that can produce both a `dtq` and a `dtt` signal in its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### **Final Identification**\n\nThe FTIR and ¹H NMR data are fully consistent with the structure of 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid, which is represented by the formula `CH₃CH(C₂H₅)CH(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
