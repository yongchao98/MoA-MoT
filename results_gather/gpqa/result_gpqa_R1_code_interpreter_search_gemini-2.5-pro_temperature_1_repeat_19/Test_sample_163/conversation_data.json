    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### **1. Understand the Physics of Binary Stars**\n\nThe problem involves two double-lined spectroscopic binary systems that are also eclipsing. We need to find the ratio of their total masses.\n\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** The fundamental relationship governing orbits is Kepler's Third Law, which relates the total mass of a system (M_total = m1 + m2) to its orbital period (P) and the semi-major axis of the relative orbit (a):\n    $M_1 + M_2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 a^3}{G P^2}$\n    where G is the gravitational constant.\n\n*   **Spectroscopic Binaries:** For spectroscopic binaries, we don't directly measure the semi-major axis 'a'. Instead, we measure the radial velocities of the stars. The amplitudes of these sinusoidal variations are K1 and K2.\n\n*   **Connecting Radial Velocity and Semi-Major Axis:** The radial velocity (vr) is the projection of the orbital velocity (v) along our line of sight. The angle between the orbital plane normal and the line of sight is the inclination 'i'. The observed amplitude K is related to the orbital speed v by K = v * sin(i).\n    The semi-major axis of the relative orbit, 'a', can be expressed in terms of the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes (K1 + K2) and the period (P):\n    $a = \\frac{P(K_1 + K_2)}{2\\pi \\sin(i)}$\n\n*   **The Mass Function:** By substituting the expression for 'a' into Kepler's Third Law, we get the mass function for a double-lined spectroscopic binary:\n    $M_{total} = M_1 + M_2 = \\frac{P(K_1 + K_2)^3}{2\\pi G \\sin^3(i)}$\n\n*   **The Importance of Eclipses:** The problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses. This is a critical piece of information. Eclipses can only occur if we are viewing the system nearly edge-on, which means the inclination angle 'i' must be close to 90 degrees. For i = 90°, sin(i) = 1, and sin³(i) = 1. Since both systems are eclipsing, we can assume sin³(i) is approximately the same for both and will cancel out in the ratio.\n\n### **2. Formulate the Mass Ratio**\n\nFrom the mass function, we can see that the total mass is proportional to the period and the cube of the sum of the velocity amplitudes:\n$M_{total} \\propto P (K_1 + K_2)^3$\n\nWe want to find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, which is the ratio M_total_1 / M_total_2.\n\n$\\frac{M_{total,1}}{M_{total,2}} = \\frac{P_1 (K_{1,1} + K_{1,2})^3}{P_2 (K_{2,1} + K_{2,2})^3}$\n\n### **3. Extract Data and Calculate**\n\nLet's plug in the given values:\n\n*   **System 1:**\n    *   Period, P1 = 2 years\n    *   Sum of velocity amplitudes, K_sum_1 = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n*   **System 2:**\n    *   Period, P2 = 1 year\n    *   Sum of velocity amplitudes, K_sum_2 = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, let's compute the ratio.\n\n```python\n# Parameters for system_1\nP1 = 2.0  # years\nK_sum_1 = 10.0 + 5.0  # km/s\n\n# Parameters for system_2\nP2 = 1.0  # year\nK_sum_2 = 15.0 + 10.0  # km/s\n\n# Calculate the ratio of the total masses (M_total_1 / M_total_2)\n# The mass is proportional to P * (K_sum)^3\n# The constants of proportionality cancel out in the ratio.\nmass_ratio = (P1 * (K_sum_1**3)) / (P2 * (K_sum_2**3))\n\nprint(mass_ratio)\n```\n<execute_code>\n0.432\n</execute_code>\n\nThe calculation gives a ratio of 0.432.\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\nThe mass of system_1 is 0.432 times the mass of system_2. This value is approximately 0.4.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.6\nB) ~ 0.7\nC) ~ 0.4\nD) ~ 1.2\n\nThe calculated factor of 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to find the ratio of their total masses, M_total_1 / M_total_2.\n\n### **1. Physical Principles**\n\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M_1 + M_2) is related to the orbital period (P), the amplitudes of the radial velocities (K_1 and K_2), and the inclination of the orbit (i) by the following formula, which combines Kepler's Third Law with the definitions of radial velocity:\n\n$M_{total} = M_1 + M_2 = \\frac{P(K_1 + K_2)^3}{2\\pi G \\sin^3(i)}$\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant.\n\nA crucial piece of information is that both systems exhibit eclipses. This can only happen if the inclination angle 'i' is very close to 90 degrees, meaning we are viewing the orbits nearly edge-on. For i ≈ 90°, we have sin(i) ≈ 1, and therefore sin³(i) ≈ 1.\n\n### **2. Setting up the Ratio**\n\nWe want to calculate the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to that of system_2:\n\n$\\frac{M_{total,1}}{M_{total,2}} = \\frac{\\frac{P_1(K_{1,1} + K_{1,2})^3}{2\\pi G \\sin^3(i_1)}}{\\frac{P_2(K_{2,1} + K_{2,2})^3}{2\\pi G \\sin^3(i_2)}}$\n\nSince both systems are eclipsing, we assume sin³(i₁) ≈ sin³(i₂) ≈ 1. The term 2πG also cancels out. The formula simplifies to:\n\n$\\frac{M_{total,1}}{M_{total,2}} = \\frac{P_1(K_{1,1} + K_{1,2})^3}{P_2(K_{2,1} + K_{2,2})^3}$\n\n### **3. Plugging in the Values**\n\nLet's gather the data provided in the problem:\n\n*   **System 1:**\n    *   Period, P₁ = 2 years\n    *   Sum of velocity amplitudes = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n*   **System 2:**\n    *   Period, P₂ = 1 year\n    *   Sum of velocity amplitudes = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we substitute these values into our ratio equation:\n\n$\\frac{M_{total,1}}{M_{total,2}} = \\frac{2 \\times (15)^3}{1 \\times (25)^3}$\n\n### **4. Calculation**\n\n$\\frac{M_{total,1}}{M_{total,2}} = \\frac{2 \\times 3375}{1 \\times 15625} = \\frac{6750}{15625} = 0.432$\n\nThe calculation shows that the mass of system_1 is approximately 0.432 times the mass of system_2.\n\n### **5. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated ratio of ~0.432 is closest to the value 0.4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
