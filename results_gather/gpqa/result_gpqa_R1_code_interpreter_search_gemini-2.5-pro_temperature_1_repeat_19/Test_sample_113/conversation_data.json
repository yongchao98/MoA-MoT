    "*   **Analysis of the first reaction:**\n    *   The first reaction is the conversion of butan-2-one into 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.\n    *   This is a classic example of **cyanohydrin formation**.\n    *   The reaction mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻), provided by NaCN, on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one.\n    *   This attack forms a tetrahedral intermediate, an alkoxide ion: (CH₃)(C₂H₅)C(O⁻)(CN).\n    *   To form the final product, this alkoxide ion must be protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   This protonation requires a source of protons (H⁺), which is typically an acid.\n    *   Among the given options for A, H₃O⁺ (representing an aqueous acid like HCl or H₂SO₄) is the standard reagent used to provide the necessary protons for this step. NaHSO₃ is used to form crystalline bisulfite addition products for purification and is not the correct reagent for this synthesis.\n    *   Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n*   **Analysis of the second reaction:**\n    *   The second reaction is the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile into 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.\n    *   This reaction involves the transformation of a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   This transformation is a **hydrolysis reaction**.\n    *   The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can be catalyzed by either strong acids or strong bases upon heating with water.\n    *   The reaction shows H₂O as a reactant, indicating hydrolysis. Reagent B is the catalyst.\n    *   Looking at the options for B:\n        *   HCl (Hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid and is a very common and effective catalyst for the hydrolysis of nitriles.\n        *   CH₃COOH (Acetic acid) is a weak acid and would be much less effective and slower for this transformation compared to a strong acid.\n    *   Therefore, the most suitable reagent for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the nitrile is a strong acid.\n    *   Thus, **B = HCl**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Reagent A should be H₃O⁺.\n    *   Reagent B should be HCl.\n    *   This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
