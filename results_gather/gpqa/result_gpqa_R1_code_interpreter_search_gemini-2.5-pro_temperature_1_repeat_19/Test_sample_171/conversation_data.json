    "This problem requires the application of the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical distribution of particles over various energy states in a system at thermal equilibrium. The stellar photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so we can use this equation.\n\n1.  **The Boltzmann Equation**\n    The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited energy state (`N_excited`) to the number of atoms in the ground state (`N_ground`) is given by the Boltzmann equation:\n\n    `N_excited / N_ground = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`\n\n    where:\n    *   `g_excited` and `g_ground` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the excited and ground states, respectively.\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately `1.38 x 10^-23 J/K`).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n2.  **Applying to the Two Stars**\n    Let's write the equation for each star. Let the ratio `N_excited / N_ground` be denoted by `R`.\n    For star_1 (temperature `T_1`):\n    `R_1 = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))`\n\n    For star_2 (temperature `T_2`):\n    `R_2 = (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n3.  **Using the Given Information**\n    The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2.\" This means that the ratio of excited atoms to ground-state atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2.\n    `R_1 = 2 * R_2`\n\n4.  **Formulating the Equation**\n    We can now set up an equation by dividing the expression for `R_1` by the expression for `R_2`:\n\n    `R_1 / R_2 = [ (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) ] / [ (g_excited / g_ground) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) ]`\n\n    The term with the statistical weights `(g_excited / g_ground)` is the same for both stars (since it's the same atomic transition) and cancels out. Substituting `R_1 / R_2 = 2`:\n\n    `2 = exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))`\n\n    Using the property of exponents `e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)`:\n\n    `2 = exp( (-ΔE / (k * T_1)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2)) )`\n    `2 = exp( (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) )`\n\n5.  **Solving for the Temperatures**\n    To solve for the temperatures, we first take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides:\n\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)`\n\n    Now, combine the terms in the parenthesis with a common denominator `(T_1 * T_2)`:\n\n    `ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * ( (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) )`\n\n6.  **Substituting the Given Values**\n    The problem gives the energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J`.\n    The Boltzmann constant is `k ≈ 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K`.\n\n    Therefore, the ratio `ΔE / k` is approximately:\n    `ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) = 1 K`\n\n    The problem is set up so that this pre-factor is numerically equal to 1. Substituting this into our equation:\n\n    `ln(2) = 1 * ( (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) )`\n    `ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)`\n\n    This equation matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
