    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **The Anhydride:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride has a very simple NMR spectrum:\n    *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates two chemically equivalent protons on a double bond. The downfield shift to 7 ppm is characteristic of vinyl protons attached to electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons).\n    *   These data perfectly match the structure of **maleic anhydride**. It is symmetrical, so the two vinyl protons are equivalent, and the two carbonyl carbons are equivalent, as are the two vinyl carbons.\n\n*   **The Diene:** The problem explicitly names the diene as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n**2. Identify the Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a new six-membered ring, resulting in a bicyclic adduct.\n\n**3. Address the Molecular Formula Discrepancy**\n\n*   Let's calculate the molecular formula of the expected Diels-Alder product:\n    *   Maleic anhydride: C₄H₂O₃\n    *   1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene: C₉H₁₂\n    *   Diels-Alder Adduct: C₄H₂O₃ + C₉H₁₂ = **C₁₃H₁₄O₃**\n*   The problem states the products have a molecular formula of **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**. This differs by two hydrogen atoms (H₂), suggesting a reduction (hydrogenation) of a double bond might have occurred after the Diels-Alder reaction.\n*   However, let's analyze the consequences. If the product were reduced, the characteristic NOE pattern that distinguishes *endo* and *exo* Diels-Alder products would be altered in a way that contradicts the problem statement (this will be shown below). It is most likely that the molecular formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃ is a typo in the question and we should proceed by analyzing the direct Diels-Alder adducts (C₁₃H₁₄O₃), as this leads to a logical and consistent answer.\n\n**4. Determine the Structure and Stereochemistry of the Products**\n\n*   The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* adduct and the *exo* adduct.\n    *   **Endo Rule:** In most Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is formed faster and is the **major product** (kinetic control). The *exo* product is usually more stable but forms slower, making it the **minor product**.\n    *   **Endo Adduct:** The electron-withdrawing group of the dienophile (the anhydride part) is oriented \"under\" the π-system of the newly formed ring (originally the diene).\n    *   **Exo Adduct:** The anhydride part is oriented \"away\" from the π-system.\n\n*   Let's visualize the structures:\n    *   **Major Product (Endo):** The anhydride ring is on the same side as the C=C bridge that bears the four methyl groups. The two protons on the anhydride portion of the molecule (let's call them H_anhydride) are spatially close to the methyl groups on the double bond (let's call them Me_vinyl).\n    *   **Minor Product (Exo):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side of the C=C bridge. The H_anhydride protons are far from the Me_vinyl groups.\n\n**5. Interpret the NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows correlations (cross-peaks) between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The problem states: \"A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\"\n*   Based on our structural analysis:\n    *   In the **major (endo) product**, the H_anhydride protons and the Me_vinyl groups are close. A NOESY cross-peak between them is expected.\n    *   In the **minor (exo) product**, these protons are far apart. No significant NOESY cross-peak is expected.\n*   This perfectly matches the experimental observation. Therefore, the cross-peak in the major product is between the H_anhydride protons and the Me_vinyl protons.\n\n**6. Assign the NMR Resonances**\n\n*   We now need to assign the signals described in the answer choices to the protons in our structure.\n    *   **H_anhydride:** These are two equivalent protons (due to symmetry) on carbons adjacent to carbonyl groups. They are deshielded and should appear as a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Me_vinyl:** These are four methyl groups attached to the double bond. By symmetry, they fall into two sets of two. However, in many similar systems, the difference is small, and they might appear as a single peak. The question describes them as singlets. Let's look closer: there are two methyls on the \"front\" of the double bond (e.g., C1, C4) and two on the \"back\" (C2, C3 of the original diene). The adduct has C2v symmetry. The methyls at C1 and C4 of the diene become the bridgehead methyls. The methyls at C2 and C3 of the diene remain on the double bond of the product. The problem simplifies this by referring to the signals for the products. Let's re-examine the diene: 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The product is 1,4,5,6-tetramethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride.\n        *   The methyls at positions 1 and 4 are bridgehead methyls. They are on saturated carbons. Let's call them **Me_bridgehead**. They should be a **6H singlet at ~1.0-1.5 ppm**.\n        *   The methyls at positions 5 and 6 are on the double bond. Let's call them **Me_vinyl**. They are deshielded relative to the bridgehead methyls. They should be a **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n*   The key NOE is between H_anhydride and Me_vinyl.\n*   The corresponding signals are the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** and the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n\n**7. Match with the Options**\n\n*   Let's review the options based on our assignments:\n    *   A) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl)\n    *   B) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (Me_vinyl) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride)\n    *   C) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (likely a bridge proton) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (H_anhydride)\n    *   D) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm (Me_bridgehead) and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm (likely a bridge proton)\n\nOur analysis shows the cross-peak connects the resonances for Me_vinyl and H_anhydride. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
