    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Chemistry:** The problem involves a chemical equilibrium. We start with a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, which can dissociate back into its constituent ions, Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻. The extent of this dissociation is determined by its equilibrium constant.\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Reaction:** The formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is given by:\n    Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\n3.  **Use the Formation Constant (K_f):** The equilibrium constant for this formation reaction is given as K_f (or K_Ca-EDTA) = 5 x 10¹⁰.\n    K_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n4.  **Consider the Dissociation Reaction:** Since we start with the complex, the relevant reaction in our solution is the dissociation of the complex:\n    [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n5.  **Calculate the Dissociation Constant (K_d):** The dissociation constant (K_d) is the inverse of the formation constant (K_f).\n    K_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n6.  **Set up an ICE Table:** We use an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the concentrations of the species at equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that forms from the dissociation.\n\n| Species         | [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ | Ca²⁺ | EDTA⁴⁻ |\n| --------------- | :-----------: | :----: | :------: |\n| **I**nitial (M) | 0.02          | 0      | 0        |\n| **C**hange (M)  | -x            | +x     | +x       |\n| **E**quilibrium(M)| 0.02 - x      | x      | x        |\n\n7.  **Write the Equilibrium Expression for Dissociation:**\n    K_d = ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]\n    Substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into this expression:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n\n8.  **Simplify the Equation:** Because K_f is very large, K_d is very small. This means the complex is very stable and will only dissociate to a very small extent. Therefore, we can assume that 'x' is negligible compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M).\n    So, (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    The equation simplifies to:\n    2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\n9.  **Solve for x:**\n    x² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\n    x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n    To make the square root easier, we can write 4 x 10⁻¹³ as 40 x 10⁻¹⁴.\n    x = √(40 x 10⁻¹⁴) = √40 * 10⁻⁷\n    Since √36 = 6 and √49 = 7, √40 is approximately 6.3.\n    x ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n10. **Final Answer:** The concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is represented by 'x'. Therefore, [Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. This matches option C.\n\nTo confirm the calculation precisely, we can use a python script.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\n# Initial concentration of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02  # M\n# Formation constant for the Ca-EDTA complex\nKf = 5e10\n\n# The dissociation reaction is [Ca-EDTA]^2- <=> Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-\n# The dissociation constant, Kd, is the inverse of the formation constant, Kf.\n# Kd = 1 / Kf\n# The equilibrium expression for dissociation is:\n# Kd = [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] / [[Ca-EDTA]^2-]\n#\n# From the ICE table:\n# [Ca^2+] = x\n# [EDTA^4-] = x\n# [[Ca-EDTA]^2-] = 0.02 - x\n#\n# So, (x * x) / (0.02 - x) = 1 / Kf\n#\n# Since Kf is very large, Kd is very small, meaning x will be very small.\n# We can make the approximation that (0.02 - x) is approximately 0.02.\n# The equation simplifies to:\n# x^2 / 0.02 ≈ 1 / Kf\n#\n# Solving for x:\n# x^2 ≈ 0.02 / Kf\n# x = sqrt(0.02 / Kf)\n\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / Kf\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\n# The value of x represents the concentration of Ca^2+ ions at equilibrium.\nprint(f\"The concentration of calcium ions is: {x:.2e} M\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nThe concentration of calcium ions is: 6.32e-07 M\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated result from the script is 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M, which confirms the manual calculation.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The equilibrium reaction for the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is:\n\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is the dissociation constant (K_d), which is the inverse of the formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA).\n\nGiven:\n*   Initial concentration of [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ = 0.02 M\n*   Formation constant, K_f = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nFirst, calculate the dissociation constant, K_d:\nK_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\nNext, we set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions that form upon dissociation.\n\n| Species         | [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ | Ca²⁺ | EDTA⁴⁻ |\n| --------------- | :-----------: | :----: | :------: |\n| **I**nitial (M) | 0.02          | 0      | 0        |\n| **C**hange (M)  | -x            | +x     | +x       |\n| **E**quilibrium(M)| 0.02 - x      | x      | x        |\n\nNow, we write the equilibrium expression using the dissociation constant:\n\nK_d = ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]\n\nSubstitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table into the expression:\n\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n\nBecause K_d is very small, the dissociation of the complex is minimal. This means 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore make the simplifying assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * (0.02)\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to x.\n\n[Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis matches the result from the code execution (`6.32e-07 M`). Comparing this value with the given options:\n\nA) 5.0x10⁻³ M\nB) 1.0x10⁻² M\nC) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nD) 2.0x10⁻² M\n\nThe calculated concentration matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
