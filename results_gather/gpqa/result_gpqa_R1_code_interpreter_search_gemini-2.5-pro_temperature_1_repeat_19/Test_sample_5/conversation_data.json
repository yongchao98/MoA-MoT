    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle.\n\n**1. Express the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nThe given potential is in polar coordinates (r, θ):\n$V(r, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} k r^2 + \\frac{3}{2} k r^2 \\cos^2(\\theta)$\n\nTo solve this problem, it's beneficial to switch to Cartesian coordinates (x, y). The relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\n$x = r \\cos(\\theta)$\n$y = r \\sin(\\theta)$\n$r^2 = x^2 + y^2$\n\nSubstitute these into the potential expression:\n$V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} k (x^2 + y^2) + \\frac{3}{2} k (r \\cos(\\theta))^2$\n$V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} k (x^2 + y^2) + \\frac{3}{2} k x^2$\n\nNow, group the terms with x and y:\n$V(x, y) = (\\frac{1}{2} k + \\frac{3}{2} k) x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n$V(x, y) = (\\frac{4}{2} k) x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n$V(x, y) = 2 k x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n\n**2. Separate the Schrödinger Equation**\n\nThe potential is now in a form that is separable in x and y:\n$V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)$\nwhere:\n$V_x(x) = 2 k x^2$\n$V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$\n\nThis means the 2D Schrödinger equation can be separated into two independent 1D Schrödinger equations, one for the x-direction and one for the y-direction. The total energy E will be the sum of the energies from each dimension: $E = E_x + E_y$.\n\n**3. Solve for the Energy in Each Dimension**\n\nThe potential for each dimension is that of a simple harmonic oscillator. The general form for a 1D harmonic oscillator potential is $V(z) = \\frac{1}{2} k_{eff} z^2$, and its energy eigenvalues are given by $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega$, where the angular frequency is $\\omega = \\sqrt{k_{eff}/m}$.\n\n*   **For the x-direction:**\n    The potential is $V_x(x) = 2 k x^2$. We can rewrite this in the standard form:\n    $V_x(x) = \\frac{1}{2} (4k) x^2$\n    So, the effective spring constant is $k_x = 4k$.\n    The angular frequency for the x-oscillator is:\n    $\\omega_x = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_x}{m}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4k}{m}} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    The energy eigenvalues for the x-direction are:\n    $E_{n_x} = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega_x = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar (2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}})$\n\n*   **For the y-direction:**\n    The potential is $V_y(y) = \\frac{1}{2} k y^2$.\n    The effective spring constant is $k_y = k$.\n    The angular frequency for the y-oscillator is:\n    $\\omega_y = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_y}{m}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n    The energy eigenvalues for the y-direction are:\n    $E_{n_y} = (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\omega_y = (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of the energies from the x and y oscillators:\n$E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}$\n$E = (n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar (2\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}) + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\nNow, let's simplify this expression by factoring out the common term $\\hbar\\sqrt{k/m}$:\n$E = \\left[ 2(n_x + \\frac{1}{2}) + (n_y + \\frac{1}{2}) \\right] \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n$E = \\left[ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + \\frac{1}{2} \\right] \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n$E = (2n_x + n_y + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$\n\nThis is the energy spectrum for the particle. The quantum numbers $n_x$ and $n_y$ can be any non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\n**5. Compare with the Given Options**\n\nLet's compare our result with the choices provided:\nA) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nB) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nC) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nD) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\n\nOur derived energy spectrum, $E = (2n_x + n_y + \\frac{3}{2}) \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$, matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
