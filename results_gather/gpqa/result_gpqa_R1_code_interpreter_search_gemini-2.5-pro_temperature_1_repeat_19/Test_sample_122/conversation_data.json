    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S'):** The supernova ejecta's reference frame.\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the two frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`. This is the speed of the ejecta as measured from the Galaxy's frame.\n    *   The time elapsed in the moving frame (ejecta's frame) is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock that is moving with the ejecta.\n    *   The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance `d` that the ejecta travels as measured in the stationary frame (the Galaxy's frame).\n\n4.  **Apply the Principles of Special Relativity:**\n    *   The problem involves a velocity that is a significant fraction of the speed of light (v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2), so we must use the theory of special relativity.\n    *   The distance in the Galaxy's frame is given by the classical formula `d = v * Δt`, but the time `Δt` must be the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame, not the ejecta's frame.\n    *   According to the principle of time dilation, an observer in a stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval `Δt` for events happening in a moving frame, compared to the proper time `Δt₀` measured in the moving frame itself.\n    *   The formula for time dilation is `Δt = γ * Δt₀`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   The formula for the Lorentz factor is `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   First, calculate the ratio `β = v/c`:\n        `β = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   Using the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\n    *   Now, use the distance formula with the speed `v` and the time `Δt` measured in the Galaxy's frame:\n        `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * (50 / sqrt(0.96)) s`\n        `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n\n8.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    *   To get a numerical answer, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nv = 60000  # speed in km/s\ndelta_t0 = 50  # proper time in s\nc = 300000 # speed of light in km/s\n\n# Calculate beta (v/c)\nbeta = v / c\n\n# Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - beta**2)\n\n# Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (delta_t)\ndelta_t = gamma * delta_t0\n\n# Calculate the distance traveled as measured in the Galaxy's reference frame\ndistance = v * delta_t\n\nprint(f\"{distance:.0f}\")\n```\n```output\n3061862\n```\nThe calculated distance is 3,061,862 km. This value is very close to option A.\n\n*   A) 3,060,000 km\n*   B) 2,940,000 km\n*   C) 2,880,000 km\n*   D) 3,000,000 km (This would be the incorrect classical mechanics answer: 60,000 km/s * 50 s)\n\nThe most accurate answer among the choices is A.\n\n<<<A>>>",
    "This problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation. Here is the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   The Galaxy's reference frame is the \"stationary\" frame (let's call it S).\n    *   The supernova ejecta's reference frame is the \"moving\" frame (let's call it S').\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the frames is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   The time that passes in the moving frame (the ejecta's clock) is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is known as the \"proper time\".\n    *   The speed of light is `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the stationary frame (the Galaxy's frame). The formula for distance is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n4.  **Apply Time Dilation:**\n    *   An observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly in the moving frame (the ejecta). Conversely, the time interval `Δt` in the stationary frame will be longer than the proper time `Δt₀`.\n    *   The relationship is given by the time dilation formula: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`.\n    *   Here, `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n    *   `Δt ≈ (1 / 0.9798) * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\n    *   Now, use the time `Δt` measured in the Galaxy's frame to find the distance.\n    *   `d = v * Δt = 60,000 km/s * (50 / sqrt(0.96)) s`\n    *   `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n8.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.\n    *   Looking at the choices:\n        A) 3,060,000 km\n        B) 2,940,000 km\n        C) 2,880,000 km\n        D) 3,000,000 km (This would be the non-relativistic answer, `60,000 * 50`)\n    *   The value 3,061,862 km is extremely close to option A. The small difference is likely due to rounding in the problem's design.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
