    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the number of stereoisomers for the compound 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol.\n\n**Step 1: Draw the structure of the compound from its IUPAC name.**\n\nThe name provides the following information:\n*   **undeca**: The parent chain has 11 carbon atoms.\n*   **-3,7-dien-**: There are two carbon-carbon double bonds, one starting at carbon 3 (between C3 and C4) and another at carbon 7 (between C7 and C8).\n*   **-5-ol**: There is a hydroxyl (-OH) group on carbon 5. This is the principal functional group, so we number the chain to give this group the lowest possible number.\n*   **6-chloro-**: A chlorine atom (Cl) is attached to carbon 6.\n*   **9-ethyl-**: An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) is attached to carbon 9.\n*   **2-methyl-**: A methyl group (-CH₃) is attached to carbon 2.\n\nBased on this, we can draw the carbon skeleton and add the substituents and functional groups.\n\nNumbering the chain from left to right:\n`C(1)-C(2)-C(3)=C(4)-C(5)-C(6)-C(7)=C(8)-C(9)-C(10)-C(11)`\n\nAdding the groups:\n*   At C2: -CH₃\n*   At C5: -OH\n*   At C6: -Cl\n*   At C9: -CH₂CH₃\n\nAdding hydrogens to satisfy the valency of each carbon atom, we get the final structure:\n`CH₃–CH(CH₃)–CH=CH–CH(OH)–CH(Cl)–CH=CH–CH(CH₂CH₃)–CH₂–CH₃`\n\nLet's label the carbons for clarity in the analysis:\n`¹CH₃–²CH(CH₃)–³CH=⁴CH–⁵CH(OH)–⁶CH(Cl)–⁷CH=⁸CH–⁹CH(CH₂CH₃)–¹⁰CH₂–¹¹CH₃`\n\n**Step 2: Identify all stereocenters in the molecule.**\n\nStereocenters are points in a molecule that can give rise to stereoisomers. These include chiral centers (asymmetric carbon atoms) and double bonds that can exhibit geometric isomerism (E/Z).\n\n**a) Chiral Centers (Asymmetric Carbons)**\nA carbon atom is a chiral center if it is bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **C2**: This carbon is bonded to H, a methyl substituent (-CH₃), C1 (-CH₃), and the rest of the chain starting with C3. Since it is bonded to two identical methyl groups, **C2 is not a chiral center**.\n*   **C5**: This carbon is bonded to four different groups:\n    1.  -H\n    2.  -OH\n    3.  The group on the left: `-CH=CH-CH(CH₃)₂`\n    4.  The group on the right: `-CH(Cl)-CH=CH-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂CH₃`\n    These four groups are all different. Therefore, **C5 is a chiral center**.\n*   **C6**: This carbon is bonded to four different groups:\n    1.  -H\n    2.  -Cl\n    3.  The group on the left: `-CH(OH)-CH=CH-CH(CH₃)₂`\n    4.  The group on the right: `-CH=CH-CH(C₂H₅)-CH₂CH₃`\n    These four groups are all different. Therefore, **C6 is a chiral center**.\n*   **C9**: This carbon is bonded to H, an ethyl substituent (-CH₂CH₃), the C8 side of the chain, and the C10-C11 part of the chain (-CH₂CH₃). Since it is bonded to two identical ethyl groups, **C9 is not a chiral center**.\n\nSo, there are **2 chiral centers** (C5 and C6).\n\n**b) Geometric Isomerism (E/Z Isomerism)**\nA double bond can exhibit E/Z isomerism if each of the two carbon atoms involved in the double bond is attached to two different groups.\n\n*   **C3=C4 double bond**:\n    *   C3 is bonded to H and an isopropyl group (`-CH(CH₃)₂`). These are different.\n    *   C4 is bonded to H and the rest of the chain (`-CH(OH)-...`). These are different.\n    Therefore, the **C3=C4 double bond is a stereocenter**.\n*   **C7=C8 double bond**:\n    *   C7 is bonded to H and the rest of the chain (`-CH(Cl)-...`). These are different.\n    *   C8 is bonded to H and a 3-pentyl group (`-CH(C₂H₅)CH₂CH₃`). These are different.\n    Therefore, the **C7=C8 double bond is a stereocenter**.\n\nSo, there are **2 double bonds** that exhibit geometric isomerism.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of stereoisomers.**\n\nThe total number of stereocenters (n) is the sum of the number of chiral centers and the number of stereogenic double bonds.\nn = (number of chiral centers) + (number of stereogenic double bonds)\nn = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nThe maximum number of stereoisomers for a molecule with 'n' stereocenters is given by the formula 2ⁿ. This formula applies when the molecule is not symmetrical (i.e., has no meso forms).\n\nThe molecule `6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol` is asymmetrical. The group at one end is an isopropyl group (`-CH(CH₃)₂`), and the group at the other end is part of a 3-pentyl system. There is no internal plane of symmetry. Therefore, no meso compounds are possible, and the number of stereoisomers is exactly 2ⁿ.\n\nNumber of stereoisomers = 2⁴ = 16.\n\n<<<C>>>"
