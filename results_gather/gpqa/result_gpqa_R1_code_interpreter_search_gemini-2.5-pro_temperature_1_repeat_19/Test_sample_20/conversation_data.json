    "*   **Analysis of Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n    *   **Tautomerism** is a chemical equilibrium between two or more interconvertible isomers, known as tautomers. A very common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n    *   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** The structure is a six-membered ring with alternating single and double bonds, and two carbonyl groups (C=O) at opposite ends (positions 1 and 4). Let's examine the carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups. These alpha-carbons are part of the ring's double bonds and are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms. Since there are no alpha-hydrogens, p-benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This is a six-membered saturated ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are alpha to the carbonyl groups. Each of these carbons is a CH₂ group, meaning they possess alpha-hydrogens. The presence of these alpha-hydrogens, which are particularly acidic because they are positioned between two carbonyl groups, allows this compound to readily undergo tautomerism. It tautomerizes to its enol form, phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene), which is a highly stable aromatic compound.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.\n\n*   **Analysis of Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n    *   **Optical isomerism** occurs in chiral molecules. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common source of chirality is a stereocenter, typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's analyze the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). This carbon is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n        Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule and exhibits optical isomerism.\n    *   **Dimethyl fumarate:** Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, and it is the *trans* isomer. This molecule is planar around the double bond. It possesses a center of inversion and a plane of symmetry, which makes it achiral. Molecules that are achiral cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Final Combination**\n\n    *   The compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n    *   The compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n    *   This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
