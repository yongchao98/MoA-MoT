    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction I**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   This is a ketone with a pre-existing chiral center at carbon 5 (C5), with an (S) configuration.\n    *   The structure is: CH₃-CH(OCH₃)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₃. The chiral center is the carbon bonded to the methoxy group.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that will reduce the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol. This reaction creates a new chiral center at C3.\n*   **Products:** The original chiral center at C5 is unaffected by the reaction. The new chiral center at C3 can have either an (R) or (S) configuration because the hydride ion can attack the planar carbonyl group from either face.\n    *   Product 1: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** Since one chiral center is the same (5S) and the other is different (3S vs. 3R), these two products are **diastereomers**. Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by standard chromatography techniques.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two diastereomeric products are formed.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction II**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   This is a symmetrical diketone: CH₃-C(=O)-CH₂-C(=O)-CH₃. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄) followed by an acidic workup (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH₄ will reduce both ketone groups to secondary alcohols, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new chiral centers at C2 and C4.\n    *   Product structure: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃.\n*   **Products and Stereochemistry:** We need to consider all possible stereoisomers. With two chiral centers (C2 and C4), there is a maximum of 2² = 4 stereoisomers.\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, so they are a pair of **enantiomers**. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, these will be formed as a racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) need closer inspection. Due to the symmetry of the molecule, the (2R, 4S) isomer has an internal plane of symmetry (in a specific conformation) and is superimposable on its mirror image, (2S, 4R). Therefore, (2R, 4S) and (2S, 4R) are the same achiral compound, which is a **meso compound**.\n    *   The meso compound is a **diastereomer** of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n\n**Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three stereoisomers are formed: one pair of enantiomers and one meso compound.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties (including polarity) in an achiral environment and therefore **cannot be separated**. They will elute as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and **can be separated**. They will elute as distinct peaks.\n\nLet's count the peaks from the combined mixture:\n1.  **Products from Reaction I:** We have two diastereomers, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Since they are diastereomers, they have different polarities and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n2.  **Products from Reaction II:** We have a racemic pair of enantiomers, ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol), and a meso compound.\n    *   The enantiomeric pair will co-elute as **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, so it has a different polarity and will elute as a separate peak (**1 peak**).\n    *   This gives a total of **2 peaks** from Reaction II products.\n3.  **Total Peaks:** The products from Reaction I (methoxy-alcohols) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (diols) and will have different retention times. Assuming no accidental co-elution, the total number of peaks is the sum of the peaks from each group.\n    *   Total peaks = 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**\n\nA chiral HPLC column has a stationary phase that is itself chiral. This allows it to interact differently with enantiomers, enabling their separation. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   **Enantiomers can be separated.**\n*   **Diastereomers can be separated.**\n\nLet's count the peaks from the combined mixture, which contains a total of 5 unique stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (**Peak 1**)\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (diastereomer of 1, will separate) (**Peak 2**)\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (**Peak 3**)\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomer of 3, will separate on a chiral column) (**Peak 4**)\n5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol (diastereomer of 3 and 4, will separate) (**Peak 5**)\n\nSince all five stereoisomers are chemically distinct and a chiral column can resolve both enantiomers and diastereomers, we expect to see **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: **4 peaks**\n*   Chiral HPLC: **5 peaks**\n\nMatching this with the given options:\n\nA) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nB) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\nC) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nD) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
