    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\nThe problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%. Let the molecular formula of Z be CxHy. The atomic mass of Carbon (C) is approximately 12 g/mol, and Hydrogen (H) is approximately 1 g/mol.\n\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen is calculated as:\nMass Fraction of H = (Total mass of H) / (Total mass of hydrocarbon)\n0.1428 = (y * 1) / (x * 12 + y * 1)\n\nTo find the ratio of y to x:\n0.1428 * (12x + y) = y\n1.7136x + 0.1428y = y\n1.7136x = y - 0.1428y\n1.7136x = 0.8572y\ny / x = 1.7136 / 0.8572 ≈ 2\n\nThis means the empirical formula for Z is CH2. The general formula for a hydrocarbon with this empirical formula is (CH2)n or CnH2n.\n\nThe problem also states that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon (it does not react further with hydrogen) and is widely used as a solvent. A hydrocarbon with the general formula CnH2n that is saturated must be a cycloalkane. A very common cycloalkane used as a solvent is cyclohexane, which has the formula C6H12.\n\nLet's verify the mass fraction of hydrogen for cyclohexane (C6H12) using integer masses:\nMass fraction of H = (12 * 1) / (6 * 12 + 12 * 1) = 12 / (72 + 12) = 12 / 84 = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857.\nThis matches the given value of 14.28%. Therefore, substance Z is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y**\n\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. One of its constituents is Z, which we have identified as cyclohexane (C6H12). Let the other component be W.\nSo, Y = {cyclohexane (C6H12), W}.\n\nWe know that mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. Cyclohexane is a saturated alkane and does not react with bromine water. Therefore, W must also be a substance that does not decolorize bromine water. This means W is likely a saturated or aromatic compound.\n\nFurthermore, the hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z (cyclohexane).\n*   Hydrogenation of cyclohexane (C6H12) yields cyclohexane (no reaction as it's already saturated).\n*   Hydrogenation of W must yield cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\nIf W were a saturated hydrocarbon, to be converted to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation, it would need to be an isomer of cyclohexane (like methylcyclopentane). However, the problem says mixture Y is formed from disproportionation, which typically involves changes in the degree of unsaturation. A more fitting candidate for W is an aromatic compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. The only C6 aromatic hydrocarbon is benzene (C6H6).\n\nLet's check if benzene fits the description:\n*   Hydrogenation of benzene under severe conditions (as stated in the problem) gives cyclohexane: C6H6 + 3H2 --(Pt)--> C6H12. This fits.\n*   Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under standard conditions (it undergoes substitution, not addition, and the reaction is not with bromine water). This fits.\n\nTherefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction and Mixture X**\n\nMixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, let's call them A and B. When heated with platinum, X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y.\nA disproportionation reaction in this context is a hydrogen transfer reaction, where some molecules are hydrogenated (gain H) and others are dehydrogenated (lose H).\n\nThe overall reaction is:\nMixture X (A + B) → Mixture Y (C6H12 + C6H6)\n\nSince the mixtures are equimolar, the reaction at the molecular level is:\nA + B → C6H12 + C6H6\n\nBy the law of conservation of mass, the number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the equation.\n*   The hydrogenation of both A and B gives only cyclohexane (C6H12). This implies that both A and B must have a C6 carbon skeleton. Let their formulas be C6Ha and C6Hb.\n*   The reaction becomes: C6Ha + C6Hb → C6H12 + C6H6.\n\nNow, let's balance the hydrogen atoms:\nTotal H atoms in reactants = Total H atoms in products\na + b = 12 + 6\na + b = 18\n\nThe problem asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This corresponds to the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of liquid A and one molecule of liquid B, which is `a + b`.\n\nBased on our stoichiometric analysis, this sum is 18.\n\nThe other pieces of information (X decolorizes bromine water, no conjugated bonds) help confirm the identities of A and B (likely cyclohexene, C6H10, and 1,4-cyclohexadiene, C6H8, where 10 + 8 = 18), but they are not required to find the total number of hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe total number of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each of the two liquids in mixture X is 18.\n\n<<<D>>>"
