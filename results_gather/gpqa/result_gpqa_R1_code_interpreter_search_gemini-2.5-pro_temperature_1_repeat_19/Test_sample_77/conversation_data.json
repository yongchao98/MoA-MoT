    "This question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a moving point charge. These are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Let's derive them from the general formulas for retarded potentials.\n\n### 1. Key Definitions and Retarded Time\n\n*   `q`: The point charge.\n*   `s(t)`: The trajectory of the charge.\n*   `r`: The point in space where we observe the field (the field point).\n*   `t`: The time at which we observe the field.\n*   The field observed at `(r, t)` was emitted by the charge at an earlier time, called the **retarded time**, `tr`.\n*   The signal (electromagnetic field) travels at the speed of light, `c`. The time it takes for the signal to travel from the charge's position at `tr` to the observation point `r` is `t - tr`.\n*   The position of the charge at the retarded time is `s(tr)`.\n*   The distance the signal travels is `|r - s(tr)|`.\n*   Therefore, the defining equation for the retarded time is: `t - tr = |r - s(tr)| / c`.\n*   Let `d = r - s(tr)` be the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point.\n*   Let `d = |d|` be the magnitude of this vector. So, `c(t - tr) = d`.\n*   Let `v = s'(tr)` be the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n\n### 2. General Formulas for Retarded Potentials\n\nThe general solutions for the potentials in the Lorenz gauge are given by the retarded potential integrals:\n*   Scalar Potential: `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [ρ(r', tr') / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n*   Vector Potential: `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [J(r', tr') / |r - r'|] d³r'`\nwhere `tr' = t - |r - r'| / c` is the retarded time for a source point `r'`.\n\n### 3. Applying to a Point Charge\n\nFor a point charge `q` moving along a trajectory `s(t)`, the charge and current densities are:\n*   `ρ(r', t) = q δ³(r' - s(t))`\n*   `J(r', t) = q v(t) δ³(r' - s(t))`\nwhere `δ³` is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function.\n\nSubstituting these into the potential integrals:\n*   `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) ∫ [q δ³(r' - s(tr')) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n*   `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) ∫ [q v(tr') δ³(r' - s(tr')) / |r - r'|] d³r'`\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Integrals\n\nThe presence of `tr' = t - |r - r'|/c` inside the argument of the delta function makes the integration non-trivial. A standard result from electromagnetism (derived by considering the Jacobian of a change of variables) is that the integration yields a correction factor `1/(1 - \\hat{d} ⋅ v/c)`, where `\\hat{d} = d/d`.\n\nLet's evaluate the integral for `V(r, t)`. The delta function `δ³(r' - s(tr'))` collapses the integral to the point where `r' = s(tr')`. At this point, `r'` becomes the retarded position of the charge `s(tr)`.\nThe integral is evaluated as:\n`∫ f(r') δ³(r' - s(tr')) d³r' = [f(r') / |1 - \\hat{d} ⋅ v/c|]_ret`\nThe `_ret` subscript means all quantities are evaluated at the retarded time `tr`.\nThe factor `|1 - \\hat{d} ⋅ v/c|` arises from the change of variables. Since `v < c`, the term is always positive, so we can drop the absolute value.\n\nApplying this to the potential integrals:\n*   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n    The integrand without the delta function is `q / |r - r'|`. At the retarded position, this becomes `q / |r - s(tr)| = q / d`.\n    So, `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * [q / d] * [1 / (1 - \\hat{d} ⋅ v/c)]`\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * q / (d(1 - (\\vec{d} ⋅ \\vec{v})/(dc)))`\n    `V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * q / (d - (\\vec{d} ⋅ \\vec{v})/c)`\n\n*   **Vector Potential (A):**\n    The integrand is `q v(tr') / |r - r'|`. At the retarded position, this becomes `q v / d`.\n    So, `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * [q v / d] * [1 / (1 - \\hat{d} ⋅ v/c)]`\n    `A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * qv / (d - (\\vec{d} ⋅ \\vec{v})/c)`\n\n### 5. Comparing with the Options\n\nNow, let's manipulate these expressions to match the form given in the options.\nLet's focus on the denominator:\n`d - (\\vec{d} ⋅ \\vec{v})/c = (dc - \\vec{d} ⋅ \\vec{v}) / c`\n\nSubstitute this back into the expression for V:\n`V(r, t) = (1 / 4πε₀) * q / ((dc - \\vec{d} ⋅ \\vec{v})/c) = (qc) / (4πε₀ (dc - \\vec{d} ⋅ \\vec{v}))`\n\nAnd for A:\n`A(r, t) = (μ₀ / 4π) * qv / ((dc - \\vec{d} ⋅ \\vec{v})/c) = (μ₀ qcv) / (4π (dc - \\vec{d} ⋅ \\vec{v}))`\n\nThese two expressions exactly match Option A.\n\n*   **A) V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}` -> **Correct**.\n*   **B) and D)** These options use the static potential `q / (4πε₀ r)`, which is incorrect as it neglects retardation and the motion effect on the potential's magnitude.\n*   **C)** This option has a `+` sign in the denominator. This is incorrect; the derivation clearly shows a `-` sign, which is crucial for describing the physical effects (like the Doppler effect and beaming).\n\nTherefore, Option A provides the correct expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n<<<A>>>"
