    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n**1. Analyze the Products and Reactions**\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** Compound **A** is treated with LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) and then H⁺ to produce **(R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**.\n*   **Reaction 2:** Compound **B** is treated with BH₃ (Borane) and then H⁺ to produce **(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**.\n\nThe product in both cases is a lactone (a cyclic ester), specifically a δ-lactone (a six-membered ring). The two products are enantiomers of each other, differing only in the stereochemistry at the chiral center (C4, which bears the ethyl group).\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Materials**\n\nThe options provided are all isomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". This name describes a derivative of 3-ethylpentanedioic acid (also known as 3-ethylglutaric acid) where one of the carboxylic acid groups has been converted into an isobutyl ester. The structure is an **ester-acid**:\n\n`iBu-O-CO-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`\n\nThe chiral center is the carbon with the ethyl group (C3 in the acid chain). The reactions produce a lactone, which involves the cyclization of a molecule containing both a hydroxyl group and a carboxylic acid group (or a derivative). The key to solving this problem lies in the different selectivities of the two reducing agents, LiBH₄ and BH₃.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1: The Role of LiBH₄**\n\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a reducing agent.\n*   **Chemoselectivity:** When reacting with a molecule containing both an ester and a carboxylic acid (an ester-acid), LiBH₄ preferentially reduces the **ester** group. The carboxylic acid is first deprotonated by the basic hydride reagent to form a carboxylate salt, which is much less reactive towards reduction.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The ester group (`-CO-O-iBu`) in compound **A** is reduced by LiBH₄ to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The acid workup (H⁺) protonates the intermediate to form a hydroxy-acid: `HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH` (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid).\n    3.  Under acidic conditions, this hydroxy-acid undergoes intramolecular esterification (lactonization), where the `-OH` group attacks the `-COOH` group to form the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (ester reduction and cyclization) do not involve the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Since the product is **(R) H-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**, the starting material **A** must also have the **(R)** configuration.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2: The Role of BH₃**\n\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane), usually used as a BH₃·THF complex.\n*   **Chemoselectivity:** Borane is highly selective for reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols, and it typically does not reduce esters under the same conditions.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) in compound **B** is reduced by BH₃ to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The ester group is left unchanged.\n    2.  This step produces a hydroxy-ester: `iBu-O-CO-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH` (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate).\n    3.  During the acid workup (H⁺), an acid-catalyzed intramolecular transesterification occurs. The newly formed `-OH` group attacks the carbonyl of the isobutyl ester, displacing isobutanol (`iBu-OH`) and forming the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reactions (carboxylic acid reduction and cyclization) do not involve the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Since the product is **(S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**, the starting material **B** must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**5. Final Determination**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material A is the (R)-isomer.\n*   Starting material B is the (S)-isomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
