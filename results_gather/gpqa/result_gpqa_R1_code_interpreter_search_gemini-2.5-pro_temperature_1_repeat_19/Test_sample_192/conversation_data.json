    "Here's the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    The problem states that the number of stars (`N`) varies with parallax (`plx`) in a specific way. More precisely, the number of stars *per unit range of parallax* is given by the relation:\n    `dN / d(plx) ∝ 1 / plx^5`\n    where `∝` means \"is proportional to\".\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    We need to find how the number of stars *per unit range of distance* (`dN / dr`) changes with distance (`r`).\n\n3.  **Establish the Key Relationship:**\n    The fundamental connection between distance and parallax is that they are inversely proportional. In standard astronomical units (distance `r` in parsecs and parallax `plx` in arcseconds), the relationship is:\n    `plx = 1 / r`\n\n4.  **Formulate a Plan using Calculus:**\n    We have a derivative with respect to `plx` (`dN / d(plx)`) and we want to find a derivative with respect to `r` (`dN / dr`). This is a classic variable-change problem that can be solved using the **chain rule** of differentiation:\n    `dN / dr = (dN / d(plx)) * (d(plx) / dr)`\n\n5.  **Execute the Plan:**\n    We need to find the two terms on the right side of the chain rule equation.\n\n    *   **First term (`dN / d(plx)`):** We are given this relationship. To make it easier to work with, we can express it in terms of `r`. Since `plx = 1/r`, we can substitute this into the given proportionality:\n        `dN / d(plx) ∝ 1 / plx^5 = 1 / (1/r)^5 = r^5`\n\n    *   **Second term (`d(plx) / dr`):** We need to differentiate the relationship `plx = 1/r` with respect to `r`.\n        `plx = r⁻¹`\n        `d(plx) / dr = d/dr (r⁻¹) = -1 * r⁻² = -1 / r²`\n\n6.  **Combine the Terms:**\n    Now, substitute the two parts back into the chain rule equation:\n    `dN / dr ∝ (r^5) * (-1 / r²) `\n\n7.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `dN / dr ∝ -r^(5-2)`\n    `dN / dr ∝ -r³`\n\n8.  **Interpret the Result:**\n    The result `dN / dr ∝ -r³` tells us how the number of stars per unit distance changes with distance. The negative sign indicates the direction of the relationship (as `r` increases, `plx` decreases, and `dN/d(plx)` changes accordingly), but the question is about the functional dependence, or the magnitude of the relationship. Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to `r³`.\n\n9.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated relationship is `~ r³`.\n    *   A) ~ r²\n    *   B) ~ r³\n    *   C) ~ r⁴\n    *   D) ~ r⁵\n\n    The result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
