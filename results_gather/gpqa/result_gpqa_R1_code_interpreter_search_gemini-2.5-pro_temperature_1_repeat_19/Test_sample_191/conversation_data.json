    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the System:** We have a neutral spherical conductor of radius R. Inside it, there is an off-center spherical cavity of radius r. A point charge +q is placed inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.\n\n2.  **Apply Properties of Conductors in Electrostatics:**\n    *   **Electric Field Inside a Conductor:** The electric field inside the bulk material of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is always zero.\n    *   **Charge Induction:** The presence of the charge +q inside the cavity will cause the mobile charges (electrons) within the conductor to redistribute.\n\n3.  **Charge on the Inner Surface (Cavity Wall):**\n    *   Consider a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the conducting material and encloses the cavity.\n    *   According to Gauss's Law, the electric flux through this surface is equal to the net charge enclosed divided by ε₀ (∮ E⋅dA = Q_enclosed / ε₀).\n    *   Since the electric field (E) inside the conductor is zero, the flux through our Gaussian surface is zero.\n    *   This implies that the net charge enclosed (Q_enclosed) must be zero.\n    *   The enclosed charge is the sum of the point charge (+q) and the charge induced on the inner surface of the cavity (q_inner).\n    *   Therefore, Q_enclosed = +q + q_inner = 0.\n    *   This means a charge of **-q** must be induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n4.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:**\n    *   The spherical conductor was initially uncharged (electrically neutral).\n    *   We've established that a charge of -q has been drawn to the inner surface.\n    *   To maintain overall charge neutrality for the conductor, a charge of **+q** must appear on its outer surface.\n\n5.  **Electrostatic Shielding:**\n    *   A key principle is that the conducting material acts as an electrostatic shield. The charges outside the conductor are shielded from the electric fields of the charges inside the cavity (+q and the induced -q).\n    *   Consequently, the distribution of the +q charge on the outer surface is not affected by the position of the cavity or the position of the charge +q within the cavity.\n    *   Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere, the +q charge will distribute itself **uniformly** over the outer surface to minimize repulsion.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P (Outside):**\n    *   The electric field at any point outside the conductor is solely due to the charge distribution on the outer surface.\n    *   We have a charge of +q distributed uniformly over a spherical surface of radius R.\n    *   According to the Shell Theorem (a result of Gauss's Law), the electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is identical to the field produced by a point charge of the same total magnitude located at the center of the sphere.\n    *   In this case, the total charge on the outer surface is +q. The center is the center of the main spherical conductor. The distance from this center to point P is given as L.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Using the formula for the electric field of a point charge:\n        E = (1 / 4πε₀) * (Total Charge) / (distance)²\n    *   Substituting our values:\n        E = (1 / 4πε₀) * q / L²\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The information about the cavity's radius (r), its displacement from the center (s), the distance from the cavity's center to P (l), and the angle (θ) are all irrelevant for calculating the electric field *outside* the conductor due to the shielding effect. The field outside only depends on the net charge that moves to the outer surface (+q) and the geometry of that outer surface (a sphere).\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) E = (1 / 4πε₀) * (q / L²) - This matches our derivation.\nB) E = (1 / 4πε₀) * (q / l²) - Incorrect. This ignores the shielding and redistribution of charge by the conductor.\nC) E = (1 / 4πε₀) * (q / (l + s cosθ)²) - Incorrect. This uses an incorrect distance.\nD) E = (1 / 4πε₀) * (q / (l - s cosθ)²) - Incorrect. This uses an incorrect distance.\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
