    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the two reactions.\n\n### Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate, which is an α,β-unsaturated ester (a Michael acceptor).\n\n2.  **Determine the enolate formation:**\n    *   The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   We need to find the α-protons (protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group). The α-carbons are C-2 and C-6.\n    *   C-2 is a quaternary carbon, bonded to an ethyl group, a methyl group, C-1 (carbonyl), and C-3. It has **no α-protons**.\n    *   C-6 is a tertiary carbon, bonded to a methyl group, C-1 (carbonyl), C-5, and one hydrogen. It has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Therefore, the base (t-BuOK) can only abstract the proton from C-6. This is the only site for enolate formation.\n\n     \n\n3.  **Perform the Michael Addition:**\n    *   The enolate's nucleophilic carbon (C-6) attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt).\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C-6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n    *   The resulting product adds a `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` group to the C-6 position of the original ketone.\n\n     \n\n4.  **Determine the structure and name of Product A:**\n    *   The product has the following structure: A cyclohexanone ring with the carbonyl at C-1, an ethyl and a methyl group at C-2, a methyl group at C-6, and a new `–CH₂CH₂COOEt` group also at C-6.\n    *   Let's analyze the IUPAC name provided in the options. The options name the product as a substituted ethyl propanoate. This is a valid, though less common, way to name the product. Let's see if our product matches this naming convention.\n    *   Let's analyze the name: **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n        *   The parent chain is `ethyl propanoate`.\n        *   At position 3 of the propanoate chain (`-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt`), there is a cyclohexyl substituent.\n        *   Let's number the cyclohexyl ring according to this name:\n            *   The attachment point to the propanoate chain is C-1.\n            *   There is a methyl group at C-1 (`-1,3-dimethyl`).\n            *   The keto group (`-oxo`) is at C-2.\n            *   An ethyl group and a methyl group are at C-3 (`-3-ethyl` and `-1,3-dimethyl`).\n    *   Now, let's map this onto our product structure by renumbering the ring. If we set the original C-6 (the point of attack) as the new C-1, then:\n        *   The original C-1 (carbonyl) becomes the new C-2.\n        *   The original C-2 (with Et and Me) becomes the new C-3.\n    *   This renumbering perfectly matches the name `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`. The other name option for A has the oxo group at position 4, which is incorrect.\n\n    Therefore, **Product A is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n---\n\n### Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is also a Michael addition. Protons on the carbon adjacent to a nitro group (α-protons) are acidic (pKa ≈ 10). The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), is strong enough to deprotonate the 1-nitropropane. The resulting carbanion (a nitronate) acts as a nucleophile. The Michael acceptor is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Determine the carbanion formation:**\n    *   KOH removes a proton from the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (`CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂`).\n    *   The nucleophile formed is `[CH₃CH₂CH-NO₂]⁻`.\n\n3.  **Perform the Michael Addition:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the deprotonated 1-nitropropane attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`).\n    *   The β-carbon is the `CH` group attached to the methyl group.\n    *   A new C-C bond forms between the α-carbon of the nitropropane and the β-carbon of the nitrile.\n    *   The resulting intermediate is protonated by water (the solvent) to give the final product.\n\n     \n\n4.  **Determine the structure and name of Product B:**\n    *   The resulting structure is `CH₃CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n    *   To name this product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The carbon of the nitrile is C-1.\n    *   We find the longest carbon chain that includes C-1. The chain is 6 carbons long, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   Now we number the chain and name the substituents:\n        `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(NO₂)(4)-CH(CH₃)(3)-CH₂(2)-CN(1)`\n        *   There is a methyl group on C-3.\n        *   There is a nitro group on C-4.\n    *   Putting it all together, the name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct**)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A and B)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect B)\n\nThe correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
