    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area of a surface defined by the given metric.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Metric\nThe given metric is:\n$ds^{2}=\\frac{32}{\\left(4-x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)}\\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\\right)$\n\nThis is a metric for a 2-dimensional surface described in Cartesian coordinates (x, y). The form is $ds^2 = g_{xx}dx^2 + 2g_{xy}dxdy + g_{yy}dy^2$.\nBy comparing with the given metric, we can identify the components of the metric tensor $g_{ij}$:\n$g_{xx} = \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}$\n$g_{yy} = \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}$\n$g_{xy} = g_{yx} = 0$\n\nThe metric is defined as long as the denominator is positive, i.e., $4-x^2-y^2 > 0$, which means $x^2+y^2 < 4$. This domain is an open disk of radius 2 centered at the origin. The phrase \"pseudosphere of radius r=2\" refers to this manifold whose coordinate chart is the disk of radius 2.\n\n### 2. The Area Element\nThe area element $dA$ on a surface with metric tensor $g$ is given by the formula:\n$dA = \\sqrt{\\det(g)} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\nFirst, we calculate the determinant of the metric tensor $g$:\n$\\det(g) = g_{xx}g_{yy} - g_{xy}^2 = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right) - 0^2$\n$\\det(g) = \\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right)^2$\n\nNow, we find the square root of the determinant:\n$\\sqrt{\\det(g)} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right)^2} = \\left|\\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right|$\n\nSince the domain of definition is $x^2+y^2 < 4$, the denominator $4-x^2-y^2$ is always positive. Therefore, we can remove the absolute value signs.\n$\\sqrt{\\det(g)} = \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}}$\n\nSo, the area element is:\n$dA = \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\n### 3. Calculating the Total Area\nThe total area $A$ is found by integrating the area element $dA$ over the entire domain where the metric is defined, which is the disk $D = \\{(x,y) | x^2+y^2 < 4\\}$.\n$A = \\iint_D \\frac{32}{4-x^{2}-y^{2}} \\, dx \\, dy$\n\nDue to the circular symmetry of the integrand and the domain, it is convenient to switch to polar coordinates.\nLet:\n$x = r \\cos \\theta$\n$y = r \\sin \\theta$\nThen $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$.\nThe differential area element in polar coordinates is $dx \\, dy = r \\, dr \\, d\\theta$.\nThe domain $D$ in polar coordinates is $0 \\le r < 2$ and $0 \\le \\theta \\le 2\\pi$.\n\nSubstituting these into the integral:\n$A = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{32}{4-r^2} \\, r \\, dr \\, d\\theta$\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Integral\nWe can separate the integral into two parts:\n$A = 32 \\left( \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta \\right) \\left( \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{r}{4-r^2} \\, dr \\right)$\n\nThe integral with respect to $\\theta$ is straightforward:\n$\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta = [\\theta]_0^{2\\pi} = 2\\pi$\n\nNow we evaluate the integral with respect to $r$. This is an improper integral because the integrand $\\frac{r}{4-r^2}$ is undefined at the limit of integration $r=2$. We must evaluate it using a limit:\n$I_r = \\int_{0}^{2} \\frac{r}{4-r^2} \\, dr = \\lim_{a \\to 2^-} \\int_{0}^{a} \\frac{r}{4-r^2} \\, dr$\n\nWe use the substitution method. Let $u = 4-r^2$. Then $du = -2r \\, dr$, which implies $r \\, dr = -\\frac{1}{2} du$.\nLet's find the indefinite integral first:\n$\\int \\frac{r}{4-r^2} \\, dr = \\int \\frac{1}{u} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} du\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\int \\frac{1}{u} du = -\\frac{1}{2} \\ln|u| + C = -\\frac{1}{2} \\ln|4-r^2| + C$\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral with the limit:\n$I_r = \\lim_{a \\to 2^-} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{2} \\ln(4-r^2) \\right]_0^a$\n(We can drop the absolute value since $4-r^2>0$ for $r \\in [0, a)$ where $a<2$).\n$I_r = \\lim_{a \\to 2^-} \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} \\ln(4-a^2) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\ln(4-0^2)\\right) \\right)$\n$I_r = \\lim_{a \\to 2^-} \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} \\ln(4-a^2) + \\frac{1}{2} \\ln(4) \\right)$\n\nAs $a$ approaches $2$ from below, the term $4-a^2$ approaches $0$ from the positive side. The natural logarithm $\\ln(x)$ approaches $-\\infty$ as $x \\to 0^+$.\nSo, $\\lim_{a \\to 2^-} \\ln(4-a^2) = -\\infty$.\n\nTherefore, the value of the integral is:\n$I_r = -\\frac{1}{2} (-\\infty) + \\frac{1}{2} \\ln(4) = +\\infty$\n\nSince the integral with respect to $r$ diverges to infinity, the total area is:\n$A = 32 \\cdot (2\\pi) \\cdot (+\\infty) = +\\infty$\n\nThe area of the specified pseudosphere is infinite.\n\n<<<B>>>"
