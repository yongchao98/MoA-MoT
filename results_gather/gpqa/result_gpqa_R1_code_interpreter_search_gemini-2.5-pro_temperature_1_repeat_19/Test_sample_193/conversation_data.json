    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the partition function Z for a system of three spins S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1. The total number of possible microstates for the system is 2^3 = 8.\n\nThe energy of the system is given by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J [S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3]\n\nThe partition function Z is defined as the sum over all possible states (microstates) of the Boltzmann factor e^(-βE), where β = 1/(kT).\nZ = Σ_states e^(-βE)\n\nWe need to list all 8 possible microstates, calculate the energy for each state, and then sum their corresponding Boltzmann factors.\n\nLet's list the states (S1, S2, S3) and calculate the term S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 and the energy E for each state.\n\n1.  **All spins up:** (S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1)\n    S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n    E = -J * (3) = -3J\n    This configuration is unique.\n\n2.  **All spins down:** (S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1)\n    S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n    E = -J * (3) = -3J\n    This configuration is also unique.\n    So, we have two states with energy E = -3J. The degeneracy is g1 = 2.\n\n3.  **Two spins up, one spin down:** There are three such configurations:\n    *   (S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1):\n        S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1\n        E = -J * (-1) = J\n    *   (S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1):\n        S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 = (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1\n        E = -J * (-1) = J\n    *   (S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1):\n        S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 = (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1\n        E = -J * (-1) = J\n\n4.  **One spin up, two spins down:** There are three such configurations:\n    *   (S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1):\n        S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 = (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1\n        E = -J * (-1) = J\n    *   (S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1):\n        S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 = (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1\n        E = -J * (-1) = J\n    *   (S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1):\n        S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1\n        E = -J * (-1) = J\n\n    So, we have a total of 3 + 3 = 6 states with energy E = J. The degeneracy is g2 = 6.\n\nNow, we can write the partition function Z by summing the Boltzmann factors for all states. We can group the states by their energy levels:\nZ = Σ_i g_i * e^(-βE_i)\nwhere g_i is the degeneracy of the energy level E_i.\n\nWe have two distinct energy levels:\n*   E1 = -3J with degeneracy g1 = 2\n*   E2 = J with degeneracy g2 = 6\n\nPlugging these values into the formula for the partition function:\nZ = g1 * e^(-βE1) + g2 * e^(-βE2)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(J))\nZ = 2 * e^(3Jβ) + 6 * e^(-Jβ)\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Z= 2e^(2Jβ)+6e^(-2Jβ)\nB) Z= 6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ)\nC) Z= 2 e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ)\nD) Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ)+6e^(Jβ)\n\nOur calculated partition function Z = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ) matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
