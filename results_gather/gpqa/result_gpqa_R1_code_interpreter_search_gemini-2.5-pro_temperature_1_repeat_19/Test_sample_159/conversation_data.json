Thus, the angular position of the m-th minimum is:\nθ_m ≈ (x_m * λ) / (2π * a)\n\nTo find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need the first two non-zero roots of the Bessel function J₁(x).

    "An N-sided regular polygon with an infinitely large number of sides (N -> ∞) approximates a circle. The problem states that the apothem of this polygon is 'a'. As N approaches infinity, the apothem of a regular polygon becomes equal to its circumradius, which is the radius of the limiting circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe diffraction pattern from a circular aperture in the far-field region (Fraunhofer diffraction) is known as the Airy pattern. The intensity minima (dark rings) in this pattern occur at angles θ that satisfy the following condition:\n\n`sin(θ) = x / (k * a)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   `k` is the wave number, given by `k = 2π / λ`.\n*   `x` represents the roots (zeros) of the Bessel function of the first kind, of order one, `J₁(x)`.\n\nSubstituting `k = 2π / λ` into the equation, we get:\n\n`sin(θ) = x * λ / (2π * a)`\n\nThe problem states that we can use the small-angle approximation (`tan θ ≈ θ`, which also implies `sin θ ≈ θ`).

    "The user wants me to solve the problem. The core of the problem is to determine the angular distance between the first two diffraction minima for an aperture that is effectively a circle.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture's Geometry:**\n    *   The aperture is an N-sided regular polygon.\n    *   The number of sides, N, is infinitely large (N → ∞). A regular polygon with an infinite number of sides is a circle.\n    *   The problem states that all apothems have the same length 'a'. The apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of any side. As N → ∞, the length of the apothem becomes equal to the radius of the resulting circle.\n    *   Therefore, the problem simplifies to finding the diffraction pattern from a **circular aperture of radius `a`**.\n\n2.  **Apply Diffraction Theory:**\n    *   When monochromatic light passes through a circular aperture, it produces a diffraction pattern in the far-field (Fraunhofer diffraction) known as the Airy pattern.\n    *   The intensity of this pattern is characterized by a bright central spot (the Airy disk) surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings.\n    *   The dark rings correspond to the minima of the intensity pattern. The angular positions of these minima are given by the formula:\n        `sin(θ_m) = x_m / (k * a)`\n        where:\n        *   `θ_m` is the angular position of the *m*-th minimum.\n        *   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n        *   `k` is the wave number, defined as `k = 2π / λ`.\n        *   `x_m` is the *m*-th non-zero root (zero) of the Bessel function of the first kind, of order one, `J₁(x)`.\n\n3.  **Incorporate the Small-Angle Approximation:**\n    *   The problem states we can assume the angles are small, so `tan(θ) ≈ θ`. For small angles, this also means `sin(θ) ≈ θ`.\n    *   Applying this approximation to the minima condition:\n        `θ_m ≈ x_m / (k * a)`\n    *   Now, substitute `k = 2π / λ`:\n        `θ_m ≈ x_m / ((2π / λ) * a) = (x_m / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Angular Distance:**\n    *   We need the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n    *   This requires the first two non-zero roots of the `J₁(x)` Bessel function.\n        *   First root, `x₁ ≈ 3.8317` (This corresponds to the first dark ring).\n        *   Second root, `x₂ ≈ 7.0156` (This corresponds to the second dark ring).\n    *   Now, we can express the angular distance:\n        `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = [(x₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a)] - [(x₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a)]`\n        `Δθ = [(x₂ - x₁) / (2π)] * (λ / a)`\n\n5.  **Compute the Numerical Coefficient:**\n    *   The final step is to calculate the value of the coefficient `(x₂ - x₁) / (2π)`.\n    *   Using the approximate values for the roots:\n        `Coefficient ≈ (7.0156 - 3.8317) / (2 * π) = 3.1839 / (2 * π)`\n    *   To get a more precise value, we can use a python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import jn_zeros\n\n# Get the first two non-zero roots of the Bessel function J1(x)\n# jn_zeros(n, k) finds the first k positive roots of the Bessel function Jn(x).\n# Here n=1 for J1.\nx1, x2 = jn_zeros(1, 2)\n\n# The angular distance is Delta_theta = (x2 - x1) / (2 * pi) * (lambda / a)\n# We calculate the coefficient for (lambda / a).\ncoefficient = (x2 - x1) / (2 * np.pi)\nprint(coefficient)\n```\n\nThe code execution provides the output `0.5067303993663669`.\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   The calculated coefficient is approximately `0.5067`.\n    *   The angular distance is `Δθ ≈ 0.5067 * (λ / a)`.\n    *   Let's check the given options:\n        A) `1.220 λ / a`\n        B) `0.506 λ / a`\n        C) `0.610 λ / a`\n        D) `0.500 λ / a`\n    *   Our calculated value `0.5067` is closest to `0.506`.
