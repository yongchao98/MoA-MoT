    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Process:** The problem describes a hydrogen atom decaying from the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state. This decay is not a single transition because it would violate the selection rules. It occurs via an intermediate state through two consecutive electric dipole (E1) transitions. This type of decay is called a cascade decay.\n\n2.  **Recall Electric Dipole (E1) Selection Rules:** For an E1 transition to be allowed, the quantum numbers must change according to the following rules:\n    *   Change in the principal quantum number, n: Δn = any integer.\n    *   Change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, l: Δl = ±1.\n    *   Change in the magnetic quantum number, m: Δm = 0, ±1.\n\n3.  **Analyze the First Transition:**\n    *   Initial state: |i> = |3,0,0> (n=3, l=0, m=0).\n    *   Intermediate state: |k> = |n', l', m'>.\n    *   Applying the selection rules to the initial state:\n        *   Δl = ±1  => l' must be 1 (since the initial l is 0).\n        *   Δm = 0, ±1 => m' can be 0, +1, or -1 (since the initial m is 0).\n        *   For a decay, the energy must decrease, so the principal quantum number n must decrease. The intermediate state cannot have n=3 or n>3. Also, for l'=1, we must have n' ≥ 2. So, n' must be 2.\n    *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, and |2,1,1>.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Second Transition:**\n    *   Intermediate state: |k> = |2,1,m'> (where m' can be -1, 0, or 1).\n    *   Final state: |f> = |1,0,0> (n=1, l=0, m=0).\n    *   Let's check if the transition from |2,1,m'> to |1,0,0> is allowed:\n        *   Δl = l_final - l_intermediate = 0 - 1 = -1. This satisfies Δl = ±1.\n        *   Δm = m_final - m_intermediate = 0 - m'.\n            *   If m'=0, Δm=0. Allowed.\n            *   If m'=1, Δm=-1. Allowed.\n            *   If m'=-1, Δm=+1. Allowed.\n    *   All three possible intermediate states can decay to the final state |1,0,0>. This also happens to be the only possible decay channel for the |2,1,m'> state (the 2p state), as it can only decay to an n=1 state, which must have l=0. So, once the atom reaches any of the |2,1,m'> states, it will decay to |1,0,0> with a probability of 1.\n\n5.  **Determine the Possible Transition Routes:** Based on the analysis above, there are three possible routes for the cascade decay:\n    *   Route 1: |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>\n    *   Route 2: |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>\n    *   Route 3: |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>\n\n6.  **Calculate the Transition Probabilities (Branching Ratios):**\n    The probability of taking a specific route is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition, since the second transition happens with probability 1. We need to find the probability of the atom in the |3,0,0> state decaying into each of the three possible |2,1,m'> states.\n\n    The transition rate Γ is proportional to the square of the dipole matrix element: Γ ∝ |<n',l',m'| **d** |n,l,m>|², where **d** is the electric dipole operator.\n\n    A key physical principle is that of rotational symmetry. The initial state |3,0,0> is spherically symmetric (its wavefunction does not depend on the angles θ and φ). The Hamiltonian of the hydrogen atom is also spherically symmetric. There is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the decay must be isotropic, meaning it must proceed to each of the possible final m' states with equal probability. Any other result would imply that the arbitrary choice of the z-axis had a physical consequence, which is impossible.\n\n    Since there are three equally likely channels for the first decay step (|2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, |2,1,1>), the probability for each channel is 1/3.\n\n    *   P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) = 1/3\n    *   P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) = 1/3\n    *   P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) = 1/3\n\n    The overall probability for a given cascade path is the product of the probabilities of each step.\n    *   Probability(Route 1) = P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,0>) × P(|2,1,0> → |1,0,0>) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n    *   Probability(Route 2) = P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,1>) × P(|2,1,1> → |1,0,0>) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n    *   Probability(Route 3) = P(|3,0,0> → |2,1,-1>) × P(|2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>) = (1/3) × 1 = 1/3.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3. This matches our result for Route 1.\n    *   B) Typo, but probability is 2/3. Incorrect.\n    *   C) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4. The route is possible, but the probability is incorrect.\n    *   D) |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4. The route is possible, but the probability is incorrect.\n\nThe only option that presents a valid route with the correct corresponding probability is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
