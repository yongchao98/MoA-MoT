    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed $v_{max}$ of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n1.  **Identify the conserved quantity:** In a system with a conservative force, the total energy is conserved. For a relativistic particle moving in a potential $U(x)$, the total energy $E_{total}$ is the sum of its relativistic energy and its potential energy.\n    The relativistic energy of a particle with mass $m$ and speed $v$ is $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor and $c$ is the speed of light.\n    The potential energy for a spring obeying Hooke's law ($F=-kx$) is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n    Therefore, the total conserved energy of the system is:\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$\n\n2.  **Analyze the system at two key points:** The motion of the harmonic oscillator is between the maximum amplitude points $x = -A$ and $x = +A$. The speed is maximum at the equilibrium position $x=0$. We can apply the conservation of energy between the point of maximum amplitude and the equilibrium point.\n\n    *   **At the point of maximum amplitude (e.g., $x = A$):**\n        The mass is momentarily at rest, so its speed is $v = 0$.\n        The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n        The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$\n\n    *   **At the equilibrium position ($x = 0$):**\n        The speed of the mass is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n        The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n        The potential energy is zero: $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n        The total energy at this point is:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n3.  **Apply the principle of conservation of energy:** The total energy at the maximum amplitude must equal the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n    $mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max}mc^2$\n\n4.  **Solve for the maximum Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_{max}$:**\n    Divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2}{mc^2}$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n5.  **Solve for the maximum speed, $v_{max}$:**\n    Now, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$, and substitute the expression we found for $\\gamma_{max}$.\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n    To solve for $v_{max}$, we first invert both sides:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n    Next, square both sides of the equation:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Rearrange the terms to isolate $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\n    Finally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:** The derived expression for $v_{max}$ matches option A.\n\n    A) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n    B) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$\n    C) $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$ (This is the non-relativistic limit)\n    D) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$\n\nThe correct answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
