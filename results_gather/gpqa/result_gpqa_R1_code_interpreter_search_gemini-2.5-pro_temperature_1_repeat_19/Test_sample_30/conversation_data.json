    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the structure of product 3 and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is the electrophilic aromatic nitration of toluene.\n*   **Reactant:** Toluene (C₆H₅CH₃). The methyl group (-CH₃) is an ortho-, para-directing and activating group.\n*   **Reagents:** A mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO₃) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), known as \"mixed acid,\" is the standard reagent for nitration.\n*   **Product 1:** The reaction yields a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. Due to less steric hindrance, the major product is **para-nitrotoluene (p-nitrotoluene)**.\n\n    Structure of Product 1 (p-nitrotoluene):\n    A benzene ring with a methyl group (-CH₃) and a nitro group (-NO₂) in positions 1 and 4 (para) respectively.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is an oxidation reaction.\n*   **Reactant:** p-Nitrotoluene.\n*   **Reagents:** Manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Analysis:** MnO₂ is often used as a mild oxidizing agent to convert benzylic alcohols to aldehydes. While it typically does not oxidize a benzylic methyl group on its own, the presence of strong acid (H₂SO₄) creates a more powerful oxidizing medium. In the context of a multi-step synthesis problem, where the next step involves reaction with a ketone and base, it is most logical that the methyl group is oxidized to an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid. Oxidation to a carboxylic acid would require a stronger agent like KMnO₄ and would result in a product (p-nitrobenzoic acid) that is unreactive in the next step. Therefore, the benzylic methyl group is oxidized to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n*   **Product 2:** The product is **para-nitrobenzaldehyde (p-nitrobenzaldehyde)**.\n\n    Structure of Product 2 (p-nitrobenzaldehyde):\n    A benzene ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) and a nitro group (-NO₂) in para positions.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide.**\n*   **Reaction:** This is a base-catalyzed crossed-aldol condensation, specifically known as the **Claisen-Schmidt condensation**.\n*   **Reactants:** p-Nitrobenzaldehyde (an aromatic aldehyde with no α-hydrogens) and acetone ((CH₃)₂C=O, a ketone with α-hydrogens).\n*   **Reagent:** Aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH) acts as the base.\n*   **Mechanism:** The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) removes an acidic α-hydrogen from acetone to form an enolate nucleophile. This enolate then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde. The resulting aldol addition product quickly dehydrates (loses a molecule of water) under the reaction conditions to form a stable, conjugated system.\n*   **Product 3:** The final product is an α,β-unsaturated ketone. Due to sterics, the more stable trans (E) isomer is predominantly formed. The product is **(E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\n    Structure of Product 3:\n    `O₂N - C₆H₄ - CH=CH - C(=O) - CH₃`\n    (The nitro group is para on the phenyl ring, and the double bond has trans geometry).\n\n**Determining the Molecular Symmetry Group of Product 3**\n\nNow, we need to find the point group for (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n1.  **Draw the molecule:**\n          NO₂\n           |\n          / \\\n        //   \\\\\n       C-----C\n      / \\   / \\\n     C---C---C---H\n      \\ /   \\ /  \\\\\n       C-----C     C\n        \\   /     /\n         C=C     H\n        /   \\\n       H     C=O\n            /\n          CH₃\n\n2.  **Identify symmetry elements:**\n    *   **Rotation Axes (Cₙ):** There are no rotation axes (other than the trivial C₁). The molecule is not symmetric enough for a C₂ or higher axis.\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** There is no center of inversion. For example, the nitro group does not have an equivalent group at the opposite point through the center of the molecule.\n    *   **Improper Rotation Axes (Sₙ):** There are no improper rotation axes.\n    *   **Mirror Plane (σ):** The molecule is largely planar. The benzene ring, the nitro group, the `C=C` double bond, the carbonyl group (`C=O`), and the α-carbon of the methyl group can all lie in a single plane. If we consider a conformation where one C-H bond of the methyl group is also in this plane, this plane becomes a mirror plane (σ) for the entire molecule, reflecting the two other hydrogens of the methyl group into each other.\n\n3.  **Assign the Point Group:**\n    *   A molecule that possesses only the identity element (E) and a single mirror plane (σ) belongs to the **Cₛ** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of product 3 is Cₛ.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) D₂h\nB) C₂h\nC) Cₛ\nD) C₃\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
