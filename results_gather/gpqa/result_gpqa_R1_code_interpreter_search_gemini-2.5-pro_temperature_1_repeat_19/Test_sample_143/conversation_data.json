    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the mean decay distance (also known as decay length) of a meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Total energy of the particle, $E_X = 8 \\, \\text{GeV}$.\n    *   Rest mass of the particle, $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}$.\n    *   Decay width of the particle, $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\, \\text{MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Recall Relevant Physical Formulas:**\n    *   The mean decay distance, $L$, is the product of the particle's velocity ($v$) and its mean lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{lab}$):\n        $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$\n    *   The lifetime in the lab frame is related to the lifetime in the particle's rest frame ($\\tau_{rest}$) by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$ (time dilation):\n        $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_{rest}$\n    *   The rest lifetime is related to the decay width, $\\Gamma$, by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n        $\\tau_{rest} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$ where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   Combining these, we get:\n        $L = v \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n    *   From relativistic mechanics, the momentum $p$ is given by $p = \\gamma m v$. This can be rearranged to $v\\gamma = p/m$.\n    *   Substituting this into the equation for L:\n        $L = \\frac{p}{m} \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n    *   To work with more convenient units (like GeV), we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c^2$ and $c$ where appropriate:\n        $L = \\frac{p c}{m c^2} \\cdot c \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma} = \\frac{p c}{m c^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n    *   This final formula is very useful as we can plug in values in terms of GeV.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Necessary Quantities:**\n    *   First, we need the momentum of the particle, or more conveniently, $pc$. We can find this from the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n        $(pc)^2 = E^2 - (mc^2)^2$\n        $pc = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}$\n        $pc = \\sqrt{(8 \\, \\text{GeV})^2 - (1.2 \\, \\text{GeV})^2} = \\sqrt{64 - 1.44} \\, \\text{GeV} = \\sqrt{62.56} \\, \\text{GeV}$.\n    *   The decay width needs to be in GeV to be consistent with other units:\n        $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\, \\text{MeV} = 0.320 \\, \\text{GeV}$.\n    *   We need the value of the physical constant $\\hbar c$. In particle physics units:\n        $\\hbar c \\approx 1.97327 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{GeV} \\cdot \\text{m}$.\n\n5.  **Substitute the values into the formula for L:**\n    $L = \\frac{\\sqrt{62.56} \\, \\text{GeV}}{1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}} \\cdot \\frac{1.97327 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{GeV} \\cdot \\text{m}}{0.320 \\, \\text{GeV}}$\n\n6.  **Perform the calculation:**\nTo ensure precision, let's use a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\nE_X = 8.0  # GeV\nm_X_c2 = 1.2  # GeV\nGamma_X_MeV = 320.0  # MeV\n\n# Convert Gamma to GeV\nGamma_X_GeV = Gamma_X_MeV / 1000.0\n\n# Physical constant hbar*c in GeV*m\nhbar_c_GeV_m = 1.973269804e-16\n\n# Calculate pc from the relativistic energy-momentum relation\npc = math.sqrt(E_X**2 - m_X_c2**2)\n\n# Calculate the mean decay distance L using the formula L = (pc / mc^2) * (hbar*c / Gamma)\nmean_decay_distance = (pc / m_X_c2) * (hbar_c_GeV_m / Gamma_X_GeV)\n\n# Print the final result in scientific notation\nprint(f\"{mean_decay_distance:.4e}\")\n```\n<execute_code>\n4.0645e-15\n</execute_code>\n\n7.  **Compare the Result with the Given Options:**\n    *   The calculated mean decay distance is $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$.\n    *   Let's look at the options:\n        A) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\n        B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n        C) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\n        D) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\n    *   The calculated value $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$ is extremely close to option B, $4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$. The minor difference (about 0.025%) is likely due to the precision of the constants used to create the problem options.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the mean decay distance (also known as the decay length) of a particle X in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   Total energy of the particle in the lab frame: $E_X = 8 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n    *   Rest mass of the particle: $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n    *   Decay width of the particle: $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n\n3.  **Formulate the Physics Plan:**\n    *   The mean decay distance, $L$, is the distance the particle travels on average before decaying. In the lab frame, this is given by the product of its velocity ($v$) and its mean lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{\\text{lab}}$):\n        $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{lab}}$\n    *   Due to relativistic time dilation, the lifetime in the lab frame is longer than the lifetime in the particle's own rest frame ($\\tau_{\\text{rest}}$). The relationship is given by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n        $\\tau_{\\text{lab}} = \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{rest}}$\n    *   The lifetime in the rest frame is related to the decay width ($\\Gamma$) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle ($\\Delta E \\Delta t \\approx \\hbar$). For a particle decay, this becomes:\n        $\\tau_{\\text{rest}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n        where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   Combining these equations, we get:\n        $L = v \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n    *   The term $v \\gamma$ can be related to the particle's momentum ($p$) and mass ($m$) through the definition of relativistic momentum, $p = \\gamma m v$. This gives $v \\gamma = p/m$.\n    *   Substituting this into our expression for $L$:\n        $L = \\frac{p}{m} \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n    *   To work with standard particle physics units (like GeV), it is most convenient to write the formula using $pc$, $mc^2$, and $\\hbar c$:\n        $L = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation Steps:**\n\n    *   **Step i: Unit Conversion.**\n        All units should be consistent.
