    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Chemistry**\n\nThe problem involves dissolving a sparingly soluble base, iron(III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)3), in a strong monobasic acid (let's call it HA). Fe(OH)3 is a solid that doesn't dissolve well in water. To dissolve it, we need to add an acid, which will react with the hydroxide ions (OH-) from the Fe(OH)3, shifting the equilibrium towards the dissolved state.\n\nThe overall chemical reaction is:\nFe(OH)3(s) + 3H+(aq) → Fe3+(aq) + 3H2O(l)\n\nThis equation tells us that for every 1 mole of solid Fe(OH)3 we want to dissolve, we need 3 moles of hydrogen ions (H+).\n\n**2. The Concept of \"Minimum Volume\"**\n\nThe term \"minimum volume\" implies that we need just enough acid to react with all the Fe(OH)3. However, simply providing the exact stoichiometric amount of H+ will not be enough to completely dissolve the solid. The dissolution is governed by the solubility product constant, Ksp.\n\nThe dissolution equilibrium is:\nFe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe3+(aq) + 3OH-(aq)\nKsp = [Fe3+][OH-]^3\n\nFor the solid to be considered \"dissolved\", the ion product (Qsp = [Fe3+][OH-]^3) must be less than or equal to Ksp. The condition for complete dissolution is when the ion product is exactly equal to Ksp.\n\n**3. Gather the Necessary Data**\n\n*   Mass of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g\n*   Total volume of the solution = 100 cm3 = 0.1 L\n*   Concentration of the strong acid = 0.1 M\n*   We need the molar mass of Fe(OH)3 and its Ksp value at 25°C.\n    *   Molar mass of Fe = 55.845 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of O = 15.999 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of H = 1.008 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of Fe(OH)3 = 55.845 + 3*(15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol\n    *   The solubility product constant (Ksp) for Fe(OH)3 at 25°C is approximately 2.79 x 10^-39.\n\n**4. Calculations**\n\n**Step 4a: Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3.**\nMoles = Mass / Molar Mass\nMoles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 9.3575 x 10^-4 mol\n\n**Step 4b: Calculate the concentration of Fe3+ in the final solution.**\nWhen all the Fe(OH)3 dissolves in the 100 cm3 (0.1 L) solution, the concentration of Fe3+ will be:\n[Fe3+] = Moles / Volume = (9.3575 x 10^-4 mol) / 0.1 L = 9.3575 x 10^-3 M\n\n**Step 4c: Calculate the equilibrium concentration of H+ required.**\nWe use the Ksp expression to find the maximum [OH-] allowed in the solution for the Fe3+ to remain dissolved.\nKsp = [Fe3+][OH-]^3\n2.79 x 10^-39 = (9.3575 x 10^-3) * [OH-]^3\n[OH-]^3 = (2.79 x 10^-39) / (9.3575 x 10^-3) ≈ 2.9818 x 10^-37\n[OH-] = (2.9818 x 10^-37)^(1/3) ≈ 6.680 x 10^-13 M\n\nNow, we use the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10^-14 at 25°C) to find the concentration of H+ at equilibrium.\n[H+]_equilibrium = Kw / [OH-] = (1.0 x 10^-14) / (6.680 x 10^-13 M) ≈ 0.01497 M\n\n**Step 4d: Calculate the pH of the resulting solution.**\nThe pH is determined by this equilibrium concentration of H+.\npH = -log10([H+]_equilibrium)\npH = -log10(0.01497) ≈ 2.82\n\nLet's check the options. pH 2.82 is closest to 2.69 (Option A). This suggests our approach is on the right track. Let's proceed to calculate the required volume of acid.\n\n**Step 4e: Calculate the total moles of H+ needed.**\nThe total amount of acid we add serves two purposes:\n1.  Reacting with the Fe(OH)3.\n2.  Establishing the final equilibrium concentration of H+ in the solution.\n\nMoles of H+ for reaction = 3 * (Moles of Fe(OH)3)\nMoles of H+ for reaction = 3 * (9.3575 x 10^-4 mol) ≈ 2.8073 x 10^-3 mol\n\nMoles of H+ for equilibrium = [H+]_equilibrium * Total Volume\nMoles of H+ for equilibrium = (0.01497 M) * (0.1 L) = 1.497 x 10^-3 mol\n\nTotal moles of H+ needed = (2.8073 x 10^-3) + (1.497 x 10^-3) = 4.3043 x 10^-3 mol\n\n**Step 4f: Calculate the minimum volume of the 0.1 M acid.**\nThe moles of H+ come from the strong acid we add.\nVolume of acid = Total moles of H+ / Concentration of acid\nVolume of acid = (4.3043 x 10^-3 mol) / 0.1 M = 0.043043 L\n\nTo convert this to cm³, we multiply by 1000.\nVolume of acid = 0.043043 L * 1000 cm³/L = 43.04 cm³\n\n**5. Re-evaluation and Conclusion**\n\nOur calculated values are pH ≈ 2.82 and Volume ≈ 43.04 cm³. These values do not perfectly match any of the options. Let's re-examine the provided options.\n\nA) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\nB) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³\nC) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³\nD) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³\n\nThere might be a discrepancy due to the Ksp value used in the problem's source material, or a potential oversimplification is expected. If we work backwards from option A:\n\n*   If pH = 2.69, then [H+] = 10^-2.69 ≈ 0.0204 M.\n*   Total moles of H+ needed = (moles for reaction) + (moles for equilibrium)\n    *   Moles for equilibrium = 0.0204 M * 0.1 L = 0.00204 mol\n    *   Moles for reaction = 0.002807 mol (this is fixed)\n    *   Total moles H+ = 0.002807 + 0.00204 = 0.004847 mol\n*   Volume of acid = 0.004847 mol / 0.1 M = 0.04847 L = 48.47 cm³\n\nThis volume (48.47 cm³) does not match the 30.09 cm³ in option A.\n\nLet's reconsider the possibility of hydrolysis of Fe3+, which is a weak acid:\nFe3+ + H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)2+ + H+\n\nThis reaction produces *more* H+, meaning we would need *less* initial acid to reach the target pH. Given the complexity and the discrepancy, it's highly likely that the problem expects a simpler interpretation where the excess acid required to maintain the low pH is ignored, and the pH is calculated from the stoichiometry of dissolving a related, slightly different iron compound or a different Ksp value was used.\n\nHowever, based on a rigorous application of chemical principles with standard data, none of the options are a perfect match. Option A has the closest pH value to our calculated result (2.69 vs. 2.82). The significant discrepancy in the calculated volume across all options suggests a potential flaw in the problem statement or the provided choices. Given the available options, option A is the most plausible answer, primarily based on the pH calculation.\n\nLet's assume the question intended to neglect the H+ needed for equilibrium, which is chemically incorrect but a common simplification in some contexts.\nMoles H+ ≈ Moles for reaction = 0.002807 mol\nVolume ≈ 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³.\nThis matches the volume in option D. Let's check the pH for option D. pH 2.04 means [H+] = 10^-2.04 = 0.00912 M. This is not consistent.\n\nLet's stick with the most chemically sound approach. Our calculated pH of 2.82 is closest to 2.69.\n\n<<<A>>>"
