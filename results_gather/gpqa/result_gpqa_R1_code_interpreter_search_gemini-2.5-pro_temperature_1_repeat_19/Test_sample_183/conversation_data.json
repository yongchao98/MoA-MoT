    "This is a complex multi-step synthesis problem. The goal is to find the correct sequence of reactions to produce 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. The final product has three adjacent substituents (-OEt, -tBu, -NO2 at positions C1, C2, and C3, respectively). This substitution pattern is difficult to achieve with standard electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions, as the directing effects of the groups often do not favor such an arrangement. Syntheses like this typically require a more sophisticated strategy involving blocking groups and functional group interconversions.\n\nLet's break down the required transformations and analyze the options.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   Substituents: Ethoxy (-OEt), tert-Butyl (-tBu), Nitro (-NO2)\n*   Positions: 1, 2, 3 (all adjacent)\n*   Directing Effects:\n    *   -OEt: Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -tBu: Moderate activator, *ortho, para*-director (bulky).\n    *   -NO2: Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n\nA plausible strategy to create a crowded 1,2,3-substituted ring involves these key ideas:\n1.  **Blocking Group:** Use a group like sulfonic acid (-SO3H) to block a reactive position (usually *para*) to force substitution elsewhere (e.g., *ortho*). The -SO3H group is ideal because it can be easily added (sulfonation) and later removed (desulfonation).\n2.  **Amino Group as Director:** An amino group (-NH2), usually introduced by nitration followed by reduction, is a very strong activating *ortho, para*-director. It can be used to control the position of other substituents.\n3.  **Functional Group Interconversion:** The amino group can be converted into many other functional groups via a diazonium salt (-N2+). For this problem, we need to convert it to an ethoxy group (-OEt), which is done by converting the diazonium salt to a phenol (-OH) and then performing a Williamson ether synthesis.\n\nNow let's analyze the given options by checking for fatal flaws or incorrect chemical logic.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...` This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation (step iii) on aniline (product of step ii). Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on anilines because the basic amino group complexes with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring. This is a fatal flaw.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...` This sequence attempts to perform diazotization (step iv) on a molecule that does not contain an amino group. The product after step iii is a nitro-sulfonic acid derivative. Diazotization requires a primary aromatic amine. This is a fatal flaw.\n\n*   **Option C:** `... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...` This sequence attempts to react a diazonium salt (product of step v) with a nitrating mixture. Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable; they would not survive these conditions and this is not a standard method to nitrate the ring. This is a fatal flaw as written.\n\n*   **Option A:** `... iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ...` This sequence involves the nitration of an aniline derivative. While direct nitration of unprotected anilines is often problematic (leading to oxidation and/or forming the anilinium ion which is a *meta*-director), it is not a fundamentally impossible reaction, unlike the flaws in options B, C, and D. If the aniline is first protected (e.g., via acetylation), nitration can proceed in a controlled manner. Although the sequence shown doesn't explicitly mention a protection step, it is the only option that does not contain an unequivocally incorrect transformation. The steps `viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4` at the end are nonsensical, suggesting there are typos in the option's construction.\n\n**Revisiting Option C with a Corrected, Plausible Pathway:**\nDespite the apparent fatal flaw in Option C as written, the *reagents* listed in it are the most suitable for a logical synthesis of a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene, albeit with the steps in the wrong order. A correct synthesis would look like this:\n\n1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n2.  `ii) SO3/H2SO4`: Block the *para* position → **4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n3.  `iii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration is forced to the *ortho* position → **4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n4.  `iv) Fe/HCl`: Reduce the nitro group → **2-Amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n5.  `vi) HNO3/H2SO4`: This is the crucial second nitration. The powerful directing effects of the -NH2, -tBu, and -SO3H groups concertedly direct the new -NO2 group to the C3 position → **2-Amino-3-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n6.  `viii) dilute H2SO4`: Remove the blocking sulfonic acid group → **3-Nitro-4-tert-butylaniline**.\n7.  `v) NaNO2/HCl`: Convert the amino group to a diazonium salt.\n8.  `vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat`: Convert the diazonium salt to a phenol.\n9.  `ix) NaOH/EtBr`: Convert the phenol to an ethoxy ether via Williamson synthesis.\n\nThis logical sequence, constructed using the reagents from option C, leads to **4-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**. This is an isomer of the target molecule. Given that all options are flawed as written and this is a multiple-choice question, it is highly probable that there is an error in the target name or the options provided. However, the strategy embodied by the reagents in Option C is the most advanced and chemically sound approach for generating a complex polysubstituted benzene of this type. The flaws in B and D are more fundamental than the likely sequence error in C. Therefore, C is the most probable intended answer, representing a correct strategy with typos in the sequence.\n\n<<<C>>>"
