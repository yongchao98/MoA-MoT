    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of each gene individually.**\n    *   The wild-type (WT) control has 100% resistance. This is our baseline.\n    *   The `g1` mutant (G1 knock-out) has 75% resistance. This means gene G1 is responsible for some part of the resistance, but its absence is not completely debilitating. The loss of G1 function causes a 25% drop in resistance.\n    *   The `g3` mutant (G3 knock-out) has 50% resistance. Gene G3 contributes more to resistance than G1. Its loss causes a 50% drop in resistance.\n    *   The `g2` mutant (G2 knock-out) has 0% resistance. This means gene G2 is absolutely essential for any resistance to occur. The loss of G2 function eliminates resistance entirely.\n\n2.  **Analyze the double mutants to understand gene interactions.**\n    *   **`g1g2` and `g2g3` mutants:** Both have 0% resistance. The phenotype of the `g2` single mutant (0% resistance) is identical to the phenotype of the `g1g2` and `g2g3` double mutants. When the phenotype of a single mutant (like `g2`) masks the phenotype of another single mutant (like `g1` or `g3`) in a double-mutant combination, this is called **epistasis**. Specifically, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. In a genetic pathway, an upstream gene is often epistatic to downstream genes. Since the problem states at least one gene is a transcription factor (a type of upstream regulator), G2 is the strongest candidate for this role. Its knockout shuts down the entire resistance pathway, regardless of what G1 or G3 are doing.\n    *   **`g1g3` mutant:** This double mutant has 10% resistance. Let's compare this to what we would expect if the genes acted independently (an additive effect).\n        *   Loss from g1: 25%\n        *   Loss from g3: 50%\n        *   Expected additive loss: 25% + 50% = 75%\n        *   Expected resistance if additive: 100% - 75% = 25%\n    *   The observed resistance is 10%, which is significantly lower than the expected 25%. This means the combined loss of G1 and G3 has a much stronger effect than simply adding their individual effects. This is known as a **synergistic interaction**. Synergy often occurs when two genes function in parallel or partially redundant pathways that contribute to the same outcome. When one pathway is disabled, the other can still provide a significant level of function. When both are disabled, the system collapses more than expected. Therefore, the term **gene redundancy** is an appropriate way to describe the relationship between G1 and G3.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the given options based on the analysis.**\n\n    *   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Plausible and strongly supported.\n        *   `G1 and G3 show pleiotropy`: Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. This experiment only measures one trait (resistance), so there is no evidence for pleiotropy.\n        *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: False. The double mutant phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g1` mutant phenotype (75%).\n\n    *   **B) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1**\n        *   `G1 is a transcription factor`: Unlikely. The `g1` mutant has a relatively mild effect compared to the `g2` mutant.\n        *   `G2 and G3 show pleiotropy`: No evidence.\n        *   `G2 is epistatic towards G1`: This part is true, but the first statement is likely false.\n\n    *   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Plausible.\n        *   `G1 and G3 has the same promoter`: There is no evidence for this specific molecular arrangement in the data.\n        *   `G3 is epistatic towards G1`: False. The double mutant phenotype (10%) is not the same as the `g3` mutant phenotype (50%).\n\n    *   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**\n        *   `G2 is a transcription factor`: Plausible and strongly supported by G2's essential role and its epistasis over G1 and G3.\n        *   `G1 and G3 show gene redundancy`: Correct. The synergistic interaction in the `g1g3` mutant is characteristic of redundant or parallel pathways.\n        *   `G1 is epistatic towards G3`: This specific statement is technically incorrect by the classical definition of masking. However, epistasis can broadly refer to any non-additive gene interaction, which is what we observe. Compared to the other options, this one contains the two most accurate and significant conclusions from the experiment. The other options contain definitively incorrect statements (pleiotropy) or unsubstantiated claims (same promoter).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOption D provides the best description of the genetic relationships. It correctly identifies G2 as the likely transcription factor due to its epistatic and essential nature, and it correctly describes the G1-G3 interaction as synergistic, which is a form of gene redundancy. Despite the imprecise wording of the final clause (\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\"), this option is the most accurate overall.\n\n<<<D>>>"
