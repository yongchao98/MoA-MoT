    "This problem involves the reaction of an aryl halide with a strong base (NaNH2), which proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   Substrate: 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position C1 and a deuterium atom (D) at position C2.\n    *   Reagent: Sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia (NH3). NaNH2 is a very strong base.\n    *   Reaction Mechanism: The reaction of an aryl halide that lacks strong electron-withdrawing groups with a strong base like NaNH2 proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. The mechanism has two main steps: elimination to form the benzyne, followed by the addition of a nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The amide ion (NH2⁻) acts as a base and removes a proton (or deuteron) from one of the positions *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine leaving group. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, the ortho positions are C2 and C6.\n\n    *   **Path A: Abstraction of a proton (H) from C6.**\n        *   The NH2⁻ base removes the proton from C6.\n        *   The resulting carbanion at C6 rapidly eliminates the bromide ion from C1.\n        *   This forms a benzyne intermediate where the new triple bond is between C1 and C6.\n        *   The deuterium atom at C2 is unaffected in this pathway. The intermediate is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n        *   (Note: Due to the kinetic isotope effect, abstraction of the lighter isotope (H) is faster than the heavier one (D). So, this pathway is expected to be the major one, but the other pathway is still possible).\n\n    *   **Path B: Abstraction of a deuteron (D) from C2.**\n        *   The NH2⁻ base removes the deuteron from C2.\n        *   The resulting carbanion at C2 eliminates the bromide ion from C1.\n        *   This forms a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C2.\n        *   In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The resulting intermediate is the normal, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\n    Therefore, two different benzyne intermediates are formed in the reaction mixture.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The amide ion (NH2⁻) also acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the two carbon atoms of the benzyne triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n    *   **Products from 3-deuteriobenzyne (from Path A):**\n        *   This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C6, and a deuterium at C2.\n        *   **Attack at C1:** If NH2⁻ attacks C1, a negative charge forms at C6. Protonation of C6 by NH3 yields a product with the -NH2 group at the original C1 position and the deuterium at the original C2 position. This product is **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6:** If NH2⁻ attacks C6, a negative charge forms at C1. Protonation of C1 yields a product with the -NH2 group at the original C6 position and the deuterium at the original C2 position. When naming this as a substituted aniline, the carbon bearing the -NH2 group is C1. The original C2 is now three carbons away, at position C3. Thus, this product is **3-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   Path A leads to two distinct products: 2-deuterioaniline and 3-deuterioaniline.\n\n    *   **Products from benzyne (from Path B):**\n        *   This intermediate has a triple bond between C1 and C2 and has no deuterium.\n        *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Whether the NH2⁻ attacks C1 or C2, the subsequent protonation leads to the same single product: **aniline** (C₆H₅NH₂), which is not deuterated.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    By considering both possible elimination pathways and the subsequent addition steps, we find three distinct possible organic products:\n    1.  Aniline (from Path B)\n    2.  2-deuterioaniline (from Path A)\n    3.  3-deuterioaniline (from Path A)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
