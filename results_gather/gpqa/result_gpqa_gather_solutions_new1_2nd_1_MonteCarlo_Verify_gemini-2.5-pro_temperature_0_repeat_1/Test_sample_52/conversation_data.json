  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nYou have prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.\n\nA) C11H14O2\nB) C12H12O2\nC) C12H14O2\nD) C11H12O2\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nBased on the successful execution of the Python script, which enumerates and prunes hypotheses, we can determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n### Summary of Reasoning\n\n1.  **Initial Hypotheses:** The script started with the four provided chemical formulas as candidates: C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, and C12H14O2.\n\n2.  **Constraint Analysis & Filtering:** The script applies constraints derived from the spectroscopic data to filter these candidates.\n    *   **Structural Fragments:** The analysis of the FTIR and ¹H NMR data identifies several key fragments:\n        *   A di-substituted benzene ring: **C₆H₄**\n        *   An ester group: **-COO-**\n        *   A propenyl group (**-CH=CH-CH₃**), identified by the characteristic vinyl signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets). This fragment is **C₃H₅**.\n        *   A second methyl group, which must be part of the ester to satisfy the \"no -CH₂-\" constraint (e.g., a methyl ester, **-COOCH₃**).\n    *   **Constraint 1: Atom Count:** By summing the atoms from the required fragments (C₆H₄ + C₃H₅ + -COOCH₃), the script determines the only possible molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n        *   Carbons: 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 1 (carbonyl) + 1 (ester methyl) = 11\n        *   Hydrogens: 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (ester methyl) = 12\n        *   Oxygens: 2 (ester)\n    *   **Constraint 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The structure requires a DBE of 6 (4 for the aromatic ring, 1 for the vinyl C=C, 1 for the ester C=O).\n        *   C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DBE = 6 (Pass)\n        *   C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DBE = 5 (Fail)\n        *   C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DBE = 7 (Fail)\n        *   C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DBE = 6 (Pass, but fails the next constraint)\n    *   **Constraint 3: No -CH₂- groups:** This is the final, critical filter. The formula C₁₂H₁₄O₂ has an extra CH₂ group compared to the derived C₁₁H₁₂O₂. Any structure with this formula that also contains the other required fragments would necessarily include a -CH₂- group (e.g., as an ethyl ester), which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n\n3.  **Surviving Candidate:** After applying all constraints, only one candidate, **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**, remains. This formula perfectly matches all the provided spectroscopic information.\n\n### Final Choice\n\nThe only formula consistent with all the data is C₁₁H₁₂O₂. This corresponds to option D in the question's list.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula from the provided options.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Framework and Functional Groups:**\n    *   The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This means it is a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by other groups. The core of this structure is therefore a **C₆H₄** fragment.\n    *   The FTIR spectrum shows an \"ester group.\" This indicates the presence of a **-COO-** functional group, which accounts for the **two oxygen atoms** present in all the formula options.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H:** The C₆H₄ fragment has four protons. The fact that they appear as only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, such as para (1,4) substitution. This confirms the **4 hydrogens** on the aromatic ring.\n    *   **Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (into a doublet) and the three methyl protons (into a quartet), giving a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is split only by the first vinyl proton, giving a doublet. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅**.\n    *   **Two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups:** This indicates two chemically distinct methyl groups. One is already accounted for in the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH₃**). The second methyl group must be part of the ester.\n    *   **No signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical constraint. For the ester group to contain the second methyl group but no -CH₂- group, it must be a methyl ester (**-COOCH₃**). An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃), for example, is ruled out.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula:**\n    Now, we sum the atoms from all the identified fragments to determine the total molecular formula:\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄\n    *   **Propenyl Group:** C₃H₅\n    *   **Methyl Ester Group:** -COOCH₃ (This adds C₂H₃O₂ to the rest of the molecule, but to avoid double-counting, let's sum the individual atoms: 1 Carbonyl Carbon, 1 Methyl Carbon, 3 Methyl Hydrogens, 2 Oxygens)\n\n    Let's sum the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 1 (from the ester's C=O) + 1 (from the ester's -OCH₃) = **11 carbons**.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from the ester's -OCH₃) = **12 hydrogens**.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from the ester's -COO-) = **2 oxygens**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The molecular formula derived from a complete analysis of the spectral data is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This formula is fully consistent with all the provided information, including the absence of -CH₂- groups.\n\n    Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\n    B) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\n    C) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n    D) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\n\n    The correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo determine the correct chemical formula, we must systematically analyze the structural fragments indicated by the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structure and Functional Groups:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by substituents. The core fragment is therefore C₆H₄.\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group, which accounts for the two oxygen atoms in all the given options.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum in Detail:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** This is consistent with the four protons on the C₆H₄ ring. The presence of only two signals often suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, like para (1,4) substitution.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a highly characteristic splitting pattern that points unambiguously to a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by both the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three methyl protons (creating a quartet), resulting in a \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is only split by its vinyl neighbor, resulting in a \"doublet\". This fragment has the formula C₃H₅.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** One methyl group is part of the propenyl group identified above. The second methyl group must belong to the ester.\n    *   **No signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a crucial constraint. It rules out possibilities like an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or a propyl substituent (-CH₂CH₂CH₃). For the ester to contain the second methyl group without a -CH₂- group, it must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃).\n\n3.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula:**\n    We have identified all the pieces of the molecule:\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring: **C₆H₄**\n    *   A propenyl group: **C₃H₅**\n    *   A methyl ester group: **-COOCH₃** (This fragment adds C₂H₃O₂ to the formula)\n\n    Now, let's sum the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 1 (from C=O) + 1 (from OCH₃) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from OCH₃) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester) = **2**\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n4.  **Match with the Given Options:**\n    The calculated formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, matches option A.\n\n    *   **A) C11H12O2** - Matches our deduction.\n    *   B) C12H12O2 - Incorrect carbon count.\n    *   C) C12H14O2 - Incorrect carbon and hydrogen count. Would likely contain a -CH₂- group, which is ruled out.\n    *   D) C11H14O2 - Incorrect hydrogen count. The two extra hydrogens would likely saturate the propenyl double bond, creating a propyl group, which contains forbidden -CH₂- groups.\n\nThe only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula from the given options.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by other groups. The core of this structure is a C₆H₄ fragment.\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** The molecule contains a -COO- functional group. This accounts for the two oxygen atoms present in all the formula options.\n    *   **¹H NMR - Two aromatic-H signals:** This corresponds to the four protons on the C₆H₄ ring. The presence of only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para (1,4-substitution).\n    *   **¹H NMR - Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a highly specific and characteristic splitting pattern for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three methyl protons (creating a quartet), resulting in a \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is only split by the first, resulting in a \"doublet\". This fragment has the formula C₃H₅.\n    *   **¹H NMR - Two –CH₃ signals:** The molecule has two distinct methyl groups. One is part of the propenyl group identified above. The other must be part of the ester group.\n    *   **¹H NMR - No signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical constraint. It eliminates any possibility of having an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) or any other chain with a methylene (-CH₂) unit. This means the ester must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate (-OCOCH₃), not an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula:**\n    We have identified the following pieces of the molecule:\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring: **C₆H₄**\n    *   A propenyl group: **C₃H₅**\n    *   An ester group that includes a methyl group and no methylene groups (e.g., -COOCH₃): This fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n    Now, we sum the atoms from these fragments:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11 carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12 hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **2 oxygens**\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n3.  **Match the Formula to the Options:**\n    The calculated formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ must be compared to the given choices:\n    *   A) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\n    *   B) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n    *   C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\n    *   D) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\n\n    The calculated formula matches option B.\n\n4.  **Verify by Eliminating Other Options:**\n    *   **C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** Has two extra hydrogens. This would require saturating a double bond, likely turning the propenyl group into a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃), which would create -CH₂- signals. This contradicts the data.\n    *   **C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** Has an extra CH₂ group compared to the correct formula. This is explicitly ruled out by the \"no –CH₂ groups\" constraint.\n    *   **C₁₂H₁₂O₂:** Has an extra carbon but the same number of hydrogens. It is not possible to construct a molecule with this formula that fits all the other constraints.\n\nThe only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Information:**\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two substituents. The formula for this core fragment is C₆H₄.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** The molecule contains a -COO- functional group. This accounts for two oxygen atoms and one carbon atom (in the C=O).\n*   **¹H NMR - Two aromatic-H signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring has four protons. Having only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para (1,4-substitution). This confirms the C₆H₄ fragment with its 4 hydrogens.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH₃. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three methyl protons (creating a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is only split by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet. This fragment has the formula C₃H₅.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two -CH₃ signals:** The molecule has two distinct methyl groups. One is part of the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH₃**). The other must be part of the ester group.\n*   **¹H NMR - No signals for -CH₂ groups:** This is a critical piece of negative evidence. It rules out any ethyl (-CH₂CH₃), propyl (-CH₂CH₂CH₃), or other groups containing a methylene unit. This confirms that the ester must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) to account for the second methyl signal without introducing a methylene group.\n\n**2. Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula:**\nBased on the analysis, the molecule is composed of the following parts:\n*   A di-substituted benzene ring: **C₆H₄**\n*   A propenyl group: **C₃H₅**\n*   A methyl ester group: **-COOCH₃**, which adds **C₂H₃O₂** to the formula (one C from the carbonyl, one C from the methyl, three H from the methyl, and two O).\n\nNow, let's sum the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from methyl ester) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl ester) = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from methyl ester) = **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**3.

Final Verification (Degree of Unsaturation):**\n*   The proposed structure (e.g., methyl 4-propenylbenzoate) has 1 ring (4 degrees of unsaturation), 1 C=C double bond (1 degree), and 1 C=O double bond (1 degree), for a total of 6 degrees of unsaturation.\n*   The formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ has a degree of unsaturation of: C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n*   The calculation matches the structure, confirming our conclusion.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Framework and Functional Groups:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by substituents.

This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** (3 carbons and 5 hydrogens).\n    *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** The spectrum shows two distinct methyl groups. One belongs to the propenyl group just identified. The other must be part of the ester group.\n    *   **No signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical constraint. It rules out any fragments like ethyl (-CH₂CH₃) or propyl (-CH₂CH₂CH₃). Therefore, the ester must be structured in a way that avoids a methylene group, such as a methyl ester (-COOCH₃).\n\n3.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula:**\n    *   We have identified three key pieces of the molecule:\n        1.  The aromatic ring: **C₆H₄**\n        2.  The propenyl substituent: **C₃H₅**\n        3.  The methyl ester substituent: **-COOCH₃**, which contributes **C₂H₃O₂** (one carbonyl carbon, one methyl carbon, three methyl hydrogens, and two oxygens).\n\n    *   Now, sum the atoms from these fragments:\n        *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11**\n        *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12**\n        *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **2**\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The molecular formula deduced from a complete analysis of all the spectroscopic data is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.

The presence of only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, like para (1,4) substitution.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a very specific and characteristic splitting pattern for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (into a doublet) and the methyl protons (into a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is split only by its vinyl neighbor, resulting in a doublet. This fragment has the formula **-C₃H₅**.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** One methyl group is already accounted for in the propenyl group. The second methyl group must belong to the ester functionality.\n*   **¹H NMR - No signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical constraint. It rules out any fragments containing a methylene (-CH₂-) group, such as an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃). Since the second methyl group is part of the ester, it must be a **methyl ester (-COOCH₃)** to avoid any -CH₂- groups.\n\n**2. Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula:**\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from all the identified fragments:\n*   **Fragment 1:** The aromatic ring core -> **C₆H₄**\n*   **Fragment 2:** The propenyl group substituent -> **-C₃H₅**\n*   **Fragment 3:** The methyl ester group substituent -> **-COOCH₃** (which adds C₂H₃O₂)\n\nLet's add them up:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**3.

This formula contains an extra CH₂ group compared to our derived formula, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n\nTherefore, the only possible chemical formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nTo determine the correct chemical formula, we will systematically analyze the provided spectroscopic data by breaking it down into structural fragments and then assembling them to find the total number of atoms.\n\n**1. Analysis of Structural Fragments from Spectroscopic Data:**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by substituents. The core fragment is therefore **C₆H₄**. This accounts for 6 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms. The two aromatic-H signals in the ¹H NMR are consistent with this.\n\n*   **Ester group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the **two oxygen atoms** present in all the candidate formulas.\n\n*   **Vinyl and Methyl groups (from ¹H NMR):**\n    *   The spectrum shows two signals for vinyl hydrogens (-CH=CH-) with a specific splitting pattern: one doublet (d) and one doublet of quartets (dq). This is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. In this group, one vinyl proton is split by the other (doublet), and the second vinyl proton is split by both the first vinyl proton (doublet) and the adjacent methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This fragment's formula is **C₃H₅**. It accounts for 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens.\n    *   The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl (-CH₃) groups. One of these is part of the propenyl group identified above. The other methyl group must be part of the ester.\n\n*   **Absence of -CH₂ groups:** This is a critical piece of information. Since the second methyl group is part of the ester and there are no -CH₂- groups, the ester must be a **methyl ester (-COOCH₃)**. An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃), for example, is ruled out. This methyl ester fragment accounts for the second -CH₃ signal and the ester's carbonyl carbon.\n\n**2. Assembling the Fragments and Calculating the Molecular Formula:**\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from all the identified fragments:\n*   **From the aromatic ring:** C₆H₄\n*   **From the propenyl group:** C₃H₅\n*   **From the methyl ester group:** -COOCH₃ (This adds the C=O carbon, the -O-CH₃ group, and the two oxygens).\n\nLet's count the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 1 (from the ester C=O) + 1 (from the ester -OCH₃) = **11 carbons**.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from the ester -OCH₃) = **12 hydrogens**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from the ester -COO-) = **2 oxygens**.\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**3. Verification and Comparison with Options:**\n\nThe deduced formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, is consistent with all the spectral data. Let's check it against the given options:\nA) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\nB) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\nC) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\nD) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\n\nOur calculated formula matches option B. The other options are incorrect:\n*   C₁₁H₁₄O₂ and C₁₂H₁₄O₂ would require additional -CH₂- groups (or saturation of the double bond), which contradicts the \"no -CH₂- signals\" constraint.\n*   C₁₂H₁₂O₂ has an incorrect carbon count.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that fits all the evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided information and candidate responses.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data\n\nThe problem provides several key pieces of information about the unknown compound's structure. Let's break them down into molecular fragments.\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two hydrogens replaced by substituents. The formula for this fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n2.  **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a **-COO-** functional group, which contains two oxygen atoms.\n3.  **¹H NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅**.\n4.  **¹H NMR shows two signals for –CH₃ groups:** One of these methyl groups is part of the propenyl group identified above. The other methyl group must be part of the ester.\n5.  **¹H NMR shows no signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a crucial constraint. It means the ester group cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or have any other alkyl chain containing a methylene group. Combined with the point above, this confirms the second methyl group is directly attached to the ester, forming a **methyl ester (-COOCH₃)**.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula\n\nNow, we can sum the atoms from the identified fragments to determine the overall chemical formula.\n\n*   **Carbons (C):**\n    *   6 from the aromatic ring (C₆H₄)\n    *   3 from the propenyl group (C₃H₅)\n    *   1 from the ester's carbonyl group (C=O)\n    *   1 from the ester's methyl group (-OCH₃)\n    *   **Total Carbons = 6 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 11**\n\n*   **Hydrogens (H):**\n    *   4 from the aromatic ring (C₆H₄)\n    *   5 from the propenyl group (C₃H₅)\n    *   3 from the ester's methyl group (-OCH₃)\n    *   **Total Hydrogens = 4 + 5 + 3 = 12**\n\n*   **Oxygens (O):**\n    *   2 from the ester group (-COO-)\n    *   **Total Oxygens = 2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Result Against the Options\n\nLet's check our derived formula against the given choices and see why the others are incorrect.\n\n*   **A) C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** This matches our calculation perfectly.\n*   **B) C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** This formula contains an extra CH₂ group compared to our result. The presence of a CH₂ group is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n*   **C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂:** This formula has an extra carbon but the same number of hydrogens. It is not possible to construct a molecule that fits the NMR fragments with this formula. It also has an incorrect Degree of Unsaturation (7, whereas our structure requires 6).\n*   **D) C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** This formula has two extra hydrogens. This would likely mean the propenyl group's double bond is saturated, forming a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃). This would introduce CH₂ signals, which are explicitly absent.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis of the spectroscopic data points unequivocally to the chemical formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂. The vast majority of the candidate answers also reach this conclusion in their reasoning, even if some select the wrong final letter. Based on the provided options, C₁₁H₁₂O₂ corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n\n\n**Careful Points to List:**\n1.  **Decomposition of the molecule:** Break down the molecule into its constituent fragments based on the spectral data.\n2.  **Aromatic Ring:** `C6H4` from \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\".\n3.  **Ester Group:** `-COO-` from FTIR, accounting for the two oxygen atoms.\n4.  **Propenyl Group:** `-CH=CH-CH3` from the specific vinyl NMR signals (doublet and doublet of quartets). This is a key deduction. This fragment is `C3H5`.\n5.  **Methyl Groups:** Two distinct `-CH3` signals are accounted for: one in the propenyl group and one in the ester group.\n6.  **\"No -CH2-\" Constraint:** This is a critical eliminator. It confirms the ester must be a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or acetate (`-OCOCH3`) and rules out other possibilities like an ethyl ester. It also rules out saturating the propenyl group to a propyl group.\n7.  **Summation of Fragments:** Carefully sum the atoms from the deduced fragments (`C6H4` + `C3H5` + `C2H3O2`) to get the final formula.\n8.  **Verification:** Check the calculated formula against the options and also verify the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) as a final check.\n    *   DoU from structure: 1 ring (4) + 1 C=C (1) + 1 C=O (1) = 6.\n    *   DoU from formula C11H12O2: 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6. The DoU matches.\n9.  **Final Selection:** Match the correct formula to the corresponding letter in the prompt's options.Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula from the given options.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Structural Fragments**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by substituents. The core of this fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** The presence of an ester functional group (–COO–) is confirmed. This accounts for the **two oxygen atoms** present in all the formula options.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific and complex splitting pattern is a classic signature of a **propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH₃)**. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by both the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three methyl protons (creating a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅**.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** The molecule has two distinct methyl groups. One is part of the propenyl group identified above. The other must belong to the ester group.\n*   **¹H NMR - No signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical piece of information. It rules out any fragments containing a methylene group, such as an ethyl ester (–COOCH₂CH₃) or a propyl group (–CH₂CH₂CH₃). This confirms that the second methyl group must be directly part of the ester, forming a **methyl ester (–COOCH₃)** or an **acetate (–OCOCH₃)**.\n\n**2. Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula**\n\nWe have identified the following pieces that make up the molecule:\n*   A di-substituted benzene ring: **C₆H₄**\n*   A propenyl group: **C₃H₅**\n*   An ester group containing a methyl group (e.g., –COOCH₃): This fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** (one carbon from the C=O, one from the –OCH₃, three hydrogens, and two oxygens).\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from these fragments:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11 carbons**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12 hydrogens**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **2 oxygens**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**3. Verify the Result and Compare with Options**\n\nThe deduced formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂. Let's check this against the provided options:\n*   A) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\n*   B) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n*   C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\n*   D) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\n\nThe calculated formula matches option B.\n\nWe can also perform a final check using the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU). The proposed structure (e.g., methyl propenylbenzoate) has one ring (DoU=4), one C=C double bond (DoU=1), and one C=O double bond (DoU=1), for a total DoU of 6. The formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ gives a DoU of (11 + 1 - 12/2) = 6. The structure and formula are consistent. The other options either have an incorrect DoU or would require the presence of –CH₂– groups, which are explicitly absent.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula from the given options.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Structural Fragments from the Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by substituents. The core of this fragment is **C₆H₄**, which contributes 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n\n2.  **FTIR Spectrum (Ester Group):** The presence of an ester group (`-COO-`) is confirmed. This group contains two oxygen atoms and a carbonyl (`C=O`) double bond.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum (Proton Signals):**\n    *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** These correspond to the 4 hydrogens on the `C₆H₄` ring. The presence of only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, such as para (1,4) substitution.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a highly characteristic splitting pattern that points directly to a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (doublet) and the methyl protons (quartet), creating the doublet of quartets. This fragment contributes 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens (`-C₃H₅`).\n    *   **Two –CH₃ signals:** One methyl group is part of the propenyl group. The second methyl group must belong to the ester functionality.\n    *   **No –CH₂ signals:** This is a critical constraint. It rules out any fragments containing a methylene (`-CH₂-`) group, such as an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). Therefore, the second methyl group must be part of a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetate (`-OCOCH₃`).\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula\n\nWe have identified the following essential pieces of the molecule:\n*   A benzene ring fragment: **C₆H₄**\n*   A propenyl group fragment: **C₃H₅**\n*   An ester fragment containing a methyl group (e.g., `-COOCH₃`): This adds **C₂H₃O₂** to the formula (one carbon from the carbonyl, one from the methyl, three hydrogens, and two oxygens).\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from these fragments:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11 carbons**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12 hydrogens**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **2 oxygens**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Result and Select the Correct Option\n\nThe derived formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data. Let's check this against the given options:\n\n*   A) C₁₂H₁₂O₂ - Incorrect carbon count.\n*   B) C₁₁H₁₄O₂ - Incorrect hydrogen count. This formula would also require the presence of `-CH₂-` groups (e.g., a propyl group instead of propenyl), which contradicts the NMR data.\n*   C) **C₁₁H₁₂O₂** - This matches our derived formula.\n*   D) C₁₂H₁₄O₂ - Incorrect carbon and hydrogen counts. This formula contains an extra `CH₂` group compared to our result, which is explicitly ruled out.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical formula that fits all the evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nTo determine the correct chemical formula, we must systematically analyze the structural fragments indicated by the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Framework and Functional Groups:**\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by substituents. The core of this structure is therefore a `C6H4` fragment. This accounts for 6 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms.\n*   **FTIR Spectrum (Ester Group):** The data confirms the presence of an ester functional group (`-COO-`). This group contains two oxygen atoms, which is consistent with all the given formula options.\n\n**2. Detailed Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** The four protons on the `C6H4` ring give rise to two signals. This suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para (1,4-substitution), where there are two pairs of chemically equivalent protons.\n*   **Vinyl-H (2 signals):** The presence of two signals for vinyl protons (`-CH=CH-`) with splitting patterns of \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" is a classic signature for a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three methyl protons (creating a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This fragment has a formula of `C3H5`.\n*   **-CH3 Groups (2 signals):** The spectrum shows two distinct methyl groups. One belongs to the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The other must be part of the ester group.\n*   **No -CH2 Groups:** This is a critical piece of information. It rules out structures containing an ethyl group (`-CH2CH3`) or any other alkyl chain with a methylene (`-CH2-`) unit. Therefore, the second methyl group must be part of a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate (`-OCOCH3`).\n\n**3. Assembling the Fragments and Calculating the Formula:**\nWe can now sum the atoms from the identified fragments to determine the total chemical formula:\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** `C6H4` (6 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens)\n*   **Propenyl Group:** `C3H5` (3 Carbons, 5 Hydrogens)\n*   **Ester + Methyl Group:** The ester group (`-COO-`) and the second methyl group (`-CH3`) combine to form a fragment like a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`). This fragment adds 2 carbons (`C` from carbonyl and `C` from methyl), 3 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens.\n\nLet's sum the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 1 (from ester C=O) + 1 (from ester -CH3) = **11 Carbons**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester -CH3) = **12 Hydrogens**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester) = **2 Oxygens**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**4. Verification Against Options:**\nThe calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option A. Let's quickly check why the other options are incorrect:\n*   **C11H14O2:** This would require saturating the double bond of the propenyl group, creating a propyl group (`-CH2CH2CH3`), which would have `-CH2-` signals. This contradicts the data.\n*   **C12H12O2:** This has an extra carbon but the same number of hydrogens. It is not possible to add a carbon without hydrogens while fitting the other constraints.\n*   **C12H14O2:** This formula has an extra `CH2` group compared to C11H12O2. This is explicitly ruled out by the \"no -CH2- signals\" constraint.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided spectral data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nAn analysis of the provided answers and the original problem statement reveals a strong consensus on the chemical formula, even if the final letter choices vary due to differences in how the options were presented to each agent. The correct approach is to deduce the formula from the spectral data and then match it to the original list of options.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This establishes a core structure of a benzene ring with two substituents, which has a formula of **C₆H₄**. This accounts for 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a **-COO-** functional group, which contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   **¹H NMR - Vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific and complex splitting pattern is a classic signature of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment accounts for 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens (1+1+3).\n    *   **¹H NMR - Two -CH₃ signals:** One methyl group is part of the propenyl group identified above. The second methyl group must belong to the ester.\n    *   **¹H NMR - No -CH₂ signals:** This is a critical constraint. For the ester group to contain the second methyl group without introducing a methylene (-CH₂-) group, it must be a **methyl ester (-COOCH₃)**. An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) is explicitly ruled out.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula:**\n    By combining the identified fragments, we can determine the total number of atoms:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 3 (from propenyl group) + 1 (from the ester's C=O) + 1 (from the ester's -OCH₃) = **11 Carbons**.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 5 (from the propenyl group) + 3 (from the ester's -OCH₃) = **12 Hydrogens**.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2 Oxygens**.\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n3.  **Verify with Constraints:**\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The proposed structure (e.g., methyl propenylbenzoate) has 1 ring (4 DoU), 1 C=C double bond (1 DoU), and 1 C=O double bond (1 DoU), for a total of 6 DoU. The formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ also has a DoU of 6 (DoU = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 6), confirming consistency.\n    *   **Eliminating Other Options:**\n        *   C₁₁H₁₄O₂ (DoU=5) and C₁₂H₁₂O₂ (DoU=7) are incorrect based on the required degree of unsaturation.\n        *   C₁₂H₁₄O₂ (DoU=6) has the correct DoU but contains an extra CH₂ group compared to the deduced formula. This directly contradicts the \"no -CH₂ signals\" constraint.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The only formula that satisfies all the spectroscopic constraints is C₁₁H₁₂O₂. Matching this to the original list of options:\n    A) C11H14O2\n    B) C12H14O2\n    C) C12H12O2\n    D) C11H12O2\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula from the provided options.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Structural Fragments\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring where two hydrogens have been replaced by substituents. The core fragment is therefore **C₆H₄**. This fragment has 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens. The ring structure itself accounts for a Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 4.\n\n2.  **FTIR - Ester group:** The presence of an ester group (`-COO-`) is confirmed. This adds 2 oxygen atoms and a carbonyl group (`C=O`), which contributes 1 to the DoU.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR - Vinyl-H signals:** The spectrum shows two signals for vinyl protons (`-CH=CH-`). The specific splitting pattern of \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (doublet) and the methyl protons (quartet), giving a doublet of quartets. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** (3 carbons, 5 hydrogens) and adds 1 to the DoU from its C=C double bond.\n\n4.  **¹H NMR - Two -CH₃ signals:** The spectrum shows two distinct methyl groups. One is already accounted for in the propenyl group. The second methyl group must be part of the ester.\n\n5.  **¹H NMR - No -CH₂ signals:** This is a critical constraint. For the ester group to contain the second methyl group but no methylene (`-CH₂-`) group, it must be a **methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`)**. An ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`) is explicitly ruled out. The methyl ester fragment adds a **C₂H₃O₂** component (one carbonyl carbon, one methyl carbon, three methyl hydrogens, and two oxygens).\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄\n*   **Propenyl Group:** C₃H₅\n*   **Methyl Ester Group:** C₂H₃O₂ (This is the `-COOCH₃` part)\n\nLet's sum them up:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from methyl ester) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl ester) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from methyl ester) = **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Result and Match with Options\n\n*   **Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   From fragments: 4 (ring) + 1 (C=C) + 1 (C=O) = 6.\n    *   From formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   The DoU matches, confirming the structural consistency.\n\n*   **Matching with the provided options:**\n    *   A) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\n    *   B) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\n    *   C) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\n    *   D) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n\nThe calculated formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula from the provided options.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Structural Fragments\n\nThe provided information allows us to identify the key components of the molecule:\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring**: This indicates a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced. The core chemical formula for this fragment is **C₆H₄**. The 1H NMR data, showing two signals for these four protons, is consistent with a symmetrical substitution pattern, such as para (1,4) substitution.\n*   **Ester group**: The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group. This accounts for the **two oxygen atoms** in the final formula.\n*   **Vinyl and Methyl groups (from 1H NMR)**:\n    *   The presence of two vinyl-H signals with splitting patterns of a **doublet** and a **doublet of quartets** is a classic and definitive signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has a formula of **C₃H₅**.\n    *   The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl (-CH₃) groups. One of these belongs to the propenyl group. The other must be part of the ester.\n*   **\"No -CH₂ groups\" Constraint**: This is a critical piece of information. For the ester group to contain the second methyl group without introducing a methylene (-CH₂-) bridge, it must be a **methyl ester (-COOCH₃)** or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃), for example, is explicitly ruled out.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula\n\nBy combining the identified fragments, we can determine the overall chemical formula. The molecule consists of a C₆H₄ ring substituted with a propenyl group (-C₃H₅) and an ester group that includes a methyl group (e.g., -COOCH₃).\n\nLet's sum the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from the C₆H₄ ring) + 3 (from the C₃H₅ propenyl group) + 1 (from the ester's C=O) + 1 (from the ester's -CH₃) = **11 Carbons**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from the C₆H₄ ring) + 5 (from the C₃H₅ propenyl group) + 3 (from the ester's -CH₃) = **12 Hydrogens**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from the -COO- ester group) = **2 Oxygens**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Result and Eliminate Other Options\n\nWe can verify this formula using the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), which represents the total number of rings and pi bonds.\n*   **DoU from Structure**: 1 (ring) + 3 (aromatic C=C) + 1 (vinyl C=C) + 1 (ester C=O) = **6**\n*   **DoU from Formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂)**: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**. The values match perfectly.\n\nNow let's check the other options:\n*   **A) C₁₂H₁₄O₂**: DoU = 6. However, this formula has an extra CH₂ group compared to our derived C₁₁H₁₂O₂.

    "Based on a step-by-step analysis of the spectroscopic data, we can determine the correct chemical formula. The reasoning of the candidate agents is sound, and a consensus on the chemical formula is clear, even if the final letter choice varies due to shuffled options.\n\n### Careful Points for Analysis\n\n1.  **Systematic Fragmentation:** The most reliable approach is to break down the molecule into its constituent fragments based on the spectral data provided.\n2.  **Aromatic Ring Core:** The \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\" immediately establishes a **C₆H₄** fragment. The two aromatic-H signals in the NMR are consistent with this.\n3.  **Ester Group Identification:** The FTIR data confirms a **-COO-** group, which accounts for the two oxygen atoms present in all candidate formulas.\n4.  **Propenyl Group Signature:** The ¹H NMR signals for vinyl protons—specifically \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\"—is a classic and unambiguous signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅**.\n5.  **Methyl Group Accounting:** The two distinct -CH₃ signals are accounted for: one is part of the propenyl group, and the other must belong to the ester group.\n6.  **The \"No -CH₂-\" Constraint:** This is a critical piece of negative evidence. It confirms that the ester must be a **methyl ester (-COOCH₃)**, as any other common alkyl ester (like ethyl) would contain a -CH₂- group. It also rules out the possibility of the propenyl group being saturated (i.e., a propyl group).\n7.  **Accurate Summation:** The atoms from the identified fragments must be summed correctly:\n    *   **Carbons:** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 1 (from C=O) + 1 (from -OCH₃) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogens:** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from -OCH₃) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygens:** 2 (from -COO-) = **2**\n    *   This leads to the formula **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n8.  **Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** A final check confirms the result. The structure (1 ring, 1 C=C, 1 C=O) requires a DoU of 6. The formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ gives a DoU of (11 + 1 - 12/2) = 6. The consistency is verified.\n9.  **Elimination of Alternatives:**\n    *   C₁₁H₁₄O₂ (DoU=5) and C₁₂H₁₂O₂ (DoU=7) have the wrong degree of unsaturation.\n    *   C₁₂H₁₄O₂ (DoU=6) has the correct DoU but contains an extra CH₂ group, which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n10. **Final Mapping:** The correctly deduced formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, must be matched to the original list of options provided in the question.\n\nBased on the original question's options:\nA) C11H14O2\nB) C12H12O2\nC) C12H14O2\nD) C11H12O2\n\nThe correct formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"

The FTIR spectrum of this compound shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. The 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two signals corresponding to aromatic-H, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. There are no signals corresponding to –CH2 groups. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.\n\nA) C11H14O2\nB) C12H12O2\nC) C12H14O2\nD) C11H12O2\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nBased on the successful execution of the Python script, which enumerates and prunes hypotheses, we can determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n### Summary of Reasoning\n\n1.  **Initial Hypotheses:** The script started with the four provided chemical formulas as candidates: C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, and C12H14O2.\n\n2.  **Constraint Analysis & Filtering:** The script applies constraints derived from the spectroscopic data to filter these candidates.\n    *   **Structural Fragments:** The analysis of the FTIR and ¹H NMR data identifies several key fragments:\n        *   A di-substituted benzene ring: **C₆H₄**\n        *   An ester group: **-COO-**\n        *   A propenyl group (**-CH=CH-CH₃**), identified by the characteristic vinyl signals (a doublet and a doublet of quartets). This fragment is **C₃H₅**.\n        *   A second methyl group, which must be part of the ester to satisfy the \"no -CH₂-\" constraint (e.g., a methyl ester, **-COOCH₃**).\n    *   **Constraint 1: Atom Count:** By summing the atoms from the required fragments (C₆H₄ + C₃H₅ + -COOCH₃), the script determines the only possible molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n        *   Carbons: 6 (ring) + 3 (propenyl) + 1 (carbonyl) + 1 (ester methyl) = 11\n        *   Hydrogens: 4 (ring) + 5 (propenyl) + 3 (ester methyl) = 12\n        *   Oxygens: 2 (ester)\n    *   **Constraint 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** The structure requires a DBE of 6 (4 for the aromatic ring, 1 for the vinyl C=C, 1 for the ester C=O).\n        *   C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DBE = 6 (Pass)\n        *   C₁₁H₁₄O₂: DBE = 5 (Fail)\n        *   C₁₂H₁₂O₂: DBE = 7 (Fail)\n        *   C₁₂H₁₄O₂: DBE = 6 (Pass, but fails the next constraint)\n    *   **Constraint 3: No -CH₂- groups:** This is the final, critical filter. The formula C₁₂H₁₄O₂ has an extra CH₂ group compared to the derived C₁₁H₁₂O₂. Any structure with this formula that also contains the other required fragments would necessarily include a -CH₂- group (e.g., as an ethyl ester), which is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n\n3.  **Surviving Candidate:** After applying all constraints, only one candidate, **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**, remains. This formula perfectly matches all the provided spectroscopic information.\n\n### Final Choice\n\nThe only formula consistent with all the data is C₁₁H₁₂O₂. This corresponds to option D in the question's list.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula from the provided options.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Framework and Functional Groups:**\n    *   The compound has a \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring.\" This means it is a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by other groups. The core of this structure is therefore a **C₆H₄** fragment.\n    *   The FTIR spectrum shows an \"ester group.\" This indicates the presence of a **-COO-** functional group, which accounts for the **two oxygen atoms** present in all the formula options.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H:** The C₆H₄ fragment has four protons. The fact that they appear as only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, such as para (1,4) substitution. This confirms the **4 hydrogens** on the aromatic ring.\n    *   **Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (into a doublet) and the three methyl protons (into a quartet), giving a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is split only by the first vinyl proton, giving a doublet. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅**.\n    *   **Two signals corresponding to –CH₃ groups:** This indicates two chemically distinct methyl groups. One is already accounted for in the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH₃**). The second methyl group must be part of the ester.\n    *   **No signals corresponding to –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical constraint. For the ester group to contain the second methyl group but no -CH₂- group, it must be a methyl ester (**-COOCH₃**). An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃), for example, is ruled out.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula:**\n    Now, we sum the atoms from all the identified fragments to determine the total molecular formula:\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄\n    *   **Propenyl Group:** C₃H₅\n    *   **Methyl Ester Group:** -COOCH₃ (This adds C₂H₃O₂ to the rest of the molecule, but to avoid double-counting, let's sum the individual atoms: 1 Carbonyl Carbon, 1 Methyl Carbon, 3 Methyl Hydrogens, 2 Oxygens)\n\n    Let's sum the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 1 (from the ester's C=O) + 1 (from the ester's -OCH₃) = **11 carbons**.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from the ester's -OCH₃) = **12 hydrogens**.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from the ester's -COO-) = **2 oxygens**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The molecular formula derived from a complete analysis of the spectral data is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**. This formula is fully consistent with all the provided information, including the absence of -CH₂- groups.\n\n    Comparing this result to the given options:\n    A) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\n    B) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\n    C) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n    D) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\n\n    The correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nTo determine the correct chemical formula, we must systematically analyze the structural fragments indicated by the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Structure and Functional Groups:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by substituents. The core fragment is therefore C₆H₄.\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group, which accounts for the two oxygen atoms in all the given options.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum in Detail:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** This is consistent with the four protons on the C₆H₄ ring. The presence of only two signals often suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, like para (1,4) substitution.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a highly characteristic splitting pattern that points unambiguously to a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by both the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three methyl protons (creating a quartet), resulting in a \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is only split by its vinyl neighbor, resulting in a \"doublet\". This fragment has the formula C₃H₅.\n    *   **Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** One methyl group is part of the propenyl group identified above. The second methyl group must belong to the ester.\n    *   **No signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a crucial constraint. It rules out possibilities like an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or a propyl substituent (-CH₂CH₂CH₃). For the ester to contain the second methyl group without a -CH₂- group, it must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃).\n\n3.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula:**\n    We have identified all the pieces of the molecule:\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring: **C₆H₄**\n    *   A propenyl group: **C₃H₅**\n    *   A methyl ester group: **-COOCH₃** (This fragment adds C₂H₃O₂ to the formula)\n\n    Now, let's sum the atoms:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 1 (from C=O) + 1 (from OCH₃) = **11**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from OCH₃) = **12**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester) = **2**\n\n    The resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n4.  **Match with the Given Options:**\n    The calculated formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, matches option A.\n\n    *   **A) C11H12O2** - Matches our deduction.\n    *   B) C12H12O2 - Incorrect carbon count.\n    *   C) C12H14O2 - Incorrect carbon and hydrogen count. Would likely contain a -CH₂- group, which is ruled out.\n    *   D) C11H14O2 - Incorrect hydrogen count. The two extra hydrogens would likely saturate the propenyl double bond, creating a propyl group, which contains forbidden -CH₂- groups.\n\nThe only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula from the given options.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Information:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by other groups. The core of this structure is a C₆H₄ fragment.\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** The molecule contains a -COO- functional group. This accounts for the two oxygen atoms present in all the formula options.\n    *   **¹H NMR - Two aromatic-H signals:** This corresponds to the four protons on the C₆H₄ ring. The presence of only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para (1,4-substitution).\n    *   **¹H NMR - Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a highly specific and characteristic splitting pattern for a propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃). The vinyl proton adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three methyl protons (creating a quartet), resulting in a \"doublet of quartets\". The other vinyl proton is only split by the first, resulting in a \"doublet\". This fragment has the formula C₃H₅.\n    *   **¹H NMR - Two –CH₃ signals:** The molecule has two distinct methyl groups. One is part of the propenyl group identified above. The other must be part of the ester group.\n    *   **¹H NMR - No signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical constraint. It eliminates any possibility of having an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃) or any other chain with a methylene (-CH₂) unit. This means the ester must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) or an acetate (-OCOCH₃), not an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula:**\n    We have identified the following pieces of the molecule:\n    *   A di-substituted benzene ring: **C₆H₄**\n    *   A propenyl group: **C₃H₅**\n    *   An ester group that includes a methyl group and no methylene groups (e.g., -COOCH₃): This fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂**.\n\n    Now, we sum the atoms from these fragments:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11 carbons**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12 hydrogens**\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **2 oxygens**\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n3.  **Match the Formula to the Options:**\n    The calculated formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ must be compared to the given choices:\n    *   A) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\n    *   B) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n    *   C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\n    *   D) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\n\n    The calculated formula matches option B.\n\n4.  **Verify by Eliminating Other Options:**\n    *   **C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** Has two extra hydrogens. This would require saturating a double bond, likely turning the propenyl group into a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃), which would create -CH₂- signals. This contradicts the data.\n    *   **C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** Has an extra CH₂ group compared to the correct formula. This is explicitly ruled out by the \"no –CH₂ groups\" constraint.\n    *   **C₁₂H₁₂O₂:** Has an extra carbon but the same number of hydrogens. It is not possible to construct a molecule with this formula that fits all the other constraints.\n\nThe only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Information:**\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two substituents. The formula for this core fragment is C₆H₄.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** The molecule contains a -COO- functional group. This accounts for two oxygen atoms and one carbon atom (in the C=O).\n*   **¹H NMR - Two aromatic-H signals:** A di-substituted benzene ring has four protons. Having only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para (1,4-substitution). This confirms the C₆H₄ fragment with its 4 hydrogens.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a propenyl group, -CH=CH-CH₃. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three methyl protons (creating a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is only split by the first vinyl proton, resulting in a doublet. This fragment has the formula C₃H₅.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two -CH₃ signals:** The molecule has two distinct methyl groups. One is part of the propenyl group (-CH=CH-**CH₃**). The other must be part of the ester group.\n*   **¹H NMR - No signals for -CH₂ groups:** This is a critical piece of negative evidence. It rules out any ethyl (-CH₂CH₃), propyl (-CH₂CH₂CH₃), or other groups containing a methylene unit. This confirms that the ester must be a methyl ester (-COOCH₃) to account for the second methyl signal without introducing a methylene group.\n\n**2. Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula:**\nBased on the analysis, the molecule is composed of the following parts:\n*   A di-substituted benzene ring: **C₆H₄**\n*   A propenyl group: **C₃H₅**\n*   A methyl ester group: **-COOCH₃**, which adds **C₂H₃O₂** to the formula (one C from the carbonyl, one C from the methyl, three H from the methyl, and two O).\n\nNow, let's sum the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from methyl ester) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl ester) = **12**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from methyl ester) = **2**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**3.

It rules out any fragments like ethyl (-CH₂CH₃) or propyl (-CH₂CH₂CH₃). Therefore, the ester must be structured in a way that avoids a methylene group, such as a methyl ester (-COOCH₃).\n\n3.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula:**\n    *   We have identified three key pieces of the molecule:\n        1.  The aromatic ring: **C₆H₄**\n        2.  The propenyl substituent: **C₃H₅**\n        3.  The methyl ester substituent: **-COOCH₃**, which contributes **C₂H₃O₂** (one carbonyl carbon, one methyl carbon, three methyl hydrogens, and two oxygens).\n\n    *   Now, sum the atoms from these fragments:\n        *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11**\n        *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12**\n        *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **2**\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The molecular formula deduced from a complete analysis of all the spectroscopic data is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.

The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (into a doublet) and the methyl protons (into a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. The other vinyl proton is split only by its vinyl neighbor, resulting in a doublet. This fragment has the formula **-C₃H₅**.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** One methyl group is already accounted for in the propenyl group.

Analysis of Structural Fragments from Spectroscopic Data:**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by substituents. The core fragment is therefore **C₆H₄**. This accounts for 6 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms. The two aromatic-H signals in the ¹H NMR are consistent with this.\n\n*   **Ester group:** The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the **two oxygen atoms** present in all the candidate formulas.\n\n*   **Vinyl and Methyl groups (from ¹H NMR):**\n    *   The spectrum shows two signals for vinyl hydrogens (-CH=CH-) with a specific splitting pattern: one doublet (d) and one doublet of quartets (dq). This is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. In this group, one vinyl proton is split by the other (doublet), and the second vinyl proton is split by both the first vinyl proton (doublet) and the adjacent methyl group (quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This fragment's formula is **C₃H₅**. It accounts for 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens.\n    *   The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl (-CH₃) groups. One of these is part of the propenyl group identified above. The other methyl group must be part of the ester.\n\n*   **Absence of -CH₂ groups:** This is a critical piece of information. Since the second methyl group is part of the ester and there are no -CH₂- groups, the ester must be a **methyl ester (-COOCH₃)**. An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃), for example, is ruled out. This methyl ester fragment accounts for the second -CH₃ signal and the ester's carbonyl carbon.\n\n**2. Assembling the Fragments and Calculating the Molecular Formula:**\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from all the identified fragments:\n*   **From the aromatic ring:** C₆H₄\n*   **From the propenyl group:** C₃H₅\n*   **From the methyl ester group:** -COOCH₃ (This adds the C=O carbon, the -O-CH₃ group, and the two oxygens).\n\nLet's count the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 1 (from the ester C=O) + 1 (from the ester -OCH₃) = **11 carbons**.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from the ester -OCH₃) = **12 hydrogens**.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from the ester -COO-) = **2 oxygens**.\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**3.

Let's break them down into molecular fragments.\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This tells us the core of the molecule is a benzene ring with two hydrogens replaced by substituents. The formula for this fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n2.  **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a **-COO-** functional group, which contains two oxygen atoms.\n3.  **¹H NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific splitting pattern is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅**.\n4.  **¹H NMR shows two signals for –CH₃ groups:** One of these methyl groups is part of the propenyl group identified above. The other methyl group must be part of the ester.\n5.  **¹H NMR shows no signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a crucial constraint. It means the ester group cannot be an ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) or have any other alkyl chain containing a methylene group. Combined with the point above, this confirms the second methyl group is directly attached to the ester, forming a **methyl ester (-COOCH₃)**.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula\n\nNow, we can sum the atoms from the identified fragments to determine the overall chemical formula.\n\n*   **Carbons (C):**\n    *   6 from the aromatic ring (C₆H₄)\n    *   3 from the propenyl group (C₃H₅)\n    *   1 from the ester's carbonyl group (C=O)\n    *   1 from the ester's methyl group (-OCH₃)\n    *   **Total Carbons = 6 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 11**\n\n*   **Hydrogens (H):**\n    *   4 from the aromatic ring (C₆H₄)\n    *   5 from the propenyl group (C₃H₅)\n    *   3 from the ester's methyl group (-OCH₃)\n    *   **Total Hydrogens = 4 + 5 + 3 = 12**\n\n*   **Oxygens (O):**\n    *   2 from the ester group (-COO-)\n    *   **Total Oxygens = 2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Result Against the Options\n\nLet's check our derived formula against the given choices and see why the others are incorrect.\n\n*   **A) C₁₁H₁₂O₂:** This matches our calculation perfectly.\n*   **B) C₁₂H₁₄O₂:** This formula contains an extra CH₂ group compared to our result. The presence of a CH₂ group is explicitly ruled out by the NMR data.\n*   **C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂:** This formula has an extra carbon but the same number of hydrogens. It is not possible to construct a molecule that fits the NMR fragments with this formula. It also has an incorrect Degree of Unsaturation (7, whereas our structure requires 6).\n*   **D) C₁₁H₁₄O₂:** This formula has two extra hydrogens. This would likely mean the propenyl group's double bond is saturated, forming a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃). This would introduce CH₂ signals, which are explicitly absent.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis of the spectroscopic data points unequivocally to the chemical formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂. The vast majority of the candidate answers also reach this conclusion in their reasoning, even if some select the wrong final letter. Based on the provided options, C₁₁H₁₂O₂ corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\n\n\n**Careful Points to List:**\n1.  **Decomposition of the molecule:** Break down the molecule into its constituent fragments based on the spectral data.\n2.  **Aromatic Ring:** `C6H4` from \"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\".\n3.  **Ester Group:** `-COO-` from FTIR, accounting for the two oxygen atoms.\n4.  **Propenyl Group:** `-CH=CH-CH3` from the specific vinyl NMR signals (doublet and doublet of quartets). This is a key deduction. This fragment is `C3H5`.\n5.  **Methyl Groups:** Two distinct `-CH3` signals are accounted for: one in the propenyl group and one in the ester group.\n6.  **\"No -CH2-\" Constraint:** This is a critical eliminator. It confirms the ester must be a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or acetate (`-OCOCH3`) and rules out other possibilities like an ethyl ester. It also rules out saturating the propenyl group to a propyl group.\n7.  **Summation of Fragments:** Carefully sum the atoms from the deduced fragments (`C6H4` + `C3H5` + `C2H3O2`) to get the final formula.\n8.  **Verification:** Check the calculated formula against the options and also verify the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) as a final check.\n    *   DoU from structure: 1 ring (4) + 1 C=C (1) + 1 C=O (1) = 6.\n    *   DoU from formula C11H12O2: 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6. The DoU matches.\n9.  **Final Selection:** Match the correct formula to the corresponding letter in the prompt's options.Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula from the given options.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Structural Fragments**\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by substituents. The core of this fragment is **C₆H₄**.\n*   **FTIR shows an ester group:** The presence of an ester functional group (–COO–) is confirmed. This accounts for the **two oxygen atoms** present in all the formula options.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific and complex splitting pattern is a classic signature of a **propenyl group (–CH=CH–CH₃)**. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by both the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three methyl protons (creating a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅**.\n*   **¹H NMR - Two signals for –CH₃ groups:** The molecule has two distinct methyl groups. One is part of the propenyl group identified above. The other must belong to the ester group.\n*   **¹H NMR - No signals for –CH₂ groups:** This is a critical piece of information. It rules out any fragments containing a methylene group, such as an ethyl ester (–COOCH₂CH₃) or a propyl group (–CH₂CH₂CH₃). This confirms that the second methyl group must be directly part of the ester, forming a **methyl ester (–COOCH₃)** or an **acetate (–OCOCH₃)**.\n\n**2. Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula**\n\nWe have identified the following pieces that make up the molecule:\n*   A di-substituted benzene ring: **C₆H₄**\n*   A propenyl group: **C₃H₅**\n*   An ester group containing a methyl group (e.g., –COOCH₃): This fragment contributes **C₂H₃O₂** (one carbon from the C=O, one from the –OCH₃, three hydrogens, and two oxygens).\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from these fragments:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11 carbons**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12 hydrogens**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **2 oxygens**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n**3. Verify the Result and Compare with Options**\n\nThe deduced formula is C₁₁H₁₂O₂. Let's check this against the provided options:\n*   A) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\n*   B) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n*   C) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\n*   D) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\n\nThe calculated formula matches option B.\n\nWe can also perform a final check using the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU). The proposed structure (e.g., methyl propenylbenzoate) has one ring (DoU=4), one C=C double bond (DoU=1), and one C=O double bond (DoU=1), for a total DoU of 6. The formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ gives a DoU of (11 + 1 - 12/2) = 6. The structure and formula are consistent. The other options either have an incorrect DoU or would require the presence of –CH₂– groups, which are explicitly absent.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula from the given options.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Structural Fragments from the Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by substituents. The core of this fragment is **C₆H₄**, which contributes 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n\n2.  **FTIR Spectrum (Ester Group):** The presence of an ester group (`-COO-`) is confirmed. This group contains two oxygen atoms and a carbonyl (`C=O`) double bond.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectrum (Proton Signals):**\n    *   **Two aromatic-H signals:** These correspond to the 4 hydrogens on the `C₆H₄` ring. The presence of only two signals suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, such as para (1,4) substitution.\n    *   **Two vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a highly characteristic splitting pattern that points directly to a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (doublet) and the methyl protons (quartet), creating the doublet of quartets. This fragment contributes 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens (`-C₃H₅`).\n    *   **Two –CH₃ signals:** One methyl group is part of the propenyl group. The second methyl group must belong to the ester functionality.\n    *   **No –CH₂ signals:** This is a critical constraint. It rules out any fragments containing a methylene (`-CH₂-`) group, such as an ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`). Therefore, the second methyl group must be part of a methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`) or an acetate (`-OCOCH₃`).\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula\n\nWe have identified the following essential pieces of the molecule:\n*   A benzene ring fragment: **C₆H₄**\n*   A propenyl group fragment: **C₃H₅**\n*   An ester fragment containing a methyl group (e.g., `-COOCH₃`): This adds **C₂H₃O₂** to the formula (one carbon from the carbonyl, one from the methyl, three hydrogens, and two oxygens).\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from these fragments:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄) + 3 (from C₃H₅) + 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **11 carbons**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄) + 5 (from C₃H₅) + 3 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **12 hydrogens**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C₂H₃O₂) = **2 oxygens**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Result and Select the Correct Option\n\nThe derived formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, is fully consistent with all the provided spectroscopic data. Let's check this against the given options:\n\n*   A) C₁₂H₁₂O₂ - Incorrect carbon count.\n*   B) C₁₁H₁₄O₂ - Incorrect hydrogen count. This formula would also require the presence of `-CH₂-` groups (e.g., a propyl group instead of propenyl), which contradicts the NMR data.\n*   C) **C₁₁H₁₂O₂** - This matches our derived formula.\n*   D) C₁₂H₁₄O₂ - Incorrect carbon and hydrogen counts. This formula contains an extra `CH₂` group compared to our result, which is explicitly ruled out.\n\nTherefore, the only chemical formula that fits all the evidence is C₁₁H₁₂O₂.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nTo determine the correct chemical formula, we must systematically analyze the structural fragments indicated by the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Molecular Framework and Functional Groups:**\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced by substituents. The core of this structure is therefore a `C6H4` fragment. This accounts for 6 carbon atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms.\n*   **FTIR Spectrum (Ester Group):** The data confirms the presence of an ester functional group (`-COO-`). This group contains two oxygen atoms, which is consistent with all the given formula options.\n\n**2. Detailed Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n*   **Aromatic-H (2 signals):** The four protons on the `C6H4` ring give rise to two signals. This suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, most likely para (1,4-substitution), where there are two pairs of chemically equivalent protons.\n*   **Vinyl-H (2 signals):** The presence of two signals for vinyl protons (`-CH=CH-`) with splitting patterns of \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" is a classic signature for a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (creating a doublet) and the three methyl protons (creating a quartet), resulting in a doublet of quartets. This fragment has a formula of `C3H5`.\n*   **-CH3 Groups (2 signals):** The spectrum shows two distinct methyl groups. One belongs to the propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`). The other must be part of the ester group.\n*   **No -CH2 Groups:** This is a critical piece of information. It rules out structures containing an ethyl group (`-CH2CH3`) or any other alkyl chain with a methylene (`-CH2-`) unit. Therefore, the second methyl group must be part of a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate (`-OCOCH3`).\n\n**3. Assembling the Fragments and Calculating the Formula:**\nWe can now sum the atoms from the identified fragments to determine the total chemical formula:\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** `C6H4` (6 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens)\n*   **Propenyl Group:** `C3H5` (3 Carbons, 5 Hydrogens)\n*   **Ester + Methyl Group:** The ester group (`-COO-`) and the second methyl group (`-CH3`) combine to form a fragment like a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`). This fragment adds 2 carbons (`C` from carbonyl and `C` from methyl), 3 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens.\n\nLet's sum the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 1 (from ester C=O) + 1 (from ester -CH3) = **11 Carbons**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from ester -CH3) = **12 Hydrogens**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from ester) = **2 Oxygens**\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**4. Verification Against Options:**\nThe calculated formula, C11H12O2, matches option A. Let's quickly check why the other options are incorrect:\n*   **C11H14O2:** This would require saturating the double bond of the propenyl group, creating a propyl group (`-CH2CH2CH3`), which would have `-CH2-` signals. This contradicts the data.\n*   **C12H12O2:** This has an extra carbon but the same number of hydrogens. It is not possible to add a carbon without hydrogens while fitting the other constraints.\n*   **C12H14O2:** This formula has an extra `CH2` group compared to C11H12O2. This is explicitly ruled out by the \"no -CH2- signals\" constraint.\n\nTherefore, the only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided spectral data is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nAn analysis of the provided answers and the original problem statement reveals a strong consensus on the chemical formula, even if the final letter choices vary due to differences in how the options were presented to each agent. The correct approach is to deduce the formula from the spectral data and then match it to the original list of options.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data:**\n    *   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This establishes a core structure of a benzene ring with two substituents, which has a formula of **C₆H₄**. This accounts for 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.\n    *   **FTIR shows an ester group:** This confirms the presence of a **-COO-** functional group, which contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n    *   **¹H NMR - Vinyl-H signals (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This specific and complex splitting pattern is a classic signature of a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment accounts for 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens (1+1+3).\n    *   **¹H NMR - Two -CH₃ signals:** One methyl group is part of the propenyl group identified above. The second methyl group must belong to the ester.\n    *   **¹H NMR - No -CH₂ signals:** This is a critical constraint. For the ester group to contain the second methyl group without introducing a methylene (-CH₂-) group, it must be a **methyl ester (-COOCH₃)**. An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) is explicitly ruled out.\n\n2.  **Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula:**\n    By combining the identified fragments, we can determine the total number of atoms:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 3 (from propenyl group) + 1 (from the ester's C=O) + 1 (from the ester's -OCH₃) = **11 Carbons**.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C₆H₄ ring) + 5 (from the propenyl group) + 3 (from the ester's -OCH₃) = **12 Hydrogens**.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2 Oxygens**.\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n3.  **Verify with Constraints:**\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The proposed structure (e.g., methyl propenylbenzoate) has 1 ring (4 DoU), 1 C=C double bond (1 DoU), and 1 C=O double bond (1 DoU), for a total of 6 DoU. The formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂ also has a DoU of 6 (DoU = 11 + 1 - 12/2 = 6), confirming consistency.\n    *   **Eliminating Other Options:**\n        *   C₁₁H₁₄O₂ (DoU=5) and C₁₂H₁₂O₂ (DoU=7) are incorrect based on the required degree of unsaturation.\n        *   C₁₂H₁₄O₂ (DoU=6) has the correct DoU but contains an extra CH₂ group compared to the deduced formula. This directly contradicts the \"no -CH₂ signals\" constraint.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The only formula that satisfies all the spectroscopic constraints is C₁₁H₁₂O₂. Matching this to the original list of options:\n    A) C11H14O2\n    B) C12H14O2\n    C) C12H12O2\n    D) C11H12O2\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula from the provided options.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Structural Fragments\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This indicates a benzene ring where two hydrogens have been replaced by substituents. The core fragment is therefore **C₆H₄**. This fragment has 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens. The ring structure itself accounts for a Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 4.\n\n2.  **FTIR - Ester group:** The presence of an ester group (`-COO-`) is confirmed. This adds 2 oxygen atoms and a carbonyl group (`C=O`), which contributes 1 to the DoU.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR - Vinyl-H signals:** The spectrum shows two signals for vinyl protons (`-CH=CH-`). The specific splitting pattern of \"one doublet and one doublet of quartets\" is a classic signature for a **propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH₃`)**. The proton on the carbon adjacent to the methyl group is split by the other vinyl proton (doublet) and the methyl protons (quartet), giving a doublet of quartets. This fragment has the formula **C₃H₅** (3 carbons, 5 hydrogens) and adds 1 to the DoU from its C=C double bond.\n\n4.  **¹H NMR - Two -CH₃ signals:** The spectrum shows two distinct methyl groups. One is already accounted for in the propenyl group. The second methyl group must be part of the ester.\n\n5.  **¹H NMR - No -CH₂ signals:** This is a critical constraint. For the ester group to contain the second methyl group but no methylene (`-CH₂-`) group, it must be a **methyl ester (`-COOCH₃`)**. An ethyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH₃`) is explicitly ruled out. The methyl ester fragment adds a **C₂H₃O₂** component (one carbonyl carbon, one methyl carbon, three methyl hydrogens, and two oxygens).\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula\n\nNow, we sum the atoms from the identified fragments:\n*   **Aromatic Ring:** C₆H₄\n*   **Propenyl Group:** C₃H₅\n*   **Methyl Ester Group:** C₂H₃O₂ (This is the `-COOCH₃` part)\n\nLet's sum them up:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from ring) + 3 (from propenyl) + 2 (from methyl ester) = **11**\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from ring) + 5 (from propenyl) + 3 (from methyl ester) = **12**\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from methyl ester) = **2**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Result and Match with Options\n\n*   **Verification with Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   From fragments: 4 (ring) + 1 (C=C) + 1 (C=O) = 6.\n    *   From formula C₁₁H₁₂O₂: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n    *   The DoU matches, confirming the structural consistency.\n\n*   **Matching with the provided options:**\n    *   A) C₁₂H₁₂O₂\n    *   B) C₁₁H₁₄O₂\n    *   C) C₁₂H₁₄O₂\n    *   D) C₁₁H₁₂O₂\n\nThe calculated formula, C₁₁H₁₂O₂, matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula from the provided options.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Data into Structural Fragments\n\nThe provided information allows us to identify the key components of the molecule:\n\n*   **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring**: This indicates a benzene ring where two hydrogen atoms have been replaced. The core chemical formula for this fragment is **C₆H₄**. The 1H NMR data, showing two signals for these four protons, is consistent with a symmetrical substitution pattern, such as para (1,4) substitution.\n*   **Ester group**: The FTIR spectrum confirms the presence of a -COO- functional group. This accounts for the **two oxygen atoms** in the final formula.\n*   **Vinyl and Methyl groups (from 1H NMR)**:\n    *   The presence of two vinyl-H signals with splitting patterns of a **doublet** and a **doublet of quartets** is a classic and definitive signature for a **propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH₃)**. This fragment has a formula of **C₃H₅**.\n    *   The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl (-CH₃) groups. One of these belongs to the propenyl group. The other must be part of the ester.\n*   **\"No -CH₂ groups\" Constraint**: This is a critical piece of information. For the ester group to contain the second methyl group without introducing a methylene (-CH₂-) bridge, it must be a **methyl ester (-COOCH₃)** or an acetate ester (-OCOCH₃). An ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃), for example, is explicitly ruled out.\n\n### Step 2: Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Molecular Formula\n\nBy combining the identified fragments, we can determine the overall chemical formula. The molecule consists of a C₆H₄ ring substituted with a propenyl group (-C₃H₅) and an ester group that includes a methyl group (e.g., -COOCH₃).\n\nLet's sum the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from the C₆H₄ ring) + 3 (from the C₃H₅ propenyl group) + 1 (from the ester's C=O) + 1 (from the ester's -CH₃) = **11 Carbons**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from the C₆H₄ ring) + 5 (from the C₃H₅ propenyl group) + 3 (from the ester's -CH₃) = **12 Hydrogens**\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from the -COO- ester group) = **2 Oxygens**\n\nThe resulting molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Result and Eliminate Other Options\n\nWe can verify this formula using the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU), which represents the total number of rings and pi bonds.\n*   **DoU from Structure**: 1 (ring) + 3 (aromatic C=C) + 1 (vinyl C=C) + 1 (ester C=O) = **6**\n*   **DoU from Formula (C₁₁H₁₂O₂)**: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = **6**. The values match perfectly.\n\nNow let's check the other options:\n*   **A) C₁₂H₁₄O₂**: DoU = 6. However, this formula has an extra CH₂ group compared to our derived C₁₁H₁₂O₂. This is directly contradicted by the \"no -CH₂ groups\" constraint.\n*   **C) C₁₁H₁₄O₂**: DoU = 5. This is inconsistent with the required number of double bonds and the ring structure.\n*   **D) C₁₂H₁₂O₂**: DoU = 7. This is also inconsistent with the structure.\n\nThe only formula that is fully consistent with all pieces of the provided spectroscopic data is C₁₁H₁₂O₂. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
