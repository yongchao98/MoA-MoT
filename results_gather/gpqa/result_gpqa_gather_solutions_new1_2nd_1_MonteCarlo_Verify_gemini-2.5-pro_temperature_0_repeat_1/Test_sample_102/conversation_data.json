Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Substituents:** It has three groups attached to the benzene ring:\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH3)\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br)\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Positions:** The substitution pattern is 1, 3, 5. This means all substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects\n\nThe order of reactions is critical because existing substituents on the ring direct the position of incoming groups.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n\n### 3. Evaluation of Synthetic Strategies\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be carefully planned. The most effective strategies involve installing a *meta*-director first to guide subsequent substitutions.\n\n*   **Strategy 1: Start with Acylation.** This is the most logical first step.\n    *   **Step i: Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** This installs the acetyl group, which is a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Step ii: Bromination of Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at the C3 position.\n    *   **Step iii: Nitration of 3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** At this stage, the ring has a strong *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The powerful deactivating effect of the acetyl group makes the positions ortho and para to it (C2, C4, C6) less reactive. The acetyl group strongly directs the incoming nitro group to the other *meta* position (C5). Therefore, nitration preferentially occurs at C5, yielding the desired product.\n\n*   **Strategy 2: Start with Nitration or Bromination.**\n    *   If the first step is bromination, an *ortho, para*-director is installed. The subsequent nitration would yield primarily the 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene isomer, which is incorrect.\n    *   If the first step is nitration, a strongly deactivating nitro group is installed. A subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the acetyl group) would fail because these reactions do not work on strongly deactivated rings.\n\n### 4. Conclusion on the Correct Sequence\n\nThe only chemically viable pathway among the fundamental options is to perform the reactions in the following order:\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n2.  **Bromination**\n3.  **Nitration**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to the first three steps of option D as described by a majority of the provided analyses. The other options (A, B, C) contain chemically impossible steps (e.g., Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline or nitrobenzene) or follow a synthetic route that would produce the wrong isomers. The additional steps (iv-vii) listed in option D are nonsensical for this synthesis and appear to be distractors, as the target molecule is successfully formed after the first three steps.\n\nTherefore, the sequence in option D is the only one that provides a chemically sound route to the target molecule.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. It has three substituents on a benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\nThe key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern, where all groups are in a *meta* relationship to one another.\n\n**2. Consider the Directing Effects of Substituents**\nThe order of reactions is critical and depends on the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Optimal Synthetic Route vs. The Offered Options**\nThe most efficient, high-yield synthesis would involve an order where the directing effects are cooperative or reinforcing. This would be:\n1.  **Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone.\n2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone → 3-Nitroacetophenone (The acetyl group directs the nitro group to the *meta* position).\n3.  **Bromination:** 3-Nitroacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one (Both the acetyl and nitro groups are *meta*-directors and they cooperatively direct the incoming bromine to the 5-position).\n\nThis optimal sequence is noted by several candidate answers but is not one of the options provided. We must therefore evaluate the given options to find the most plausible, even if imperfect, choice.\n\n**4. Analyze the Plausibility of Each Option**\n\n*   **Option A / C (variant):** Sequences starting with nitration followed by reduction to aniline (i, ii) and then attempting a Friedel-Crafts acylation (iii) are incorrect. Friedel-Crafts acylation fails on anilines because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring.\n\n*   **Option B (variant):** Sequences starting with bromination (i) followed by nitration (ii) are incorrect. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director, so nitration would primarily yield the 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene isomer, which does not have the required *meta* relationship for the target molecule.\n\n*   **Option D / B / C (variant):** A majority of the analyses point to one option that follows the sequence: **i) Acylation → ii) Bromination → iii) Nitration**.\n    *   **i) CH3COCl/AlCl3:** Benzene is acylated to form acetophenone. This is a valid first step, installing a *meta*-director.\n    *   **ii) Br2/FeBr3:** Acetophenone is brominated. The *meta*-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at the 3-position, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. At this stage, the ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH3) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br). Their effects are conflicting. The acetyl group directs to position 5, while the bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. This would lead to a mixture of products, making it not a \"high-yield\" synthesis. However, it is the only sequence among the options that can produce the desired product at all.\n\n*   **Other Flaws:** Many options contain nonsensical steps, such as a sequence of nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination that simply returns the starting material to benzene. The additional steps (iv-vii) in the plausible option are also superfluous, as the target molecule is formed after step (iii).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy elimination, the only chemically viable (though not optimal) route presented in the options is the one that proceeds via **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**. The other options contain steps that are chemically impossible (e.g., Friedel-Crafts on a nitro-ring or aniline) or lead to the wrong isomers. Therefore, the option containing this sequence is the correct answer, despite the questionable \"high-yield\" claim and the presence of nonsensical additional steps. Based on the provided candidate answers, this sequence is most frequently associated with option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a step-by-step analysis of the substitution pattern and directing effects is required.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   The parent structure is an acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   The substituents are located at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   Position 1: Acetyl group (-COCH3)\n    *   Position 3: Bromo group (-Br)\n    *   Position 5: Nitro group (-NO2)\n*   The key feature is that all three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to one another.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\nThe order of reactions is critical because existing substituents on the ring direct the position of incoming groups during electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence fails at step (iii). Friedel-Crafts acylation (adding the acetyl group) does not work on an aniline ring (formed in step ii). The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2), forming a strongly deactivated complex that prevents acylation of the ring.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...`\n    This sequence is nonsensical for this synthesis. Steps (i) through (iv) constitute the nitration of benzene, reduction to aniline, diazotization, and then deamination (removal of the amino group). This four-step process simply converts benzene back into benzene, making it a pointless loop.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence fails at step (iii). Step (i) produces bromobenzene. Step (ii) nitrates bromobenzene, which, being an *ortho, para*-director, yields mainly 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this product. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on strongly deactivated rings, such as those containing a nitro group.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This sequence is the only chemically viable route among the choices.\n    1.  **Step i) CH3COCl/AlCl3:** Benzene is acylated to form acetophenone. This correctly installs the acetyl group, which is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **Step ii) Br2/FeBr3:** Acetophenone is brominated. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the C3 position, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone. This correctly establishes the 1,3-relationship.\n    3.  **Step iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. The ring now has a strong *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The powerful meta-directing effect of the acetyl group guides the incoming nitro group to the C5 position. This reaction successfully yields the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThe synthesis is effectively complete after the first three steps. The subsequent steps listed in option C (iv-vii) are superfluous and appear to be distractors, but the initial sequence is the only one that correctly and logically leads to the desired product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Parent Structure:** Acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   Position 1: Acetyl group (-COCH3)\n    *   Position 3: Bromo group (-Br)\n    *   Position 5: Nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\nThe order of reactions is critical in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) because existing groups on the ring direct where new groups will attach.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n\n**3. Strategize the Synthesis**\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the most effective strategy is to install a *meta*-director first. This will help place the subsequent groups in the correct meta positions.\n\n**4. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\nLet's analyze each option based on fundamental organic chemistry principles.\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   This sequence starts with nitration (i) to form nitrobenzene, followed by reduction (ii) to form aniline.\n    *   Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction **fails**. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) is an acid, and the amino group (-NH2) on aniline is a base. They react with each other, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents the desired acylation. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ...**\n    *   Steps (i) through (iv) are nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination. This sequence converts benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, and finally back to benzene. This is a pointless loop that accomplishes nothing. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ...**\n    *   This option is very similar to A and fails for the same reason at step (iii): Friedel-Crafts acylation does not work on aniline. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    *   **Step (i):** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation to form acetophenone. This is an excellent first step, as the acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Step (ii):** Acetophenone is brominated. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   **Step (iii):** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. The ring now has a strong *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the C5 position. The bromo group directs to positions C2, C4, and C6. In such cases, the position that is least deactivated is favored. The positions ortho and para to the strongly deactivating acetyl group (C2, C4, C6) are highly unfavorable for electrophilic attack. The position meta to the acetyl group (C5) is the most favorable site. Therefore, nitration occurs at C5 to give the desired product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   **Steps (iv) - (vii):** These subsequent steps are nonsensical as the target molecule has already been formed in high yield by step (iii). They are included as distractors.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe first three steps of sequence D represent the only chemically sound and logical pathway to synthesize the target molecule among the given choices. The other options contain fatal flaws, such as attempting reactions that are known to fail or following a sequence that leads to incorrect isomers or is a pointless loop.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a step-by-step analysis of the substitution pattern and the directing effects of the functional groups is required.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.

Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\nThe key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern, where all substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\nThe order of reactions is critical and depends on the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Ideal Synthetic Pathway**\nFor a high-yield synthesis of a 1,3,5-trisubstituted product with two *meta*-directors, the best strategy is to use their reinforcing directing effects.\n*   **Ideal Path:** Acylation → Nitration → Bromination.\n    1.  **Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone → 3-Nitroacetophenone. The acetyl group directs the nitro group to the *meta* position.\n    3.  **Bromination:** 3-Nitroacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Both the acetyl (at C1) and nitro (at C3) groups are *meta*-directors. They both direct the incoming bromine to the C5 position. This reinforcing effect leads to a highly selective, high-yield reaction.\n\nThis ideal pathway is not listed as an option. Therefore, we must evaluate the given options to find the best available choice.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n    *   Steps i-iv constitute a nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination sequence. This converts benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, and finally back to benzene. This is a pointless loop and cannot be the correct synthesis.\n\n*   **B) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    *   **i) Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone. This is a valid first step, installing a *meta*-director.\n    *   **ii) Bromination:** Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone. The *meta*-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at the C3 position.\n    *   **iii) Nitration:** 3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. The bromo group directs to C2, C4, and C6. While the directing effects are conflicting, the acetyl group is a stronger deactivator, and its directing effect to the C5 position is significant, leading to the formation of the desired product. This is a plausible, if not perfectly optimal, synthesis. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are nonsensical distractors.\n\n*   **C) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n    *   **i) Bromination:** Benzene → Bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **ii) Nitration:** Bromobenzene → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product). This does not establish the required 1,3-*meta* relationship.

The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a strongly deactivated complex that prevents acylation of the ring. This path fails.\n\n**Conclusion**\nOptions A, C, and D contain fatal flaws: a pointless loop, incorrect regiochemistry, or an impossible reaction. Option B is the only sequence whose initial steps describe a chemically viable route to the target molecule. Although the nitration step (iii) involves conflicting directors, it is the only plausible pathway among the choices. The question asks for the sequence that would lead to the synthesis, and by elimination, only option B is possible.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1.

This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing the desired reaction.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   This sequence forms bromobenzene first. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Step (ii), nitration, would yield a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. It does not produce the required *meta* relationship.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...`\n    *   This sequence involves nitration, reduction to an amine, diazotization, and then deamination (removal of the amino group).\n    *   Steps (i) through (iv) convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, and finally back to benzene.

This is an excellent first step, as the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, which is needed to establish the 1,3,5-pattern.\n    *   **Step (ii):** Bromination of acetophenone. The *meta*-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at the 3-position, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   **Step (iii):** Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. The bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. In such cases, the position that is least deactivated and sterically accessible is favored. The position C5 is *meta* to the strong deactivating acetyl group, which is a favorable position for substitution. This step successfully yields the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe first three steps of Option C represent a chemically sound and logical pathway to synthesize the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are nonsensical and appear to be distractors, as the synthesis is complete after step (iii). By eliminating the other options which contain fatal chemical flaws in their initial steps, Option C is the only viable choice.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Strategy**\n\n*   **Target:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents: an acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1, a bromo group (-Br) at position 3, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern, where all groups are *meta* to each other.\n*   **Directing Effects:** To achieve this pattern, we must consider the directing effects of each group as it is added:\n    *   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Reaction Constraints:** Friedel-Crafts reactions (like acylation) fail on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., nitrobenzene) or on anilines.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Option Systematically**\n\nLet's analyze each proposed sequence based on these principles.\n\n*   **Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This is a standard and correct first step. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director, which is essential for establishing the 1,3,5-pattern.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** Acetophenone is brominated. The *meta*-directing acetyl group correctly directs the incoming bromine to the C3 position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. The ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the new nitro group to C5. The bromo group directs to C2, C4, and C6. Although the directing effects conflict, the position *meta* to the stronger deactivating group (-COCH3) is favored, leading to the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one as the major product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The first three steps of this sequence provide a chemically viable, albeit not perfectly regioselective, route to the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are nonsensical distractors, but the initial path is correct.\n\n*   **Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...**\n    1.  This sequence involves nitration, reduction to an amine, diazotization, and then deamination (removal of the amino group).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a pointless loop that converts benzene back into benzene. It is not a productive synthesis.\n\n*   **Option C: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    1.  **Step i & ii:** Bromination of benzene followed by nitration yields primarily 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, as the bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. This does not create the required *meta* relationship.\n    2.  **Step iii:** A Friedel-Crafts acylation is attempted on 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. This reaction fails because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is incorrect due to both wrong regiochemistry and a failed reaction step.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    1.  **Step i & ii:** Nitration of benzene followed by reduction yields aniline.\n    2.  **Step iii:** A Friedel-Crafts acylation is attempted on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a strongly deactivating complex that prevents acylation on the ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is incorrect due to a failed reaction step.\n\n**3. Final Decision**\n\nAfter analyzing all four options, only sequence A provides a chemically plausible route to the target molecule. Options B, C, and D contain either nonsensical steps or reactions that are known to fail under the specified conditions. The first three steps of Option A correctly build the molecule, making it the only valid choice, despite the superfluous steps listed at the end.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, we must analyze the directing effects of the substituents and the limitations of the reactions involved.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. It has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\nThis is a 1,3,5-substitution pattern, where all groups are in a *meta* relationship to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, the order of adding substituents is critical.\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an **ortho-, para-director**.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This is a standard and correct first step. The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n    2.  **ii) Bromination:** The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **iii) Nitration:** The ring now has a meta-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an ortho-, para-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. The bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. In such cases of conflicting directors, the stronger deactivating group's effect (the acetyl group) typically dominates, directing the substitution to the position meta to it (C5). This sequence is chemically viable and leads to the desired product. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous as the target molecule is already formed.\n\n*   **Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    1.  This sequence begins by forming nitrobenzene, which is then reduced to aniline.\n    2.  **iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This step attempts to perform an acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a strongly deactivated complex that prevents the acylation of the ring. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...**\n    1.  The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, and finally back to benzene. This is a pointless loop and does not advance the synthesis. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    1.  This sequence starts with bromination, followed by nitration. The bromo group is an ortho-, para-director, so this would primarily yield 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, which does not have the required meta-relationship.\n    2.  **iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This step attempts acylation on a bromo-nitro-benzene ring. The presence of the strongly deactivating nitro group prevents the Friedel-Crafts reaction from occurring. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOptions B, C, and D contain fatal chemical flaws that make them impossible routes. Option A is the only sequence where the initial steps are chemically sound and lead to the desired 1,3,5-substituted product. Although the nitration in step (iii) involves conflicting directors, it is known to produce the desired isomer as the major product. The additional steps (iv-vii) are nonsensical distractors, as the synthesis is effectively complete after step (iii). By elimination, Option A is the only plausible choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a step-by-step analysis of electrophilic aromatic substitution principles is required.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. It has three substituents on a benzene ring at positions 1, 3, and 5:\n*   **C1:** Acetyl group (-COCH3)\n*   **C3:** Bromo group (-Br)\n*   **C5:** Nitro group (-NO2)\nAll three groups are in a *meta* relationship to one another.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\nThe order of substitution is critical and is governed by the directing effects of the groups already on the ring:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n\n**3. Devise an Optimal Strategy**\nFor a high-yield synthesis of a 1,3,5-trisubstituted product with two *meta*-directing groups, the ideal strategy is to use their reinforcing effects.\n*   **Optimal Path:**\n    1.  **Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone. This adds a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone → 3-Nitroacetophenone. The acetyl group directs the nitro group to the *meta* position.\n    3.  **Bromination:** 3-Nitroacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Both the acetyl (at C1) and nitro (at C3) groups are *meta*-directors, and both direct the incoming bromine to the C5 position. This reinforcing effect ensures high regioselectivity and thus a high yield of the desired product.\n\nThis optimal sequence (Acylation → Nitration → Bromination) is not listed as an option. Therefore, we must evaluate the given options to find the \"best fit\" or the only chemically possible route.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    1.  **Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone. (Correct)\n    2.  **Bromination:** Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone. The *meta*-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at C3. (Correct)\n    3.  **Nitration:** 3-Bromoacetophenone is nitrated. Here, the directing effects are in conflict: the acetyl group (-COCH3) directs *meta* (to C5), while the bromo group (-Br) directs *ortho, para* (to C2, C4, C6). This conflict will lead to a mixture of isomers, making this a **low-yield** pathway for the target molecule. However, the reaction itself is possible.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...**\n    This sequence involves nitration, reduction to an amine, diazotization, and then deamination. This series of reactions converts benzene back into benzene, making the sequence nonsensical and unproductive. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    1.  **Bromination:** Benzene → Bromobenzene.\n    2.  **Nitration:** Bromobenzene → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product). This step does not create the required *meta* relationship.\n    3.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This reaction fails on strongly deactivated rings, such as one bearing a nitro group. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    1.  **Nitration:** Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n    2.  **Reduction:** Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n    3.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This reaction fails on aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a strongly deactivating complex that prevents acylation of the ring. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOptions B, C, and D contain steps that are chemically impossible or nonsensical. They would produce no significant amount of the desired product. Option A describes a sequence of reactions that are all possible, but the final nitration step is not regioselective and would result in a low yield of the target isomer due to conflicting directing groups.\n\nGiven that the question asks for the sequence that *would lead to* the synthesis and that options B, C, and D are fundamentally flawed (i.e., they fail completely), Option A is the only chemically plausible route, even if it does not meet the \"high-yield\" criterion perfectly. In the context of selecting the best answer from a flawed set of choices, the one that is merely inefficient is superior to those that are impossible.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, we must analyze the structure of the target molecule and the directing effects of the substituents at each step of the proposed syntheses.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   It has a benzene ring with three substituents.\n*   At position 1: an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n*   At position 3: a bromo group (-Br).\n*   At position 5: a nitro group (-NO2).\nThe key feature is the **1,3,5-substitution pattern**, where all groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n### 2.

The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Step ii) would nitrate bromobenzene, primarily at the para position, to give 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. This does not establish the required 1,3,5-pattern.\n    *   Furthermore, step iii), a Friedel-Crafts acylation, would fail on the strongly deactivated 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene ring.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   Step i) forms nitrobenzene, and step ii) reduces it to aniline.\n    *   Step iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline.

The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. While the bromo group directs to other positions (2, 4, 6), substitution at position 5 is a known outcome that yields the desired product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The first three steps of this sequence form a chemically plausible route to the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are nonsensical in this context and appear to be distractors. By a process of elimination, this is the only option that contains a viable synthetic pathway.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nWhile the nitration in step (iii) of Option C may not be perfectly selective due to conflicting directing effects, it is a plausible reaction. In contrast, Options A, B, and D contain steps that are either chemically impossible under the given conditions or are logically nonsensical.

This sequence converts benzene into nitrobenzene, then aniline, then a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is illogical as it involves a pointless loop that regenerates the starting material.\n\n*   **Option B: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    1.  **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene gives acetophenone. This is an excellent first step, as the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, which is needed to establish the 1,3,5-pattern.\n    2.  **Step ii:** Bromination of acetophenone. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the C3 position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step iii:** Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho,para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the C5 position. While the bromo group directs elsewhere, the strong deactivating effect of the acetyl group makes the position *meta* to it (C5) the most favorable site for the final substitution. This step successfully yields the target molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The first three steps of Option B represent a chemically sound, albeit not perfectly selective, pathway to the desired product.

Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Name:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   **Substituents:** The benzene ring has three groups:\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH3)\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br)\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The groups are at positions 1, 3, and 5. This means all substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other.\n\n### **2. Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects**\n\nThe order of reactions is critical because existing substituents on the ring direct where new groups will be added.\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Evaluation of the Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on established principles of organic chemistry.\n\n*   **Option A: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    *   The first step, bromination, creates bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   The second step, nitration, would therefore produce a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene.\n    *   This route fails to establish the required 1,3,5-*meta* relationship.\n\n*   **Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   This sequence begins with nitration to form nitrobenzene, followed by reduction to aniline (-NH2).\n    *   The third step is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a strongly deactivated complex that prevents acylation on the ring.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...**\n    *   The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) serve to convert benzene into nitrobenzene, then aniline, and finally back to benzene.\n    *   This is a pointless loop that does not advance the synthesis.\n\n*   **Option C: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    1.  **Step i) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This is a standard and effective first step. The resulting acetyl group is a **meta-director**.\n    2.  **Step ii) Bromination:** The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the C3 position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone. This establishes the 1,3 relationship between the first two substituents.\n    3.  **Step iii) Nitration:** The ring now has a meta-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an ortho, para-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the C5 position. The bromo group directs to positions C2, C4, and C6. In such cases of conflicting directors, the outcome depends on the relative activating/deactivating strengths. The acetyl group is a stronger deactivator, making the positions ortho and para to it (C2, C4, C6) less reactive. The position that is meta to the strongest deactivating group (C5) is favored, leading to the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe sequence outlined in the first three steps of **Option C** is the only chemically viable route among the choices that leads to the correct 1,3,5-substitution pattern. Options A, B, and D contain fundamental flaws that make them incorrect. The additional steps (iv-vii) listed in Option C are superfluous and likely included as distractors, as the target molecule is successfully formed after the third step.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Substituents:** It has three groups attached to the benzene ring:\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH3)\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br)\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Positions:** The substitution pattern is 1, 3, 5. This means all substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects\n\nThe order of reactions is critical because existing substituents on the ring direct the position of incoming groups.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n\n### 3. Evaluation of Synthetic Strategies\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be carefully planned. The most effective strategies involve installing a *meta*-director first to guide subsequent substitutions.\n\n*   **Strategy 1: Start with Acylation.** This is the most logical first step.\n    *   **Step i: Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone.** This installs the acetyl group, which is a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Step ii: Bromination of Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at the C3 position.\n    *   **Step iii: Nitration of 3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** At this stage, the ring has a strong *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The powerful deactivating effect of the acetyl group makes the positions ortho and para to it (C2, C4, C6) less reactive. The acetyl group strongly directs the incoming nitro group to the other *meta* position (C5). Therefore, nitration preferentially occurs at C5, yielding the desired product.\n\n*   **Strategy 2: Start with Nitration or Bromination.**\n    *   If the first step is bromination, an *ortho, para*-director is installed. The subsequent nitration would yield primarily the 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene isomer, which is incorrect.\n    *   If the first step is nitration, a strongly deactivating nitro group is installed. A subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation (to add the acetyl group) would fail because these reactions do not work on strongly deactivated rings.\n\n### 4. Conclusion on the Correct Sequence\n\nThe only chemically viable pathway among the fundamental options is to perform the reactions in the following order:\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n2.  **Bromination**\n3.  **Nitration**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to the first three steps of option D as described by a majority of the provided analyses. The other options (A, B, C) contain chemically impossible steps (e.g., Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline or nitrobenzene) or follow a synthetic route that would produce the wrong isomers. The additional steps (iv-vii) listed in option D are nonsensical for this synthesis and appear to be distractors, as the target molecule is successfully formed after the first three steps.\n\nTherefore, the sequence in option D is the only one that provides a chemically sound route to the target molecule.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. It has three substituents on a benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\nThe key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern, where all groups are in a *meta* relationship to one another.\n\n**2. Consider the Directing Effects of Substituents**\nThe order of reactions is critical and depends on the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution:\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Optimal Synthetic Route vs. The Offered Options**\nThe most efficient, high-yield synthesis would involve an order where the directing effects are cooperative or reinforcing. This would be:\n1.  **Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone.\n2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone → 3-Nitroacetophenone (The acetyl group directs the nitro group to the *meta* position).\n3.  **Bromination:** 3-Nitroacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one (Both the acetyl and nitro groups are *meta*-directors and they cooperatively direct the incoming bromine to the 5-position).\n\nThis optimal sequence is noted by several candidate answers but is not one of the options provided. We must therefore evaluate the given options to find the most plausible, even if imperfect, choice.\n\n**4. Analyze the Plausibility of Each Option**\n\n*   **Option A / C (variant):** Sequences starting with nitration followed by reduction to aniline (i, ii) and then attempting a Friedel-Crafts acylation (iii) are incorrect. Friedel-Crafts acylation fails on anilines because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring.\n\n*   **Option B (variant):** Sequences starting with bromination (i) followed by nitration (ii) are incorrect. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director, so nitration would primarily yield the 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene isomer, which does not have the required *meta* relationship for the target molecule.\n\n*   **Option D / B / C (variant):** A majority of the analyses point to one option that follows the sequence: **i) Acylation → ii) Bromination → iii) Nitration**.\n    *   **i) CH3COCl/AlCl3:** Benzene is acylated to form acetophenone. This is a valid first step, installing a *meta*-director.\n    *   **ii) Br2/FeBr3:** Acetophenone is brominated. The *meta*-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at the 3-position, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. At this stage, the ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH3) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br). Their effects are conflicting. The acetyl group directs to position 5, while the bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. This would lead to a mixture of products, making it not a \"high-yield\" synthesis. However, it is the only sequence among the options that can produce the desired product at all.\n\n*   **Other Flaws:** Many options contain nonsensical steps, such as a sequence of nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination that simply returns the starting material to benzene. The additional steps (iv-vii) in the plausible option are also superfluous, as the target molecule is formed after step (iii).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy elimination, the only chemically viable (though not optimal) route presented in the options is the one that proceeds via **Acylation → Bromination → Nitration**. The other options contain steps that are chemically impossible (e.g., Friedel-Crafts on a nitro-ring or aniline) or lead to the wrong isomers. Therefore, the option containing this sequence is the correct answer, despite the questionable \"high-yield\" claim and the presence of nonsensical additional steps. Based on the provided candidate answers, this sequence is most frequently associated with option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a step-by-step analysis of the substitution pattern and directing effects is required.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   The parent structure is an acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   The substituents are located at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n    *   Position 1: Acetyl group (-COCH3)\n    *   Position 3: Bromo group (-Br)\n    *   Position 5: Nitro group (-NO2)\n*   The key feature is that all three substituents are in a *meta* relationship to one another.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of the Substituents**\nThe order of reactions is critical because existing substituents on the ring direct the position of incoming groups during electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence fails at step (iii). Friedel-Crafts acylation (adding the acetyl group) does not work on an aniline ring (formed in step ii). The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2), forming a strongly deactivated complex that prevents acylation of the ring.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...`\n    This sequence is nonsensical for this synthesis. Steps (i) through (iv) constitute the nitration of benzene, reduction to aniline, diazotization, and then deamination (removal of the amino group). This four-step process simply converts benzene back into benzene, making it a pointless loop.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence fails at step (iii). Step (i) produces bromobenzene. Step (ii) nitrates bromobenzene, which, being an *ortho, para*-director, yields mainly 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this product. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on strongly deactivated rings, such as those containing a nitro group.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This sequence is the only chemically viable route among the choices.\n    1.  **Step i) CH3COCl/AlCl3:** Benzene is acylated to form acetophenone. This correctly installs the acetyl group, which is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **Step ii) Br2/FeBr3:** Acetophenone is brominated. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the C3 position, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone. This correctly establishes the 1,3-relationship.\n    3.  **Step iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. The ring now has a strong *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The powerful meta-directing effect of the acetyl group guides the incoming nitro group to the C5 position. This reaction successfully yields the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThe synthesis is effectively complete after the first three steps. The subsequent steps listed in option C (iv-vii) are superfluous and appear to be distractors, but the initial sequence is the only one that correctly and logically leads to the desired product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Parent Structure:** Acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   Position 1: Acetyl group (-COCH3)\n    *   Position 3: Bromo group (-Br)\n    *   Position 5: Nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\nThe order of reactions is critical in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) because existing groups on the ring direct where new groups will attach.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n\n**3. Strategize the Synthesis**\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the most effective strategy is to install a *meta*-director first. This will help place the subsequent groups in the correct meta positions.\n\n**4. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\nLet's analyze each option based on fundamental organic chemistry principles.\n\n*   **Option A: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   This sequence starts with nitration (i) to form nitrobenzene, followed by reduction (ii) to form aniline.\n    *   Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction **fails**. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) is an acid, and the amino group (-NH2) on aniline is a base. They react with each other, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents the desired acylation. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ...**\n    *   Steps (i) through (iv) are nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination. This sequence converts benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, and finally back to benzene. This is a pointless loop that accomplishes nothing. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; iv) Br2/FeBr3 ...**\n    *   This option is very similar to A and fails for the same reason at step (iii): Friedel-Crafts acylation does not work on aniline. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    *   **Step (i):** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation to form acetophenone. This is an excellent first step, as the acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Step (ii):** Acetophenone is brominated. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   **Step (iii):** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. The ring now has a strong *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the C5 position. The bromo group directs to positions C2, C4, and C6. In such cases, the position that is least deactivated is favored. The positions ortho and para to the strongly deactivating acetyl group (C2, C4, C6) are highly unfavorable for electrophilic attack. The position meta to the acetyl group (C5) is the most favorable site.

The powerful meta-directing effect of the acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the other meta position (C5). This gives the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This is a viable reaction that produces the target molecule.\n    *   The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous as the target molecule has already been synthesized.

By elimination of the other non-viable options, this is the correct choice.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This is a benzene ring with three substituents:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\nThe key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern, where all substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\nThe order of reactions is critical and depends on the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Ideal Synthetic Pathway**\nFor a high-yield synthesis of a 1,3,5-trisubstituted product with two *meta*-directors, the best strategy is to use their reinforcing directing effects.\n*   **Ideal Path:** Acylation → Nitration → Bromination.\n    1.  **Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone → 3-Nitroacetophenone. The acetyl group directs the nitro group to the *meta* position.\n    3.  **Bromination:** 3-Nitroacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Both the acetyl (at C1) and nitro (at C3) groups are *meta*-directors. They both direct the incoming bromine to the C5 position. This reinforcing effect leads to a highly selective, high-yield reaction.\n\nThis ideal pathway is not listed as an option. Therefore, we must evaluate the given options to find the best available choice.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\n\n*   **A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4**\n    *   Steps i-iv constitute a nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination sequence. This converts benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, and finally back to benzene. This is a pointless loop and cannot be the correct synthesis.\n\n*   **B) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\n    *   **i) Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone. This is a valid first step, installing a *meta*-director.\n    *   **ii) Bromination:** Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone. The *meta*-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at the C3 position.\n    *   **iii) Nitration:** 3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. The bromo group directs to C2, C4, and C6. While the directing effects are conflicting, the acetyl group is a stronger deactivator, and its directing effect to the C5 position is significant, leading to the formation of the desired product. This is a plausible, if not perfectly optimal, synthesis. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are nonsensical distractors.\n\n*   **C) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n    *   **i) Bromination:** Benzene → Bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **ii) Nitration:** Bromobenzene → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product). This does not establish the required 1,3-*meta* relationship. This path fails.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n    *   **i) Nitration:** Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n    *   **ii) Reduction:** Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n    *   **iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This reaction fails on aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a strongly deactivated complex that prevents acylation of the ring. This path fails.\n\n**Conclusion**\nOptions A, C, and D contain fatal flaws: a pointless loop, incorrect regiochemistry, or an impossible reaction. Option B is the only sequence whose initial steps describe a chemically viable route to the target molecule. Although the nitration step (iii) involves conflicting directors, it is the only plausible pathway among the choices. The question asks for the sequence that would lead to the synthesis, and by elimination, only option B is possible.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   The parent structure is acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   The substituents are at positions 1 (-COCH3), 3 (-Br), and 5 (-NO2).\n*   This is a **1,3,5-substitution pattern**, meaning all three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\nThe order of reactions is critical in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) because existing groups on the ring direct where new groups will attach.\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's analyze the initial, most critical steps of each sequence.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   This sequence forms nitrobenzene, then reduces it to aniline (-NH2).\n    *   Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing the desired reaction.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   This sequence forms bromobenzene first. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Step (ii), nitration, would yield a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. It does not produce the required *meta* relationship.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...`\n    *   This sequence involves nitration, reduction to an amine, diazotization, and then deamination (removal of the amino group).\n    *   Steps (i) through (iv) convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, and finally back to benzene. This is a pointless loop and does not advance the synthesis.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   **Step (i):** Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene yields acetophenone. This is an excellent first step, as the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, which is needed to establish the 1,3,5-pattern.\n    *   **Step (ii):** Bromination of acetophenone. The *meta*-directing acetyl group correctly places the bromine at the 3-position, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    *   **Step (iii):** Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. The bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. In such cases, the position that is least deactivated and sterically accessible is favored. The position C5 is *meta* to the strong deactivating acetyl group, which is a favorable position for substitution. This step successfully yields the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe first three steps of Option C represent a chemically sound and logical pathway to synthesize the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are nonsensical and appear to be distractors, as the synthesis is complete after step (iii). By eliminating the other options which contain fatal chemical flaws in their initial steps, Option C is the only viable choice.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Strategy**\n\n*   **Target:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents: an acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1, a bromo group (-Br) at position 3, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern, where all groups are *meta* to each other.\n*   **Directing Effects:** To achieve this pattern, we must consider the directing effects of each group as it is added:\n    *   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Reaction Constraints:** Friedel-Crafts reactions (like acylation) fail on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., nitrobenzene) or on anilines.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Option Systematically**\n\nLet's analyze each proposed sequence based on these principles.\n\n*   **Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This is a standard and correct first step. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director, which is essential for establishing the 1,3,5-pattern.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** Acetophenone is brominated. The *meta*-directing acetyl group correctly directs the incoming bromine to the C3 position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** 3-bromoacetophenone is nitrated. The ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the new nitro group to C5. The bromo group directs to C2, C4, and C6. Although the directing effects conflict, the position *meta* to the stronger deactivating group (-COCH3) is favored, leading to the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one as the major product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The first three steps of this sequence provide a chemically viable, albeit not perfectly regioselective, route to the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are nonsensical distractors, but the initial path is correct.\n\n*   **Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...**\n    1.  This sequence involves nitration, reduction to an amine, diazotization, and then deamination (removal of the amino group).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a pointless loop that converts benzene back into benzene. It is not a productive synthesis.\n\n*   **Option C: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    1.  **Step i & ii:** Bromination of benzene followed by nitration yields primarily 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, as the bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. This does not create the required *meta* relationship.\n    2.  **Step iii:** A Friedel-Crafts acylation is attempted on 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. This reaction fails because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is incorrect due to both wrong regiochemistry and a failed reaction step.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    1.  **Step i & ii:** Nitration of benzene followed by reduction yields aniline.\n    2.  **Step iii:** A Friedel-Crafts acylation is attempted on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a strongly deactivating complex that prevents acylation on the ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is incorrect due to a failed reaction step.\n\n**3. Final Decision**\n\nAfter analyzing all four options, only sequence A provides a chemically plausible route to the target molecule. Options B, C, and D contain either nonsensical steps or reactions that are known to fail under the specified conditions. The first three steps of Option A correctly build the molecule, making it the only valid choice, despite the superfluous steps listed at the end.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, we must analyze the directing effects of the substituents and the limitations of the reactions involved.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. It has three substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n*   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n*   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\nThis is a 1,3,5-substitution pattern, where all groups are in a *meta* relationship to each other.\n\n**2.

Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\n*   **Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This is a standard and correct first step. The acetyl group is a meta-director.\n    2.  **ii) Bromination:** The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **iii) Nitration:** The ring now has a meta-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an ortho-, para-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. The bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. In such cases of conflicting directors, the stronger deactivating group's effect (the acetyl group) typically dominates, directing the substitution to the position meta to it (C5). This sequence is chemically viable and leads to the desired product. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous as the target molecule is already formed.\n\n*   **Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    1.  This sequence begins by forming nitrobenzene, which is then reduced to aniline.\n    2.  **iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This step attempts to perform an acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a strongly deactivated complex that prevents the acylation of the ring. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...**\n    1.  The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, and finally back to benzene.

This sequence starts with bromination, followed by nitration. The bromo group is an ortho-, para-director, so this would primarily yield 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, which does not have the required meta-relationship.\n    2.  **iii) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This step attempts acylation on a bromo-nitro-benzene ring. The presence of the strongly deactivating nitro group prevents the Friedel-Crafts reaction from occurring. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOptions B, C, and D contain fatal chemical flaws that make them impossible routes. Option A is the only sequence where the initial steps are chemically sound and lead to the desired 1,3,5-substituted product. Although the nitration in step (iii) involves conflicting directors, it is known to produce the desired isomer as the major product. The additional steps (iv-vii) are nonsensical distractors, as the synthesis is effectively complete after step (iii).

Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. It has three substituents on a benzene ring at positions 1, 3, and 5:\n*   **C1:** Acetyl group (-COCH3)\n*   **C3:** Bromo group (-Br)\n*   **C5:** Nitro group (-NO2)\nAll three groups are in a *meta* relationship to one another.\n\n**2.

Devise an Optimal Strategy**\nFor a high-yield synthesis of a 1,3,5-trisubstituted product with two *meta*-directing groups, the ideal strategy is to use their reinforcing effects.\n*   **Optimal Path:**\n    1.  **Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone. This adds a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **Nitration:** Acetophenone → 3-Nitroacetophenone. The acetyl group directs the nitro group to the *meta* position.\n    3.  **Bromination:** 3-Nitroacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Both the acetyl (at C1) and nitro (at C3) groups are *meta*-directors, and both direct the incoming bromine to the C5 position. This reinforcing effect ensures high regioselectivity and thus a high yield of the desired product.\n\nThis optimal sequence (Acylation → Nitration → Bromination) is not listed as an option. Therefore, we must evaluate the given options to find the \"best fit\" or the only chemically possible route.\n\n**4.

Here, the directing effects are in conflict: the acetyl group (-COCH3) directs *meta* (to C5), while the bromo group (-Br) directs *ortho, para* (to C2, C4, C6). This conflict will lead to a mixture of isomers, making this a **low-yield** pathway for the target molecule. However, the reaction itself is possible.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...**\n    This sequence involves nitration, reduction to an amine, diazotization, and then deamination.

They would produce no significant amount of the desired product. Option A describes a sequence of reactions that are all possible, but the final nitration step is not regioselective and would result in a low yield of the target isomer due to conflicting directing groups.\n\nGiven that the question asks for the sequence that *would lead to* the synthesis and that options B, C, and D are fundamentally flawed (i.e., they fail completely), Option A is the only chemically plausible route, even if it does not meet the \"high-yield\" criterion perfectly.

This does not establish the required 1,3,5-pattern.\n    *   Furthermore, step iii), a Friedel-Crafts acylation, would fail on the strongly deactivated 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene ring.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option A is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   Step i) forms nitrobenzene, and step ii) reduces it to aniline.\n    *   Step iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents acylation.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...**\n    *   The first four steps (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) constitute a sequence that converts benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, and finally back to benzene. This is a pointless loop and does not advance the synthesis.\n    *   **Conclusion: Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    *   **Step i):** Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene forms acetophenone. This is an excellent first step, as the acetyl group is a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Step ii):** Bromination of acetophenone. The *meta*-directing acetyl group correctly directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone. This correctly establishes the 1,3-relationship.\n    *   **Step iii):** Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. While the bromo group directs to other positions (2, 4, 6), substitution at position 5 is a known outcome that yields the desired product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The first three steps of this sequence form a chemically plausible route to the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are nonsensical in this context and appear to be distractors. By a process of elimination, this is the only option that contains a viable synthetic pathway.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nWhile the nitration in step (iii) of Option C may not be perfectly selective due to conflicting directing effects, it is a plausible reaction. In contrast, Options A, B, and D contain steps that are either chemically impossible under the given conditions or are logically nonsensical. Therefore, the sequence described in Option C is the only one that could lead to the synthesis of the target molecule.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Substituent Effects**\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern, where all groups are *meta* to each other.\n*   **Directing Effects in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution:**\n    *   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Reaction Constraints:**\n    *   Friedel-Crafts reactions (like acylation with CH3COCl/AlCl3) fail on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., those with a -NO2 group).\n    *   Friedel-Crafts reactions also fail on aniline (-NH2) because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amine group, deactivating the ring.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Option Systematically**\n\nWe will now analyze each proposed sequence to see if it is chemically viable and leads to the correct 1,3,5-substitution pattern.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; v) Br2/FeBr3 ; vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; vii) HNO3/H2SO4`\n    *   Steps i-iv (Nitration -> Reduction -> Diazotization -> Deamination) convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, and finally back to benzene. This is a pointless and inefficient loop at the start of a synthesis.\n    *   **Constraint Check:** This sequence is illogical. **FAIL**\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...`\n    *   Step i: Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n    *   Step ii: Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n    *   Step iii: Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation). This reaction fails. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents the desired acylation.\n    *   **Constraint Check:** This sequence fails at step (iii). **FAIL**\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...`\n    *   Step i: Benzene → Bromobenzene. The -Br group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Step ii: Bromobenzene → 1-Bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major product) and 1-Bromo-2-nitrobenzene. This step does not produce the required *meta* relationship between the first two substituents.\n    *   Step iii: Friedel-Crafts acylation is attempted on a ring that contains a strongly deactivating nitro group. This reaction would fail or give an extremely low yield.\n    *   **Constraint Check:** This sequence fails on regiochemistry (step ii) and reaction viability (step iii). **FAIL**\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...`\n    *   **Step i: Benzene → Acetophenone.** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director, which is a good start for building a 1,3,5-pattern.\n    *   **Step ii: Acetophenone → 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group correctly directs the incoming bromine to the C3 position.\n    *   **Step iii: 3-Bromoacetophenone → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** This is the nitration step. The ring has a *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The powerful deactivating and *meta*-directing acetyl group will strongly favor substitution at the other *meta* position (C5). This step successfully yields the target molecule.\n    *   **Steps iv-vii:** These subsequent steps are nonsensical for this synthesis and appear to be distractors. The synthesis is effectively complete after step (iii).\n    *   **Constraint Check:** The first three steps represent a viable, logical pathway to the target molecule. The other options are fundamentally flawed. **PASS**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically evaluating each option against fundamental principles of organic chemistry, we can eliminate options A, B, and D due to incorrect regiochemistry or reactions that are known to fail under the specified conditions. Option C is the only choice that presents a chemically sound sequence in its initial steps to produce the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. The superfluous and incorrect later steps in the option are distractors.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Substituent Effects**\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The groups are at positions 1, 3, and 5. This means all substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Viability of Each Proposed Sequence**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to identify a sequence where the directing effects of the substituents guide subsequent additions to the correct positions, and to recognize reactions that are known to fail under certain conditions.\n\n*   **Option A: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    1.  Bromination of benzene gives bromobenzene. The -Br group is an *o,p*-director.\n    2.  Nitration of bromobenzene gives mainly 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. This does not establish the required *meta* relationship.\n    3.  Furthermore, step (iii), a Friedel-Crafts acylation, would fail on the strongly deactivated 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is incorrect due to wrong regiochemistry and a failed reaction step.\n\n*   **Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    1.  Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene.\n    2.  Reduction of nitrobenzene gives aniline (-NH2).\n    3.  Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH2) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a strongly deactivated complex that prevents acylation of the ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C is incorrect because a key reaction step is not viable.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...**\n    1.  The first four steps constitute a sequence of nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination. This sequence converts benzene into nitrobenzene, then aniline, then a diazonium salt, and finally back to benzene.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is illogical as it involves a pointless loop that regenerates the starting material.\n\n*   **Option B: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    1.  **Step i:** Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene gives acetophenone. This is an excellent first step, as the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, which is needed to establish the 1,3,5-pattern.\n    2.  **Step ii:** Bromination of acetophenone. The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the C3 position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step iii:** Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho,para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the C5 position. While the bromo group directs elsewhere, the strong deactivating effect of the acetyl group makes the position *meta* to it (C5) the most favorable site for the final substitution. This step successfully yields the target molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The first three steps of Option B represent a chemically sound, albeit not perfectly selective, pathway to the desired product. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous and likely included as distractors. Among the given choices, this is the only sequence that contains a viable synthetic route.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful step-by-step analysis of each proposed route is necessary, focusing on the directing effects of the substituents.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Name:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   **Substituents:** The benzene ring has three groups:\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH3)\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br)\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The groups are at positions 1, 3, and 5. This means all substituents are in a *meta* relationship to each other.\n\n### **2. Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects**\n\nThe order of reactions is critical because existing substituents on the ring direct where new groups will be added.\n*   **-COCH3 (acetyl):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO2 (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Evaluation of the Options**\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on established principles of organic chemistry.\n\n*   **Option A: i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    *   The first step, bromination, creates bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   The second step, nitration, would therefore produce a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene.\n    *   This route fails to establish the required 1,3,5-*meta* relationship.\n\n*   **Option B: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   This sequence begins with nitration to form nitrobenzene, followed by reduction to aniline (-NH2).\n    *   The third step is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a strongly deactivated complex that prevents acylation on the ring.\n\n*   **Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...**\n    *   The first four steps of this sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) serve to convert benzene into nitrobenzene, then aniline, and finally back to benzene.\n    *   This is a pointless loop that does not advance the synthesis.\n\n*   **Option C: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    1.  **Step i) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This is a standard and effective first step. The resulting acetyl group is a **meta-director**.\n    2.  **Step ii) Bromination:** The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the C3 position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone. This establishes the 1,3 relationship between the first two substituents.\n    3.  **Step iii) Nitration:** The ring now has a meta-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an ortho, para-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the C5 position. The bromo group directs to positions C2, C4, and C6. In such cases of conflicting directors, the outcome depends on the relative activating/deactivating strengths. The acetyl group is a stronger deactivator, making the positions ortho and para to it (C2, C4, C6) less reactive. The position that is meta to the strongest deactivating group (C5) is favored, leading to the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe sequence outlined in the first three steps of **Option C** is the only chemically viable route among the choices that leads to the correct 1,3,5-substitution pattern. Options A, B, and D contain fundamental flaws that make them incorrect. The additional steps (iv-vii) listed in Option C are superfluous and likely included as distractors, as the target molecule is successfully formed after the third step.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
