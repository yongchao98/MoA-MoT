Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, synthesizing the provided candidate answers and highlighting the careful points needed to arrive at the correct conclusion.

### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question and Identify the Core Physical Principle

The question asks to identify which particle is *not* associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry (SSB). The primary physical principle that connects particles to SSB is **Goldstone's Theorem**.

*   **Goldstone's Theorem**: This theorem states that for every continuous global symmetry that is spontaneously broken, a massless (or very low-mass) particle must emerge. This particle is called a **Nambu-Goldstone boson**.
*   **Interpretation**: The phrase "associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry" in this context means "being the Goldstone boson that arises from the symmetry breaking." The task is to find the particle on the list that is not a Goldstone boson.

### Step 2: Analyze Each Particle Based on the Unanimous Physical Consensus

All 15 candidate answers, despite variations in their final letter choice (due to different option orderings in their original prompts), are in complete agreement on the physical nature of each particle.

*   **A) Pion**: The pion is the quintessential example of a **pseudo-Goldstone boson**. It arises from the spontaneous breaking of an *approximate* symmetry (chiral symmetry) in the theory of the strong force (QCD). It is directly associated with SSB.
*   **C) Magnon**: The magnon is the Goldstone boson that results from the spontaneous breaking of *rotational symmetry* in a ferromagnet (where all atomic spins align in one direction). It is directly associated with SSB.
*   **D) Phonon**: The (acoustic) phonon is the Goldstone boson that results from the spontaneous breaking of *translational symmetry* when atoms form a crystal lattice. It is directly associated with SSB.
*   **B) Skyrmion**: The skyrmion is a **topological soliton**. It is a stable, particle-like "knot" or "twist" in a field. It is fundamentally different from a Goldstone boson.

### Step 3: List and Address the Careful Points and Nuances

1.  **Pion as a "Pseudo"-Goldstone Boson**: A key point is that pions are not perfectly massless. This is because the chiral symmetry they originate from is not perfect; it is explicitly broken by the small masses of the up and down quarks. However, their existence and relatively low mass are a direct and celebrated consequence of SSB, so they are firmly "associated" with it.

2.  **The Skyrmion's Relationship with SSB**: This is the most critical nuance. Skyrmions often appear in theories that also feature SSB. For instance, the original Skyrme model described protons and neutrons as skyrmions made from the pion field. The pions are the Goldstone bosons, but the skyrmion is a stable, massive, non-linear configuration *of* that field. Its stability comes from its topology (it has a "winding number" that is conserved), not from Goldstone's theorem. Therefore, while it can exist in a system with SSB, it is not the Goldstone boson itself.

3.  **"Associated with"**: The question's wording could be seen as ambiguous. However, in the context of SSB, the most direct and defining association is the particle predicted by Goldstone's theorem. The pion, magnon, and phonon are all this type of particle. The skyrmion's association is indirect; it's a different kind of object that can be built in a system that also has Goldstone bosons.

### Step 4: Synthesize and Conclude

The analysis reveals a clear classification:
*   **Goldstone Bosons (or pseudo-type)**: Pion, Magnon, Phonon. Their existence is a direct consequence of Goldstone's theorem applied to a specific broken symmetry.
*   **Topological Soliton**: Skyrmion. Its existence and stability are guaranteed by the topology of the field configuration, a different physical principle.

Therefore, the skyrmion is the particle that is not a Goldstone boson and is the correct answer. Matching this to the provided options:

A) Pion
B) Skyrmion
C) Magnon
D) Phonon

The correct option is B.
