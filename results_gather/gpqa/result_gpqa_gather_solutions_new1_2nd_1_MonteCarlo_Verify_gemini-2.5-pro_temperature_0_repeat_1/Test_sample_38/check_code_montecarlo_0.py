def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the provided answer for the quantum mechanics problem.

    The problem requires finding the normalization constant 'a' for the wave function:
    ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i
    The particle is confined to the region 1 <= x <= 3.

    The normalization condition is: ∫[from 1 to 3] |ψ(x)|² dx = 1

    1.  Calculate the probability density |ψ(x)|²:
        |ψ(x)|² = (Real part)² + (Imaginary part)²
        |ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)²
        |ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25

    2.  Solve the definite integral:
        ∫[1,3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx
        = [a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25x] from 1 to 3
        = (a² * ln(4) + 0.25*3) - (a² * ln(2) + 0.25*1)
        = a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + (0.75 - 0.25)
        = a² * ln(2) + 0.5

    3.  Set the result to 1 and solve for 'a':
        a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
        a² * ln(2) = 0.5
        a² = 0.5 / ln(2)
        a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))
