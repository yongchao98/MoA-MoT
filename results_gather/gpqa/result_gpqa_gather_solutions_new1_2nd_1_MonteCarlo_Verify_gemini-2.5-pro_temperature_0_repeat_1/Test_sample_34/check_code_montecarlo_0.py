    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer to the quantum mechanics question.

    The original question's statements are:
    A) The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.
    B) The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are +2πh or –2πh, and the real part of that are +h/4π or –h/4π.
    C) The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are +1/2 or –1/2, and the real part of that are +1 or –1.
    D) The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

    The provided final answer is 'A'. This code will check if statement A is factually correct.
