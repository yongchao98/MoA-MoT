    # --- Physics Calculation ---

    # 1. The luminosity ratio is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
    # L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4
    radius_ratio_squared = radius_ratio ** 2

    # 2. The temperature ratio is related to the intrinsic (rest) peak wavelengths
    # by Wien's Displacement Law: T1/T2 = lambda_rest_2 / lambda_rest_1

    # 3. The problem states the *observed* peak wavelengths are the same.
    # We must use the Doppler effect to relate observed to rest wavelengths.
    # lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt((1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)) (relativistic)
    # For v << c, this approximates to lambda_obs â‰ˆ lambda_rest * (1 + v/c)
    # Since v2 is only ~0.23% of c, the non-relativistic approximation is sufficient
    # and matches the logic used in the provided answers.

    # For Star 1 (v1=0): lambda_obs_1 = lambda_rest_1
    # For Star 2 (v2=700): lambda_obs_2 = lambda_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c)

    # 4. Since lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2:
    # lambda_rest_1 = lambda_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c)

    # 5. Rearranging to find the ratio for the temperature calculation:
    # lambda_rest_2 / lambda_rest_1 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)

    # 6. Therefore, the temperature ratio is:
    # T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)
    temperature_ratio = 1.0 / (1.0 + v2 / c)

    # 7. Substitute back into the luminosity ratio formula:
    # L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4
    calculated_ratio = radius_ratio_squared * (temperature_ratio ** 4)
