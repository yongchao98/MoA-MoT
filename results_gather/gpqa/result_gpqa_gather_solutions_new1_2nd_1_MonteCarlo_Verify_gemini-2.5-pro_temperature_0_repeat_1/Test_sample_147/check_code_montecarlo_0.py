This is a complex chemical puzzle that requires a step-by-step deduction, prioritizing the most reliable clues. The candidate answers present two main hypotheses: one centered on Krypton (Kr) and the other on Gold (Au). A careful analysis reveals the most logical path.

**Step 1: Analyze the Quantitative Clue (Mass Percentage)**

The most reliable starting point is the mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in substance A2, which is 31.96%. Let the formula of A2 be YFₙ. The molar mass of element Y, M(Y), can be calculated using the formula:
M(Y) ≈ 40.45 × n

Testing small integer values for 'n' gives us the most likely candidates for Y:
*   **n=2**: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol. This is very close to **Krypton (Kr)** (83.8 g/mol). The theoretical ɷF for KrF₂ is ~31.2%, a reasonable match.
*   **n=3**: M(Y) ≈ 121.4 g/mol. This is an excellent match for **Antimony (Sb)** (121.8 g/mol). The theoretical ɷF for SbF₃ is ~31.9%.
*   **n=5**: M(Y) ≈ 202.3 g/mol. This is close to **Gold (Au)** (197.0 g/mol). The theoretical ɷF for AuF₅ is ~32.5%, a reasonable match.
*   **n=6**: M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is an excellent match for **Americium (Am)** (243 g/mol). The theoretical ɷF for AmF₆ is ~31.9%.

**Step 2: Analyze the Most Restrictive Clue (1:1 Molar Reaction)**

The clue "By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to... A4, A5 can be obtained" is the most specific and chemically restrictive. It describes a comproportionation reaction where the reactants are in a perfect 1:1 ratio.

Let's test our main candidates against this clue:
*   **Antimony (Sb):** The relevant reaction is `2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃`. The reactant ratio is 2:3, not 1:1. This hypothesis fails.
*   **Americium (Am):** The reaction `Am + AmF₄ → 2AmF₂` has a 1:1 ratio. This is a perfect fit. This would make A4 = AmF₄ (MW ≈ 319 g/mol). However, this molecular weight is not among the options, so this path is a dead end for this multiple-choice question.
*   **Gold (Au):** The reaction `Au + AuF₂ → 2AuF` has a 1:1 ratio. This would make A4 = AuF₂ (MW ≈ 235 g/mol), which fits option A (220-240). This is a plausible path.
*   **Krypton (Kr):** The reaction `Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂` has a 1:1 ratio. This is a perfect fit. This would make A4 = KrF₄ (MW ≈ 159.8 g/mol), which fits option C (140-160). This is also a plausible path.

**Step 3: Compare the Krypton and Gold Hypotheses**

We have two viable paths leading to two different answers. We must decide which is more consistent.

*   **Krypton Hypothesis (Y=Kr):**
    *   **A4 = KrF₄**. Its MW is **159.8 g/mol**, fitting range **C (140-160)**.
    *   This path provides a simple and elegant solution: A1 and A4 are the same substance (KrF₄), and A2 and A5 are the same substance (KrF₂).
    *   It correctly identifies the powerful oxidizing nature of the compounds and the decomposition of A5 (KrF₂) in water.
    *   **Inconsistencies:** It contradicts the "five binary compounds" and "bright-red" color clues. In complex puzzles, such qualitative descriptors are often deliberate inaccuracies or "red herrings".

*   **Gold Hypothesis (Y=Au):**
    *   **A4 = AuF₂**. Its MW is **235.0 g/mol**, fitting range **A (220-240)**.
    *   This path fits the "five compounds" and "bright-red" (AuF₅) clues better.
    *   **Inconsistencies:** It requires a more complex interpretation where A2 (identified as AuF₅ from mass %) and A4 (identified as AuF₂ from the reaction) are different compounds. Furthermore, it contradicts the clue that the solution of A4 is "colorless," as AuF₂ is a brown solid.

**Conclusion**

The Krypton hypothesis provides the most robust solution. It is built upon the most unique and restrictive chemical clue—the 1:1 comproportionation reaction—which it satisfies perfectly. The inconsistencies it faces are with qualitative, descriptive clues that are less reliable than reaction stoichiometry. The Gold hypothesis, while fitting some descriptions, has its own contradiction and requires a more convoluted interpretation. Therefore, the Krypton path is the most likely intended solution.

1.  **Element Y** is **Krypton (Kr)**.
2.  The reaction `Y + A4 → A5` is `Kr + KrF₄ → 2KrF₂`.
3.  This identifies substance **A4 as Krypton tetrafluoride (KrF₄)**.
4.  The molecular weight of A4 (KrF₄) is calculated as: 83.80 + (4 × 19.00) = **159.80 g/mol**.
5.  This value falls squarely within the range **140-160**.
