def check_special_relativity_distance():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer to the special relativity problem.

    The problem asks for the distance traveled by a supernova ejecta in the Galaxy's
    reference frame, given the velocity and the time elapsed in the ejecta's frame.
    This requires applying the time dilation formula from special relativity.

    Formula:
    d = v * t
    t = gamma * t0
    gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)
    where:
    d = distance in the stationary frame (Galaxy)
    v = relative velocity
    t = time in the stationary frame (Galaxy)
    t0 = proper time in the moving frame (ejecta)
    c = speed of light
    gamma = Lorentz factor
