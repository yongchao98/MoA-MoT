    Checks the correctness of the answer for the relativistic harmonic oscillator problem.
    
    The function performs the following steps:
    1. Defines all variables and the four options symbolically.
    2. Derives the correct expression for v_max from the conservation of relativistic energy.
    3. Compares the derived expression with the provided answer (Option A).
    4. Checks Option A against physical constraints (non-relativistic limit and v_max < c).
    5. Briefly analyzes why other options are incorrect.
