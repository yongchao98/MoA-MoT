    # Step 1: The non-Gaussianity (nG) for a pure state simplifies to the entropy of the
    # reference Gaussian state, nG = S(tau).

    # Step 2: Calculate the first and second moments of the cat state to define the reference state tau.
    # For an odd cat state (phi = -pi/4), the first moment < a > is 0.
    # The second moments are <a^2> and <n> = <a_dagger * a>.
