    ### Step-by-Step Analysis

    The provided candidate answers overwhelmingly agree on the numerical result, despite confusion over the final lettered option. The following step-by-step analysis confirms this result and clarifies the correct choice.

    **1. Simplify the Non-Gaussianity (nG) Measure**

    *   The measure is `del_b = [trace(rho*ln(rho)) - trace(tau*ln(tau))]`.
    *   Using the von Neumann entropy `S(X) = -trace(X*ln(X))`, this becomes `nG = S(tau) - S(rho)`.
    *   **Careful Point 1:** The state `|psi>` is a pure quantum state. The entropy of any pure state is zero. Therefore, `S(rho) = 0`. This is a critical simplification that reduces the problem to finding the entropy of the reference Gaussian state: `nG = S(tau)`.

    **2. Characterize the Reference Gaussian State (`tau`)**

    *   The reference state `tau` is a Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as `rho`.
    *   For the given parameters `phi = -pi/4` and `alpha = 0.5`, the state is an "odd cat state" proportional to `|alpha> - |-alpha>`.
    *   **Careful Point 2:** For this state, the first moment (average displacement) `<a>` is zero. This means `tau` is a centered Gaussian state.
    *   **Careful Point 3:** The second moments define the covariance matrix of `tau`. The correct formulas for the odd cat state are:
        *   `<a^2> = alpha^2`
        *   `<n> = <a†a> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`
        It is crucial to use both moments. A simple thermal state would have `<a^2> = 0`, which is not the case here.

    **3. Calculate the Entropy of `tau`**

    *   The entropy of a single-mode, centered Gaussian state is determined by its symplectic eigenvalue, `nu`.
    *   **Careful Point 4:** The symplectic eigenvalue is calculated from the second moments using the formula: `nu^2 = (<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2`.
    *   The entropy is then given by: `S(tau) = (nu + 1/2)ln(nu + 1/2) - (nu - 1/2)ln(nu - 1/2)`.

    **4. Perform the Numerical Calculation**

    1.  With `alpha = 0.5`, we have `alpha^2 = 0.25`.
    2.  `<a^2> = 0.25`.
    3.  `<n> = 0.25 * coth(0.25) ≈ 0.25 * 4.0831 ≈ 1.0208`.
    4.  `nu^2 ≈ (1.0208 + 0.5)^2 - (0.25)^2 = (1.5208)^2 - 0.0625 ≈ 2.3128 - 0.0625 = 2.2503`.
    5.  `nu = sqrt(2.2503) ≈ 1.5001`.
    6.  **Careful Point 5:** The symplectic eigenvalue is extremely close to 1.5. Using `nu = 1.5` simplifies the entropy calculation significantly:
        *   `S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5)ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5)ln(1.5 - 0.5)`
        *   `S(tau) = 2*ln(2) - 1*ln(1)`
        *   `S(tau) = 2*ln(2) ≈ 2 * 0.693147 = 1.386294`.

    ### Conclusion

    The calculated non-Gaussianity is `nG ≈ 1.386`. This result is robust and confirmed by the vast majority of the candidate answers that performed the calculation correctly. The confusion in the final letter choices among the candidates stems from inconsistent ordering of the multiple-choice options.

    Based on the options provided in the question:
    *   **A) 1.38**
    *   B) 0.25
    *   C) 0
    *   D) 2.48

    The calculated value of `1.386` is best represented by option A.
