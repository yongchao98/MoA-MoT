    # --- Step 1: Verify the identity of Reagent A ---
    # The reaction is an enamine synthesis, which is a condensation reaction between a secondary amine
    # (3-methylpyrrolidine) and a carbonyl compound (an aldehyde or ketone).
    # The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine.
    # By performing a retrosynthesis (working backward from the product), we can identify the required carbonyl compound.
    # The enamine's N-C=C structure comes from the amine and the carbonyl. The carbon bonded to the nitrogen
    # was the original carbonyl carbon. In the product, this is a -CH= group, meaning the original carbonyl
    # was an aldehyde (-CHO). The rest of the structure is a cyclohexane ring.
    # Therefore, the correct Reagent A must be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

    # The options are Acetic acid (a weak acid) and TsOH (p-toluenesulfonic acid, a strong acid).
    # For dehydration reactions, especially when heat is applied to drive the reaction to completion by removing water,
    # a strong acid catalyst like TsOH is significantly more effective and is the standard choice in organic synthesis.
