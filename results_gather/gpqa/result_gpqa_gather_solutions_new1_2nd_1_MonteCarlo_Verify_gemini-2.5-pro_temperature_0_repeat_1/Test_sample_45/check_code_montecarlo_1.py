def check_metathesis_products():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer for the racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene metathesis problem.

    The function follows these steps:
    1. Defines the possible stereoisomers from each reaction pairing (R+R, S+S, R+S).
    2. Correctly identifies meso compounds and chiral pairs.
    3. Groups the resulting stereoisomers into separable fractions (racemic pairs and meso compounds).
    4. Counts these fractions to determine the chemically correct answer.
    5. Compares this correct count to the provided answer.
