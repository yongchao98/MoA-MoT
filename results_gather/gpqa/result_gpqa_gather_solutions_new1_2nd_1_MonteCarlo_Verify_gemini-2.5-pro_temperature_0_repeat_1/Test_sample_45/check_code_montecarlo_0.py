    This function checks the correctness of the answer to the chemistry question.
    Question: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?
    Options: A) 6, B) 2, C) 8, D) 4
    Provided Final Answer: 'D', which corresponds to the value 4.

    The function performs a stereochemical analysis to determine the number of products
    based on the most chemically sound interpretation and compares it to the provided answer.

    # The most rigorous interpretation of "number of products" for this question is the
    # number of separable fractions (diastereomerically distinct sets), as the total
    # number of stereoisomers (7) is not an option.
    # Enantiomers are grouped into racemic pairs, while meso compounds stand alone.

    # Step 1: Define the stereoisomers resulting from each pairing.
    # (R,R) pairing gives two chiral products (E and Z).
    # (S,S) pairing gives the two enantiomers of the (R,R) products.
    # (R,S) pairing gives one meso product (E) and one chiral product (Z) which
    # is formed as a racemic pair with its (S,R) enantiomer.

    # Step 2: Group the stereoisomers into separable fractions.
    # Fraction 1: The racemic pair of E-isomers from the (R,R) and (S,S) pairings.
    # This pair consists of (E)-(3R,6R) and (E)-(3S,6S).
    fraction_1 = {"(E)-(3R,6R)", "(E)-(3S,6S)"}

    # Fraction 2: The racemic pair of Z-isomers from the (R,R) and (S,S) pairings.
    # This pair consists of (Z)-(3R,6R) and (Z)-(3S,6S).
    fraction_2 = {"(Z)-(3R,6R)", "(Z)-(3S,6S)"}

    # Fraction 3: The meso compound from the (R,S) pairing.
    # This is a single, achiral molecule: (E)-(3R,6S).
    fraction_3 = {"(E)-(3R,6S)"}

    # Fraction 4: The racemic pair of Z-isomers from the (R,S) cross-pairing.
    # This pair consists of (Z)-(3R,6S) and its enantiomer (Z)-(3S,6R).
    fraction_4 = {"(Z)-(3R,6S)", "(Z)-(3S,6R)"}

    # The total number of separable fractions is the count of these distinct groups.
