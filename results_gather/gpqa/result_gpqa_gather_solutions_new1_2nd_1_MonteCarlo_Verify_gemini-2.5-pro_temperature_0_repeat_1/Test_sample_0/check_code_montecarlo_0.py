def check_correctness_of_quantum_energy_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer to the quantum energy level resolution problem.

    The function performs the following steps:
    1. Defines the physical constants and problem parameters.
    2. Calculates the energy width (ΔE) for each quantum state using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (ΔE ≈ ħ/τ).
    3. Determines the minimum required energy separation for the states to be clearly resolved. The criterion used is that the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the individual energy widths (ΔE_diff > ΔE₁ + ΔE₂).
    4. Evaluates the given multiple-choice options against this minimum separation to find the correct answer.
    5. Compares the derived correct answer with the LLM's provided answer.
    6. Returns "Correct" if they match, or a detailed reason for the discrepancy if they do not.
