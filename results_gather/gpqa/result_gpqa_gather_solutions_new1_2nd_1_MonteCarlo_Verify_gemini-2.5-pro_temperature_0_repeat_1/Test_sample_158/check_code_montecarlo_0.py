    Checks the correctness of the provided answer for the quasar comoving distance problem.

    The function performs the following steps:
    1. Defines the physical and cosmological constants from the question.
    2. Calculates the redshift (z) based on the observed Lyman-alpha line.
    3. Numerically integrates the Friedmann equation to find the comoving distance.
    4. Compares the calculated distance to the provided options to find the best match.
    5. Checks if the best match corresponds to the given answer.
