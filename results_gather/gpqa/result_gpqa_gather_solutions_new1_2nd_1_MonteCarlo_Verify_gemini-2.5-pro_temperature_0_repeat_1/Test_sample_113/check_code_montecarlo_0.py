    Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, taking into account the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.

    ### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**

    *   **Reaction:** `butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile`
    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a **cyanohydrin formation**. A ketone (butan-2-one) is converted into a cyanohydrin, which has both a hydroxyl (-OH) group and a nitrile (-CN) group attached to the same carbon.
    *   **Mechanism:** The reaction involves two key steps:
        1.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The cyanide ion (CN⁻), a strong nucleophile from NaCN, attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the ketone.
        2.  **Protonation:** This attack forms a negatively charged alkoxide intermediate. This intermediate must be protonated to form the final, stable hydroxyl group.
    *   **Identifying Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a proton source to complete the reaction.
        *   `H₃O⁺` (hydronium ion) represents an acidic aqueous solution. It is the standard reagent used to provide the necessary proton for this step, often in an acidic workup.
        *   `NaHSO₃` (sodium bisulfite) is used in a different type of carbonyl addition reaction and is not the correct reagent for cyanohydrin formation.
    *   **Conclusion for A:** Reagent **A must be H₃O⁺**. This eliminates options B and D.

    ### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**

    *   **Reaction:** `2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid`
    *   **Reaction Type:** This reaction converts a nitrile group (-C≡N) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This is a **nitrile hydrolysis**.
    *   **Conditions:** The hydrolysis of a nitrile is a robust transformation that requires vigorous conditions, typically heating with water in the presence of a strong catalyst (either a strong acid or a strong base).
    *   **Identifying Reagent B:** Reagent B is the catalyst for the hydrolysis.
        *   `HCl` (hydrochloric acid) is a strong mineral acid and is a standard, highly effective catalyst for the complete hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.
        *   `CH₃COOH` (acetic acid) is a weak acid. It is generally not strong enough to efficiently catalyze this reaction to completion under normal laboratory conditions.
    *   **Conclusion for B:** Reagent **B must be HCl**. This eliminates option C.

    ### **Step 3: Final Decision and Careful Points**

    1.  **Synthesize Results:** The analysis of both reactions shows that the correct reagents are **A = H₃O⁺** and **B = HCl**.
    2.  **Match to Options:** We must now match this conclusion to the given choices:
        *   **A) A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl**
        *   B) A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH
        *   C) A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH
        *   D) A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl

        The correct combination directly corresponds to **Option A**.
    3.  **Review Candidate Errors:** The provided candidate answers almost universally agree on the correct chemical principles (A=H₃O⁺, B=HCl). However, many of them make a critical error in the final step by incorrectly mapping this correct chemical conclusion to the wrong lettered option. This highlights the importance of carefully checking the final selection against the reasoning.

    Based on a correct and thorough chemical analysis, the answer is A.
