To determine the final answer, we will systematically analyze the problem by deriving the necessary selection rules and then applying them to each candidate transition.

### Step 1: Analyze the Initial State and Derive Selection Rules

First, we must understand the properties of the initial state and the rules that govern the decay process.

*   **Initial State:** The system starts as two nucleons (NN) in a `1S0` state. The term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)` gives us the initial quantum numbers:
    *   `2S_i + 1 = 1` → Initial total spin `S_i = 0`.
    *   The letter `S` → Initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.
    *   The subscript `0` → Initial total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.
    *   The parity of the initial state is `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.

*   **Decay Process:** The system decays via `NN(1S0) -> NN(final) + X`.
    *   Particle `X` has an intrinsic parity of `P(X) = -1`.
    *   The final NN state has an isospin of `T_f = 0`.

From this information, we can establish three selection rules that a permitted transition must satisfy:

1.  **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):**
    The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`. The final total angular momentum is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_f`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`l_X`). For the total to remain zero, their magnitudes must be equal:
    **Rule 1: `J_f = l_X`**

2.  **Conservation of Parity (P):**
    The initial parity (`P_i = +1`) must equal the final parity (`P_f`).
    *   `P_f = P(NN_final) * P(X) * P(orbital) = (-1)^L_f * (-1) * (-1)^l_X`
    *   For `P_f` to be `+1`, the exponent in `(-1)^(L_f + l_X + 1)` must be even.
    *   Therefore, the sum **`L_f + l_X` must be odd**.

3.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle for the Final State:**
    The problem provides the rule `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. For the final state with `T_f = 0`, this becomes `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.
    *   This requires the sum `S_f + L_f + 1` to be an even number.
    *   Therefore, the sum **`S_f + L_f` must be odd**.

### Step 2: Evaluate Each Option Against the Rules

We will now test each of the four proposed transitions from the user's prompt. A transition is not permitted if it violates any of the three rules.

**A) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s**
*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.
*   Particle X (`s` wave): `l_X=0`.
1.  **J-Conservation (`J_f = l_X`):** `0 = 0`. (✓ Pass)
2.  **Parity (`L_f + l_X` is odd):** `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓ Pass)
3.  **Pauli (`S_f + L_f` is odd):** `1 + 1 = 2` (even). (**✗ Fail**)
*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted**.

**B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p**
*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.
*   Particle X (`p` wave): `l_X=1`.
1.  **J-Conservation:** `1 = 1`. (✓ Pass)
2.  **Parity:** `0 + 1 = 1` (odd). (✓ Pass)
3.  **Pauli:** `1 + 0 = 1` (odd). (✓ Pass)
*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **permitted**.

**C) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p**
*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S_f+1=7` -> `S_f=3`.
*   **Careful Point:** This transition is forbidden for a fundamental reason. A system of two nucleons (which are spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of S=0 or S=1. A state with S=3 is physically impossible for this system.
*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **not permitted**.

**D) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f**
*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.
*   Particle X (`f` wave): `l_X=3`.
1.  **J-Conservation:** `3 = 3`. (✓ Pass)
2.  **Parity:** `2 + 3 = 5` (odd). (✓ Pass)
3.  **Pauli:** `1 + 2 = 3` (odd). (✓ Pass)
*   **Conclusion:** This transition is **permitted**.

### Step 3: Final Decision

Our analysis shows that two of the options, A and C, are not permitted. We must choose the single best answer based on the problem's instructions.

*   **Option C (`1S0 -> 7D1 + p`)** is forbidden because the final state `7D1` is unphysical and cannot be constructed from two nucleons. This is a violation of the basic principles of spin addition.
*   **Option A (`1S0 -> 3P0 + s`)** is forbidden because it violates one of the specific selection rules for the *process* that we were asked to use—namely, the Pauli principle for a `T=0` final state. The final state `3P0` is, by itself, a valid NN state.

The question asks to identify the non-permitted wave by "mak[ing] use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity" and the given "Pauli statistics" rule. Option A is the only choice that is forbidden by a direct application of this specific set of rules. The issue with Option C is more fundamental (the state cannot exist) and is not a violation of the process rules themselves. Therefore, Option A is the intended answer.
