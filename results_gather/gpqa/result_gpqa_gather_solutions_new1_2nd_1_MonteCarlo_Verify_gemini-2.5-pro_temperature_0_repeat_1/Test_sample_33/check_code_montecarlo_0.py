    # Step 1: Determine the correct products for each reaction based on chemical principles.
    
    # Reaction A: 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol
    # Principle 1 (Carbocation Stability): The carbocation at C4 is tertiary and benzylic, making it more stable than the tertiary carbocation at C3.
    # Principle 2 (Migratory Aptitude): On the adjacent carbon (C3), the ethyl group has a higher migratory aptitude than the methyl group.
    # Conclusion: Ethyl migrates to C4, ketone forms at C3.
    correct_product_A = "3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one"

    # Reaction B: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylpentane-2,3-diol
    # Principle 1 (Carbocation Stability): The carbocation at C3 is stabilized by a 4-hydroxyphenyl group (a strong EDG), making it more stable than the C2 carbocation stabilized by a simple phenyl group.
    # Principle 2 (Migratory Aptitude): On the adjacent carbon (C2), the phenyl group has a much higher migratory aptitude than the methyl group.
    # Conclusion: Phenyl migrates to C3, ketone forms at C2.
    correct_product_B = "3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one"

    # Reaction C: 1,1,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethane-1,2-diol
    # Principle 1 (Carbocation Stability): Let An = 4-methoxyphenyl. The carbocation at C1 is stabilized by two An groups, making it more stable than the C2 carbocation (stabilized by one An and one phenyl).
    # Principle 2 (Migratory Aptitude): On the adjacent carbon (C2), the Anisyl (An) group is more electron-rich and has a higher migratory aptitude than the phenyl group.
    # Conclusion: Anisyl migrates from C2 to C1, ketone forms at C2.
