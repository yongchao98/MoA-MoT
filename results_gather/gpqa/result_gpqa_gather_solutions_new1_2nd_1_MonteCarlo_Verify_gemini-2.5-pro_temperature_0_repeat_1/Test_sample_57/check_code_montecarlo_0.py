Based on the provided candidate answers, here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.

### Step 1: Deconstruct the Core Question
The question asks which of the listed physical theories "never requires regularization at high energies." This is a technical question with a precise meaning:
*   **High Energies / Short Distances:** In quantum physics, interactions at very high energies are equivalent to interactions at extremely short distances.
*   **Divergences:** In many theories, especially Quantum Field Theories (QFTs), calculations for physical quantities result in infinite values. These infinities, called "ultraviolet (UV) divergences," arise from the assumption that particles are mathematical points that interact at a single location in spacetime.
*   **Regularization:** This is a set of mathematical techniques used to temporarily manage these infinities, typically by introducing an artificial "cutoff" to make the calculations finite. It is a necessary step before renormalization, which produces the final, physically meaningful predictions.
*   **The Goal:** The question seeks the theory that is fundamentally constructed to be free of these UV divergences, making the artificial step of regularization unnecessary.

### Step 2: Analyze the Consensus Reasoning
Across all 15 candidate answers, there is a remarkable and unanimous consensus in the underlying physical reasoning, even if the final letter choices are inconsistent.
*   **On QED, QCD, and Classical Electrodynamics:** Every single candidate answer correctly explains that Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) are quantum field theories that are famous for having UV divergences that absolutely require regularization. They also correctly state that Classical Electrodynamics has its own version of this problem (the infinite self-energy of a point charge) that requires a form of regularization to resolve.
*   **On Superstring Theory:** Every single candidate answer correctly identifies that Superstring Theory is fundamentally different. A primary motivation for the theory is that it is believed to be "UV-finite." By modeling fundamental particles as extended, one-dimensional strings instead of zero-dimensional points, interactions are "smeared out." This smearing naturally smooths over the short-distance behavior that causes infinities in the other theories.

### Step 3: Identify and Address Inconsistencies (Careful Points)
1.  **The Reasoning is Unanimous:** The most critical takeaway is that the physical logic presented in every single answer is consistent and points to Superstring Theory as the unique correct answer.
2.  **The Lettering is Inconsistent:** The final letter outputs (`<<<A>>>`, `<<<B>>>`, etc.) are wildly inconsistent across the candidates. This strongly indicates that the different agents were working with different letter-to-option mappings for the same question. For example, in one case "Superstring Theory" might be option A, while in another it is option C.
3.  **Internal Contradictions:** Several answers (e.g., 5, 6, 8, 15) have clear internal contradictions where their flawless reasoning points to Superstring Theory, but their final output letter corresponds to a different theory. These final letter outputs are errors and should be disregarded in favor of their correct reasoning.

### Step 4: Synthesize and Conclude
The overwhelming and unanimous consensus of the *reasoning* is the most reliable signal. All evidence points to Superstring Theory as the only theory on the list that is constructed to be free from high-energy (UV) divergences.

To provide the final answer, we map this correct physical concept back to the specific list provided in the problem description:

A) Classical Electrodynamics
B) Superstring Theory
C) Quantum Chromodynamics
D) Quantum Electrodynamics

The correct theory is Superstring Theory, which corresponds to option B.
