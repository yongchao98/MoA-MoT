Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful points derived from the experimental evidence.

### Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data

This is the most definitive piece of evidence and should be the first point of analysis.
*   **Observation:** The LC-MS analysis shows two distinct peaks in the chromatogram, but both peaks yield the *same mass spectrum*. This mass is also consistent with the expected molecule.
*   **Careful Point:** This observation proves that the two chemical species are **isomers**. They have the same chemical formula and molecular weight but a different three-dimensional arrangement of atoms. This single fact allows us to immediately eliminate any options that involve a change in mass.
    *   **Eliminates A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor.** A precursor is an intermediate from the synthesis and would have a different (usually lower) molecular weight.
    *   **Eliminates C) 'Double coupling' has occurred.** This side reaction would result in a product with an extra amino acid, leading to a different (higher) molecular weight.

### Step 2: Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and NMR Data

With precursors and mass-variant side products ruled out, we must distinguish between the two remaining types of isomers: enantiomers (B) and diastereoisomers (D).
*   **Observation:** The two species are separated by liquid chromatography (LC), appearing as two distinct peaks. The Â¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton.
*   **Careful Point:** These observations prove that the two isomers are physically and chemically distinct under standard (achiral) analytical conditions.
    *   **Evaluate B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In an achiral environment (like a standard LC column or a standard NMR solvent), they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they would **not** be separated by a standard LC column and would **not** be distinguishable in a standard NMR experiment. The experimental data directly contradicts this.
    *   **Evaluate D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. They have different physical properties and are chemically distinct. This means they can be separated by standard LC, and their corresponding protons will exist in different chemical environments, leading to distinct signals in an NMR spectrum. This explanation is perfectly consistent with all the provided data.

### Step 3: Synthesize the Conclusion

By systematically applying the constraints from the experimental data, we can confidently arrive at the correct answer.
1.  The identical mass of the two species confirms they are isomers, ruling out precursors and side-products.
2.  The fact that they are separable by LC and distinguishable by NMR proves they are not enantiomers.
3.  The only remaining possibility that fits all the evidence is a mixture of diastereoisomers. This is a common phenomenon in peptide synthesis, often arising from either epimerization (inversion of a single chiral center) or the presence of stable *cis/trans* isomers (rotamers) around a peptide bond.
