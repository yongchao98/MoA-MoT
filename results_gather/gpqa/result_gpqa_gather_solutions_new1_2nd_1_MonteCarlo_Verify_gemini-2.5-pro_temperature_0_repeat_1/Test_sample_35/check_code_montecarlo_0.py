    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer by performing the necessary astrophysical calculations.
    It follows these steps:
    1.  Calculates the cosmological redshift (z) based on the given distance.
    2.  Calculates the rest-frame energy of the absorption line using the redshift.
    3.  Identifies the spectral line by comparing the rest-frame energy to known transitions.
    4.  Determines the phase of the interstellar medium (ISM) based on the observation type (absorption).
    5.  Compares the derived correct answer with the LLM's provided answer.
