  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nThe 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 exhibits two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\nA) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\nB) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene\nC) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\nD) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nThe python script was designed to systematically evaluate each possible mixture against the NMR data provided in the question.\n\n### **Execution Analysis**\n\n1.  **Hypothesis Generation:** The script correctly defined the expected NMR signals for each of the four candidate compounds based on their chemical structure and symmetry. It then generated four hypotheses, corresponding to the mixtures in options A, B, C, and D.\n\n2.  **Constraint Application & Filtering:**\n    *   The script first checks the aromatic region. For a 1:1 mixture to have two singlets in a 1:1 ratio, each component must contribute one aromatic singlet representing the same number of protons (in this case, 2H each). 1,2,4,5-TMB, 1,2,3,4-TMB, and 1,2,3,5-TMB all fit this criterion. 1,4-diethylbenzene has a 4H singlet, which would create a 2H:4H (or 1:2) ratio, so any option with it would be eliminated.\n    *   The script then checks the aliphatic region. The mixture must have exactly three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n        *   **Option A (1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB):** Combines one 12H singlet with two 6H singlets. This results in three total singlets with a 12:6:6 ratio, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This is a perfect match.\n        *   **Option B (1,2,3,5-TMB + 1,4-diethylbenzene):** This is eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n        *   **Option C (1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):** Combines two 6H singlets with three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). This would result in five total signals (or four if one 6H signal overlaps), which does not match the required three signals.\n        *   **Option D (1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):** Combines one 12H singlet with three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). This results in four total signals, which does not match the required three signals.\n\n3.  **Surviving Candidates & Final Choice:**\n    *   The only candidate that survives the filtering process is Option A. The combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only one that perfectly accounts for both the aromatic and aliphatic signals described in the problem.\n\n```python\n# Final output based on the script's logic\nprint(\"Surviving Candidates:\")\nprint(\"A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Choice:\")\nprint(\"The only mixture that matches all NMR constraints is A.\")\n```\n\n<<<A>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: Surviving Candidates:\nA) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\n\nFinal Choice:\nThe only mixture that matches all NMR constraints is A.\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the given 1H NMR spectral data.**\nThe problem describes the spectrum of a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. This means the mixture contains two distinct types of aromatic protons that do not have any adjacent proton neighbors. The total number of protons corresponding to each signal is equal.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1. This indicates three distinct types of alkyl protons. The \"singlet\" multiplicity suggests these are likely methyl groups attached to the benzene ring, as they have no adjacent protons to couple with.\n\n**Step 2: Eliminate candidates based on signal multiplicity.**\n*   The problem states all signals in the alkyl region are singlets.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene** contains ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The -CH2- protons would appear as a quartet and the -CH3- protons would appear as a triplet due to spin-spin coupling.\n*   Since 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the alkyl region, it can be eliminated as a possible component. This immediately rules out **Option A**.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for the remaining individual compounds.**\nWe need to analyze the symmetry of each molecule to determine the number of unique proton environments.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each with an integration of 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H), the one at C2 is unique (3H), and the one at C5 is unique (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 are also equivalent but distinct from the first pair. This results in **two singlets**, each with an integration of 6H (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the remaining mixture options.**\n\n*   **Option B (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three** aromatic signals. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **Option C (1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three** aromatic signals. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **Option D (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB provides one 2H singlet. Since they are different compounds, they will appear at slightly different chemical shifts. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets**, each corresponding to 2H. The integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the aromatic data.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB provides **one singlet** for **12H**. 1,2,3,4-TMB provides **two singlets**, each for **6H**. In the 1:1 mixture, the spectrum will show these three distinct signals. The integration ratio will be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the alkyl data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only combination that produces a spectrum with two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds from the given options.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem and the 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two isomers with the formula C10H14.\n*   **Aromatic Region Data (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. This means there are two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture, and the number of protons contributing to each signal is equal.\n*   **Alkyl Region Data (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1. The fact that they are all singlets is a crucial clue, indicating the methyl groups are not adjacent to any carbons bearing protons.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Predicted 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe must predict the spectrum for each of the four compounds to see how they would contribute to the mixture's spectrum. This prediction is based on molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** This compound has two ethyl groups. An ethyl group's signal is split into a quartet (-CH2-) and a triplet (-CH3-).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the problem states all alkyl signals are singlets, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be immediately eliminated**. This rules out option **B**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent and have no adjacent protons. This gives **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. This gives **one singlet** integrating to 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They form a single signal group integrating to 2H. In textbook problems, this is often simplified to **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the outer pair (at C1 and C4) and the inner pair (at C2 and C3). This gives **two singlets**, each integrating to 6H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments and have no adjacent protons. This gives **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three sets of chemically distinct methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the one at C2 (3H), and the one at C5 (3H). This gives **three singlets** with a 6H:3H:3H ratio (which is 2:1:1).\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test the remaining options (A, C, and D) by combining the predicted spectra for a 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Prehnitene contributes one signal (2H), and Isodurene contributes two signals (1H each). The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the experimental data of two signals.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Durene contributes one signal (2H), and Isodurene contributes two signals (1H each). The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the experimental data. (Note: While a solution involving accidental overlap of signals is possible, it is less likely than a direct fit).\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Durene provides one 2H singlet. Prehnitene provides one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets**. Since each signal represents 2 protons, their integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the aromatic data.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** Durene provides one singlet for 12H. Prehnitene provides two singlets, each for 6H. In the mixture, this combines to give **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The simplest whole-number ratio of these integrations is **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the alkyl data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** is the only option that directly and simply accounts for all the features of the described 1H NMR spectrum: two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three alkyl singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the 1H NMR Data for the Mixture**\n\nThe problem provides the following key pieces of information about the 1H NMR spectrum of a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both of which are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all of which are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the structure and symmetry of each candidate compound to predict its spectrum.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Region:** This compound has ethyl groups, which would produce a quartet (for the -CH2-) and a triplet (for the -CH3-) due to spin-spin coupling.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the problem states all alkyl signals are singlets, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This immediately rules out option D.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons. This results in **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. This results in **one aliphatic singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons to split with. This results in **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the outer pair (at C1 and C4) and the inner pair (at C2 and C3). This results in **two aliphatic singlets (each 6H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. C4 is between a methyl group and a hydrogen, while C6 is between two methyl groups. This results in **two distinct aromatic singlets (each 1H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three sets of chemically distinct methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the one at C2 (3H), and the one at C5 (3H). This results in **three aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow, we combine the predicted spectra for the pairs in each option to see which one matches the experimental data for the 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, these would appear as **two singlets**. Since each signal represents 2 protons, their integration ratio is 2H:2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. **This matches the aromatic data.**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum would show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This matches the aliphatic data.**\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match for all the provided data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   This option was already eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\nThe only pair of compounds that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum in a 1:1 mixture is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Information from the Question**\n\n1.  **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two aromatic compounds.\n2.  **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n3.  **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both are singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe need to analyze the structure of each compound to predict its 1H NMR spectrum, paying close attention to symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they appear as **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They appear as **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments and have no adjacent protons. They appear as **two separate singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 are equivalent, the one at C2 is unique, and the one at C5 is unique. This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H (or **2:1:1**).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Although they are adjacent, in many tetramethylbenzenes, such AA' systems appear as a sharp singlet. We will assume it gives **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the outer ones (C1/C4) and the inner ones (C2/C3). This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to 6H (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent, giving **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The problem states all alkyl signals are singlets. This compound has ethyl groups, which produce a **quartet** and a **triplet**. Therefore, **this compound can be eliminated**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture that matches the experimental data: two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show **three** aromatic signals. This does not match.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show **three** aromatic signals. This does not match.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, these two different signals will appear as **two singlets**. Since each signal represents 2 protons, the integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. **This matches the aromatic data.**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This matches the alkyl data.**\n    *   This option is a perfect match for all the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This option is eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the two compounds present in the mixture, we will follow a systematic approach:\n1.  Analyze the provided 1H NMR spectral data.\n2.  Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four candidate compounds.\n3.  Eliminate candidates that are inconsistent with the data.\n4.  Evaluate the remaining combinations to find the mixture that matches the experimental spectrum.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Given NMR Data\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two C10H14 isomers.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio. This means there are two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture, and the number of protons contributing to each signal is equal.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. The fact that all signals are singlets is a crucial piece of information, suggesting the protons are on carbons (likely methyl groups) with no adjacent carbons bearing protons.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, it has only two types of protons.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** The four methyl groups are all equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. This will produce **two distinct singlets**, each with an integration of 1H.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (equivalent), the one at C2, and the one at C5. This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 2H. (While they are adjacent, in this symmetrical environment, they often appear as a singlet).\n    *   **Aliphatic:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This will produce **two singlets**, each with an integration of 6H (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aliphatic:** The ethyl groups will show spin-spin coupling, producing a **quartet** for the -CH2- protons and a **triplet** for the -CH3- protons. This contradicts the data that all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This rules out option D.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture that gives two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **Option B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic signals: One 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4-TMB and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB would result in three signals. This does not match.\n\n*   **Option C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic signals: One 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB would result in three signals. This does not match.\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the aromatic data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the aliphatic data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Information from the Question**\n\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two aromatic compounds.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both are singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the structure and symmetry of each compound to predict the number of signals, their multiplicity (e.g., singlet), and their relative integration.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The protons on these groups will split each other, resulting in a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region. The problem states all alkyl signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is eliminated**. This rules out option **C**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons. This gives **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. This gives **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent. Although they are adjacent, in this specific symmetric system (an AA' system), they appear as a single sharp signal. This gives **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (at C1 and C4) and the \"inner\" pair (at C2 and C3). This gives **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This symmetry makes the two protons (at C4 and C6) chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons. This gives **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair (at C1 and C3), the unique group at C2, and the unique group at C5. This gives **three singlets (6H, 3H, and 3H)**, which is a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nNow, we combine the predicted spectra for the pairs in the remaining options (A, B, D) to see which one matches the experimental data for the 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, these two non-identical compounds will produce **two distinct singlets**. Since each signal represents 2 protons, their integration ratio will be 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This **matches** the aromatic data.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum will show **three distinct singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This **matches** the alkyl data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Option B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have at least four signals (one 6H signal might overlap), which does not match the \"three signals\" observation.\n\n*   **Option D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have four signals. This does not match the \"three signals\" observation unless we assume a case of accidental degeneracy (e.g., the two 3H signals overlap), which is a less direct explanation than that for Option A.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe combination of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** is the only one that naturally and directly accounts for all the features of the described 1H NMR spectrum: two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds from the given options.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe problem provides the following information about the 1H NMR spectrum of a 1:1 molar mixture of two C10H14 isomers:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both are singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nThis data provides a unique fingerprint for the mixture that we can compare against the predicted spectra of the options.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe need to analyze the structure and symmetry of each candidate molecule to predict its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This compound has ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The protons on these groups will couple with each other, producing a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region.\n    *   The problem states all alkyl signals are **singlets**. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This rules out option A.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons. This results in **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. This results in **one singlet** with an integration of **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent. In practice, they appear as a single sharp signal. This results in **one singlet** with an integration of **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the outer pair (at C1 and C4) and the inner pair (at C2 and C3). This results in **two singlets**, each with an integration of **6H** (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has low symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. This results in **two separate singlets**, each with an integration of **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** This compound has three distinct sets of methyl groups, resulting in **three singlets** with a 6H:3H:3H ratio (or 2:1:1).\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow, let's see which 1:1 mixture from the remaining options (B, C, D) matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this gives **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This **matches** the data.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum shows **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also **matches** the data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This **does not match** the data.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This **does not match** the data.\n\nOnly the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is consistent with all the information provided.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer from the provided options.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem and NMR Data**\n\nThe goal is to identify a 1:1 mixture of two isomers of C10H14 that produces a specific 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   This means there are two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture.\n    *   The \"singlet\" multiplicity implies these protons have no adjacent proton neighbors.\n    *   The 1:1 integration ratio means the total number of protons contributing to the first signal is equal to the total number of protons contributing to the second.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   This means there are three distinct types of alkyl protons in the mixture.\n    *   The \"singlet\" multiplicity implies these are likely methyl groups attached to the aromatic ring (or another atom with no protons).\n    *   The 2:1:1 ratio describes the relative number of protons for these three signals.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Predicted 1H NMR Spectrum of Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe must predict the spectrum for each of the four compounds based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High (two perpendicular planes of symmetry).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C3 and C6 are equivalent. This gives **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. This gives **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** One plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at C5 and C6 are equivalent. They form an AA' system which typically appears as a single sharp signal, effectively a **singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the outer pair (C1/C4) and the inner pair (C2/C3). This gives **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** One plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments. This gives **two singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three sets of methyl groups: the C1/C3 pair, the unique C2, and the unique C5. This gives **three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**, a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** High.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The ethyl groups would produce a **quartet** (-CH2-) and a **triplet** (-CH3-). This contradicts the data that all alkyl signals are singlets. **This compound can be eliminated.**\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test the combinations given in the options against the experimental data.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic signals: 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with a 2H:2H or **1:1 integration ratio**. This **matches** the data.\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum shows **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This **matches** the data.\n    *   This option is a perfect fit for all observations.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic signals: 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This option is eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nTo determine the two compounds present in the mixture, we will systematically analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each candidate compound and then evaluate which 1:1 mixture matches the provided experimental data.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Experimental 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe spectrum of the 1:1 mixture shows the following key features:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\nThe fact that all signals are singlets is a crucial piece of information.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe will predict the spectrum for each of the four isomers of C10H14 based on their molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-Diethylbenzene:** This molecule contains two ethyl groups. The protons of an ethyl group are not singlets; they split each other to form a characteristic quartet (-CH2-) and triplet (-CH3-). Since the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This rules out option D.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. Although they are adjacent, in this symmetrical environment (an AA' system), they appear as a single sharp signal. This gives **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the pair at C1 and C4, and the pair at C2 and C3. This results in **two singlets**, each with an integration of 6H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments and have no adjacent protons. This will produce **two distinct singlets**, each with an integration of 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three sets of chemically distinct methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1 and C3 (6H), the unique methyl at C2 (3H), and the unique methyl at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we can test which 1:1 mixture of the remaining compounds matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Option B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (2H), and 1,2,3,5-TMB contributes two singlets (1H each). The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the experimental data of two signals.\n\n*   **Option C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one singlet (2H), and 1,2,3,5-TMB contributes two singlets (1H each). The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This also contradicts the data.\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet, and 1,2,3,4-TMB provides one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets**. Since each signal represents 2 protons, their integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the aromatic region data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB provides one singlet (12H), and 1,2,3,4-TMB provides two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio of these integrations is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the aliphatic region data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces a spectrum with two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem Constraints**\n\nThe question provides a set of strict constraints for a 1:1 molar mixture of two C10H14 isomers:\n*   **Constraint 1 (Aromatic Region Multiplicity):** The two signals in the aromatic region must be **singlets**. This means the aromatic protons in each respective molecule do not have adjacent proton neighbors.\n*   **Constraint 2 (Aromatic Region Signals & Ratio):** There must be exactly **two** aromatic signals in total, and their integration ratio must be **1:1**.\n*   **Constraint 3 (Alkyl Region Multiplicity):** The three signals in the alkyl region must all be **singlets**. This implies the signals come from methyl groups that are not adjacent to carbons bearing protons.\n*   **Constraint 4 (Alkyl Region Signals & Ratio):** There must be exactly **three** alkyl signals in total, and their integration ratio must be **2:1:1**.\n\n### **2. Analyze Individual Compounds and Prune the Options**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each candidate compound to see if it can be part of a mixture that meets the constraints.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Alkyl Region: The ethyl groups would produce a **quartet** and a **triplet**.\n    *   **Pruning:** This violates Constraint 3 (all alkyl signals are singlets). Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene cannot be in the mixture. This eliminates **Option C**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   Aromatic Region: It has two non-equivalent aromatic protons (at C4 and C6). Neither has an adjacent proton. This compound by itself produces **two 1H singlets**.\n    *   **Pruning:** If this compound is in the mixture, it already provides two aromatic signals. For the mixture to have only two signals in total, the other compound must either have no aromatic protons (not possible for these isomers) or its aromatic signal(s) must perfectly overlap with one or both of Isodurene's signals. More importantly, if we mix it with any of the other candidates (which all produce one 2H aromatic signal), the total number of aromatic signals would be 1 + 2 = 3. This violates Constraint 2. Therefore, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene is unlikely to be in the mixture. This eliminates **Option A** and **Option D**.\n\n### **3. Verify the Remaining Option**\n\nOnly **Option B** remains. Let's verify if a 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** satisfies all constraints.\n\n*   **Candidate 1: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   Aromatic: High symmetry gives one type of aromatic proton -> **1 singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Alkyl: High symmetry gives one type of methyl group -> **1 singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **Candidate 2: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   Aromatic: Symmetry gives one type of aromatic proton -> **1 singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Alkyl: Symmetry gives two types of methyl groups -> **2 singlets (6H each)**.\n\nNow, let's combine them in a 1:1 mixture:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region Check:**\n    *   Durene contributes one 2H singlet. Prehnitene contributes another 2H singlet at a different chemical shift.\n    *   Result: **Two singlets**. Since it's a 1:1 mixture and each signal represents 2H, the integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**.\n    *   **Constraint 1 & 2: PASS**\n\n*   **Alkyl Region Check:**\n    *   Durene contributes one singlet (12H).\n    *   Prehnitene contributes two singlets (6H each).\n    *   Result: **Three singlets** in total, with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The simplest whole-number ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Constraint 3 & 4: PASS**\n\nThe mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only combination that perfectly matches all the spectral data described.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer from the given options.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Information from the Question**\n\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n    *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Predicted 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nThe key to this problem is understanding the number of unique proton environments in each molecule, which is determined by its symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This compound has two ethyl groups. The protons on the ethyl groups (-CH2- and -CH3) will couple with each other, producing a quartet and a triplet, respectively.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the problem states all alkyl signals are singlets, **1,4-diethylbenzene is eliminated**. This immediately rules out option D.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (2H):** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons (12H):** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (2H):** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons (12H):** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the outer pair (at C1 and C4) and the inner pair (at C2 and C3). This results in **two singlets**, each with an integration of 6H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (2H):** The protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments. This will produce **two separate singlets**, each with an integration of 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons (12H):** There are three sets of chemically distinct methyl groups. This results in **three singlets** with integrations of 6H, 3H, and 3H (a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow, we combine the spectra of the pairs in the remaining options (A, B, C) to see which one matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Option B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **Option C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one 2H singlet.\n        *   In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. This **matches** the aromatic data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet for 12H.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets, each for 6H.\n        *   The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This **matches** the aliphatic data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This combination perfectly accounts for the two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and the three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio without needing to assume any accidental signal overlaps.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds based on the provided information.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Experimental Data**\n\nThe problem provides the 1H NMR data for a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds with the formula C10H14.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nThe key takeaways are:\n*   The presence of only **singlets** in the aliphatic region strongly suggests the signals are from methyl groups and rules out compounds with ethyl groups, like 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n*   The presence of **two** aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio for a 1:1 mixture implies that the two compounds together produce two distinct aromatic proton environments with an equal number of protons.\n*   The presence of **three** aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio describes the combined methyl proton signals from both compounds in the mixture.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nTo solve the problem, we must accurately predict the spectrum for each individual compound.\n\n*   **1,4-Diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This compound has ethyl groups, which produce a quartet (-CH2-) and a triplet (-CH3-) due to spin-spin coupling.

The two aromatic protons (at C4 and C6) are not equivalent. There are three distinct sets of methyl groups (the C1/C3 pair, the C2, and the C5).\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** **Two singlets**, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** **Three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow, we test which 1:1 mixture of the remaining compounds matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic Signals: 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three** aromatic signals. This does not match the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets**. Since each signal represents 2 protons, their integration ratio is **1:1**. This **matches** the data.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum shows **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem and the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe question provides a set of strict criteria for a 1:1 molar mixture of two isomers with the molecular formula C10H14.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows **two signals**, both of which are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **1:1**.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows **three signals**, all of which are **singlets**, with an integration ratio of **2:1:1**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The \"singlet\" nature of all signals is a critical clue. In the alkyl region, this strongly suggests the signals are from methyl groups that are not adjacent to any carbons bearing protons. This immediately raises a red flag for any compound containing ethyl groups.\n*   The number of signals and their ratios in the mixture are the sum of the signals from the two individual components.\n\n### **2. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nTo evaluate the mixtures, we must first accurately predict the spectrum for each individual compound based on its molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** This compound has two ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The protons on these groups will split each other, resulting in a quartet (-CH2-) and a triplet (-CH3-).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This violates the condition that all alkyl signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated** as a possible component.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons. This gives **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. This gives **one singlet** integrating to **12H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They appear as a single sharp signal, effectively **one singlet** integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (at C1 and C4) and the \"inner\" pair (at C2 and C3). This gives **two singlets**, each integrating to **6H**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has lower symmetry than the others.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments and have no adjacent protons. This gives **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to **1H**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three sets of chemically distinct methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1/C3 (6H), the unique group at C2 (3H), and the unique group at C5 (3H). This gives **three singlets** with a 6H:3H:3H ratio (which is **2:1:1**).\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test the options by combining the predicted spectra for a 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, these two different signals will appear as **two singlets**. Since each signal represents 2 protons, their integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This **matches** the aromatic data.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This **matches** the alkyl data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match for all the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet, and 1,2,3,5-TMB contributes two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the experimental data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one 2H singlet, and 1,2,3,5-TMB contributes two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the experimental data.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This combination perfectly accounts for the two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and the three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n<<<A>>>"

It then generated four hypotheses, corresponding to the mixtures in options A, B, C, and D.\n\n2.  **Constraint Application & Filtering:**\n    *   The script first checks the aromatic region. For a 1:1 mixture to have two singlets in a 1:1 ratio, each component must contribute one aromatic singlet representing the same number of protons (in this case, 2H each). 1,2,4,5-TMB, 1,2,3,4-TMB, and 1,2,3,5-TMB all fit this criterion. 1,4-diethylbenzene has a 4H singlet, which would create a 2H:4H (or 1:2) ratio, so any option with it would be eliminated.\n    *   The script then checks the aliphatic region. The mixture must have exactly three singlets with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n        *   **Option A (1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,4-TMB):** Combines one 12H singlet with two 6H singlets. This results in three total singlets with a 12:6:6 ratio, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This is a perfect match.\n        *   **Option B (1,2,3,5-TMB + 1,4-diethylbenzene):** This is eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n        *   **Option C (1,2,3,4-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):** Combines two 6H singlets with three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). This would result in five total signals (or four if one 6H signal overlaps), which does not match the required three signals.\n        *   **Option D (1,2,4,5-TMB + 1,2,3,5-TMB):** Combines one 12H singlet with three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). This results in four total signals, which does not match the required three signals.\n\n3.  **Surviving Candidates & Final Choice:**\n    *   The only candidate that survives the filtering process is Option A.

This means the mixture contains two distinct types of aromatic protons that do not have any adjacent proton neighbors. The total number of protons corresponding to each signal is equal.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1. This indicates three distinct types of alkyl protons. The \"singlet\" multiplicity suggests these are likely methyl groups attached to the benzene ring, as they have no adjacent protons to couple with.\n\n**Step 2: Eliminate candidates based on signal multiplicity.**\n*   The problem states all signals in the alkyl region are singlets.\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene** contains ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The -CH2- protons would appear as a quartet and the -CH3- protons would appear as a triplet due to spin-spin coupling.\n*   Since 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the alkyl region, it can be eliminated as a possible component. This immediately rules out **Option A**.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for the remaining individual compounds.**\nWe need to analyze the symmetry of each molecule to determine the number of unique proton environments.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. They will produce **two distinct singlets**, each with an integration of 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H), the one at C2 is unique (3H), and the one at C5 is unique (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 are also equivalent but distinct from the first pair. This results in **two singlets**, each with an integration of 6H (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the remaining mixture options.**\n\n*   **Option B (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three** aromatic signals. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **Option C (1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three** aromatic signals. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **Option D (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene):**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB provides one 2H singlet. Since they are different compounds, they will appear at slightly different chemical shifts. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets**, each corresponding to 2H. The integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the aromatic data.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB provides **one singlet** for **12H**. 1,2,3,4-TMB provides **two singlets**, each for **6H**. In the 1:1 mixture, the spectrum will show these three distinct signals. The integration ratio will be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the alkyl data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only combination that produces a spectrum with two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is the mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds from the given options.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem and the 1H NMR Data**\n\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two isomers with the formula C10H14.\n*   **Aromatic Region Data (~6.7 ppm):** The spectrum shows two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1. This means there are two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture, and the number of protons contributing to each signal is equal.\n*   **Alkyl Region Data (~2.2 ppm):** The spectrum shows three signals, all of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1. The fact that they are all singlets is a crucial clue, indicating the methyl groups are not adjacent to any carbons bearing protons.\n\n### **2. Analyze the Predicted 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe must predict the spectrum for each of the four compounds to see how they would contribute to the mixture's spectrum. This prediction is based on molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** This compound has two ethyl groups. An ethyl group's signal is split into a quartet (-CH2-) and a triplet (-CH3-).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the problem states all alkyl signals are singlets, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be immediately eliminated**. This rules out option **B**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent and have no adjacent protons. This gives **one singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent. This gives **one singlet** integrating to 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They form a single signal group integrating to 2H. In textbook problems, this is often simplified to **one singlet** (2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the outer pair (at C1 and C4) and the inner pair (at C2 and C3). This gives **two singlets**, each integrating to 6H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments and have no adjacent protons. This gives **two distinct singlets**, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three sets of chemically distinct methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the one at C2 (3H), and the one at C5 (3H). This gives **three singlets** with a 6H:3H:3H ratio (which is 2:1:1).\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test the remaining options (A, C, and D) by combining the predicted spectra for a 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **Option C: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Prehnitene contributes one signal (2H), and Isodurene contributes two signals (1H each). The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the experimental data of two signals.\n\n*   **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Durene contributes one signal (2H), and Isodurene contributes two signals (1H each). The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the experimental data. (Note: While a solution involving accidental overlap of signals is possible, it is less likely than a direct fit).\n\n*   **Option A: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** Durene provides one 2H singlet. Prehnitene provides one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets**. Since each signal represents 2 protons, their integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the aromatic data.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** Durene provides one singlet for 12H. Prehnitene provides two singlets, each for 6H. In the mixture, this combines to give **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The simplest whole-number ratio of these integrations is **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the alkyl data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe combination of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** is the only option that directly and simply accounts for all the features of the described 1H NMR spectrum: two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three alkyl singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the 1H NMR Data for the Mixture**\n\nThe problem provides the following key pieces of information about the 1H NMR spectrum of a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** There are two signals, both of which are singlets, and their integration ratio is 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** There are three signals, all of which are singlets, and their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are isomers with the formula C10H14.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the structure and symmetry of each candidate compound to predict its spectrum.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Alkyl Region:** This compound has ethyl groups, which would produce a quartet (for the -CH2-) and a triplet (for the -CH3-) due to spin-spin coupling.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the problem states all alkyl signals are singlets, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This immediately rules out option D.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical, with two perpendicular planes of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons. This results in **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. This results in **one aliphatic singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons to split with. This results in **one aromatic singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the outer pair (at C1 and C4) and the inner pair (at C2 and C3). This results in **two aliphatic singlets (each 6H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. C4 is between a methyl group and a hydrogen, while C6 is between two methyl groups. This results in **two distinct aromatic singlets (each 1H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three sets of chemically distinct methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (6H), the one at C2 (3H), and the one at C5 (3H). This results in **three aliphatic singlets (6H, 3H, 3H)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow, we combine the predicted spectra for the pairs in each option to see which one matches the experimental data for the 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, these would appear as **two singlets**. Since each signal represents 2 protons, their integration ratio is 2H:2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. **This matches the aromatic data.**\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum would show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.

This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   This option was already eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\nThe only pair of compounds that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum in a 1:1 mixture is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Information from the Question**\n\n1.  **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two aromatic compounds.\n2.  **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n3.  **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both are singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe need to analyze the structure of each compound to predict its 1H NMR spectrum, paying close attention to symmetry.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they appear as **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They appear as **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments and have no adjacent protons. They appear as **two separate singlets (1H each)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 are equivalent, the one at C2 is unique, and the one at C5 is unique. This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H (or **2:1:1**).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. Although they are adjacent, in many tetramethylbenzenes, such AA' systems appear as a sharp singlet. We will assume it gives **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the outer ones (C1/C4) and the inner ones (C2/C3). This results in **two singlets**, each integrating to 6H (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are equivalent, giving **one singlet (4H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The problem states all alkyl signals are singlets.

Therefore, **this compound can be eliminated**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture that matches the experimental data: two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show **three** aromatic signals. This does not match.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic: 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show **three** aromatic signals. This does not match.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, these two different signals will appear as **two singlets**. Since each signal represents 2 protons, the integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. **This matches the aromatic data.**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. **This matches the alkyl data.**\n    *   This option is a perfect match for all the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This option is eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo determine the two compounds present in the mixture, we will follow a systematic approach:\n1.  Analyze the provided 1H NMR spectral data.\n2.  Predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each of the four candidate compounds.\n3.  Eliminate candidates that are inconsistent with the data.\n4.  Evaluate the remaining combinations to find the mixture that matches the experimental spectrum.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Given NMR Data\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two C10H14 isomers.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio. This means there are two distinct types of aromatic protons in the mixture, and the number of protons contributing to each signal is equal.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio. The fact that all signals are singlets is a crucial piece of information, suggesting the protons are on carbons (likely methyl groups) with no adjacent carbons bearing protons.\n\n### Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, it has only two types of protons.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** The four methyl groups are all equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. This will produce **two distinct singlets**, each with an integration of 1H.\n    *   **Aliphatic:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the pair at C1/C3 (equivalent), the one at C2, and the one at C5. This will produce **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 2H. (While they are adjacent, in this symmetrical environment, they often appear as a singlet).\n    *   **Aliphatic:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the pair at C1/C4 and the pair at C2/C3. This will produce **two singlets**, each with an integration of 6H (a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aliphatic:** The ethyl groups will show spin-spin coupling, producing a **quartet** for the -CH2- protons and a **triplet** for the -CH3- protons. This contradicts the data that all aliphatic signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This rules out option D.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options\n\nWe need to find a 1:1 mixture that gives two aromatic singlets (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **Option B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic signals: One 2H singlet from 1,2,3,4-TMB and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB would result in three signals. This does not match.\n\n*   **Option C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic signals: One 2H singlet from 1,2,4,5-TMB and two 1H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB would result in three signals. This does not match.\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the aromatic data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This perfectly matches the aliphatic data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described 1H NMR spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Information from the Question**\n\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two aromatic compounds.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both are singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n    *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe must analyze the structure and symmetry of each compound to predict the number of signals, their multiplicity (e.g., singlet), and their relative integration.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The protons on these groups will split each other, resulting in a quartet and a triplet in the alkyl region. The problem states all alkyl signals are singlets. Therefore, **1,4-diethylbenzene is eliminated**. This rules out option **C**.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons. This gives **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. This gives **one singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent. Although they are adjacent, in this specific symmetric system (an AA' system), they appear as a single sharp signal. This gives **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the \"outer\" pair (at C1 and C4) and the \"inner\" pair (at C2 and C3). This gives **two singlets (6H each)**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** This symmetry makes the two protons (at C4 and C6) chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons. This gives **one singlet (2H)**.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups: the equivalent pair (at C1 and C3), the unique group at C2, and the unique group at C5. This gives **three singlets (6H, 3H, and 3H)**, which is a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Remaining Mixture Options**\n\nNow, we combine the predicted spectra for the pairs in the remaining options (A, B, D) to see which one matches the experimental data for the 1:1 mixture.\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, these two non-identical compounds will produce **two distinct singlets**. Since each signal represents 2 protons, their integration ratio will be 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This **matches** the aromatic data.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum will show **three distinct singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This **matches** the alkyl data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match.\n\n*   **Option B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have at least four signals (one 6H signal might overlap), which does not match the \"three signals\" observation.\n\n*   **Option D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives three singlets (6H, 3H, 3H). The combined spectrum would have four signals. This does not match the \"three signals\" observation unless we assume a case of accidental degeneracy (e.g., the two 3H signals overlap), which is a less direct explanation than that for Option A.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe combination of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** is the only one that naturally and directly accounts for all the features of the described 1H NMR spectrum: two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds from the given options.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe problem provides the following information about the 1H NMR spectrum of a 1:1 molar mixture of two C10H14 isomers:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both are singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nThis data provides a unique fingerprint for the mixture that we can compare against the predicted spectra of the options.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\n\nWe need to analyze the structure and symmetry of each candidate molecule to predict its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This compound has ethyl groups (-CH2CH3).

This contradicts the data that all alkyl signals are singlets. **This compound can be eliminated.**\n\n### **3. Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we test the combinations given in the options against the experimental data.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic signals: 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with a 2H:2H or **1:1 integration ratio**. This **matches** the data.\n    *   **Alkyl signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 12H singlet. 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two 6H singlets. The combined spectrum shows **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This **matches** the data.\n    *   This option is a perfect fit for all observations.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   Aromatic signals: 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This option is eliminated because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce only singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nTo determine the two compounds present in the mixture, we will systematically analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each candidate compound and then evaluate which 1:1 mixture matches the provided experimental data.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Experimental 1H NMR Data**\n\nThe spectrum of the 1:1 mixture shows the following key features:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all of which are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\nThe fact that all signals are singlets is a crucial piece of information.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nWe will predict the spectrum for each of the four isomers of C10H14 based on their molecular symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-Diethylbenzene:** This molecule contains two ethyl groups. The protons of an ethyl group are not singlets; they split each other to form a characteristic quartet (-CH2-) and triplet (-CH3-). Since the problem states all aliphatic signals are singlets, **1,4-diethylbenzene can be eliminated**. This rules out option D.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent and have no adjacent protons. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. Although they are adjacent, in this symmetrical environment (an AA' system), they appear as a single sharp signal. This gives **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the pair at C1 and C4, and the pair at C2 and C3. This results in **two singlets**, each with an integration of 6H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments and have no adjacent protons. This will produce **two distinct singlets**, each with an integration of 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** There are three sets of chemically distinct methyl groups: the equivalent pair at C1 and C3 (6H), the unique methyl at C2 (3H), and the unique methyl at C5 (3H). This results in **three singlets** with an integration ratio of 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow we can test which 1:1 mixture of the remaining compounds matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Option B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet (2H), and 1,2,3,5-TMB contributes two singlets (1H each). The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the experimental data of two signals.\n\n*   **Option C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one singlet (2H), and 1,2,3,5-TMB contributes two singlets (1H each). The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This also contradicts the data.\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet, and 1,2,3,4-TMB provides one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets**. Since each signal represents 2 protons, their integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**. This perfectly matches the aromatic region data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB provides one singlet (12H), and 1,2,3,4-TMB provides two singlets (6H each). The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio of these integrations is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also perfectly matches the aliphatic region data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces a spectrum with two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem Constraints**\n\nThe question provides a set of strict constraints for a 1:1 molar mixture of two C10H14 isomers:\n*   **Constraint 1 (Aromatic Region Multiplicity):** The two signals in the aromatic region must be **singlets**. This means the aromatic protons in each respective molecule do not have adjacent proton neighbors.\n*   **Constraint 2 (Aromatic Region Signals & Ratio):** There must be exactly **two** aromatic signals in total, and their integration ratio must be **1:1**.\n*   **Constraint 3 (Alkyl Region Multiplicity):** The three signals in the alkyl region must all be **singlets**. This implies the signals come from methyl groups that are not adjacent to carbons bearing protons.\n*   **Constraint 4 (Alkyl Region Signals & Ratio):** There must be exactly **three** alkyl signals in total, and their integration ratio must be **2:1:1**.\n\n### **2. Analyze Individual Compounds and Prune the Options**\n\nLet's predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each candidate compound to see if it can be part of a mixture that meets the constraints.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   Alkyl Region: The ethyl groups would produce a **quartet** and a **triplet**.\n    *   **Pruning:** This violates Constraint 3 (all alkyl signals are singlets). Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene cannot be in the mixture. This eliminates **Option C**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   Aromatic Region: It has two non-equivalent aromatic protons (at C4 and C6). Neither has an adjacent proton. This compound by itself produces **two 1H singlets**.\n    *   **Pruning:** If this compound is in the mixture, it already provides two aromatic signals. For the mixture to have only two signals in total, the other compound must either have no aromatic protons (not possible for these isomers) or its aromatic signal(s) must perfectly overlap with one or both of Isodurene's signals. More importantly, if we mix it with any of the other candidates (which all produce one 2H aromatic signal), the total number of aromatic signals would be 1 + 2 = 3. This violates Constraint 2. Therefore, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene is unlikely to be in the mixture. This eliminates **Option A** and **Option D**.\n\n### **3. Verify the Remaining Option**\n\nOnly **Option B** remains. Let's verify if a 1:1 mixture of **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** satisfies all constraints.\n\n*   **Candidate 1: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   Aromatic: High symmetry gives one type of aromatic proton -> **1 singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Alkyl: High symmetry gives one type of methyl group -> **1 singlet (12H)**.\n\n*   **Candidate 2: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   Aromatic: Symmetry gives one type of aromatic proton -> **1 singlet (2H)**.\n    *   Alkyl: Symmetry gives two types of methyl groups -> **2 singlets (6H each)**.\n\nNow, let's combine them in a 1:1 mixture:\n\n*   **Aromatic Region Check:**\n    *   Durene contributes one 2H singlet. Prehnitene contributes another 2H singlet at a different chemical shift.\n    *   Result: **Two singlets**. Since it's a 1:1 mixture and each signal represents 2H, the integration ratio is 2H:2H, which is **1:1**.\n    *   **Constraint 1 & 2: PASS**\n\n*   **Alkyl Region Check:**\n    *   Durene contributes one singlet (12H).\n    *   Prehnitene contributes two singlets (6H each).\n    *   Result: **Three singlets** in total, with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H.\n    *   The simplest whole-number ratio is 12:6:6, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Constraint 3 & 4: PASS**\n\nThe mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is the only combination that perfectly matches all the spectral data described.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer from the given options.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Information from the Question**\n\n*   **Mixture:** A 1:1 molar ratio of two compounds.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Both compounds are C10H14.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both are singlets, with an integration ratio of 1:1.\n    *   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all are singlets, with an integration ratio of 2:1:1.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Predicted 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nThe key to this problem is understanding the number of unique proton environments in each molecule, which is determined by its symmetry.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This compound has two ethyl groups. The protons on the ethyl groups (-CH2- and -CH3) will couple with each other, producing a quartet and a triplet, respectively.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the problem states all alkyl signals are singlets, **1,4-diethylbenzene is eliminated**. This immediately rules out option D.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (2H):** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons (12H):** All four methyl groups are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (2H):** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They will produce **one singlet** with an integration of 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons (12H):** There are two sets of equivalent methyl groups: the outer pair (at C1 and C4) and the inner pair (at C2 and C3). This results in **two singlets**, each with an integration of 6H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has lower symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons (2H):** The protons at C4 and C6 are in different chemical environments. This will produce **two separate singlets**, each with an integration of 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons (12H):** There are three sets of chemically distinct methyl groups. This results in **three singlets** with integrations of 6H, 3H, and 3H (a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Mixture Options**\n\nNow, we combine the spectra of the pairs in the remaining options (A, B, C) to see which one matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **Option B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **Option C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one 2H singlet. 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two 1H singlets. The mixture would show a total of **three aromatic signals**. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **Option A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one 2H singlet.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes one 2H singlet.\n        *   In a 1:1 mixture, this results in **two singlets** with an integration ratio of 2H:2H, which simplifies to **1:1**. This **matches** the aromatic data.\n    *   **Aliphatic Signals:**\n        *   1,2,4,5-TMB contributes one singlet for 12H.\n        *   1,2,3,4-TMB contributes two singlets, each for 6H.\n        *   The combined spectrum will show **three singlets** with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. The ratio 12:6:6 simplifies to **2:1:1**. This **matches** the aliphatic data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only pair of compounds that, when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, produces the described spectrum is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**. This combination perfectly accounts for the two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio and the three aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio without needing to assume any accidental signal overlaps.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds based on the provided information.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Experimental Data**\n\nThe problem provides the 1H NMR data for a 1:1 molar mixture of two compounds with the formula C10H14.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\nThe key takeaways are:\n*   The presence of only **singlets** in the aliphatic region strongly suggests the signals are from methyl groups and rules out compounds with ethyl groups, like 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n*   The presence of **two** aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio for a 1:1 mixture implies that the two compounds together produce two distinct aromatic proton environments with an equal number of protons.\n*   The presence of **three** aliphatic singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio describes the combined methyl proton signals from both compounds in the mixture.\n\n### **Step 2: Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Candidate Compound**\n\nTo solve the problem, we must accurately predict the spectrum for each individual compound.\n\n*   **1,4-Diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This compound has ethyl groups, which produce a quartet (-CH2-) and a triplet (-CH3-) due to spin-spin coupling.
