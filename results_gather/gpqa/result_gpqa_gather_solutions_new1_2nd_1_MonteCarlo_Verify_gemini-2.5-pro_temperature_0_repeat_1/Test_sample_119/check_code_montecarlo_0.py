def check_star_parallax_distribution():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the derivation for the number of stars per unit parallax.

    The problem states:
    - Stars are uniformly distributed in space (constant density rho).
    - Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (d): d = 1/plx.
    - We need to find how the number of stars per unit parallax (dN/d(plx)) changes with plx.

    The derivation proceeds as follows:
    1. Number of stars dN in a shell of radius d and thickness dd is dN = rho * dV = rho * (4*pi*d^2) * dd.
       So, dN is proportional to d^2 * dd.
    2. We want to find dN/d(plx). Using the chain rule: dN/d(plx) = (dN/dd) * (dd/d(plx)).
    3. From step 1, dN/dd is proportional to d^2.
    4. From d = 1/plx, we can find the derivative dd/d(plx) = -1/plx^2.
       Since we are counting stars, we use the magnitude: |dd/d(plx)| = 1/plx^2.
    5. Combining these: dN/d(plx) is proportional to d^2 * (1/plx^2).
    6. Substituting d = 1/plx gives: dN/d(plx) is proportional to (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) = 1/plx^4.
