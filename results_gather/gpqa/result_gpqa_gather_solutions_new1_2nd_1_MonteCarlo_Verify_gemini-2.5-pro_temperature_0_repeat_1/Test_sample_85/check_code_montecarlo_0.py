This problem requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of two distinct chemical reactions, focusing on reagent selectivity and the resulting stereochemistry. The most common pitfall is to oversimplify the stereochemical outcome.

### **1. Analyze the Structures and Chiral Center**

*   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has a single chiral center at Carbon-3 (C3), the carbon bonded to the ethyl group.
*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered lactone. The chiral center from C3 of the starting material becomes C4 in the lactone product.
*   **Groups on the Chiral Center (C3):**
    1.  `-H` (Hydrogen)
    2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)
    3.  `-CH₂COOH` (Carboxylic acid side)
    4.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (Isobutyl ester side)

### **2. Careful Point 1: Chemoselectivity of the Reagents**

This is the first critical step. The two reducing agents have opposite selectivities for the functional groups present.
*   **Lithium Borohydride (LiBH₄):** Selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.
*   **Borane (BH₃):** Selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.

### **3. Careful Point 2: Configuration vs. R/S Label (The Decisive Step)**

In both reaction pathways, the chemical transformations occur at the functional groups (ester and acid), which are not directly attached to the chiral center. The bonds at the chiral C3 are not broken or formed. Therefore, the 3D spatial arrangement of the groups around the chiral center is preserved. This is known as **retention of configuration**.

However, the R/S designation is a *label* based on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups. If a reaction changes the chemical nature of these groups, their priorities can change, which can cause the R/S label to flip, even if the 3D configuration is retained.

**Initial CIP Priority in the Starting Material:**
To rank the two main side chains, we compare them atom by atom. The ester chain (`-CH₂-C(=O)O-C₄H₉`) has priority over the acid chain (`-CH₂-C(=O)O-H`) because the oxygen in the ester is bonded to a carbon, while the oxygen in the acid is bonded to a hydrogen.
*   **Priority Order:** `-CH₂COOiBu` (High) > `-CH₂COOH` (Mid) > `-CH₂CH₃` (Low) > `-H` (Lowest)

---

### **4. Analysis of Reaction A: A + LiBH₄ → (R)-Product**

1.  **Transformation:** LiBH₄ reduces the ester group: `-CH₂COOiBu` becomes `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) is unchanged.
2.  **Priorities in Intermediate:** We now compare the new group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`) with the unchanged acid group (`-CH₂COOH`). The acid group outranks the new alcohol group.
3.  **Priority Change:**
    *   **Before:** Ester side > Acid side
    *   **After:** Acid side > Alcohol side (from original ester side)
    *   The priorities of the two highest-ranking groups have **swapped**.
4.  **Stereochemical Conclusion:** When the 3D configuration is retained but the priorities of two groups swap, the R/S label **inverts**. Therefore, to obtain an **(R)**-product, the starting material **A** must have the **(S)** configuration.

---

### **5. Analysis of Reaction B: B + BH₃ → (S)-Product**

1.  **Transformation:** BH₃ reduces the acid group: `-CH₂COOH` becomes `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is unchanged.
2.  **Priorities in Intermediate:** We compare the unchanged ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) with the new alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group still outranks the alcohol group.
3.  **Priority Change:**
    *   **Before:** Ester side > Acid side
    *   **After:** Ester side > Alcohol side (from original acid side)
    *   The priority order of the two highest-ranking groups is **maintained**.
4.  **Stereochemical Conclusion:** When the 3D configuration is retained and the priority order does not change, the R/S label is **retained**. Therefore, to obtain an **(S)**-product, the starting material **B** must have the **(S)** configuration.

### **Final Decision**

*   For Reaction A, the starting material must be **(S)**.
*   For Reaction B, the starting material must be **(S)**.

This means both A and B are the same enantiomer: **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This corresponds to option D.
