All the apothems are of the same length a. When a monochromatic light (of wavelength \\lambda), travelling along z-axis, falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a series of intensity maxima and minima in the far field region.

It recognized that an N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a' becomes a circle of radius 'a' as N approaches infinity. It then used the formula for the angular distance between the first two diffraction minima for a circular aperture, which is derived from the zeros of the first-order Bessel function (`J₁`). The calculation `Δθ = (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) * (λ/a)` was performed using the standard values for the first two zeros (`z₁ ≈ 3.8317`, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`), resulting in a theoretical coefficient of `0.50673...`.\n\n3.  **Pruning & Selection**: The calculated coefficient `0.50673...` was compared against the initial hypotheses. The script found that the value from option B, `0.506`, had the smallest difference (`~0.0007`). This confirms that `0.506 λ / a` is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Geometric Simplification of the Aperture:** The problem states that the aperture is an N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a', and N is infinitely large. As the number of sides of a regular polygon with a constant apothem approaches infinity, the polygon's shape converges to that of a circle. The apothem 'a' becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to analyzing the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Fraunhofer Diffraction by a Circular Aperture:** When monochromatic light passes through a circular aperture, it produces a far-field diffraction pattern known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The angular positions of the dark rings (intensity minima) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x).\n\n3.  **Formula for Intensity Minima:** The condition for an intensity minimum is that the argument of the Bessel function, `x = k * a * sin(θ)`, must be a non-trivial zero of the J₁(x) function.\n    *   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π/λ`.\n    *   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n    *   `θ` is the angular position from the central axis.\n    *   The problem allows for the small-angle approximation, so `sin(θ) ≈ θ`.\n\n    The condition for the n-th minimum (θₙ) becomes:\n    `(2πa/λ) * θₙ = xₙ`\n    where `xₙ` is the n-th zero of J₁(x).\n    Solving for θₙ gives:\n    `θₙ = (xₙ / 2π) * (λ/a)`\n\n4.  **Numerical Calculation:** To find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need the values of the first two non-trivial zeros of J₁(x).\n    *   First zero, `x₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n    *   Second zero, `x₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\n    Now, we can calculate the angular positions of the first two minima:\n    *   **First minimum (θ₁):** `θ₁ = (3.8317 / 2π) * (λ/a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ/a)`\n    *   **Second minimum (θ₂):** `θ₂ = (7.0156 / 2π) * (λ/a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ/a)`\n\n5.  **Angular Distance:** The question asks for the angular distance between these two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n    `Δθ = (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ/a)`\n    `Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ/a)`\n\n6.  **Comparison with Options:** The calculated value is `0.5068 * (λ/a)`. We compare this with the given options:\n    *   A) 0.610 λ / a\n    *   B) 0.506 λ / a\n    *   C) 1.220 λ /a\n    *   D) 0.500 λ / a\n\n    The calculated value `0.5068` is best matched by option B, `0.506`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Aperture Radius:** It is crucial to recognize that the apothem 'a' of the limiting polygon becomes the **radius** of the circular aperture, not its diameter.\n*   **Quantity to Calculate:** The question asks for the **angular distance between the first two minima** (`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`), not the position of the first minimum (`θ₁ ≈ 0.610 λ/a`) or the angular diameter of the central Airy disk (`2θ₁ ≈ 1.220 λ/a`). Options A and C correspond to these incorrect quantities.\n*   **Approximations:** While common approximations like `θ₁ ≈ 1.22 λ/d` (where d is diameter) are useful, using the more precise zeros of the Bessel function provides a more accurate result and confirms the choice between `0.506 λ/a` and `0.500 λ/a`.\n*   **Consistency of Candidate Answers:** Many of the provided candidate answers correctly calculate the numerical value but select the wrong letter (A, C, or D) due to inconsistent labeling of the options in their own context. The correct decision must be based on the options provided in the original question.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the correct numerical coefficient for the angular distance is approximately 0.5068, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the reasoning from the provided answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture's Geometry:** The problem starts with an N-sided regular polygon where the apothem (the perpendicular distance from the center to a side) is a constant length 'a'. The question asks to consider the case where the number of sides, N, becomes infinitely large (N → ∞). In this limit, a regular polygon with a constant apothem converges to a circle. The radius of this resulting circle is equal to the apothem, 'a'. Therefore, the complex polygonal aperture simplifies to a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Identify the Physics Phenomenon:** A monochromatic light wave passing through this circular aperture will undergo diffraction. Since the observation is in the far-field region, this is specifically Fraunhofer diffraction. The diffraction pattern from a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings.\n\n3.  **Locate the Intensity Minima:** The dark rings in the Airy pattern correspond to the intensity minima. The angular positions of these minima are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x). The intensity is zero when the argument of the Bessel function, `x = k * a * sin(θ)`, corresponds to a non-trivial zero of J₁(x).\n    *   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π/λ`.\n    *   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n    *   `θ` is the diffraction angle.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Minima Positions:** Using the small-angle approximation (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`), the condition for the n-th minimum is:\n    `(2πa/λ) * θ_n = z_n`\n    where `z_n` is the n-th non-trivial zero of the J₁(x) Bessel function. Solving for the angular position `θ_n` gives:\n    `θ_n = (z_n * λ) / (2πa)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the First Two Minima:** To find the angular distance between the first two minima, we first need their individual positions. This requires the first two non-trivial zeros of J₁(x):\n    *   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n    *   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\n    Now, we calculate the angular positions:\n    *   Position of the first minimum: `θ₁ = (3.8317 * λ) / (2πa) ≈ 0.6098 * λ / a`\n    *   Position of the second minimum: `θ₂ = (7.0156 * λ) / (2πa) ≈ 1.1166 * λ / a`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Angular Distance:** The question asks for the angular distance *between* the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n    `Δθ = (1.1166 * λ / a) - (0.6098 * λ / a)`\n    `Δθ = (1.1166 - 0.6098) * λ / a`\n    `Δθ = 0.5068 * λ / a`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated angular distance is approximately `0.5068 * λ / a`. Comparing this with the given options:\n    *   A) 0.500 λ / a\n    *   B) 1.220 λ / a\n    *   C) 0.610 λ / a\n    *   D) 0.506 λ / a\n\n    The calculated value `0.5068` is best matched by option D, `0.506`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Aperture Shape:** The most critical step is correctly identifying that the N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a' becomes a circle of radius 'a'.\n*   **The Question's Goal:** A common mistake is to calculate only the position of the first minimum (`θ₁ ≈ 0.610 λ / a`) and select option C. The question explicitly asks for the *angular distance between* the first two minima (`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`).\n*   **Radius vs. Diameter:** Many standard formulas for diffraction use the diameter `d`. In this problem, the radius is 'a', so the diameter is `d = 2a`. Care must be taken to use the correct dimension in the formulas. For example, the first minimum is at `θ₁ ≈ 1.22 λ / d`, which becomes `1.22 λ / (2a) = 0.61 λ / a`.\n*   **Precision:** Using the common rounded approximations for the minima locations (e.g., `1.22 λ/d` and `2.23 λ/d`) gives `Δθ ≈ 0.505 λ/a`. Using the more precise zeros of the Bessel function gives `Δθ ≈ 0.5068 λ/a`, which more definitively points to `0.506` as the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture's Geometry**: The problem states that the aperture is an N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a', and we need to consider the case where N is infinitely large (N → ∞). As the number of sides of a regular polygon increases to infinity, its shape approaches that of a circle. The apothem, which is the perpendicular distance from the center to a side, becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the problem simplifies to analyzing the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Identify the Diffraction Phenomenon**: The light undergoes Fraunhofer diffraction as it passes through the circular aperture. This creates a characteristic far-field intensity pattern known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings.\n\n3.  **Locate the Intensity Minima**: The dark rings correspond to the intensity minima. Their angular positions are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x). The intensity is zero when the argument of the Bessel function, `x = (2πa/λ)sin(θ)`, is equal to one of the non-trivial zeros of J₁(x).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Angular Positions of the Minima**: Using the small angle approximation given in the problem (sin(θ) ≈ θ), the condition for the n-th minimum is:\n    `(2πa/λ) * θ_n = z_n`\n    where `z_n` is the n-th non-trivial zero of the J₁(x) function.\n    Solving for the angular position `θ_n` gives:\n    `θ_n = (z_n / 2π) * (λ / a)`\n\n    The first two non-trivial zeros of J₁(x) are approximately:\n    *   `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n    *   `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\n    Now, we can calculate the angular positions of the first two minima:\n    *   **First minimum (θ₁)**: `θ₁ = (3.8317 / 2π) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * λ / a`\n    *   **Second minimum (θ₂)**: `θ₂ = (7.0156 / 2π) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * λ / a`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Angular Distance**: The question asks for the angular distance *between* the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n    `Δθ = (1.1166 * λ / a) - (0.6098 * λ / a)`\n    `Δθ = (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ / a)`\n    `Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * λ / a`\n\n6.  **Compare with Options and Conclude**: The calculated angular distance is approximately `0.5068 * λ / a`. Comparing this with the given options:\n    *   A) 0.506 λ / a\n    *   B) 0.500 λ / a\n    *   C) 0.610 λ / a\n    *   D) 1.220 λ /a\n\n    The calculated value `0.5068 * λ / a` is best matched by option A.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Aperture Shape**: The crucial first step is realizing that an N-sided polygon with a constant apothem 'a' becomes a circle of radius 'a' as N → ∞.\n*   **Radius vs. Diameter**: The radius of the aperture is 'a'. Many standard formulas for diffraction use the diameter `D = 2a`. Using the wrong dimension will lead to an error by a factor of 2.\n*   **Position vs. Distance**: Option C, `0.610 λ / a`, corresponds to the angular position of the *first* minimum (`θ₁`), not the angular *distance between* the first two minima (`Δθ`). This is a common distractor. The question explicitly asks for the distance between the two.\n*   **Precision**: Using the common rounded approximation for the first minimum (`θ₁ ≈ 1.22 * λ / D = 0.61 * λ / a`) and the second minimum (`θ₂ ≈ 2.23 * λ / D = 1.115 * λ / a`) yields `Δθ ≈ 0.505 * λ / a`. Using the more precise zeros of the Bessel function gives `0.5068 * λ / a`.

The question asks to consider the case where the number of sides, N, becomes infinitely large. In this limit (as N → ∞), a regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' converges to the shape of a circle whose radius is equal to the apothem 'a'. Therefore, the complex polygonal aperture simplifies to a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Identify the Physical Phenomenon**: A monochromatic light wave falls vertically on this aperture, and we are interested in the intensity pattern in the far-field region. This is a classic example of Fraunhofer diffraction. For a circular aperture, the resulting diffraction pattern is known as an Airy pattern.\n\n3.  **Locate the Intensity Minima**: The Airy pattern consists of a bright central disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings.

While useful, it's more precise to use the zeros of the Bessel function directly, as the constants `1.22`, `2.23`, etc., are themselves derived and rounded from these zeros. Using the zeros directly (`z₁` and `z₂`) for the calculation `Δθ = (z₂ - z₁) / (2π) * (λ/a)` yields the most accurate result.\n*   **Radius vs. Diameter**: The radius of the aperture is `a`.

The value for `θ₁` is `~0.610 λ / a`, which corresponds to option D and is a classic distractor.\n*   **Aperture Diameter:** The radius of the aperture is `a`. Many standard formulas for diffraction use the diameter `D`. It is essential to remember that `D = 2a` when applying these formulas. For example, the first minimum is at `θ₁ ≈ 1.22 * λ / D = 1.22 * λ / (2a) = 0.610 * λ / a`.\n*   **Precision:** Using the common approximations for the minima locations (e.g., `1.22 λ/D` and `2.23 λ/D`) gives a result of `0.505 λ/a`.

The intensity is zero when the argument of the Bessel function, `x = (2πa/λ)sin(θ)`, is equal to one of these non-trivial zeros.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Angular Position of the Minima**: Using the small-angle approximation (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`), the condition for the n-th minimum is `(2πa/λ)θ_n = z_n`, where `z_n` is the n-th non-zero root of J₁(x).

The question asks to consider the case where the number of sides, N, becomes infinitely large. In this limit (N → ∞), a regular polygon with a constant apothem converges to the shape of a circle. The apothem 'a' becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the problem simplifies to analyzing the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Identify the Physical Phenomenon:** A monochromatic light wave falls on this aperture, and we are interested in the intensity pattern in the far-field region. This is a classic example of Fraunhofer diffraction. For a circular aperture, the resulting diffraction pattern is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings.\n\n3.  **Locate the Intensity Minima:** The question concerns the angular distance between the first two intensity minima (the dark rings). The angular positions of these minima are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x). The intensity is zero when the argument of the Bessel function is a non-zero root.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Calculation:** The condition for the n-th intensity minimum is given by:\n    `k * a * sin(θ_n) = z_n`\n    where:\n    *   `k = 2π/λ` is the wave number.\n    *   `a` is the radius of the circular aperture.\n    *   `θ_n` is the angular position of the n-th minimum.\n    *   `z_n` is the n-th non-trivial zero of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\n    Using the small-angle approximation given in the problem (`sin(θ_n) ≈ θ_n`), the formula becomes:\n    `(2π * a / λ) * θ_n = z_n`\n\n    Solving for the angular position `θ_n`:\n    `θ_n = (z_n / 2π) * (λ / a)`\n\n5.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation:** To find the angular distance between the first two minima, we need the values of the first two non-trivial zeros of J₁(x).\n    *   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n    *   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\n    Now, we can calculate the angular positions of the first and second minima:\n    *   `θ₁ = (3.8317 / 2π) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n    *   `θ₂ = (7.0156 / 2π) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\n    The question asks for the angular distance *between* these two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n    `Δθ = (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ / a)`\n    `Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\n\n6.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:** The calculated angular distance is approximately `0.5068 * (λ / a)`.

It asks for the **angular distance between the first two minima** (`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`), not the position of the first minimum (`θ₁`).\n*   **Analysis of Distractors:**\n    *   The value `0.610 λ / a` (Option B) corresponds to the position of the first minimum, `θ₁`. This is a classic distractor.\n    *   The value `1.220 λ / a` (Option A) corresponds to the angular diameter of the central maximum (`2θ₁`) if the aperture's *diameter* were 'a'. Since the radius is 'a', this option is incorrect on two counts.\n    *   The value `0.500 λ / a` (Option C) is a close but less accurate approximation of the correct answer.\n*   **Precision:** Using the fundamental zeros of the Bessel function (`z₁` and `z₂`) provides the most accurate result. Relying on rounded textbook formulas (like `θ₁ ≈ 1.22 λ/d`) can sometimes be less precise, but in this case, it would still point to the correct answer: `θ₂ ≈ 2.23 λ/d`, so `Δθ ≈ (2.23-1.22)λ/d = 1.01λ/(2a) = 0.505 λ/a`, which is closest to 0.506.\n\nThe consensus of correct physical reasoning leads to a numerical coefficient of approximately 0.5068.\n\n<<<D>>>"

For a regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' (the perpendicular distance from the center to a side), as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. The apothem 'a' becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the problem simplifies to calculating the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Physics of Diffraction:**\n    The problem involves Fraunhofer diffraction (far-field) of monochromatic light passing through this circular aperture. The resulting intensity pattern is known as an Airy pattern.

The intensity is zero when the argument of the Bessel function, `x = k * a * sin(θ)`, is a non-zero root of J₁(x).\n    *   `k` is the wave number, `k = 2π/λ`.\n    *   `a` is the radius of the aperture.\n    *   `θ` is the angular position from the central axis.\n\n    Using the small angle approximation (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`), the condition for the n-th minimum is:\n    `(2πa/λ) * θ_n = z_n`\n    where `z_n` is the n-th non-trivial zero of J₁(x). This can be rearranged to find the angular position of the n-th minimum:\n    `θ_n = (z_n / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n4.  **Calculation of Angular Positions:**\n    To find the distance between the first two minima, we need their individual positions, which depend on the first two zeros of J₁(x).\n    *   First zero, `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n    *   Second zero, `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\n    Now, we can calculate the angular positions:\n    *   **First minimum (θ₁):**\n        `θ₁ = (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * λ / a`\n    *   **Second minimum (θ₂):**\n        `θ₂ = (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * λ / a`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Angular Distance:**\n    The question asks for the angular distance *between* the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n    `Δθ = (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ / a)`\n    `Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * λ / a`\n\n6.  **Conclusion and Comparison with Options:**\n    The calculated angular distance is approximately `0.5068 * λ / a`.

It asks for the **distance between the first two minima** (`θ₂ - θ₁`), not the position of the first minimum (`θ₁`). The value for `θ₁` is `~0.610 λ / a`, which corresponds to option D and is a classic distractor.\n*   **Aperture Diameter:** The radius of the aperture is `a`. Many standard formulas for diffraction use the diameter `D`. It is essential to remember that `D = 2a` when applying these formulas. For example, the first minimum is at `θ₁ ≈ 1.22 * λ / D = 1.22 * λ / (2a) = 0.610 * λ / a`.\n*   **Precision:** Using the common approximations for the minima locations (e.g., `1.22 λ/D` and `2.23 λ/D`) gives a result of `0.505 λ/a`. Using the more precise zeros of the Bessel function gives `0.5068 λ/a`, which more clearly points to the correct answer.\n*   **Option Labeling:** As seen in the candidate answers, there was significant confusion about which letter corresponded to which value. Based on the prompt's original list, `0.506 λ / a` is option B.\n\nThe overwhelming consensus from the calculations in the candidate answers is that the numerical coefficient is ~0.506.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct reasoning from the provided answers.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Geometry of the Aperture**\nThe problem describes an aperture shaped like an N-sided regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a'. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. As the number of sides, N, approaches infinity, the polygon becomes indistinguishable from a circle. The apothem 'a' becomes the radius of this circle.\n*   **Careful Point:** The limiting shape is a circle of radius `r = a`. The diameter of this circle is `d = 2a`.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Relevant Physics**\nThe problem involves the diffraction of monochromatic light in the far-field region, which is described by Fraunhofer diffraction. For a circular aperture, the resulting diffraction pattern is known as an Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central disk surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings.\n\n**Step 3: Locate the Intensity Minima**\nThe angular positions of the dark rings (intensity minima) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x). The condition for the n-th minimum is:\n`k * r * sin(θ_n) = z_n`\nwhere:\n*   `k = 2π/λ` is the wave number.\n*   `r = a` is the radius of the aperture.\n*   `θ_n` is the angular position of the n-th minimum.\n*   `z_n` is the n-th non-trivial zero of the J₁(x) function.\n\nUsing the small angle approximation (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`), the formula becomes:\n`(2π/λ) * a * θ_n = z_n`\n\nSolving for `θ_n`, we get:\n`θ_n = (z_n / (2π)) * (λ / a)`\n\n**Step 4: Use the Zeros of the Bessel Function**\nTo find the positions of the first two minima, we need the first two non-trivial zeros of J₁(x):\n*   First zero: `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   Second zero: `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Angular Positions of the First Two Minima**\n*   **First Minimum (θ₁):**\n    `θ₁ = (z₁ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (3.8317 / 6.2832) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * (λ / a)`\n    *   **Careful Point:** This value corresponds to option C (0.610 λ/a). This is a common distractor, as it represents the position of the first minimum, not the distance between the first two.\n\n*   **Second Minimum (θ₂):**\n    `θ₂ = (z₂ / (2π)) * (λ / a) ≈ (7.0156 / 6.2832) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ / a)`\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Angular Distance Between the Minima**\nThe question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ / a)`\n`Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\n\n**Step 7: Compare with the Options**\nThe calculated angular distance is `0.5068 * (λ / a)`. Let's compare this to the given options:\nA) 0.500 λ / a\nB) 1.220 λ /a\nC) 0.610 λ / a\nD) 0.506 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value `0.5068` is best approximated by option D, `0.506`.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the careful points needed to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Aperture's Geometry**: The problem starts with an N-sided regular polygon where the apothem (the perpendicular distance from the center to a side) is a constant length 'a'. It asks for the result when N becomes infinitely large.\n    *   **Careful Point**: As the number of sides of a regular polygon with a constant apothem approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. The apothem 'a' becomes the radius of this circle. Therefore, the problem simplifies to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Physics**: The problem describes light passing through an aperture and creating an intensity pattern in the far field. This is a classic example of Fraunhofer diffraction.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The diffraction pattern from a circular aperture is known as an Airy pattern. It consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n\n3.  **Locate the Intensity Minima**: The question asks about the angular distance between the first two intensity minima (the dark rings). The positions of these minima are not arbitrary; they are determined by the mathematical properties of the diffraction pattern.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The angular positions of the minima in an Airy pattern correspond to the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x). The intensity is zero when the argument of the Bessel function, `x = (2πa/λ)sin(θ)`, is equal to one of these non-trivial zeros.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Angular Position of the Minima**: Using the small-angle approximation (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`), the condition for the n-th minimum is `(2πa/λ)θ_n = z_n`, where `z_n` is the n-th non-zero root of J₁(x). This can be rearranged to solve for the angular position `θ_n`:\n    `θ_n = (z_n / 2π) * (λ / a)`\n\n    The first two non-zero roots of J₁(x) are:\n    *   `z₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n    *   `z₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\n    Now, we can calculate the positions of the first two minima:\n    *   **First Minimum (θ₁)**: `θ₁ = (3.8317 / 2π) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 * λ / a`\n    *   **Second Minimum (θ₂)**: `θ₂ = (7.0156 / 2π) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1166 * λ / a`\n\n    *   **Careful Point**: The value for the first minimum, `~0.610 λ/a`, is listed as option C. This is a common distracter. It represents the angular radius of the central Airy disk, not the distance between the first two minima.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Angular Distance**: The question asks for the angular distance *between* the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n    `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ ≈ (1.1166 - 0.6098) * (λ / a)`\n    `Δθ ≈ 0.5068 * (λ / a)`\n\n6.  **Compare with Options and Conclude**: The calculated value is `0.5068 * λ / a`. We compare this to the given options:\n    *   A) 0.506 λ / a\n    *   B) 1.220 λ / a (This is approximately twice the value of θ₁, related to the angular diameter of the Airy disk)\n    *   C) 0.610 λ / a (This is the approximate value of θ₁, the position of the first minimum)\n    *   D) 0.500 λ / a\n\n    The calculated value `0.5068` is best matched by option A, `0.506`.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
