    This function symbolically derives the oscillation frequency for the given
    quantum mechanics problem and checks if the provided answer is correct.

    The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle, initially in the |+z> state,
    subjected to a magnetic field in the +Y direction. We calculate the
    time evolution of the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic
    moment, <μ_z>(t), and find its oscillation frequency.
