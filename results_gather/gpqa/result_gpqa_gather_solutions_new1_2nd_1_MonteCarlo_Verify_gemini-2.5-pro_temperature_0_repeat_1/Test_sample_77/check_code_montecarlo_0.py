Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.

### Step-by-step Analysis

1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The question asks for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\vec{A}$) generated by a moving point charge. This is a fundamental problem in classical electrodynamics. The solution must account for the finite speed of light, `c`, which means the potentials at a given time and place depend on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier, "retarded" time. These potentials are known as the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**.

2.  **Recall the Standard Formulas:** The standard textbook formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:
    *   Scalar Potential: $V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_o} \left[ \dfrac{q}{R(1 - \vec{n} \cdot \vec{\beta})} \right]_{\text{ret}}$
    *   Vector Potential: $\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\mu_o}{4\pi} \left[ \dfrac{q\vec{v}}{R(1 - \vec{n} \cdot \vec{\beta})} \right]_{\text{ret}}$
    where the subscript "ret" means all quantities are evaluated at the retarded time, $\vec{R}$ is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observer, $\vec{n} = \vec{R}/R$ is the unit vector, and $\vec{\beta} = \vec{v}/c$.

3.  **Translate to the Problem's Notation:** We map the standard notation to the one given in the question:
    *   $\vec{R}$ becomes $\vec{d}$.
    *   $R$ becomes $d$.
    *   $\vec{n}$ becomes $\vec{d}/d$.
    *   The crucial denominator term $R(1 - \vec{n} \cdot \vec{\beta})$ becomes:
        $d \left(1 - \frac{\vec{d}}{d} \cdot \frac{\vec{v}}{c}\right) = d - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}$

4.  **Rewrite the Potentials and Match Format:** Substituting this denominator back and rearranging to match the format of the options (by multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`):
    *   $V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_o} \dfrac{q}{d - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}} = \dfrac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_o (dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}$
    *   $\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\mu_o}{4\pi} \dfrac{q\vec{v}}{d - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}} = \dfrac{\mu_o qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}$

5.  **Compare with Options and Identify Careful Points:**

    *   **Careful Point 1: Retarded Distance vs. Static Distance.** The potential must depend on the distance `d` from the charge's position *when the field was emitted* (the retarded position). It does not depend on `r`, the distance from the origin to the observer. This is a fundamental aspect of retardation. Options B and D use the static Coulomb potential form ($V \propto 1/r$) and are therefore incorrect.

    *   **Careful Point 2: The Sign in the Denominator.** The remaining options, A and C, differ only by the sign in the denominator. The term $(dc - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})$ is a relativistic correction that accounts for a Doppler-like effect. The negative sign is physically correct for a retarded potential. If the charge moves towards the observer, $\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}$ is positive, which makes the denominator smaller and the potential stronger. This is the correct physical behavior. The positive sign in option A would correspond to an unphysical "advanced potential" (where the effect precedes the cause) and would incorrectly predict a weaker potential. Therefore, option A is incorrect.

    *   **Careful Point 3: Final Verification.** The expressions derived in step 4 perfectly match the expressions in **Option C**.
        $V(\vec{r},t) = \dfrac{qc}{4\pi\epsilon_o (d c - \vec{d}. \vec{v})},  \vec{A(\vec{r},t)} = \dfrac{\mu_o qc \vec{v}}{4\pi (d c - \vec{d}. \vec{v})}$
        These expressions are also self-consistent, satisfying the known relation for Liénard-Wiechert potentials, $\vec{A} = (\vec{v}/c^2)V$.

### Analysis of Candidate Answers
A review of the 15 candidate answers shows that the vast majority correctly identify the physics of the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. However, many of them seem to have been presented with a shuffled list of options, leading them to correctly derive the formulas but then map them to the wrong letter (e.g., Answer 2 correctly derives the formulas for C but calls it B). The agents whose reasoning is sound and whose mapping is consistent with the provided option list (e.g., Answers 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12) all converge on option C. The physical reasoning is overwhelmingly in favor of the expressions found in C.
