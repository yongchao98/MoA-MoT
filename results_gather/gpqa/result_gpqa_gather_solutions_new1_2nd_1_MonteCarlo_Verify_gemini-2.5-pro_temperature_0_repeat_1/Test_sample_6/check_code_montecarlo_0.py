    Checks the correctness of the answer to the gamma-ray annihilation problem.

    The problem is to find the threshold energy for the reaction:
    gamma + gamma_CMB -> e+ + e-

    The threshold energy E_gamma is given by the formula:
    E_gamma = (m_e * c^2)^2 / E_cmb

    This code calculates this value and compares it to the provided answer.
