Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful points to consider based on the provided answers.

### **Step 1: Analyze the Chemical Transformation**
The reaction sequence described (1. mCPBA, 2. H₃O⁺) is a standard method for the **anti-dihydroxylation** of an alkene. This means two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added across the double bond, one from the top face and one from the bottom face.

### **Step 2: Determine the Product of Reaction 1**
*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene, which is a symmetrical *trans*-alkene.
*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a symmetrical *trans*-alkene results in a **meso** compound. A helpful mnemonic is **T**rans + **A**nti → **M**eso (TAM).
*   **Product 1:** Reaction 1 produces a single, achiral product: **meso-octane-4,5-diol**.

### **Step 3: Determine the Product of Reaction 2**
*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene, which is a symmetrical *cis*-alkene.
*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The anti-addition of two identical groups to a symmetrical *cis*-alkene results in a **racemic mixture** of enantiomers. A helpful mnemonic is **C**is + **A**nti → **R**acemic (CAR).
*   **Product 2:** Reaction 2 produces a 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers: **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** and **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol**.

### **Step 4: Characterize the Combined Product Mixture**
The chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:
1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)
2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)
3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)

The stereochemical relationships between these compounds are crucial:
*   Compounds 2 and 3 are **enantiomers** of each other.
*   Compound 1 (the meso compound) is a **diastereomer** of both compound 2 and compound 3.

### **Step 5: Predict the Chromatographic Observations**

**Standard (achiral) HPLC:**
*   **Principle:** A standard HPLC column has an achiral stationary phase. It separates compounds based on differences in physical properties (e.g., polarity).
*   **Separation:**
    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and **can be separated**.
    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and **cannot be separated**.
*   **Prediction:** The meso-diol will be separated from the enantiomeric pair, giving one peak. The two enantiomers will elute together (co-elute) as a second peak.
*   **Result:** **2 peaks** will be observed.

**Chiral HPLC:**
*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase, which creates a chiral environment that allows it to interact differently with each enantiomer.
*   **Separation:** A chiral column can separate **both diastereomers and enantiomers**.
*   **Prediction:** All three unique stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved into separate peaks.
*   **Result:** **3 peaks** will be observed (one for the meso compound, one for the (4R,5R)-enantiomer, and one for the (4S,5S)-enantiomer).

### **Conclusion and Careful Points**

*   **Summary of Analysis:** The final mixture will produce **2 peaks** in a standard (achiral) HPLC and **3 peaks** in a chiral HPLC.
*   **Matching to Options:** This result corresponds directly to option A.
*   **Careful Point 1 (Stereochemistry):** It is essential to correctly identify the reaction as an *anti*-dihydroxylation and apply the correct stereochemical rules (Trans + Anti → Meso; Cis + Anti → Racemic).
*   **Careful Point 2 (Chromatography Principles):** One must understand the fundamental difference in separation capabilities: standard (achiral) columns separate diastereomers but not enantiomers, while chiral columns separate both diastereomers and enantiomers.
*   **Careful Point 3 (Evaluating Candidate Answers):** As seen in the provided answers, a correct chemical analysis can be followed by an incorrect selection of the final letter. It is critical to carefully match the derived result (2 peaks standard, 3 peaks chiral) to the text of the options.
