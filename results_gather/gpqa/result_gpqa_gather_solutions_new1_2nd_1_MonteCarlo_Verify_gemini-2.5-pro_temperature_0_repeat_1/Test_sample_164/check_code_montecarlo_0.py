Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.

**1. Deconstruct the Chemical Problem**

The core task is to create a polymer with "regular branches" using only ethylene as the reactant. This requires a tandem catalysis process, where two distinct reactions occur in the same system:
*   **Reaction 1: Selective Oligomerization.** This is the "essential additional reaction step." One catalyst must selectively convert a small number of ethylene molecules into a specific short-chain alpha-olefin (e.g., three ethylenes are trimerized into one molecule of 1-hexene). The high selectivity of this step is what ensures the branches are "regular."
*   **Reaction 2: Copolymerization.** A second catalyst polymerizes the remaining ethylene while incorporating the newly formed alpha-olefin as a comonomer. For example, incorporating 1-hexene into the polyethylene chain creates regular butyl branches.

**2. Systematically Evaluate Each Statement**

Let's analyze the four statements based on established principles of industrial polymer chemistry.

*   **A) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.**
    *   **Analysis:** This statement is ambiguous and likely incorrect under a strict interpretation. The term "combined system" implies a single-reactor ("one-pot") process where both oligomerization and polymerization occur simultaneously. While the component technologies are heavily industrialized in the US (e.g., companies like Chevron Phillips and Sasol have large-scale plants that use chromium catalysts to produce 1-hexene from ethylene), this is typically a standalone process. The resulting 1-hexene is then used as a comonomer in a separate polymerization reactor. A true single-reactor tandem system is a major research goal but is not yet a widespread, large-scale industrial reality.
    *   **Verdict:** Incorrect or at least highly ambiguous.

*   **B) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.**
    *   **Analysis:** This statement is a distractor. While some noble metal catalysts (e.g., palladium-based) can produce branched polyethylene from ethylene, they typically do so via a "chain-walking" mechanism. This process creates a variety of branch lengths and structures (hyperbranching), which is fundamentally different from the "regular branches" that result from incorporating a specific comonomer. Therefore, this technology is not suitable for the stated goal.
    *   **Verdict:** Misleading and incorrect for this specific application.

*   **C) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.**
    *   **Analysis:** This statement is factually incorrect. The "essential additional reaction step" is the selective oligomerization of ethylene. The premier industrial catalysts for this reaction (based on chromium) absolutely require an activator, or co-catalyst, to function. These activators are almost universally aluminum-based compounds, such as methylaluminoxane (MAO), modified MAO (MMAO), and various trialkylaluminum reagents. They are essential, not ineffective.
    *   **Verdict:** Incorrect.

*   **D) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.**
    *   **Analysis:** This statement is factually correct, unambiguous, and fundamental to the problem. Group VIa (also known as Group 6) contains Chromium (Cr). Chromium-based catalysts are the state-of-the-art industrial technology for the highly selective oligomerization of ethylene to 1-hexene (trimerization) and 1-octene (tetramerization). This is precisely the function required of the second catalyst to generate the comonomers for regular branches. These catalysts are indeed used "in combination with specific activators," which are the very aluminum-based compounds that statement C incorrectly dismisses.
    *   **Verdict:** Correct.

**Conclusion**

After a careful review, only one statement accurately and unambiguously describes a key aspect of the required technology. Statement C is definitively false, statement B is misleading, and statement A is incorrect under a strict interpretation of industrial practice. Statement D is a direct and correct chemical fact about the primary catalyst used for the key reaction.
