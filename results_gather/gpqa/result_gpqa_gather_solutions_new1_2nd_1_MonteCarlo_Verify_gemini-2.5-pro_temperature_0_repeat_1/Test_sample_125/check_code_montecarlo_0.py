Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.

### **Step 1: Analyze the Products of Reaction I**

*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with a single, pre-existing stereocenter at the C5 position, which has an (S) configuration.
*   **Reaction:** The ketone group at the C3 position is reduced to a secondary alcohol using Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), an achiral reducing agent. This reduction creates a new stereocenter at the C3 position.
*   **Products:** The original stereocenter at C5 is not involved in the reaction and its (S) configuration is retained. The reduction of the planar carbonyl group at C3 can occur from two different faces, leading to both (R) and (S) configurations at the new C3 stereocenter. This results in two products:
    1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol
    2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol
*   **Relationship:** These two products are **diastereomers** because they have two stereocenters, one of which is the same (5S) and one of which is different (3R vs. 3S).
*   **Conclusion for Reaction I:** Two distinct diastereomeric products are formed.

### **Step 2: Analyze the Products of Reaction II**

*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetric and **achiral** molecule.
*   **Reaction:** Both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols using excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBHâ‚„), an achiral reducing agent. This creates two new stereocenters at the C2 and C4 positions.
*   **Products:** Since the starting material and reagent are achiral, all possible stereoisomers are formed. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.
    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: These two are non-superimposable mirror images, forming a pair of **enantiomers**. They are produced in a 1:1 racemic mixture.
    2.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**: This molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it an achiral **meso compound**.
*   **Relationship:** The meso compound is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair.
*   **Conclusion for Reaction II:** Three distinct stereoisomers are formed (a pair of enantiomers and a meso compound).

### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC**

*   **Principle:** A normal-phase HPLC column is achiral. It separates compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity. It can separate constitutional isomers and diastereomers, but it **cannot** separate enantiomers.
*   **Peak Count:**
    *   **From Reaction I:** The two products are diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties and will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.
    *   **From Reaction II:** The products are an enantiomeric pair and a meso compound. The enantiomeric pair has identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will elute together as **1 peak**. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the pair, has different physical properties, and will elute as a separate, **second peak**. This gives a total of **2 peaks** for the products of Reaction II.
    *   **Overall:** The products from Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) are structurally different from those of Reaction II (C5 diols) and will not co-elute. Therefore, the total number of peaks is 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.

### **Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC**

*   **Principle:** A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase that can interact differently with all stereoisomers, allowing for the separation of **both diastereomers and enantiomers**.
*   **Peak Count:**
    *   The number of peaks will be equal to the total number of unique stereoisomers in the mixture.
    *   Total unique stereoisomers = 2 (from Reaction I) + 3 (from Reaction II) = **5 stereoisomers**.
    *   A chiral column is capable of resolving all five of these distinct stereoisomers.
    *   **Total Peaks:** **5 peaks**.

### **Final Conclusion**

The analysis shows that the chemist will observe **5 peaks in the chiral HPLC** and **4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC**. This result corresponds to option B.
