To determine the final answer, a step-by-step analysis of each compound for chirality is required. A compound exhibits optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This analysis will focus on identifying key structural features that lead to chirality (like chiral centers or axial chirality) or achirality (like planes of symmetry or centers of inversion).

**Step-by-step Analysis of Each Compound:**

1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**
    *   **Structure**: This is a biphenyl system where two phenyl rings are connected by a single C-C bond.
    *   **Careful Point (Atropisomerism)**: The key feature is the presence of large, bulky substituents (-NO₂ and -COOCH₃) at all four *ortho*-positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'). These groups sterically hinder each other, preventing the two rings from rotating freely around the central bond.
    *   **Analysis**: This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, locks the molecule into a stable, twisted (non-planar) conformation. This conformation lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion.
    *   **Conclusion**: The molecule is chiral due to axial chirality and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.

2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**
    *   **Structure**: Also known as methyl lactate, its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.
    *   **Careful Point (Chiral Center)**: The analysis must check for a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.
    *   **Analysis**: The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups:
        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)
        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)
        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)
        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)
    *   **Conclusion**: Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.

3.  **benzophenone**
    *   **Structure**: Its structure is (C₆H₅)₂C=O.
    *   **Careful Point (Symmetry)**: The molecule's symmetry must be evaluated.
    *   **Analysis**: The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the central carbonyl group (C=O) and bisects the angle between the two identical phenyl rings.
    *   **Conclusion**: The presence of a plane of symmetry makes the molecule achiral, so it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4.  **dimethyl fumarate**
    *   **Structure**: This is the *trans*-isomer of an alkene, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.
    *   **Careful Point (Symmetry)**: The geometry and symmetry of this planar molecule are critical.
    *   **Analysis**: The molecule is planar. It possesses both a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion at the midpoint of the C=C double bond.
    *   **Conclusion**: The presence of these symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral, so it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

**Final Decision:**

The analysis shows that only compounds **1** and **2** are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism. Reviewing the options:
A) 2 and 3
B) 1 and 2
C) 1, 2 and 4
D) 3 and 4

The correct option is B, as it correctly identifies that only compounds 1 and 2 are optically active. The reasoning across all provided candidate answers is unanimously consistent with this chemical analysis, even though many of them selected the wrong final letter.
