    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer based on physics principles.

    The core principle is electrostatic shielding: the electric field outside a
    conductor with a cavity is independent of the arrangement of charges
    inside the cavity. Therefore, the formula for the external field E cannot
    depend on variables describing the internal geometry (s, l, theta). It should
    only depend on the total charge (q) and the distance from the conductor's
    center (L).
