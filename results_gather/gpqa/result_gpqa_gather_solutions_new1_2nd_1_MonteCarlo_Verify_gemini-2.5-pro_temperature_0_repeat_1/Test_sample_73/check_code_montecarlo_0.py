def check_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to the radioactive decay problem.

    The problem is solved as follows:
    1.  The memoryless property of exponential decay means the 50 minutes that have passed are irrelevant.
    2.  We are given the decay probability in 100 minutes, P(100) = 0.32.
    3.  The survival probability for 100 minutes is S(100) = 1 - P(100) = 0.68.
    4.  The survival probability follows S(t) = exp(-lambda * t). So, S(100) = exp(-lambda * 100) = 0.68.
    5.  We need to find the decay probability in 150 minutes, P(150) = 1 - S(150).
    6.  S(150) = exp(-lambda * 150) = exp(-lambda * 100 * 1.5) = (exp(-lambda * 100))^1.5 = S(100)^1.5.
    7.  S(150) = 0.68^1.5.
    8.  P(150) = 1 - 0.68^1.5.
    9.  The result is compared to the given options to find the closest match.
