    # A) 4.73; 7.00

    # D) 3.17; 6.73

    # --- Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution ---
    # Convert volumes to Liters
    V_acid_initial_L = V_acid_initial_cm3 / 1000.0
    V_water_L = V_water_cm3 / 1000.0
    
    # Calculate initial moles of acid
    moles_acid = M_acid_initial * V_acid_initial_L
    
    # Calculate final volume and concentration after dilution
    V_acid_diluted_L = V_acid_initial_L + V_water_L
    M_acid_diluted = moles_acid / V_acid_diluted_L

    # --- Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration ---
    # This is a buffer region, so we use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
    # pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])
    
    # Calculate pKa
    pKa = -math.log10(Ka)

    # Calculate pH
    calculated_pH_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(ratio_base_acid)

    # --- Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point ---
    # At the equivalence point, all acid has been converted to its conjugate base.
    
    # Volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence: M_acid * V_acid = M_base * V_base
    # We use the diluted acid values: moles_acid = M_base * V_base_added
    V_base_added_L = moles_acid / M_base
    
    # Total volume at the equivalence point
    V_total_equiv_L = V_acid_diluted_L + V_base_added_L
    
    # Concentration of the conjugate base (acetate, A-) at equivalence
    M_A_minus = moles_acid / V_total_equiv_L
    
    # The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the weak base A-:
    # A- + H2O <=> HA + OH-
    
    # Calculate Kb for the conjugate base
    Kb = Kw / Ka
    
    # Use the equilibrium expression: Kb = [HA][OH-]/[A-] ≈ [OH-]^2 / [A-]
    # Solve for [OH-]: [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [A-])
    conc_OH = math.sqrt(Kb * M_A_minus)
    
    # Calculate pOH and then pH
    pOH = -math.log10(conc_OH)
    calculated_pH_equiv = 14.0 - pOH

    # --- Step 4: Check the correctness of the answer ---
    # Compare the calculated values with the expected values from option C.
    # We use a tolerance to account for potential rounding differences.
