It can observe stars with declinations (DEC) up to about +65.4° in the northern sky.\n*   The W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES) is in the Northern Hemisphere at a latitude of approximately +19.8°.

This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem & Establish Criteria**\n\nTo be detected by *both* the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, a star must meet two independent conditions:\n\n*   **Brightness Condition:** The star must be bright enough for the less sensitive of the two instruments.\n    *   ESPRESSO limit: Apparent V magnitude (V) < 17.0\n    *   HIRES limit: Apparent V magnitude (V) < 16.0\n    *   Therefore, the combined requirement is **V < 16.0**.\n\n*   **Location (Visibility) Condition:** The star must be physically visible in the sky from both observatory locations. The prompt asks to \"disregard the pointing limits,\" which is best interpreted as ignoring mechanical limitations (like not being able to point to the zenith) or atmospheric effects near the horizon. However, it does not mean we can ignore the fundamental fact that a star must rise above the horizon to be seen.\n    *   Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO) is at latitude ~24.6° S. It can see stars with declinations (DEC) north of its southern celestial pole and south of its northern horizon, meaning **DEC < +65.4°**.\n    *   Keck Observatory (HIRES) is at latitude ~19.8° N. It can see stars with declinations south of its northern celestial pole and north of its southern horizon, meaning **DEC > -70.2°**.\n    *   Therefore, the combined requirement is **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n### **2. Evaluate Each Star Against the Criteria**\n\nWe will use the distance modulus formula to find the apparent magnitude (V) when it's not given directly: `V = M_V + 5*log10(d/10) + A_V`, where `M_V` is the absolute magnitude, `d` is the distance in parsecs, and `A_V` is the absorption from dust (`A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`).\n\n---\n\n**Star 1**\n*   **Location:** DEC = -75°. This is **outside** the required range (-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°). It is too far south to be visible from Keck.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star 2**\n*   **Brightness:** Apparent V magnitude is given as 16.5. This is **not brighter** than the required V < 16.0.\n*   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star 3**\n*   **Location:** DEC = +48°. This is **within** the required range. (Pass)\n*   **Brightness:** Apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5. This is **brighter** than the required V < 16.0. (Pass)\n*   **Conclusion:** **Observable by both.**\n\n---\n\n**Star 4**\n*   **Location:** DEC = -48°. This is **within** the required range. (Pass)\n*   **Brightness:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n    *   Absorption `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24` mag.\n    *   Apparent Magnitude `V = 15.5 + 5*log10(10/10) + 1.24 = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74`.\n    *   This is **not brighter** than the required V < 16.0. (Fail)\n*   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star 5**\n*   **Location:** DEC = +60°. This is **within** the required range. (Pass)\n*   **Brightness:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n    *   Apparent Magnitude `V = 16.5 + 5*log10(5/10) = 16.5 + 5*(-0.301) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995`.\n    *   This is **brighter** than the required V < 16.0. (Pass)\n*   **Conclusion:** **Observable by both.**\n\n### **3. Final Decision**\n\nThe analysis shows that only **Star 3** and **Star 5** satisfy both the location and brightness criteria for joint observation. This corresponds to option A.

Define the Constraints**\n\n**A. Brightness Constraint:**\nA star must be bright enough to be detected by both spectrographs. The instruments have the following limits for apparent V magnitude (m_V):\n*   ESPRESSO: m_V < 17.0\n*   HIRES: m_V < 16.0\n\nTo be detected by **both**, a star must satisfy the stricter limit.\n*   **Combined Requirement: m_V < 16.0**\n\n**B.

It can observe stars with declinations (DEC) up to about +65.4° in the northern sky.\n*   The W. M. Keck Observatory (HIRES) is in the Northern Hemisphere at a latitude of approximately +19.8°. It can observe stars with declinations down to about -70.2° in the southern sky.\n*   Therefore, for a star to be visible from **both** observatories, its declination must be in the overlapping range: **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n**Brightness (Apparent V Magnitude):**\n*   ESPRESSO can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude (V) brighter than 17.0 (V < 17.0).\n*   HIRES can observe stars with V brighter than 16.0 (V < 16.0).\n*   To be detected by **both**, a star must meet the stricter limit: **V < 16.0**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each Star\n\nWe will use the distance modulus formula to calculate apparent magnitude (V) when it's not given directly: `V = M_V + 5*log10(d/10) + A_V`, where `M_V` is the absolute magnitude, `d` is the distance in parsecs, and `A_V` is the extinction (`A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`).\n\n*   **Star 1:**\n    *   **Location:** DEC = -75°. This is outside the required range, as it is too far south to be visible from Keck (-75° is not > -70.2°).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Fails the location criterion. Not observable by both.\n\n*   **Star 2:**\n    *   **Location:** DEC = +55°. This is within the required range. (Pass)\n    *   **Brightness:** V = 16.5 mag.

(Pass)\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Observable by both.**\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only stars that satisfy both the location and brightness criteria for both observatories are **Star 3** and **Star 5**. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n### **1. Deconstruct the Problem & Establish Criteria**\n\nTo be detected by *both* the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, a star must meet two independent conditions:\n\n*   **Brightness Condition:** The star must be bright enough for the less sensitive of the two instruments.\n    *   ESPRESSO limit: Apparent V magnitude (V) < 17.0\n    *   HIRES limit: Apparent V magnitude (V) < 16.0\n    *   Therefore, the combined requirement is **V < 16.0**.\n\n*   **Location (Visibility) Condition:** The star must be physically visible in the sky from both observatory locations. The prompt asks to \"disregard the pointing limits,\" which is best interpreted as ignoring mechanical limitations (like not being able to point to the zenith) or atmospheric effects near the horizon. However, it does not mean we can ignore the fundamental fact that a star must rise above the horizon to be seen.\n    *   Paranal Observatory (ESPRESSO) is at latitude ~24.6° S. It can see stars with declinations (DEC) north of its southern celestial pole and south of its northern horizon, meaning **DEC < +65.4°**.\n    *   Keck Observatory (HIRES) is at latitude ~19.8° N. It can see stars with declinations south of its northern celestial pole and north of its southern horizon, meaning **DEC > -70.2°**.\n    *   Therefore, the combined requirement is **-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°**.\n\n### **2. Evaluate Each Star Against the Criteria**\n\nWe will use the distance modulus formula to find the apparent magnitude (V) when it's not given directly: `V = M_V + 5*log10(d/10) + A_V`, where `M_V` is the absolute magnitude, `d` is the distance in parsecs, and `A_V` is the absorption from dust (`A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V)`).\n\n---\n\n**Star 1**\n*   **Location:** DEC = -75°. This is **outside** the required range (-70.2° < DEC < +65.4°).

(Pass)\n*   **Brightness:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n    *   Absorption `A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24` mag.\n    *   Apparent Magnitude `V = 15.5 + 5*log10(10/10) + 1.24 = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74`.\n    *   This is **not brighter** than the required V < 16.0. (Fail)\n*   **Conclusion:** Not observable by both.\n\n---\n\n**Star 5**\n*   **Location:** DEC = +60°. This is **within** the required range. (Pass)\n*   **Brightness:** We must calculate the apparent magnitude.\n    *   Apparent Magnitude `V = 16.5 + 5*log10(5/10) = 16.5 + 5*(-0.301) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995`.\n    *   This is **brighter** than the required V < 16.0.
