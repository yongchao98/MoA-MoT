Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.

### Step 1: Deconstruct the Core Concept
The question asks for the set of assumptions that jointly define the "impulse approximation." The fundamental idea of this approximation is to simplify a complex interaction between a probe and a many-nucleon nucleus. It does this by treating the interaction as a sum of much simpler events: a rapid collision with a single nucleon that, for the brief moment of the interaction, behaves as if it were a free particle, isolated from the rest of the nucleus.

### Step 2: Analyze Each Assumption
We must evaluate each of the four statements to see if it is a necessary component of this "free nucleon" picture.

*   **Assumption 1: The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.**
    *   **Analysis:** This is the foundational principle. It allows the complex many-body problem to be broken down into a sum of one-body problems. It explicitly ignores more complicated effects where the probe might interact with a pair of nucleons or with the virtual particles (mesons) being exchanged between them. Without this, one cannot even begin to treat the interaction as a collision with a single "selected" nucleon.
    *   **Verdict:** This assumption is **essential**.

*   **Assumption 2: The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.**
    *   **Analysis:** This assumption deals with the environment of the collision. For a nucleon to behave as if it were truly "free," it must be isolated from the influence of the other nucleons. This assumption means that neither the incoming probe nor the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the struck nucleon) interact with the other "spectator" nucleons. This is known as neglecting initial-state and final-state interactions (FSI).
    *   **Verdict:** This assumption is **essential** for the simple "free nucleon" picture to hold.

*   **Assumption 3: The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.**
    *   **Analysis:** This statement concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself, which is a different physical scale. The impulse approximation treats nucleons as the fundamental particles for the purpose of the calculation. The internal physics of the nucleon (its quark-gluon structure) is a separate problem. This assumption is not only unnecessary for the impulse approximation, but it is also physically incorrect, as quarks within a nucleon are highly relativistic.
    *   **Verdict:** This is **not** a part of the impulse approximation.

*   **Assumption 4: The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.**
    *   **Analysis:** This is the very essence of the "impulse" in the approximation's name. It is a "sudden approximation" that assumes the interaction happens so quickly that the binding forces holding the nucleon in the nucleus are negligible *during* the brief moment of the collision. The energy transferred is assumed to be much larger than the nucleon's binding energy.
    *   **Verdict:** This assumption is **essential**.

### Step 3: Synthesize the Findings and Identify Careful Points
1.  **Core Logic:** The analysis consistently shows that assumptions 1, 2, and 4 are the three pillars that jointly create the simplified "impulse approximation" picture. Assumption 3 is an irrelevant statement about a different level of physics. The correct set of assumptions is therefore **{1, 2, 4}**.

2.  **Candidate Answer Analysis:** A review of the 15 candidate answers reveals a critical pattern. The overwhelming majority of the answers provide a detailed analysis that correctly identifies {1, 2, 4} as the necessary set of assumptions. They correctly dismiss assumption 3.

3.  **Source of Error:** The widespread disagreement in the final lettered answers (A, B, C, and D) among the candidates stems from a simple clerical error. Most candidates failed to correctly map their sound physical reasoning (the set {1, 2, 4}) to the correct multiple-choice option provided in the prompt.

### Step 4: Select the Final Answer
Based on the robust physical reasoning, the correct set of assumptions is {1, 2, 4}. We now match this set to the given options:
A) 1, 2, 3
B) 1, 2, 4
C) 2, 3, 4
D) 1, 3, 4

The set {1, 2, 4} corresponds directly to option B.
