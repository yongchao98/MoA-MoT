    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating careful points derived from the provided candidate answers.

    ### Step-by-step Analysis

    1.  **Express the Density Matrix in Matrix Form:**
        The given density matrix is $\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|+\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 1\\right|\\right)$. This represents a state that is an equal statistical mixture of the basis states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$.
        In the standard computational basis, where $|0\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $|1\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, the projectors are:
        *   $|0\\rangle\\langle 0| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$
        *   $|1\\rangle\\langle 1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$
        The sum of these projectors is the 2x2 identity matrix, $I$:
        $|0\\rangle\\langle 0| + |1\\rangle\\langle 1| = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = I$
        Therefore, the density matrix simplifies to $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$. This is the definition of the **maximally mixed state**.

    2.  **Relate the Density Matrix to the Bloch Vector:**
        The geometrical position of any single-qubit state is represented by a point in the Bloch sphere, which is defined by the Bloch vector $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$. The general formula connecting the density matrix $\\rho$ and the Bloch vector $\\vec{r}$ is:
        $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$
        where $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.

    3.  **Solve for the Bloch Vector $\\vec{r}$:**
        We equate the specific form of our density matrix with the general formula:
        $\\frac{1}{2}I = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})$
        Multiplying both sides by 2 gives:
        $I = I + \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$
        Subtracting $I$ from both sides leaves:
        $0 = \\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$
        Since the Pauli matrices are linearly independent, the only way this linear combination can equal the zero matrix is if all the scalar coefficients are zero. Thus, we must have:
        $r_x = 0$, $r_y = 0$, and $r_z = 0$.
        The resulting Bloch vector is $\\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)$.

    4.  **Match the Result to the Options:**
        The calculated geometrical position is the vector `r=(0,0,0)`. According to the options provided in the question:
        *   A) r=(0,0,0)
        *   B) r=(0,0,1)
        *   C) r=(1,1,0)
        *   D) r=(1,1,1)
        The calculated vector matches option A.

    ### Careful Points

    *   **Physicality of States:** A key constraint is that the length of a valid Bloch vector must be less than or equal to 1 (i.e., $|\\vec{r}| \\le 1$). We can use this to quickly eliminate options:
        *   Option C: $|\\vec{r}| = \\sqrt{1^2+1^2+0^2} = \\sqrt{2} > 1$. This is an unphysical state.
        *   Option D: $|\\vec{r}| = \\sqrt{1^2+1^2+1^2} = \\sqrt{3} > 1$. This is also an unphysical state.
        This immediately narrows the possibilities down to A and B.

    *   **Interpretation of Bloch Sphere Positions:**
        *   The surface of the sphere ($|\\vec{r}|=1$) represents pure states. Option B, `r=(0,0,1)`, represents the pure state $|0\\rangle$.
        *   The interior of the sphere ($|\\vec{r}|<1$) represents mixed states.
        *   The exact center of the sphere ($|\\vec{r}|=0$) represents the maximally mixed state. Since our density matrix is $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}I$, it is by definition the maximally mixed state, and its position must be the origin, `r=(0,0,0)`.

    *   **Consistency of Candidate Answers:** All 15 candidate answers correctly derive that the Bloch vector is `r=(0,0,0)`. The disagreement in their final lettered choices (A, B, C, or D) is because the options were likely presented to them in a different, randomized order. The mathematical reasoning is sound and unanimous; the discrepancy is purely clerical. Based on the options listed in the prompt, `r=(0,0,0)` corresponds to A.
