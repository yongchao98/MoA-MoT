Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.

### Part 1: Determination of the Final Product Structure (Product 4)

1.  **Step 1: Acetic acid → Product 1.** The reaction of acetic acid with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride is an α-bromination, a variant of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. This places a bromine atom on the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group.
    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).

2.  **Step 2: Product 1 → Product 2.** The reaction of bromoacetic acid with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and an acid catalyst (H₂SO₄) is a Fischer esterification, converting the carboxylic acid to its ethyl ester.
    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).

3.  **Step 3: Product 2 → Product 3.** The reaction of ethyl bromoacetate with sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2), where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) displaces the bromide ion.
    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).

4.  **Step 4: Product 3 → Product 4.** This is the most critical step. Ethyl cyanoacetate has acidic protons on the central methylene (–CH₂–) group.
    *   The strong base, sodium hydride (NaH), deprotonates this carbon to form a carbanion.
    *   This carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane molecule.
    *   The problem specifies **excess NaH**, which ensures that the remaining acidic proton on the α-carbon is also removed. The resulting carbanion then performs an *intramolecular* Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the carbon chain.
    *   This cyclization is highly favorable as it forms a stable six-membered ring (a Thorpe-Ziegler cyclization). The ring is composed of the original α-carbon plus the five carbons from the pentane chain.
    *   **Final Product (4):** **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.

### Part 2: ¹H NMR Analysis of Product 4

The question asks for the number of *chemically distinct* hydrogen signals. This requires a rigorous analysis of the molecule's symmetry.

**Careful Point 1: Chirality and Symmetry**
The carbon at position 1 (C1) of the cyclohexane ring is attached to four different groups:
1.  A cyano group (–CN)
2.  An ethoxycarbonyl group (–COOCH₂CH₃)
3.  The C1–C2–C3... path of the ring
4.  The C1–C6–C5... path of the ring

Because the two substituents on C1 are different, the two paths around the ring are non-equivalent. Therefore, C1 is a **stereocenter**, and the entire molecule is **chiral**. A chiral molecule, by definition, lacks a plane of symmetry. The common argument that rapid chair-flipping creates a time-averaged plane of symmetry is only valid for achiral molecules. For this chiral molecule, the two chair conformers are diastereomers, and their time-averaged state is still chiral and asymmetric.

**Careful Point 2: Counting Signals in an Asymmetric Molecule**
In a molecule with no symmetry, protons are only chemically equivalent if they can be interchanged by rapid bond rotation (e.g., the three protons of a methyl group).

1.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**
    *   The ring has five methylene (–CH₂–) groups at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6.
    *   Because the molecule is asymmetric, none of these five CH₂ groups are equivalent to each other (e.g., C2 is not equivalent to C6).
    *   Furthermore, within each of these five distinct CH₂ groups, the two geminal protons are **diastereotopic**. This is because they are in a chiral environment. Replacing one versus the other with a test group would create a pair of diastereomers. Diastereotopic protons are chemically distinct and give separate NMR signals.
    *   Therefore, the number of distinct signals from the ring protons is: 5 (non-equivalent CH₂ groups) × 2 (diastereotopic H's per group) = **10 signals**.

2.  **Ethoxycarbonyl Group (–OCH₂CH₃) Protons:**
    *   The three protons of the terminal methyl (–CH₃) group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.
    *   The two protons of the methylene (–OCH₂–) group are adjacent to the stereocenter at C1. This makes them diastereotopic and, rigorously, chemically distinct. However, it is a very common simplification in spectroscopy problems to treat the protons of a flexible ethyl group as a single signal, as their chemical shift difference is often small.
    *   Applying this common simplification, the –OCH₂– group gives **1 signal**.

**Careful Point 3: Final Calculation and Reconciling with Options**
*   Total signals = (Signals from ring) + (Signals from ethyl group)
*   Total signals = 10 + (1 + 1) = **12 signals**.

This number corresponds to option A.

**Why other answers are less likely:**
*   **8 signals:** This answer arises from the incorrect assumption that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, which is fundamentally untrue for this chiral structure.
*   **10 signals:** This answer is typically derived from an incorrect product structure (the linear dimer) or by miscounting the signals of the correct product.
*   **5 signals:** This answer requires making two major errors: assuming a plane of symmetry and ignoring the diastereotopicity of geminal ring protons.

The most chemically rigorous analysis that matches one of the provided options leads to 12 distinct signals.
