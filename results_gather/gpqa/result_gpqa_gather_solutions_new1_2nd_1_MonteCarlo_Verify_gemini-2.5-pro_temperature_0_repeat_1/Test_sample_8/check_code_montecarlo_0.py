Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided candidate answers and chemical principles.

**1. Define the C3h Point Group**
The goal is to find the molecule belonging to the C3h point group. A molecule has C3h symmetry if it possesses the following symmetry elements:
*   A principal three-fold axis of rotation (C3).
*   A horizontal mirror plane (σh) that is perpendicular to the C3 axis.
*   Crucially, it must *not* possess other symmetry elements that would place it in a higher-symmetry point group. Specifically, it must lack:
    *   C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis (which would elevate the symmetry to D3h).
    *   Vertical mirror planes (σv) in the absence of a σh (which would likely make it C3v).

**2. Analyze Each Molecule by Name**
To avoid confusion caused by inconsistent lettering in the candidate answers, each molecule will be analyzed by its chemical name first.

*   **Quinuclidine:**
    *   **Structure:** A rigid, cage-like bicyclic amine.
    *   **Symmetry Analysis:** There is a unanimous consensus among the candidate answers that this molecule has a C3 axis passing through the nitrogen and the opposite bridgehead carbon. However, it lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh) and instead possesses three vertical mirror planes (σv).
    *   **Conclusion:** The point group is **C3v**. This molecule is incorrect.

*   **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (Mellitic Trianhydride):**
    *   **Structure:** A rigid, planar molecule with a central benzene ring.
    *   **Symmetry Analysis:** As a planar molecule, it has a horizontal mirror plane (σh) and a C3 axis perpendicular to it. However, the vast majority of detailed analyses correctly note that it also possesses three C2 axes lying within the molecular plane, perpendicular to the C3 axis.
    *   **Conclusion:** The point group is **D3h**, which has higher symmetry than C3h. This molecule is incorrect.

*   **Triisopropyl borate:**
    *   **Structure:** A flexible molecule, B(O-i-Pr)₃, with free rotation around its single bonds.
    *   **Symmetry Analysis:** The candidate answers are divided. While it is theoretically possible for the molecule to adopt a C3h conformation (with a planar B(O)₃ core), the consensus among the more careful analyses is that steric hindrance from the bulky isopropyl groups would cause it to adopt a lower-energy, non-planar "propeller" conformation with C3 symmetry.
    *   **Conclusion:** This is an ambiguous and weak candidate. In molecular symmetry problems, a rigid molecule with inherent symmetry is a much better answer than a flexible one that must adopt a specific, potentially unstable, conformation.

*   **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone:**
    *   **Structure:** A large, rigid, and planar molecule.
    *   **Symmetry Analysis:** A strong consensus of the most detailed candidate answers identifies this as the correct molecule.
        *   It has a **C3 axis** perpendicular to the molecular plane.
        *   The molecular plane itself acts as a **σh plane**.
        *   The crucial feature is the specific "propeller-like" fusion of the anhydride rings onto the triphenylene core. This rotational arrangement breaks the symmetry of the parent triphenylene (D3h) by **eliminating the three C2 axes** that would be perpendicular to the C3 axis.
    *   **Conclusion:** The molecule possesses a C3 axis and a σh plane but lacks the perpendicular C2 axes. Its point group is precisely **C3h**. It is the best and most unambiguous answer.

**3. Final Decision**
Based on the analysis, the triphenyleno[...] derivative is the only molecule that is a rigid, clear-cut example of the C3h point group. Mapping this correct molecule back to the original question's lettering:

A) quinuclidine
B) **triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**
C) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
D) triisopropyl borate

The correct answer is B.
