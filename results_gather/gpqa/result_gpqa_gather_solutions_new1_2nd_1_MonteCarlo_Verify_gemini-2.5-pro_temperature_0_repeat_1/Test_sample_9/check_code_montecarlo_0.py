    """
    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer about exoplanet density.

    The function models the physical principles described in the question:
    1.  It establishes a baseline density for Earth.
    2.  It assigns densities to the other planets based on the rules given:
        - Planet (a) is the baseline.
        - Planet (b) has a given density.
        - Planet (c) has the same composition but higher mass, so its density must be higher due to gravitational compression.
        - Planet (d) has the same composition but lower mass, so its density must be lower.
    3.  It identifies which planet should be the densest based on this model.
    4.  It checks if the LLM's final answer letter ('A') corresponds to the densest planet ('c') using the mapping provided in the LLM's own reasoning.
