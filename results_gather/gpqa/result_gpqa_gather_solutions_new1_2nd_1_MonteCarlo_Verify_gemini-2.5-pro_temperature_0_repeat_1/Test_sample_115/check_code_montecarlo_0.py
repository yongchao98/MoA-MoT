def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the final answer for the given organic chemistry problem.

    The function validates the answer based on two key constraints of the Diels-Alder reaction:
    1.  Product Skeleton: The reaction between penta-1,3-dien-1-ol and but-2-ene
        must produce a 4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol.
    2.  Product Stereochemistry: The use of a cis-dienophile (cis-but-2-ene) requires
        that the substituents it provides (at C5 and C6) must be cis in the product.
        This corresponds to opposite R/S descriptors (e.g., 5S,6R).
