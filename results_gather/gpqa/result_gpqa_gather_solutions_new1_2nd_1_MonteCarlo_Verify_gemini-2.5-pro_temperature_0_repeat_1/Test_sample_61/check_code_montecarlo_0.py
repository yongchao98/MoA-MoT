def check_synthesis_answer():
    """
    Analyzes the chemical synthesis pathways to verify the provided answer.

    This function encapsulates the chemical logic required to solve the problem:
    1. It identifies the intended product and the necessary intermediate (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde).
    2. It outlines the correct synthetic strategy: alkylation -> partial reduction -> reductive ozonolysis -> aldol addition.
    3. It evaluates each multiple-choice option against this strategy, identifying specific chemical flaws.
    4. It compares the logically correct option with the provided answer.

    Returns:
        str: "Correct" if the answer is right, or a detailed explanation if it is wrong.
