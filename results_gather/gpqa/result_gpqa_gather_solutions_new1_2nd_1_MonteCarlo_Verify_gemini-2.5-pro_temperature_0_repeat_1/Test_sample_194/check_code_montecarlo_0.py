    # Planet 1
    P1 = 3.0  # Orbital period in days

    # --- Step 1: Determine the Limiting Condition for Planet 2 ---
    # A transit occurs if the planet's path crosses the star's disk.
    # The maximum orbital period corresponds to the maximum orbital radius (semi-major axis 'a')
    # that still allows a transit.
    # The standard simplified model for this limit is a "grazing" transit, where the
    # planet's center passes over the star's limb. This corresponds to a maximum
    # impact parameter for Planet 2 of b2_max = 1.0.
    b2_max = 1.0

    # --- Step 2: Relate the Two Orbits ---
    # The impact parameter 'b' is given by b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s.
    # Since both planets share the same orbital plane, their inclination 'i' is identical.
    # They orbit the same star, so the star's radius 'R_s' is also the same.
    # Therefore, the ratio of their semi-major axes is equal to the ratio of their impact parameters:
    # a2 / a1 = b2 / b1
    a_ratio = b2_max / b1

    # --- Step 3: Apply Kepler's Third Law ---
    # Kepler's Third Law for two planets around the same star is (P2/P1)^2 = (a2/a1)^3.
    # We can solve for P2: P2 = P1 * (a2/a1)^(3/2).
    P2_max_calculated = P1 * (a_ratio ** 1.5)
