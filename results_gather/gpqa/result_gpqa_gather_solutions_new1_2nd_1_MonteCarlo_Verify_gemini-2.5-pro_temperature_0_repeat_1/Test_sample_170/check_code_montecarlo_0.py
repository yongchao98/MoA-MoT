    Based on a systematic analysis of the chemical principles and a review of the candidate answers, a definitive conclusion can be reached. The majority of the candidate answers apply the correct chemical logic, even if some make a final error in matching their derived sequence to the provided options.

    Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

    Step 1: Classify Substituents by Directing Effect
    The most critical factor determining the yield of the para-isomer is the directing effect of the substituent on the benzene ring. We can separate the six compounds into two distinct groups.

    *   Group 1: Meta-Directing Groups (Low Para-Isomer Yield)
        These groups are electron-withdrawing (deactivating) and direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) primarily to the meta position. Consequently, they produce a very low yield of the para-isomer.
        *   4) C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene)
        *   6) C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid)
        *   2) C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate)

    *   Group 2: Ortho, Para-Directing Groups (High Para-Isomer Yield)
        These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions, resulting in a significant yield of the para-isomer.
        *   1) C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene)
        *   5) C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene)
        *   3) C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene)

    Careful Point 1: Any correct final sequence must place all substances from Group 1 before all substances from Group 2. The order must have the structure `{4, 6, 2 in some order} < {1, 5, 3 in some order}`. This immediately eliminates option D (3<5<1<6<2<4), which incorrectly reverses this fundamental order.

    Step 2: Order the Meta-Directing Substances (Group 1)
    For these compounds, the yield of the minor para-product is inversely related to the deactivating strength of the substituent. A stronger deactivating group is a more powerful meta-director, resulting in an even lower yield of the para-isomer.

    *   The established order of deactivating strength is: -NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅.
    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is the reverse of this strength: Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2).

    Careful Point 2: The correct sequence must begin with `4 < 6 < 2`. This finding allows us to evaluate the remaining options:
    *   A) 4<2<6<3<1<5 - Incorrect order.
    *   B) 4<6<2<1<5<3 - Correct.
    *   C) 6<2<4<5<1<3 - Incorrect order.

    Based on this step alone, option B is the only possible correct answer.

    Step 3: Order the Ortho, Para-Directing Substances (Group 2) for Confirmation
    To verify the conclusion, we will order the substances in Group 2. For these, the para-isomer yield depends on the para-to-ortho product ratio, which is influenced by steric and electronic effects.

    *   Comparing Alkyl Groups (1 vs. 5): The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is sterically bulkier than the methyl group (-CH₃). This increased size hinders the approach of bromine to the adjacent ortho positions, making the remote para position more accessible. Thus, ethylbenzene (5) gives a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene (1). The order is 1 < 5.
    *   Comparing with the Halogen (3): The chloro group (-Cl) is a special case. While deactivating overall, it is highly para-directing. Its strong inductive effect deactivates the nearby ortho positions more strongly than the distant para position. This electronic effect, combined with the atom's size, leads to a very high yield of the para-isomer, which is experimentally shown to be higher than that for both toluene and ethylbenzene.
    *   Therefore, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).

    Step 4: Final Assembly
    By combining the two ordered groups, we get the complete sequence from the lowest para-yield to the highest:
    (4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)

    The final order is 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3. This sequence perfectly matches option B.
