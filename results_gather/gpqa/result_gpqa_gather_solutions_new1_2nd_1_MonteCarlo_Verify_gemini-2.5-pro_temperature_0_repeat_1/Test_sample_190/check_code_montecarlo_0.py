    This function simulates a four-step organic synthesis to verify the final product.

    The simulation tracks the transformation of key functional groups:
    - Ketone
    - Primary Alcohol
    - Alkene (Isopropenyl)
    - Benzyl Ether (Protecting Group)
    - Tosylhydrazone (Intermediate)
    - Alkene (in the ring, from Shapiro reaction)
    - Isopropyl Group (from hydrogenation)

    Each reaction step is modeled as a transformation of this set of functional groups.
    The final simulated state is compared against the state corresponding to the given answer.
