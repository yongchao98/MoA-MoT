    Based on a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem and a review of the candidate answers, here is a definitive resolution.

    ### Step 1: Determine the Reaction Pathway and Final Product

    The four-step synthesis is a classic sequence in organic chemistry.

    1.  **Cyclohexanone + Bromine → Product 1:** This is a standard α-bromination of a ketone. The bromine atom adds to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.
        *   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexanone.

    2.  **Product 1 + NaOH, heat → Product 2:** This step involves an α-halo ketone reacting with a strong base.
        *   **Careful Point:** While an elimination reaction is a possibility for α-halo ketones, the subsequent reaction step (treatment with thionyl chloride) strongly implies that Product 2 is a carboxylic acid. This confirms the reaction is a **Favorskii rearrangement**, which involves a ring contraction.
        *   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.

    3.  **Product 2 + Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) → Product 3:** This is a standard conversion of a carboxylic acid into a more reactive acyl chloride.
        *   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride.

    4.  **Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride → Product 4:**
        *   **Careful Point:** This reagent, LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃, is a mild and sterically hindered reducing agent. Unlike stronger reagents like LiAlH₄, it is specifically used to reduce reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at that stage without further reduction to an alcohol.
        *   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.

    The final product is unambiguously **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**.

    ### Step 2: Analyze the Structure of Product 4

    The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. This requires an analysis of the molecule's symmetry.

    *   **Structure:** The molecule has a five-membered cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).
    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group, the C1 carbon of the ring (the one attached to the aldehyde), and the hydrogen on C1. This plane bisects the C3-C4 bond.
    *   **Counting Distinct Hydrogen Environments:**
        1.  **The Aldehyde Proton:** The single hydrogen of the -CHO group is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)
        2.  **The C1 Proton:** The single hydrogen on the ring carbon directly bonded to the aldehyde group is also unique. (1 type)
        3.  **The C2 and C5 Protons:** The plane of symmetry makes carbons C2 and C5 equivalent. However, the two hydrogens on C2 are not equivalent to each other; they are **diastereotopic** because C1 is a prochiral center. The same is true for the hydrogens on C5. The two "cis" protons (on C2 and C5) are equivalent to each other, and the two "trans" protons are equivalent to each other. This gives **two** distinct types of hydrogens from these four protons.
        4.  **The C3 and C4 Protons:** Similarly, carbons C3 and C4 are equivalent. The two hydrogens on each of these carbons are also diastereotopic. This gives another **two** distinct types of hydrogens.

    ### Step 3: Final Calculation and Conclusion

    Summing the distinct types of hydrogen atoms:
    1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (from C2/C5 protons) + 2 (from C3/C4 protons) = **6**.

    The number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms is 6. Comparing this to the given options:
    A) 7
    B) 10
    C) 6
    D) 8

    The correct option is C. The overwhelming majority of the candidate answers correctly performed the chemical analysis to arrive at the number 6, even if some made clerical errors in selecting the final letter.
