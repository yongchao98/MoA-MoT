    Checks the correctness of the answer to the CERN Bubble Chamber problem.

    The function recalculates the required resolution based on the problem's
    physical principles and compares it to the provided answer. The consensus
    from the analyzed answers is that the intended solution involves approximating
    "30%" as the fraction "1/3". This check verifies that specific interpretation.
