    Based on a systematic analysis of the candidate answers and the underlying chemical principles, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct answer.

    ### **Step 1: Analysis of Part A (Tautomerism)**

    The question asks to identify the compound that does **not** show tautomerism.

    *   **Careful Point (Principle):** The most common type, keto-enol tautomerism, requires a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (an α-hydrogen). For typical tautomerism, this alpha-carbon should be sp³-hybridized.

    1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** Its structure is a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyls are part of these double bonds (sp²-hybridized) and lack the necessary alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.
    2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** Its structure is a saturated six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. The carbons between the carbonyls are -CH₂- groups (sp³-hybridized). These contain acidic alpha-hydrogens, allowing the compound to readily tautomerize. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is exceptionally stable due to aromaticity. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.

    **Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

    ### **Step 2: Analysis of Part B (Optical Isomerism)**

    The question asks to identify the compound that **will** show optical isomerism.

    *   **Careful Point (Principle):** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral (non-superimposable on its mirror image). The most common indicator of chirality is a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four *different* groups.

    1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon is bonded to four distinct groups: -H, -OH, -CH₃, and -COOCH₃. This makes it a chiral center. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.
    2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:** Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃ (the *trans* isomer). The molecule is planar and has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. It has no chiral centers. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.

    **Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

    ### **Step 3: Final Decision**

    Combining the conclusions from both parts:
    *   Compound **(A)**, which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.
    *   Compound **(B)**, which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

    We must now match this correct combination with the given options:
    *   A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
    *   **B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**
    *   C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate
    *   D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate

    The correct combination corresponds to option B.

    *   **Careful Point (Meta-Analysis):** A review of the candidate answers shows that nearly all of them perform the chemical analysis correctly. However, a majority (e.g., Answers 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14) make a simple clerical error by mismatching their correct conclusion ("A is benzoquinone, B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate") with the final lettered option. This highlights the importance of carefully checking the options after the scientific analysis is complete.
