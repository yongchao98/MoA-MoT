def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the final answer for the multi-step organic synthesis problem.

    The function verifies the final product based on key chemical principles applied at each step:
    1.  The fundamental molecular structure must be a substituted cyclohexanone.
    2.  The methylation step with LDA must occur at the C6 position, as the C2 position is a quaternary carbon with no protons.
    3.  The stereochemistry must match the expected outcome of the stereoselective reactions:
        - C4 remains (S) from the starting material.
        - C3 becomes (R) due to anti-addition of the phenyl group relative to the C4-OTBS group.
        - C2 becomes (S) due to anti-addition of the benzyl group relative to the C3-phenyl group.
        - C6 becomes (S) due to stereocontrolled methylation.
