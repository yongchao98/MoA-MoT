    # Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate -> (A)
    # The nucleophilic enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the beta-carbon of the acrylate.
    # The beta-carbon is the one attached to the p-tolyl group.
    # This places the p-tolyl group on the C2 position of the resulting propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate backbone.
    correct_A = "trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate"

    # Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile -> (B)
    # This is a Stork enamine synthesis. The acidic workup (H3O+) hydrolyzes the intermediate
    # iminium salt back to a ketone. The keto-enol equilibrium for simple ketones heavily favors
    # the keto form, which is the thermodynamically stable product.
    # Therefore, the product is the "oxo" compound, not the "hydroxy" (enol) compound.
    correct_B = "3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile"

    # Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one -> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione
    # This is a retrosynthesis problem. The product is formed by adding a "3-oxobutyl" group
    # (from but-3-en-2-one) to reactant C. The nucleophile is formed by deprotonating the
    # highly acidic C2 position (active methylene) of the Michael donor.
    # The stable starting material is the dione itself.
