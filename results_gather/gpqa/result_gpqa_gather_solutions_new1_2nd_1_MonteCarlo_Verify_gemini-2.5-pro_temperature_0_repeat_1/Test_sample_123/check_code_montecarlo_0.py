    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the correct methodologies from the provided candidate answers and identifying the sources of their discrepancies.

    ### Step-by-step Analysis

    1.  **Identify the Governing Physical Principle**: The problem concerns the decay of particles moving at relativistic speeds. The solution requires combining two fundamental concepts: the exponential law of particle decay and the time dilation effect from special relativity.

    2.  **Formulate the Survival Equation**:
        *   The fraction of particles, `f`, that survive is given by the decay law `f = exp(-t_proper / τ)`, where `t_proper` is the time experienced by the particle in its own rest frame (proper time), and `τ` is its mean proper lifetime.
        *   The time of flight in the laboratory frame (`t_lab`) is the distance traveled (the detector radius, `R`) divided by the particle's velocity (`v`). Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, `v ≈ c` (the speed of light), so `t_lab ≈ R/c`.
        *   Due to time dilation, the proper time experienced by the particle is shorter than the lab time. The relationship is given by the Lorentz factor, `γ`: `t_proper = t_lab / γ`.
        *   Substituting these expressions into the decay law gives the survival fraction as a function of lab-frame variables:
            `f = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ)) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`

    3.  **Set Up Equations for Both Scenarios**: The term `K = R / (c * τ)` is a constant for this experiment, as the detector radius and the particle's intrinsic properties do not change. The equation simplifies to `f = exp(-K / γ)`.

        *   **Scenario 1 (Given):** For a Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, the survival fraction is `f₁ = 1/3`.
            `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`

        *   **Scenario 2 (Target):** We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, for which the survival fraction is `f₂ = 2/3`.
            `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`

    4.  **Solve for the Unknown Lorentz Factor (`γ₂`)**: The most direct method is to take the natural logarithm of both equations and then take their ratio to eliminate the unknown constant `K`.
        *   From Scenario 1: `ln(1/3) = -K / 20`
        *   From Scenario 2: `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`

        Dividing the first equation by the second:
        `ln(1/3) / ln(2/3) = (-K / 20) / (-K / γ₂)`
        `ln(1/3) / ln(2/3) = γ₂ / 20`

        Now, solve for `γ₂`:
        `γ₂ = 20 * (ln(1/3) / ln(2/3))`
        Using the logarithm property `ln(a/b) = -ln(b/a)`, this simplifies to:
        `γ₂ = 20 * (-ln(3)) / (-ln(3/2)) = 20 * (ln(3) / ln(3/2))`

    5.  **Calculate the Numerical Value**: Using the standard values for natural logarithms (`ln(3) ≈ 1.0986` and `ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055`):
        `γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)`
        `γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709`
        `γ₂ ≈ 54.18`

    6.  **Conclusion**: The calculated value for the new Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. Comparing this to the options provided in the original question (A=68, B=28, C=40, D=54), the closest answer is 54.

    ### Careful Points

    *   **Correct Application of Time Dilation**: The most critical step is to apply the decay law using the particle's proper time (`t_proper`), which correctly introduces the Lorentz factor `γ` into the denominator of the exponent. A common mistake would be to use the lab time directly, which would neglect relativity.
    *   **Physical Sanity Check**: To increase the survival fraction (from 1/3 to 2/3), the particles must decay more slowly over the fixed distance. This requires a larger time dilation effect, which means the Lorentz factor `γ` must be *higher*. The result `γ₂ ≈ 54` is indeed higher than the initial `γ₁ = 20`, which confirms the calculation is physically sensible.
    *   **Solving by Ratio**: The most robust mathematical approach is to establish a ratio between the two scenarios. This elegantly cancels out all the physical constants (`R`, `c`, `τ`) that are unknown and not needed for the final answer.
    *   **Analysis of Candidate Discrepancies**: The provided candidate answers show a remarkable consensus on the physical model and the mathematical calculation, with nearly all of them arriving at the numerical result of ~54.2. The discrepancies in their final letter choices (A, B, C, or D) stem from inconsistent labeling of the multiple-choice options in their individual analyses. However, the numerical result is consistent and reliable. Based on the options provided in the prompt, the value 54 corresponds to option D.
