def check_correctness_of_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the final answer for the given physics question.

    This function programmatically verifies the provided answer by applying the
    fundamental principles of one-loop radiative mass generation to each of the
    multiple-choice options.

    The key physical constraints are:
    1.  Dimensionality: The prefactor must be proportional to 1/(x^2+v^2).
    2.  Completeness & Signs: The formula must include all relevant particles with
        the correct sign based on their spin (positive for bosons, negative for fermions).
        Specifically, it must include the top quark (-M_t^4) and the CP-odd scalar (+M_A0^4).
