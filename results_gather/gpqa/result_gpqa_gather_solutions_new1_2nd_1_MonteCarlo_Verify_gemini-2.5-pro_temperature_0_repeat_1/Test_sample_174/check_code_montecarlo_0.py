    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the candidate answers and identifying the correct physical principles.

    ### Step-by-Step Analysis

    1.  **Identify the Physical Model:** The problem describes an "oscillating charge distribution" with a "spheroid in shape" and a symmetry axis along the z-axis. For a compact oscillating source (where the size is much smaller than the radiated wavelength λ), the most dominant form of radiation is electric dipole radiation. The symmetry described implies the electric dipole moment oscillates along the z-axis. This is the standard and correct model for this problem.

    2.  **Analyze the Angular Dependence of Radiated Power:**
        *   For an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) is not uniform. It follows the relationship:
            `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`
            where `θ` is the angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).
        *   The maximum power, `A`, is radiated where `sin²(θ)` is maximum. This occurs at `θ = 90°` (the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis), because `sin²(90°) = 1`.
        *   The question asks for the power at `θ = 30°` as a fraction of the maximum power `A`. We need to calculate the value of `sin²(30°)`.
        *   The sine of 30 degrees is a standard value: `sin(30°) = 1/2`.
        *   Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.
        *   The power radiated at 30° is `1/4` of the maximum power `A`.

    3.  **Analyze the Wavelength (λ) Dependence of Radiated Power:**
        *   The function `f(λ, θ)` represents the power per unit solid angle. Its dependence on the wavelength comes from the fundamental physics of dipole radiation.
        *   The total power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency of oscillation (`ω`). This is a result from the Larmor formula.
            `P_total ∝ ω⁴`
        *   The power per unit solid angle has the same frequency dependence: `f ∝ ω⁴`.
        *   The angular frequency `ω` is inversely proportional to the wavelength `λ` (`ω = 2πc/λ`, where `c` is the speed of light).
        *   Substituting this relationship into the power dependence gives:
            `f ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`
        *   Therefore, a possible form for the function `f` must include a `λ⁻⁴` term.

    ### Conclusion

    Based on the physical principles of electric dipole radiation, we have determined two key facts:
    1.  The fraction of maximum power at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.
    2.  The wavelength dependence of the radiated power is **λ⁻⁴**.

    We now match this result, **(1/4, λ⁻⁴)**, to the options provided in the question:
    A) 1/4, λ⁻³
    B) 3/4, λ⁻⁶
    C) 1/2, λ⁻⁴
    D) 1/4, λ⁻⁴

    The only option that matches both derived quantities is **D**.

    ### Careful Points to Note

    *   **Model Validity:** The electric dipole model is the correct and standard approximation for this type of problem. Higher-order multipoles (like quadrupole) exist but are typically much weaker and have different dependencies (e.g., quadrupole power `∝ ω⁶ ∝ λ⁻⁶`). The question is clearly targeting the dominant, lowest-order radiation.
    *   **Angular Calculation:** A common mistake is to forget to square the sine. The power is proportional to `sin²(θ)`, not `sin(θ)`. `sin(30°) = 1/2`, but `sin²(30°) = 1/4`. This correctly eliminates option C.
    *   **Frequency vs. Wavelength:** Another key point is the conversion from frequency dependence (`ω⁴`) to wavelength dependence (`λ⁻⁴`). The inverse relationship is crucial. This correctly eliminates option A.
    *   **Candidate Answer Inconsistency:** The provided candidate answers show a strong consensus on the physics: the fraction is **1/4** and the wavelength dependence is **λ⁻⁴**. However, they disagree on which option letter (A, B, C, or D) this corresponds to. This suggests they were working with different or scrambled versions of the options. The correct approach is to ignore their final letter choice and use their correct physical reasoning to select from the original options provided in the question, as done above.
