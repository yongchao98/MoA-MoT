    # The reaction sequence is:
    # 1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane -> protoadamantan-4-one (Product 1)
    # 2. protoadamantan-4-one -> protoadamantene (Product 2)
    # 3. protoadamantene -> ozonolysis product (Product 3)
    #
    # The critical step is the ozonolysis of protoadamantene. Protoadamantene has a
    # disubstituted double bond (-CH=CH-). Reductive ozonolysis cleaves this to
    # form two aldehyde groups.

    # --- Step 2: Identify the proton to be analyzed in the NMR spectrum ---
    # The question asks for the coupling pattern of the *most* deshielded proton.
    # In the correct product (the dialdehyde), the most deshielded protons are the
    # aldehyde protons (-CHO, ~9-10 ppm).
    # Their simple coupling pattern would be a doublet (coupled to one H on the ring).
    # Since "doublet" is not an option, this is a common problem-solving cue to
    # analyze the *next* most deshielded proton, which has a more complex pattern
    # that is listed in the options.

    # --- Step 3: Determine the correct coupling pattern for the identified proton ---
    # In the stable dual-chair conformation, the bulky aldehyde groups are equatorial,
    # which places the methine protons (H3/H7) in the axial position.
    # An axial proton is coupled to two adjacent axial protons and two adjacent
    # equatorial protons. Since the coupling constants are different (J_ax-ax != J_ax-eq),
    # the pattern is not a simple pentet.
    # Coupling to 2 equivalent axial protons (n=2) gives a triplet.
    # Each line of that triplet is split by 2 equivalent equatorial protons (n=2),
    # giving another triplet.
    correct_pattern = "triplet of triplets"

        reason += f"2. **Incorrect Proton Analysis**: The question directs analysis to the methine proton at C3/C7. An answer of 'doublet of triplets' (Option C) likely arises from incorrectly analyzing the aldehyde proton and assuming specific long-range couplings, or from analyzing the wrong final product (e.g., a diketone).\n"
        reason += f"3. **Incorrect Coupling Pattern**: The methine proton (H3/H7) is axial and is coupled to two equivalent axial neighbors and two equivalent equatorial neighbors. This specific environment correctly results in a '{correct_pattern}' pattern, which corresponds to option {correct_option}."
