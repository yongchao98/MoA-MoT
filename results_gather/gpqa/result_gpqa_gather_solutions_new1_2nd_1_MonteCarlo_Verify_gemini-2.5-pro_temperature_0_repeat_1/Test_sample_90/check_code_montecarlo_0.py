def check_chemistry_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the multi-step synthesis problem.

    The logic follows these steps:
    1.  Eliminate options with incorrect functional groups based on the reaction with excess DAST.
    2.  Determine the stereochemistry of the major aldol addition product (anti-diastereomer).
    3.  Determine the stereochemical outcome of the DAST fluorination (retention via NGP).
    4.  Combine the stereochemical steps to predict the final product's configuration.
    5.  Parse the IUPAC names of the valid options to determine their configurations.
    6.  Compare the predicted configuration with the options to find the correct answer.
