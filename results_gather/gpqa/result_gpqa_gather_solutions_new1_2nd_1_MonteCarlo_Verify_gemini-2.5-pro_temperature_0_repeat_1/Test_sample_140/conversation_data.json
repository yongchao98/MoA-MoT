These are the classic conditions for a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a highly reactive intermediate known as benzyne.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination to Form Benzyne Intermediates**: The strong base, the amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two different ortho positions:\n    *   **Position C6**, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position C2**, which has a deuterium atom (D).\n\n    This leads to two competing elimination pathways:\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction)**: The amide ion removes the proton from C6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction)**: The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed from the molecule, resulting in a non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\n    **Careful Point**: Due to the kinetic isotope effect, breaking a C-H bond is faster than breaking a C-D bond. Therefore, Pathway A is the major pathway. However, the question asks for all *possible* organic products, so we must consider the products from both pathways.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**: The amide anion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the triple bond in each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A)**: The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The nucleophile can attack either carbon.\n        *   Attack at C1: This places the amino group (-NH₂) at C1 and, after protonation, yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   Attack at C6: This places the amino group at C6. When the ring is renumbered to give the amino group the lowest number (position 1), the deuterium is now at position 3. This yields **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B)**: The triple bond is between C1 and C2. This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium. Attack at either carbon, followed by protonation, results in a single product: **aniline**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: By combining the outcomes of both possible pathways, we identify three distinct organic products:\n    1.  2-deuteroaniline\n    2.  3-deuteroaniline\n    3.  Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH₂) in condensed ammonia is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a benzyne intermediate. To determine the number of possible products, we must consider all possible reaction pathways.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates (Elimination)**\n\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr or DBr. The strong base, the amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two distinct ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to two competing elimination pathways, resulting in two different benzyne intermediates:\n\n1.  **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the hydrogen from C6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 creates a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains untouched. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**. Due to the kinetic isotope effect (the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond), this is the major, faster pathway.\n2.  **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuterium from C2. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 creates a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed from the molecule, resulting in a non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate. Although this pathway is slower, it is still possible, and the question asks for all *possible* products.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe amide anion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the two carbons of the triple bond in each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The amino group (-NH₂) attaches to C1. The resulting carbanion at C6 is protonated, yielding **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The amino group attaches to C6. The resulting carbanion at C1 is protonated. When the ring is renumbered to give the amino group the lowest number (position 1), the deuterium is now at position 3. This yields **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The non-deuterated benzyne is symmetrical with respect to the outcome. Attack at either carbon of the triple bond, followed by protonation, results in a single product: **aniline**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy considering both possible elimination pathways and the subsequent addition steps, we can identify three distinct organic products:\n1.  2-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n2.  3-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.

Understanding the Reaction**\nThe reaction involves 1-bromobenzene-2-d and sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia. This is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a highly reactive intermediate known as benzyne.\n\n**2.

Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 creates a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains on the ring. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**. Due to the kinetic isotope effect (the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond), this is the major, faster pathway.\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion can also remove the deuteron from C2. This is a slower but still *possible* reaction. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 creates a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed from the molecule, resulting in a non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\nTherefore, two distinct benzyne intermediates are formed.\n\n**3. Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe second step is the addition of the nucleophile, the amide anion (NH₂⁻), to the triple bond of each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    *   The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the C1-C6 triple bond.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** This places the amino group (-NH₂) at C1. The final product, after protonation, is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** This places the amino group at C6. The final product, after protonation and renumbering the ring to give the amino group the lowest number, is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    *   The nucleophile attacks the C1-C2 triple bond of the non-deuterated benzyne.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Since this intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium, attack at either carbon followed by protonation yields the same single product: **aniline**.\n\n**4. Conclusion: Counting All Possible Products**\nBy considering all possible pathways, we identify three structurally distinct organic products:\n1.  2-deuteroaniline (from the major pathway)\n2.  3-deuteroaniline (from the major pathway)\n3.  Aniline (from the minor pathway)\n\nThe question asks for the number of *possible* organic products, which requires counting all products that can be formed, regardless of their yield.

This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C1. A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is not involved in this step and remains on the ring. The intermediate formed is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Careful Point (Kinetic Isotope Effect):** The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Therefore, this pathway, involving the breaking of a C-H bond, is kinetically favored and is the major pathway.\n\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C1. A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The intermediate formed is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Although this pathway is slower (the minor pathway), the question asks for *all possible* products, so we must consider the products that arise from this intermediate.\n\n**3. Step 2: Addition of Nucleophile to Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe second step is the addition of the nucleophile (the amide ion, NH₂⁻) to the benzyne intermediates.

In this specific molecule, there are two different ortho positions, leading to two competing pathways:\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion can remove the hydrogen (H) from position C6. This is the kinetically favored pathway because the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond (a phenomenon known as the kinetic isotope effect). This elimination results in a **3-deuterobenzyne** intermediate, where the triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium at C2 remains.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion can also remove the deuterium (D) from position C2. Although slower, this is a possible pathway. This elimination removes the deuterium from the molecule and results in a standard, non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate, with the triple bond between C1 and C2.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition.** The amide anion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyne intermediates.

This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C1. A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is not involved in this step and remains on the ring. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**. Due to the kinetic isotope effect (the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond), this is the major, faster pathway.\n\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion can also remove the deuteron from C2.

The strong base (NH₂⁻) abstracts a proton from a position *ortho* to the bromine.\n        *   **Ortho Position 1 (C6):** This carbon has a hydrogen (H). Abstraction of this H leads to the formation of **3-deutero-benzyne**. This pathway is kinetically favored due to the C-H bond being weaker than the C-D bond (a concept called the kinetic isotope effect).\n        *   **Ortho Position 2 (C2):** This carbon has a deuterium (D).

These conditions are characteristic of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a highly reactive \"benzyne\" intermediate.\n\n**Step 2: The Elimination Step - Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe strong base, the amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two different ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to two competing elimination pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is the faster reaction due to the kinetic isotope effect (a C-H bond is weaker and broken more easily than a C-D bond). The subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 creates a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is not involved in this step and remains on the ring. The intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** Although slower, it is still possible for the strong amide base to remove the deuteron from C2.

To determine the number of possible products, we must consider all potential reaction pathways.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identification of Reaction Type**: The reactants are an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) and a very strong base (NaNH₂). These conditions are characteristic of a reaction proceeding through a benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Elimination (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\n    The first step is an elimination reaction where the strong base, the amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In the starting material, there are two distinct ortho positions:\n    *   **Position C6**: This carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   **Position C2**: This carbon is bonded to a deuterium atom (D).\n\n    This leads to two competing elimination pathways:\n\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction)**: The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C1. A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 remains in the molecule. The resulting intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**. Due to the kinetic isotope effect (a C-H bond is weaker and broken more easily than a C-D bond), this is the major, faster pathway.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction)**: The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C1, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the ring. The resulting intermediate is the standard, **non-deuterated benzyne**. Although this pathway is slower, it is still possible and must be considered when determining all *possible* products.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Addition (Nucleophilic Attack on Intermediates)**\n    The second step is the nucleophilic addition of the amide ion (NH₂⁻) to the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A)**: The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The nucleophile can attack either carbon.\n        *   **Attack at C1**: The -NH₂ group attaches to C1. The subsequent protonation of the carbanion at C6 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   **Attack at C6**: The -NH₂ group attaches to C6. The subsequent protonation of the carbanion at C1 yields **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n    *   **Product from non-deuterated benzyne (from Pathway B)**: The triple bond is between C1 and C2.\n        *   **Attack at C1 or C2**: Since this intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium, the attack of the -NH₂ group at either carbon, followed by protonation, leads to a single product: **aniline**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy considering all possible pathways, we identify three distinct organic products that can be formed in this reaction:\n1.  2-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n2.  3-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the provided answers and the underlying chemical principles, here is a breakdown of the reaction to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reaction Type**\nThe reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism, commonly known as the benzyne mechanism.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Elimination Step to Form Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe strong base, the amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a position ortho (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In the starting material, there are two distinct ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen (H) atom.\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium (D) atom.\n\nThis leads to two competing elimination pathways:\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. Subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is not involved in this step and remains on the ring. The intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. Subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this pathway, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nA crucial point is the **kinetic isotope effect**, which states that breaking a C-H bond is faster than breaking a stronger C-D bond. Therefore, Pathway A is the major pathway. However, the question asks for all *possible* products, so the products from the minor pathway (Pathway B) must also be included.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Addition Step to Form Final Products**\nThe amide anion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyne intermediates. This is followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent.\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):** This intermediate is asymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** This leads to the formation of **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** This leads to the formation of **3-deuteroaniline**.\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):** This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium.\n    3.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** Attack at either carbon of the triple bond results in the same single product: **aniline**.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Total Number of Unique Products**\nBy considering all possible pathways, we identify three structurally distinct organic products:\n1.  2-deuteroaniline\n2.  3-deuteroaniline\n3.  Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction. This corresponds to option A.\n\nWhile many of the candidate answers correctly identified the three products through their reasoning, several failed to select the correct corresponding letter from the given options. The analysis consistently shows that 3 products are possible.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on an analysis of the provided answers and the underlying chemistry, here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction**\n\nThe task is to determine the number of possible organic products from the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia.\n\n1.  **Constraint 1: Reaction Mechanism.** The conditions (aryl halide + strong base NaNH₂) dictate an elimination-addition mechanism, which proceeds through a highly reactive benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Constraint 2: Formation of Intermediates.** The first step is elimination. The amide base (NH₂⁻) abstracts a proton from a position *ortho* to the bromine.\n    *   The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has two different ortho positions: C6 (with a hydrogen, H) and C2 (with a deuterium, D).\n    *   This leads to two competing elimination pathways:\n        *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** Removal of H from C6 and Br from C1 forms **3-deutero-benzyne**. The deuterium at C2 is untouched.\n        *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** Removal of D from C2 and Br from C1 forms a standard, **non-deuterated benzyne**. The deuterium is lost from the molecule.\n    *   **Pruning:** We must consider products from *both* possible intermediates, as the question asks for all *possible* products, not just the major ones. The kinetic isotope effect makes Pathway A (H-abstraction) faster, but Pathway B is still possible.\n\n3.  **Constraint 3: Nucleophilic Addition.** The second step is the addition of the nucleophile (NH₂⁻) to the benzyne intermediates. The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n    *   **Products from 3-deutero-benzyne (Pathway A):** This intermediate is asymmetrical.\n        *   Attack at C1 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   Attack at C6 yields **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Product from non-deuterated benzyne (Pathway B):** This intermediate is symmetrical.\n        *   Attack at either C1 or C2 yields a single product: **aniline**.\n\n4.  **Final Count:** The set of all unique possible products is {aniline, 2-deuteroaniline, 3-deuteroaniline}. The total number of products is 3.\n\n**Evaluation of Candidate Answers**\n\n*   **Correct Reasoning:** The majority of the candidate answers (2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 12, and others) correctly identify the two-pathway mechanism leading to two different benzyne intermediates, and correctly deduce that this results in three final products.\n*   **Inconsistent Conclusions:** Several answers (1, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15) present the correct chemical reasoning that leads to 3 products but then select an incorrect final option (A, B, or D). This appears to be a clerical error in those responses.\n*   **Consensus:** The consistent and correct chemical analysis, repeated across multiple answers, points to a total of 3 products.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nThe chemical mechanism unambiguously leads to the formation of three distinct organic products.\n\n1.  **Aniline** (from the non-deuterated benzyne intermediate)\n2.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from the 3-deutero-benzyne intermediate)\n3.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from the 3-deutero-benzyne intermediate)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis is a classic organic chemistry problem involving an elimination-addition reaction via a benzyne intermediate. Let's break down the reaction step-by-step to determine all possible products.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (D) at position 2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base, providing the amide anion (NH₂⁻).\n*   **Mechanism:** These conditions are characteristic of a benzyne mechanism (elimination-addition).\n\n**Step 2: Elimination to Form Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr). The strong base, NH₂⁻, abstracts an acidic proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine leaving group. In this molecule, there are two distinct ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to two competing elimination pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C1. A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is unaffected. The resulting intermediate is **3-deutero-benzyne**.\n    *   *Note:* Due to the kinetic isotope effect, breaking the weaker C-H bond is faster than breaking the stronger C-D bond. Therefore, this is the major pathway.\n\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C1. A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The resulting intermediate is a standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n    *   *Note:* Although this is the minor pathway, the question asks for all *possible* products, so this pathway must be considered.\n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe second step is the addition of the nucleophile (NH₂⁻) to the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from 3-deutero-benzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The nucleophile can attack either carbon.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. The resulting carbanion at C6 is protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. The resulting carbanion at C1 is protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. When the ring is renumbered to give the amino group the lowest number (position 1), the deuterium is at position 3.

Analyze the Elimination Step (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe first step is the removal of a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom by the strong amide base (NH₂⁻). In the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two different ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon has a standard hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D), which is an isotope of hydrogen.\n\nThis leads to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. The resulting carbanion then expels the bromide ion from C1 to form a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is not involved in this step. The resulting intermediate is **3-deutero-benzyne**. This pathway is kinetically favored because the C-H bond is weaker and easier to break than the C-D bond (a phenomenon known as the kinetic isotope effect).\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion can also remove the deuteron from C2.

After renumbering the ring to give the amino group the primary position (C1), the deuterium is now at C3. This product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    *   The nucleophile attacks the non-deuterated benzyne.

Understanding the Reaction**\nThe reaction involves 1-bromobenzene-2-d and sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia. This is a classic example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a highly reactive intermediate known as benzyne.\n\n**2. Step 1: Elimination to Form Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr). The strong base, the amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom. In the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two different ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to two competing elimination pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion can remove the hydrogen from C6. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 creates a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 remains on the ring. This intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**. Due to the kinetic isotope effect (the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond), this is the major, faster pathway.\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion can also remove the deuteron from C2. This is a slower but still *possible* reaction. Subsequent elimination of the bromide ion from C1 creates a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium is removed from the molecule, resulting in a non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\nTherefore, two distinct benzyne intermediates are formed.\n\n**3. Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe second step is the addition of the nucleophile, the amide anion (NH₂⁻), to the triple bond of each benzyne intermediate. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    *   The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the C1-C6 triple bond.\n    *   **Attack at C1:** This places the amino group (-NH₂) at C1. The final product, after protonation, is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Attack at C6:** This places the amino group at C6. The final product, after protonation and renumbering the ring to give the amino group the lowest number, is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    *   The nucleophile attacks the C1-C2 triple bond of the non-deuterated benzyne.\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** Since this intermediate is symmetrical and has no deuterium, attack at either carbon followed by protonation yields the same single product: **aniline**.\n\n**4. Conclusion: Counting All Possible Products**\nBy considering all possible pathways, we identify three structurally distinct organic products:\n1.  2-deuteroaniline (from the major pathway)\n2.  3-deuteroaniline (from the major pathway)\n3.  Aniline (from the minor pathway)\n\nThe question asks for the number of *possible* organic products, which requires counting all products that can be formed, regardless of their yield.

This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C1. A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium atom at C2 is not involved in this step and remains on the ring. The intermediate formed is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n    *   **Careful Point (Kinetic Isotope Effect):** The C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Therefore, this pathway, involving the breaking of a C-H bond, is kinetically favored and is the major pathway.\n\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C1. A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The intermediate formed is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Although this pathway is slower (the minor pathway), the question asks for *all possible* products, so we must consider the products that arise from this intermediate.\n\n**3.

The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The nucleophile can attack either carbon.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. The resulting carbanion at C6 is protonated. The final product has the amino group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. The resulting carbanion at C1 is protonated. The final product has the amino group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. When the ring is renumbered to give the amino group the lowest number (position 1), the deuterium is at position 3. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C2.

Subsequent protonation yields the same single product: **aniline** (non-deuterated).\n\n**4. Conclusion: Count the Total Number of Products**\nBy considering all possible pathways, we have identified three structurally distinct organic products:\n1.

The intermediate is **3-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. Subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this pathway, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The intermediate is the standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n\nA crucial point is the **kinetic isotope effect**, which states that breaking a C-H bond is faster than breaking a stronger C-D bond. Therefore, Pathway A is the major pathway. However, the question asks for all *possible* products, so the products from the minor pathway (Pathway B) must also be included.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Addition Step to Form Final Products**\nThe amide anion (NH₂⁻) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyne intermediates. This is followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent.\n*   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):** This intermediate is asymmetrical. The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** This leads to the formation of **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** This leads to the formation of **3-deuteroaniline**.\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):** This intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium.\n    3.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** Attack at either carbon of the triple bond results in the same single product: **aniline**.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Total Number of Unique Products**\nBy considering all possible pathways, we identify three structurally distinct organic products:\n1.  2-deuteroaniline\n2.  3-deuteroaniline\n3.  Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction. This corresponds to option A.\n\nWhile many of the candidate answers correctly identified the three products through their reasoning, several failed to select the correct corresponding letter from the given options. The analysis consistently shows that 3 products are possible.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on an analysis of the provided answers and the underlying chemistry, here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction**\n\nThe task is to determine the number of possible organic products from the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia.\n\n1.  **Constraint 1: Reaction Mechanism.** The conditions (aryl halide + strong base NaNH₂) dictate an elimination-addition mechanism, which proceeds through a highly reactive benzyne intermediate.\n\n2.  **Constraint 2: Formation of Intermediates.** The first step is elimination. The amide base (NH₂⁻) abstracts a proton from a position *ortho* to the bromine.\n    *   The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has two different ortho positions: C6 (with a hydrogen, H) and C2 (with a deuterium, D).\n    *   This leads to two competing elimination pathways:\n        *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** Removal of H from C6 and Br from C1 forms **3-deutero-benzyne**. The deuterium at C2 is untouched.\n        *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** Removal of D from C2 and Br from C1 forms a standard, **non-deuterated benzyne**. The deuterium is lost from the molecule.\n    *   **Pruning:** We must consider products from *both* possible intermediates, as the question asks for all *possible* products, not just the major ones. The kinetic isotope effect makes Pathway A (H-abstraction) faster, but Pathway B is still possible.\n\n3.  **Constraint 3: Nucleophilic Addition.** The second step is the addition of the nucleophile (NH₂⁻) to the benzyne intermediates. The nucleophile can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n    *   **Products from 3-deutero-benzyne (Pathway A):** This intermediate is asymmetrical.\n        *   Attack at C1 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n        *   Attack at C6 yields **3-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   **Product from non-deuterated benzyne (Pathway B):** This intermediate is symmetrical.\n        *   Attack at either C1 or C2 yields a single product: **aniline**.\n\n4.  **Final Count:** The set of all unique possible products is {aniline, 2-deuteroaniline, 3-deuteroaniline}. The total number of products is 3.\n\n**Evaluation of Candidate Answers**\n\n*   **Correct Reasoning:** The majority of the candidate answers (2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 12, and others) correctly identify the two-pathway mechanism leading to two different benzyne intermediates, and correctly deduce that this results in three final products.\n*   **Inconsistent Conclusions:** Several answers (1, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15) present the correct chemical reasoning that leads to 3 products but then select an incorrect final option (A, B, or D). This appears to be a clerical error in those responses.\n*   **Consensus:** The consistent and correct chemical analysis, repeated across multiple answers, points to a total of 3 products.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nThe chemical mechanism unambiguously leads to the formation of three distinct organic products.\n\n1.  **Aniline** (from the non-deuterated benzyne intermediate)\n2.  **2-deuteroaniline** (from the 3-deutero-benzyne intermediate)\n3.  **3-deuteroaniline** (from the 3-deutero-benzyne intermediate)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis is a classic organic chemistry problem involving an elimination-addition reaction via a benzyne intermediate. Let's break down the reaction step-by-step to determine all possible products.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Substrate:** 1-bromobenzene-2-d. This is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom (D) at position 2.\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium amide (NaNH₂) in liquid ammonia (NH₃). NaNH₂ is an extremely strong base, providing the amide anion (NH₂⁻).\n*   **Mechanism:** These conditions are characteristic of a benzyne mechanism (elimination-addition).\n\n**Step 2: Elimination to Form Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe first step is the elimination of HBr (or DBr). The strong base, NH₂⁻, abstracts an acidic proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine leaving group. In this molecule, there are two distinct ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D).\n\nThis leads to two competing elimination pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C1. A triple bond forms between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is unaffected. The resulting intermediate is **3-deutero-benzyne**.\n    *   *Note:* Due to the kinetic isotope effect, breaking the weaker C-H bond is faster than breaking the stronger C-D bond. Therefore, this is the major pathway.\n\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the deuteron from C2. This is followed by the elimination of the bromide ion from C1. A triple bond forms between C1 and C2. In this process, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule. The resulting intermediate is a standard, non-deuterated **benzyne**.\n    *   *Note:* Although this is the minor pathway, the question asks for all *possible* products, so this pathway must be considered.\n\n**Step 3: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\nThe second step is the addition of the nucleophile (NH₂⁻) to the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (NH₃).\n\n*   **Products from 3-deutero-benzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The nucleophile can attack either carbon.\n    1.  **Attack at C1:** The -NH₂ group adds to C1. The resulting carbanion at C6 is protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C1 and the deuterium at C2. This is **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    2.  **Attack at C6:** The -NH₂ group adds to C6. The resulting carbanion at C1 is protonated. The final product has the -NH₂ group at C6 and the deuterium at C2. When the ring is renumbered to give the amino group the lowest number (position 1), the deuterium is at position 3. This is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    The triple bond is between C1 and C2, and there is no deuterium.\n    3.  **Attack at C1 or C2:** The nucleophile adds to either C1 or C2. Since the intermediate is symmetrical and has no label, both attacks lead to the same final product after protonation: **aniline**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBy considering all possible pathways, we have identified three distinct organic products:\n1.  2-deuteroaniline\n2.  3-deuteroaniline\n3.  Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the number of possible organic products.\n\n**1. Identify the Reaction Type**\nThe reaction involves an aryl halide (1-bromobenzene-2-d) and a very strong base (sodium amide, NaNH₂). These conditions are characteristic of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution that proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism, involving a highly reactive \"benzyne\" intermediate.\n\n**2. Analyze the Elimination Step (Formation of Benzyne Intermediates)**\nThe first step is the removal of a proton (or deuteron) from a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the bromine atom by the strong amide base (NH₂⁻). In the starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two different ortho positions:\n*   **Position C6:** This carbon has a standard hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position C2:** This carbon has a deuterium atom (D), which is an isotope of hydrogen.\n\nThis leads to two possible elimination pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion removes the proton from C6. The resulting carbanion then expels the bromide ion from C1 to form a triple bond between C1 and C6. The deuterium at C2 is not involved in this step. The resulting intermediate is **3-deutero-benzyne**. This pathway is kinetically favored because the C-H bond is weaker and easier to break than the C-D bond (a phenomenon known as the kinetic isotope effect).\n*   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion can also remove the deuteron from C2. Although this is a slower process, it is still a possible reaction. The subsequent loss of the bromide ion from C1 forms a triple bond between C1 and C2. In this pathway, the deuterium atom is removed from the molecule, resulting in a standard, non-deuterated **benzyne** intermediate.\n\nSince the question asks for all *possible* products, we must consider the outcomes from both benzyne intermediates.\n\n**3. Analyze the Addition Step (Nucleophilic Attack)**\nIn the second step, the amide ion (NH₂⁻) acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the two carbons of the benzyne's triple bond. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the ammonia solvent.\n\n*   **Products from 3-deutero-benzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    *   The nucleophile can attack C1. This places the amino group (-NH₂) at C1, and the subsequent protonation of C6 yields **2-deuteroaniline**.\n    *   The nucleophile can attack C6. This places the amino group at C6. After renumbering the ring to give the amino group the primary position (C1), the deuterium is now at C3. This product is **3-deuteroaniline**.\n\n*   **Product from benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    *   The nucleophile attacks the non-deuterated benzyne. Since this intermediate is symmetrical and contains no deuterium, attack at either C1 or C2, followed by protonation, yields a single product: **aniline**.\n\n**4. Conclusion: Count the Unique Products**\nBy considering all possible pathways, we identify three distinct organic products that can be formed:\n1.  2-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n2.  3-deuteroaniline (from Pathway A)\n3.  Aniline (from Pathway B)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
