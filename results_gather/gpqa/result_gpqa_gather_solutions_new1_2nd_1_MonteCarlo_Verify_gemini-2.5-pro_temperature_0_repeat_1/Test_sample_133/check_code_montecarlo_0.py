    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer for the enthalpy of neutralization problem.

    It calculates the enthalpy based on the following steps:
    1. Calculate the total moles of H+ ions from HCl and H2SO4.
    2. Calculate the total moles of OH- ions from Ba(OH)2.
    3. Identify the limiting reactant for the neutralization reaction to find the moles of water formed.
    4. Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization using the standard value (-13.6 kcal/mol).
    5. Compare the calculated result with the provided answer's value.
