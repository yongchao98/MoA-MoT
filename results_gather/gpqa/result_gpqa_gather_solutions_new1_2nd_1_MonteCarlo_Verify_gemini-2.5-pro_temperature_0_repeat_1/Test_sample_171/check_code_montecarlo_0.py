    Based on a comprehensive analysis of the problem and the provided candidate answers, a definitive solution can be reached. The candidate answers show a remarkable consensus on the physical derivation but diverge in their final conclusion due to inconsistencies in the multiple-choice options they were presented with.

    Here is a definitive step-by-step analysis to resolve the question.

    ### Step-by-Step Analysis

    1.  **Identify the Governing Physical Principle**: The problem describes the population of atomic energy levels in stellar photospheres, which are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The correct physical law to apply is the **Boltzmann Equation**.

    2.  **State the Boltzmann Equation**: The equation relates the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (`N_j`) to a lower state (`N_i`) to the temperature (`T`) of the system:
        `N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))`
        where `ΔE` is the energy difference, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `g_j`/`g_i` is the ratio of statistical weights for the energy levels.

    3.  **Apply the Equation to Both Stars**: Let's denote the excitation ratio `N_j / N_i` as `R`. Since we are observing the same atomic transition in both stars, the term for the statistical weights `(g_j / g_i)` and the energy difference `ΔE` are the same for both.
        *   For star 1 (temperature T₁): `R₁ = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁))`
        *   For star 2 (temperature T₂): `R₂ = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))`
        (Here, `C` is the constant `g_j / g_i`).

    4.  **Incorporate the Problem's Central Condition**: The problem states that iron atoms in star 1 are "twice as excited" as in star 2. This translates to the mathematical relationship:
        `R₁ = 2 * R₂`

    5.  **Combine and Simplify**: Substitute the expressions from step 3 into the relationship from step 4:
        `C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * [C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))]`
        The constant `C` cancels from both sides:
        `exp(-ΔE / (k * T₁)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T₂))`

    6.  **Solve for the Temperature Relationship**: To isolate the temperatures, we take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides. Using the logarithm properties `ln(e^x) = x` and `ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b)`, we get:
        `-ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T₂)`

    7.  **Isolate ln(2)**: Rearrange the equation to solve for `ln(2)`:
        `ΔE / (k * T₂) - ΔE / (k * T₁) = ln(2)`
        Factor out the common term `(ΔE / k)`:
        `(ΔE / k) * (1/T₂ - 1/T₁) = ln(2)`
        Combine the fractions inside the parenthesis by finding a common denominator `(T₁ * T₂)`:
        `(ΔE / k) * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ] = ln(2)`

    8.  **Substitute the Given Numerical Values**: This is a critical step designed into the problem.
        *   Energy difference `ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J`
        *   The Boltzmann constant `k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K`
        The ratio `ΔE / k` is therefore approximately 1.

    9.  **Determine the Final Equation**: Substituting `ΔE / k = 1` into the equation from step 7 gives the final result:
        `1 * [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂) ] = ln(2)`
        Which simplifies to:
        `ln(2) = (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁ * T₂)`

    ### Careful Points and Final Conclusion

    *   **Correct Derivation**: The derivation above is robust and was performed correctly by nearly all candidate answers. The physics and algebra are sound.
    *   **The `ΔE / k ≈ 1` Simplification**: Recognizing that the given numerical values are intended to make this ratio simplify to 1 is a key insight required to match the answer choices.
    *   **Source of Confusion**: The candidate answers show widespread confusion, selecting A, B, C, and D. However, their written derivations are almost all identical and correct. This indicates the confusion stems from being presented with different orderings of the multiple-choice options.
    *   **Final Verification**: My task is to match the correctly derived formula to the options provided in *this* prompt's question.

    **Derived Formula**: `ln(2) = [ (T₁ - T₂) / (T₁*T₂) ]`

    **Options from the Question**:
    A) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]
    B) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]
    C) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]
    D) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]

    Comparing the derived formula to this specific list, it is an exact match for option D.
