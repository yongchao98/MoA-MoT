    # --- Problem Definition ---
    # The question asks for the final product of a reaction sequence.
    # Starting material: C8H9NO with given NMR.
    # Reagents: 1. NaNO2 + HCl, 2. H2O, 3. aq. KOH, Heat
    # Options:
    options = {
        "A": "2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal",
        "B": "4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal",
        "C": "2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal",
        "D": "3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal"

    # The final answer provided by the LLM to be checked.
    llm_final_answer = "A"

    # --- Step 1: Verify the Starting Material from NMR data ---
    # The code will check for key features that uniquely identify the starting material.
    # NMR data: 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H).
    # - 9.72(t) + 3.66(d) -> -CH2-CHO fragment
    # - 6.98(d) + 6.51(d) -> para-disubstituted benzene ring
    # - 6.27(bs) -> -NH2 group
    # These fragments assemble to only one structure: 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.
    expected_starting_material = "4-aminophenylacetaldehyde"
    # This step is correctly identified by all candidate answers, so we can proceed.
    
    # --- Step 2: Verify the Intermediate Product ---
    # Reagents 1 (NaNO2 + HCl) and 2 (H2O) perform a diazotization followed by hydrolysis.
    # This standard reaction converts a primary aromatic amine (Ar-NH2) to a phenol (Ar-OH).
    if expected_starting_material == "4-aminophenylacetaldehyde":
        intermediate_product = "4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde"
    else:
        # This case should not be reached if Step 1 is correct.
        return "Logic Error: Could not determine intermediate because starting material was incorrect."

    # --- Step 3: Verify the Final Product ---
    # Reagent 3 (aq. KOH, Heat) indicates a base-catalyzed aldol condensation.
    # The key is that "Heat" is specified.
    # Without heat, the reaction would stop at the aldol *addition* product.
    # With heat, the reaction proceeds via dehydration to the aldol *condensation* product.

    # The aldol addition product is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal, which is Option D.
    aldol_addition_product_name = options["D"]
    
    # The final condensation product (after dehydration due to heat) is 
    # 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal, which is Option A.
    aldol_condensation_product_name = options["A"]

    # The problem specifies "Heat", so the condensation product is the correct final answer.
    correct_final_product_name = aldol_condensation_product_name
    correct_option = "A"

    # --- Step 4: Compare with the LLM's Answer ---
    if llm_final_answer == correct_option:
        return "Correct"
    else:
        reason = (
            f"Incorrect. The provided answer is '{llm_final_answer}', but the correct answer is '{correct_option}'.\n"
            f"Reasoning: The third reaction step is an aldol reaction under 'Heat'.\n"
            f"The presence of heat is a critical constraint, indicating the reaction does not stop at the aldol addition product ('{aldol_addition_product_name}', Option D).\n"
            f"Instead, it proceeds via dehydration to the more stable, final condensation product ('{correct_final_product_name}', Option A)."
