    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer for designing a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus.

    The function evaluates each option based on three key constraints from the question:
    1.  **Molecular Kit**: The test must detect nucleic acids (RNA/DNA).
    2.  **Retrovirus Biology**: The method must correctly handle an RNA genome, which requires a reverse transcription step (RNA -> cDNA).
    3.  **Quick & Accurate**: The method must be suitable for rapid, early diagnosis in an outbreak.
