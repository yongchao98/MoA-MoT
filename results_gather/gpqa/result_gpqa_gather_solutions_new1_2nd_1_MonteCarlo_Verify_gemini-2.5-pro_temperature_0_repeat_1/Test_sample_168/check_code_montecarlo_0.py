Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.

### Step 1: Analyze the Nature of the Energy Spectrum (Continuous vs. Discrete)

The first key point is to determine if the energy spectrum of the `E` particles remains continuous or becomes discrete.

*   **General Principle:** In particle decay, the nature of the energy spectrum depends on the number of particles in the final state.
    *   A **two-body decay** (e.g., A → B + C) results in a **discrete** energy spectrum. Conservation of energy and momentum fix the energies of the two products.
    *   A **three-or-more-body decay** (e.g., A → B + C + D) results in a **continuous** energy spectrum for any of the products. The total released energy can be shared among the final particles in a continuous range of ways.

*   **Applying the Principle:**
    *   **Original Decay (`2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V`):** The final state consists of the recoiling nucleus (containing 2B) and four light particles (2E, 2V). This is a multi-body final state, which is why the problem correctly states the spectrum is continuous.
    *   **Variant Decay (`2A -> 2B + 2E + M`):** The final state consists of the recoiling nucleus, two E particles, and one M particle. This is also a multi-body final state. The total decay energy is shared among these products.

*   **Conclusion 1:** Since the variant decay still produces more than two particles in the final state, the energy spectrum of the `E` particles must **remain continuous**. This immediately eliminates options A and D.

### Step 2: Analyze the Endpoint of the Spectrum (Increases vs. Decreases)

The second key point is to determine how the maximum energy of the `E` particles (the endpoint) changes.

*   **General Principle:** The endpoint of the spectrum is determined by the total kinetic energy released in the decay, often called the Q-value. This energy is the difference between the total rest mass of the initial particles and the total rest mass of the final particles, according to `E = mc²`.
    `Q_kinetic = (m_initial - m_final) * c²`

*   **Applying the Principle:**
    *   Let `m_A`, `m_B`, `m_E`, `m_V`, and `m_M` be the masses of the respective particles. The initial mass `m(2A)` and the final heavy mass `m(2B)` are the same for both processes. The change in the endpoint depends only on the masses of the light particles that are created.

    *   **Endpoint of Original Decay (Q):**
        *   The final light particles are `2E` and `2V`.
        *   The problem describes `V` as a "much lighter particle," which, in contrast to `M` being "massless," implies `V` has a small but non-zero rest mass (`m_V > 0`).
        *   The total rest mass of the final light particles is `2*m_E + 2*m_V`.
        *   The energy "spent" creating this rest mass is `(2*m_E + 2*m_V)c²`.

    *   **Endpoint of Variant Decay (Q'):**
        *   The final light particles are `2E` and `M`.
        *   The problem explicitly states that `M` is **massless** (`m_M = 0`).
        *   The total rest mass of the final light particles is `2*m_E + m_M = 2*m_E`.
        *   The energy "spent" creating this rest mass is `(2*m_E)c²`.

*   **Comparison:** In the variant decay, the energy `2*m_V*c²` that was previously required to create the rest mass of the two `V` particles is no longer needed. This energy is now available as additional kinetic energy for the final products. Therefore, the total kinetic energy released in the variant decay is higher than in the original decay.

*   **Conclusion 2:** Since more total kinetic energy is available, the maximum possible energy for the `E` particles—the endpoint of their spectrum—**increases**.

### Final Decision

Combining the two conclusions:
1.  The spectrum remains **continuous**.
2.  The endpoint **increases**.

This corresponds exactly to option C.
