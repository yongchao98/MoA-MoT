    This function checks the correctness of the reasoning about the mean free paths λ1 and λ2.

    It verifies the following steps:
    1. The ratio λ2/λ1 is derived from the base formulas.
    2. The physical constraint on the cross-sections (σ_gg > σ_eg) is applied.
    3. The resulting inequality for λ2/λ1 is determined.
    4. The multiple-choice options are evaluated against this inequality.

    # This is derived from λ1 = 1/(sqrt(2)*n*σ_gg) and λ2 = 1/(n*σ_eg).
    
    # Principle 2: For high-energy electrons, the scattering cross-section σ_eg is smaller
    # than the kinetic cross-section σ_gg. Therefore, the ratio (σ_gg / σ_eg) is > 1.
