    This function verifies the solution to the problem of finding the volume integral
    of the divergence of a radially symmetric 1/r^2 vector field over a sphere.

    Problem: Evaluate ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV for f(r) = (1/r^2) * r_hat over a sphere of radius R.
    
    The provided final answer is 'B', which corresponds to 4π from the options:
    A) 1, B) 4π, C) 0, D) 4/3 π R.

    The standard method, as outlined in the correct answers, is to use the Divergence Theorem:
    ∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS).
    
    This check calculates the surface integral (flux) and compares it to the given answer.
