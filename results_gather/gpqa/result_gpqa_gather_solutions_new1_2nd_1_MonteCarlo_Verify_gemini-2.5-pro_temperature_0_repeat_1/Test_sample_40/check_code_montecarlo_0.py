    This function checks the correctness of the provided LLM answer.
    The question is to find the speed of light in a moving medium.
    The correct formula is derived from relativistic velocity addition.
    The provided answer is B, which corresponds to the formula (1+n*v)/(n+v).
    This function will verify this using two independent methods:
    1. Symbolic derivation using sympy.
    2. Checking against known physical constraints (limiting cases).
