Since the speeds can be relativistic (close to the speed of light), the correct physical principle to apply is Einstein's relativistic velocity addition formula. This is a point of consensus among almost all candidate answers.\n\n2.  **Define the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Laboratory Frame (S):** This is the stationary frame of the observer.\n    *   **Glass's Rest Frame (S'):** This frame moves along with the glass at a constant velocity `v` relative to the laboratory.\n\n3.  **Define the Velocities:**\n    *   **`v`**: The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S).\n    *   **`u'`**: The velocity of the light beam relative to the glass (in frame S').

This shows a strong consensus on the physical reasoning and mathematical steps.\n*   **Mapping to Options:** A significant point of failure across many candidates is correctly matching their derived formula to the given options (A, B, C, D). For instance, Answers 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 15 all perform the correct derivation but select the wrong letter. This appears to be a systematic error in their final step, possibly due to a misinterpretation of the option labels.\n*   **Correct Final Answer:** Answers 1, 4, and 5 not only perform the correct derivation (or use logical constraints that lead to the same result) but also correctly map the result `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)` to option A.\n*   **Physical Constraints (as in Answer 1):** A good way to double-check the result is to test it with limiting cases:\n    *   **Vacuum (n=1):** The speed of light should be `c=1`.

The formula gives `u = (1 + n*0) / (n + 0) = 1/n`. This is also correct.\n    Both constraints validate that the formula `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)` is the correct one.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct physical formula, derived from the principles of special relativity, is `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`. This expression matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis is a classic problem in special relativity, often demonstrated by the Fizeau experiment. To solve it, we must use the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the careful points needed for an accurate solution.\n\n**1. Identify the Frames of Reference**\n*   **Frame S:** The stationary laboratory frame, where the observer is at rest.\n*   **Frame S':** The moving frame of reference, which is the glass block itself. This frame moves at a velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame S.\n\n**2. Identify the Velocities**\n*   **`v`**: The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S). The problem states the glass and the light beam move in the same direction.\n*   **`u'`**: The velocity of the light beam as measured within its own medium, i.e., relative to the glass (frame S'). The speed of light in a medium with a refractive index `n` is `c/n`. Since the problem specifies that the speed of light in a vacuum `c=1`, the speed of light relative to the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n*   **`u`**: The velocity of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory (frame S). This is the value we need to find.\n\n**3. Apply the Correct Physical Law: Relativistic Velocity Addition**\nSince the problem involves the speed of light and moving reference frames, we cannot use the simple Galilean addition of velocities (`u = u' + v`). We must use Einstein's relativistic velocity addition formula. For two velocities `u'` and `v` in the same direction, the formula is:\n`u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n**4. Substitute the Known Values**\nWe substitute our specific values into the formula:\n*   `u' = 1/n`\n*   `v = v`\n*   `c = 1`\n\nThis gives:\n`u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n**5. Perform Careful Algebraic Simplification**\nThe expression can be simplified:\n`u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\nTo eliminate the fractions in the numerator and denominator, we multiply both by `n`:\n`u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n\nDistributing the `n` in the numerator and denominator gives:\n*   Numerator: `n * (1/n) + n * v = 1 + n*v`\n*   Denominator: `n * 1 + n * (v/n) = n + v`\n\nSo, the final simplified expression is:\n`u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n**6.

Sanity Check with Limiting Cases**\n*   **If the medium is a vacuum (n=1):** The speed should be `c=1` for any observer. Our formula gives `u = (1 + 1*v) / (1 + v) = (1+v)/(1+v) = 1`. This is correct.\n*   **If the medium is stationary (v=0):** The speed should be the standard speed in the medium, `c/n = 1/n`. Our formula gives `u = (1 + n*0) / (n + 0) = 1/n`. This is also correct.\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers shows that while most correctly derived the formula `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`, many failed to map it to the correct letter from the original question's list, likely due to randomized option ordering during their generation. The correct derivation and direct comparison confirm that A is the right choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula, a key concept from Einstein's theory of special relativity.

Understand the Physics of the Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the speed of light as measured by a stationary observer when the light is traveling through a medium (glass) that is itself moving. This is a classic problem in special relativity that requires the use of the relativistic velocity addition formula. Simple Galilean addition (`speed = speed_in_glass + speed_of_glass`) is incorrect at relativistic speeds.\n\n**2. Define the Frames of Reference and Velocities**\n\n*   **Frame S (Laboratory Frame):** This is the observer's stationary frame.\n*   **Frame S' (Glass's Rest Frame):** This frame is moving along with the glass at a velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame S.\n*   **`v`:** The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the lab (frame S).\n*   **`u'`:** The velocity of the light beam relative to the glass (i.e., as measured in frame S'). The speed of light in a medium with refractive index `n` is `c/n`. Since the problem sets the speed of light in a vacuum `c=1`, we have `u' = 1/n`.\n*   **`u`:** The velocity of the light beam relative to the observer in the lab (frame S). This is the value we need to find.\n\n**3. Apply the Correct Formula**\n\nThe relativistic velocity addition formula for two velocities (`u'` and `v`) in the same direction is:\n`u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n**4. Substitute the Known Values and Simplify**\n\nSubstitute `u' = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the formula:\n`u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\nSimplify the expression:\n`u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\nTo eliminate the fractions in the numerator and denominator, multiply both by `n`:\n`u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n`u = (n/n + n*v) / (n*1 + n*v/n)`\n`u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n**5. Compare the Result with the Options**\n\nThe derived formula for the speed of light as seen by the observer is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n\nLet's match this with the given options:\nA) `(1+n*v)/(n+v)`\nB) `(1+n*v)/(n-v)`\nC) `1`\nD) `(1-n*v)/(n+v)`\n\nThe derived formula exactly matches **Option A**.\n\n**6. Analysis of the Candidate Answers**\n\n*   **Correct Derivation:** A vast majority of the candidate answers (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15) correctly derive the formula `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`. This shows a strong consensus on the underlying physics and mathematical steps.\n*   **Mapping to the Final Answer:** The primary source of error among the candidates is incorrectly matching their correctly derived formula to the lettered options. For example, Answers 2, 3, and 9 derive the correct formula but incorrectly label it as 'B'. Answers 7 and 10 incorrectly label it as 'C', and Answers 8, 11, 12, and 15 incorrectly label it as 'D'. This appears to be a clerical error, possibly due to the options being presented in a different order during their individual processing.\n*   **Correct Conclusion:** Answers 1, 4, and 5 not only perform the derivation correctly but also correctly identify that the result matches option A. Answer 1 provides an excellent alternative method by testing the options against known physical limits (what happens when `n=1` or `v=0`), which also uniquely selects option A.\n\nBased on the correct physical derivation and a careful comparison with the provided options, the answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires the use of the relativistic velocity addition formula to determine the speed of light in a moving medium as seen by a stationary observer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Frames of Reference:**\n    *   Let **S** be the stationary laboratory frame where the observer is located.\n    *   Let **S'** be the moving frame of reference, which is the glass block itself.

However, many of them incorrectly map their correct result to the wrong letter option (B, C, or D), likely due to an internal scrambling of the options.\n*   Answer 1 provides an excellent independent verification by testing the options against two physical constraints:\n    1.  If `n=1` (vacuum), the speed must be `1`. Only options A and D satisfy this.\n    2.  If `v=0` (stationary glass), the speed must be `1/n`. Only option A satisfies this (`1/n`), while D gives `1`.\n*   This constraint-based method also uniquely identifies A as the correct answer.\n\nBased on the rigorous derivation and the process of elimination, the correct formula is conclusively determined.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nThis problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula to determine the speed of light in a moving medium as seen by a stationary observer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **S Frame:** The stationary laboratory frame where the observer is located.\n    *   **S' Frame:** The moving frame of reference, which is the glass block.

    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula, a cornerstone of Einstein's special theory of relativity. The classical (Galilean) addition of velocities is not applicable here because the speed of light is involved.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principle:** The question asks for the speed of light as measured by a stationary observer while the light travels through a moving medium. This requires the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\n2.  **Define Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Frame S:** The stationary laboratory frame where the observer is at rest.\n    *   **Frame S':** The moving frame of reference, which is the glass block. This frame moves at a constant velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame S.\n\n3.  **Define the Velocities:**\n    *   **`v`**: The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S).\n    *   **`u'`**: The velocity of the light beam as measured *within the rest frame of the glass* (frame S'). By the definition of the index of refraction `n`, the speed of light in a medium is `c/n`. Since the problem sets the speed of light in a vacuum `c=1`, the speed of light relative to the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   **`u`**: The velocity of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory (frame S). This is the value we need to find.\n\n4.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    Since the light beam and the glass are moving in the same direction, the formula for adding the velocities `u'` and `v` is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n5.  **Substitute Known Values and Simplify:**\n    We substitute `u' = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the formula:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n    This simplifies to a complex fraction:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\n    To eliminate the nested fractions, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n/n + n*v) / (n*1 + n*v/n)`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the Given Options:**\n    The derived formula for the speed of light as seen by the observer is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`. Comparing this with the options provided in the question:\n    *   A) 1\n    *   B) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n    *   C) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    *   D) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n\n    The result exactly matches option **B**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Relativistic vs. Classical Formula:** It is crucial to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The classical Galilean addition (`u = u' + v = 1/n + v`) would be incorrect.\n*   **Correct Identification of `u'`:** A common mistake is to misunderstand what `u'` represents. It is the speed of light *in the rest frame of the medium* (`c/n`), not the final observed speed.\n*   **Direction of Motion:** The problem states the glass and the beam move in the same direction, which is why `u'` and `v` are added in the numerator of the formula. If they were in opposite directions, one would be subtracted.\n*   **Algebraic Simplification:** The simplification of the complex fraction `(1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)` by multiplying the numerator and denominator by `n` is a key step that must be performed carefully.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** The provided candidate answers show a near-unanimous consensus on the derivation of the formula `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`. However, their final letter choices (A, B, C, D) are inconsistent. This strongly suggests that the options were presented in a different, randomized order to each agent. Therefore, one must trust the derived formula and carefully match it to the original list of options, rather than relying on the final letter choice of any single agent.\n*   **Verification with Limiting Cases:** A powerful way to check the final formula is to test it against known physical limits:\n    *   **Vacuum Case (`n=1`):** The speed of light must be `c=1`. Our formula gives `u = (1 + 1*v) / (1 + v) = 1`. This is correct.\n    *   **Stationary Medium Case (`v=0`):** The speed of light should be `c/n = 1/n`. Our formula gives `u = (1 + n*0) / (n + 0) = 1/n`. This is also correct.\n    Only the formula `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)` passes both tests.\n\n<<<B>>>"

For instance, Answers 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 15 all perform the correct derivation but select the wrong letter. This appears to be a systematic error in their final step, possibly due to a misinterpretation of the option labels.\n*   **Correct Final Answer:** Answers 1, 4, and 5 not only perform the correct derivation (or use logical constraints that lead to the same result) but also correctly map the result `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)` to option A.\n*   **Physical Constraints (as in Answer 1):** A good way to double-check the result is to test it with limiting cases:\n    *   **Vacuum (n=1):** The speed of light should be `c=1`.

The formula gives `u = (1 + n*0) / (n + 0) = 1/n`. This is also correct.\n    Both constraints validate that the formula `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)` is the correct one.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct physical formula, derived from the principles of special relativity, is `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`. This expression matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis is a classic problem in special relativity, often demonstrated by the Fizeau experiment. To solve it, we must use the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the careful points needed for an accurate solution.\n\n**1. Identify the Frames of Reference**\n*   **Frame S:** The stationary laboratory frame, where the observer is at rest.\n*   **Frame S':** The moving frame of reference, which is the glass block itself. This frame moves at a velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame S.\n\n**2. Identify the Velocities**\n*   **`v`**: The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S). The problem states the glass and the light beam move in the same direction.\n*   **`u'`**: The velocity of the light beam as measured within its own medium, i.e., relative to the glass (frame S'). The speed of light in a medium with a refractive index `n` is `c/n`. Since the problem specifies that the speed of light in a vacuum `c=1`, the speed of light relative to the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n*   **`u`**: The velocity of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory (frame S). This is the value we need to find.\n\n**3. Apply the Correct Physical Law: Relativistic Velocity Addition**\nSince the problem involves the speed of light and moving reference frames, we cannot use the simple Galilean addition of velocities (`u = u' + v`). We must use Einstein's relativistic velocity addition formula. For two velocities `u'` and `v` in the same direction, the formula is:\n`u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n**4. Substitute the Known Values**\nWe substitute our specific values into the formula:\n*   `u' = 1/n`\n*   `v = v`\n*   `c = 1`\n\nThis gives:\n`u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n**5. Perform Careful Algebraic Simplification**\nThe expression can be simplified:\n`u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\nTo eliminate the fractions in the numerator and denominator, we multiply both by `n`:\n`u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n\nDistributing the `n` in the numerator and denominator gives:\n*   Numerator: `n * (1/n) + n * v = 1 + n*v`\n*   Denominator: `n * 1 + n * (v/n) = n + v`\n\nSo, the final simplified expression is:\n`u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n**6. Compare the Result with the Given Options**\nWe now compare our derived formula with the options provided in the question:\nA) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\nB) 1\nC) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\nD) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n\nOur result, `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`, exactly matches option A.\n\n**7. Sanity Check with Limiting Cases**\n*   **If the medium is a vacuum (n=1):** The speed should be `c=1` for any observer. Our formula gives `u = (1 + 1*v) / (1 + v) = (1+v)/(1+v) = 1`. This is correct.\n*   **If the medium is stationary (v=0):** The speed should be the standard speed in the medium, `c/n = 1/n`. Our formula gives `u = (1 + n*0) / (n + 0) = 1/n`. This is also correct.\n\nThe analysis of the candidate answers shows that while most correctly derived the formula `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`, many failed to map it to the correct letter from the original question's list, likely due to randomized option ordering during their generation. The correct derivation and direct comparison confirm that A is the right choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThis problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula, a key concept from Einstein's theory of special relativity.

The speed of light in a medium with a refractive index `n` is `c/n`. The problem states `c=1`, so the speed of light *in the rest frame of the glass* is `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   **`u`**: The velocity of the light beam relative to the lab (frame S). This is the value we need to find.\n\n4.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:**\n    The formula for adding two velocities (`u'` and `v`) that are in the same direction is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n5.  **Substitute the Known Values:**\n    Substitute `u' = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the formula:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n6.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n    To simplify this complex fraction, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n    *   Numerator: `n * (1/n + v) = 1 + n*v`\n    *   Denominator: `n * (1 + v/n) = n + v`\n    This gives the final simplified expression:\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n### Analysis of Candidate Answers and Careful Points\n\n*   **Correct Derivation:** The overwhelming majority of the provided answers (Answers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15) correctly derive the formula `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`. This shows a strong consensus on the physical principles and mathematical steps.\n*   **Mapping Error:** A very common mistake among the candidates was incorrectly mapping the derived formula to the lettered options. For example, Answers 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 15 all derive the correct formula but select the wrong letter (B, C, or D). This is likely because the options were presented to them in a different order.\n*   **Correct Derivation and Mapping:** Answers 1, 4, and 5 not only perform the derivation correctly but also correctly identify that the formula `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)` corresponds to option A from the original question.\n*   **Verification by Limiting Cases (from Answer 1):** This is a powerful way to check the answer.\n    1.  If the medium is a vacuum (`n=1`), the speed should be `c=1`.\n        `(1 + 1*v) / (1 + v) = (1+v)/(1+v) = 1`. This works.\n    2.  If the medium is stationary (`v=0`), the speed should be `c/n = 1/n`.\n        `(1 + n*0) / (n + 0) = 1/n`. This also works.\n    Only option A satisfies both of these fundamental physical constraints.\n\nBased on the correct derivation, which is confirmed by the majority of the agents and verified by checking limiting cases, the correct expression is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a self-debate to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Proposer:** The problem requires us to find the speed of light in a moving medium relative to a stationary observer. This is a classic application of Einstein's special theory of relativity. The correct approach is to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\n1.  **Identify Frames and Velocities:**\n    *   The laboratory is the stationary frame (S).\n    *   The glass is the moving frame (S'), moving at velocity `v` relative to S.\n    *   The speed of light in the rest frame of the glass (S') is `u' = c/n`. Since `c=1`, we have `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   The glass and the light beam move in the same direction.\n\n2.  **Apply the Formula:** The relativistic velocity addition formula for co-linear motion is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'*v / c^2)`\n\n3.  **Substitute and Solve:** Substituting `u' = 1/n` and `c = 1`:\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v)`\n    To simplify, multiply the numerator and denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** This derived formula, `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`, matches option B in the question's list.\n\n**Skeptic:** The derivation seems correct, but a large number of the provided candidate answers, while arriving at the same formula, assign it to different letters (A, C, D). This indicates a high chance of confusion. I must rigorously check the derived formula using physical constraints to ensure it is correct before committing to an answer.\n\n1.  **Failure Mode Analysis:**\n    *   **Incorrect Formula:** Was the right velocity addition formula used? Yes, `(u' + v) / (1 + u'v/c^2)` is the standard formula for velocities in the same direction.\n    *   **Algebraic Error:** Is the simplification `(1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)` to `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)` correct? Yes, multiplying the numerator and denominator by `n` is a valid step and yields the correct result.\n    *   **Misinterpretation:** The problem states the glass and beam move in the same direction, so using positive signs for both `u'` and `v` is correct.\n\n2.  **Constraint Checking (Sanity Check):**\n    *   **Constraint 1: Vacuum Case.** If the medium is a vacuum, then `n=1`. The speed of light observed in the lab should be `c=1`, regardless of the velocity `v`.\n        *   Let's test the derived formula: `u = (1 + 1*v) / (1 + v) = (1+v)/(1+v) = 1`. This constraint is satisfied.\n    *   **Constraint 2: Stationary Medium Case.** If the glass is not moving, then `v=0`. The speed of light in the glass should simply be `c/n = 1/n`.\n        *   Let's test the derived formula: `u = (1 + n*0) / (n + 0) = 1/n`. This constraint is also satisfied.\n\n**Decision:** The debate converges. The derivation is sound, and the resulting formula withstands scrutiny from physical limit-case constraints. The confusion in the candidate answers is due to inconsistent labeling of the options, not a flaw in the physics. The correct formula is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`.\n\n***\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principle:** The problem involves adding velocities where at least one is relativistic (close to the speed of light). Therefore, the Galilean addition of velocities (`u = v + u'`) is incorrect. The correct tool is the Einstein (relativistic) velocity addition formula.\n\n2.  **Define Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **S (Laboratory Frame):** The frame of the stationary observer.\n    *   **S' (Glass Frame):** The frame moving with the glass at a velocity `v` relative to the laboratory.\n\n3.  **Define Velocities:**\n    *   `v`: The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the lab (frame S).\n    *   `u'`: The velocity of the light beam relative to the glass (frame S'). By the definition of the index of refraction, `n = c/u'`, so `u' = c/n`.\n    *   `c`: The speed of light in a vacuum. The problem states to set `c=1`.\n    *   Therefore, `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   `u`: The velocity of the light beam relative to the lab (frame S), which is the quantity we need to find.\n\n4.  **Apply the Relativistic Velocity Addition Formula:** For velocities `u'` and `v` in the same direction, the formula is:\n    `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n5.  **Substitute Values:** Substitute `u' = 1/n` and `c = 1` into the formula:\n    `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n6.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    `u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n    To remove the nested fractions, multiply the entire numerator and the entire denominator by `n`:\n    `u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    `u = (n/n + n*v) / (n*1 + n*v/n)`\n    `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** The final derived expression is `(1 + n*v) / (n + v)`. This matches option B from the question's list. The majority of the provided answers correctly derive this formula, even if they subsequently map it to the wrong letter. The physical reasoning is consistent.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
