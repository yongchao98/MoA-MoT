Based on a systematic analysis of the problem and the provided candidate answers, here is a step-by-step derivation of the correct solution.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

The problem requires finding the energies of the three lowest-energy states (ground, first excited, second excited) for a system of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite potential well.

**Careful Point 1: Particle Type and Governing Principle**
The particles are specified as "spin-1/2", which means they are **fermions**. This is the most critical piece of information, as it dictates that the system must obey the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**.

**Careful Point 2: Pauli Exclusion Principle and State Occupancy**
The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. For this system, a quantum state is defined by two quantum numbers:
1.  The principal quantum number `n` (which determines the energy level).
2.  The spin magnetic quantum number `m_s` (which can be spin-up or spin-down).
Therefore, each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of **two** particles.

**Careful Point 3: Single-Particle Energy Levels**
The energy for a single particle in a 1D infinite potential well is given by $E_n = n^2 \\frac{\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. The problem defines the base energy unit as $E = \\frac{\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$, so the single-particle energy levels are:
*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = E$
*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$
*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$
*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$
*   and so on.

### Calculation of System Energies

**1. Ground State Energy ($E_{ground}$)**
To find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four fermions, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.
*   Place two particles in the `n=1` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times E = 2E$.
*   Place the remaining two particles in the `n=2` level. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.
*   The total ground state energy is the sum: $E_{ground} = 2E + 8E = \\bf{10E}$.

**2. First Excited State Energy ($E_{1st}$)**
The first excited state is the configuration with the lowest energy *above* the ground state. This is achieved by making the "cheapest" possible promotion of a single particle from the highest occupied level (`n=2`) to the lowest unoccupied level (`n=3`).
*   The new configuration is: two particles in `n=1`, one particle in `n=2`, and one particle in `n=3`.
*   The total energy is the sum: $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = (2 \\times E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = \\bf{15E}$.

**3. Second Excited State Energy ($E_{2nd}$)**
The second excited state is the configuration with the next-lowest energy. We must compare the energies of different possible excitations from the ground state to find the third-lowest total energy.
*   **Possibility A (n=1 → n=3):** Promote one particle from `n=1` to `n=3`. The configuration becomes: one particle in `n=1`, two in `n=2`, and one in `n=3`.
    *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = E + 8E + 9E = \\bf{18E}$.
*   **Possibility B (double promotion, n=2,n=2 → n=3,n=3):** Promote both particles from `n=2` to `n=3`. The configuration becomes: two particles in `n=1` and two in `n=3`.
    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.
*   **Possibility C (n=2 → n=4):** Promote one particle from `n=2` to `n=4`. The configuration becomes: two particles in `n=1`, one in `n=2`, and one in `n=4`.
    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.

**Careful Point 4: Identifying the Correct State**
Comparing the total energies of the possible states (Ground: 10E, First Excited: 15E, Possibility A: 18E, Possibility B: 20E, etc.), the third-lowest energy is 18E. Therefore, the energy of the second excited state is **18E**.

### Conclusion

The calculated energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are **10E, 15E, and 18E**, respectively. This sequence matches option C.

A review of the candidate answers shows that while nearly all of them performed the physics calculation correctly to arrive at (10E, 15E, 18E), most made a simple error in matching this result to the correct letter option.
