For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the total mass (M_total = m₁ + m₂) is related to the orbital period (P), the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities of the two stars (K₁ and K₂), and the inclination of the orbit (i). The governing equation, derived from Kepler's Third Law, is:\n    M_total = (P / (2 * π * G)) * ((K₁ + K₂)³ / sin³(i))\n    where G is the gravitational constant.\n\n2.  **Incorporate Key Information:** The problem states that both systems are \"eclipsing\". This is crucial because an eclipse can only happen if our line of sight is very close to the plane of the orbit. This means the inclination angle, `i`, is approximately 90°. For an inclination `i ≈ 90°`, `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and therefore `sin³(i) ≈ 1`. This allows for a significant simplification of the formula.\n\n3.  **Establish a Proportionality for the Mass Ratio:** We need to find the ratio of the mass of system 1 (M₁) to the mass of system 2 (M₂). The constant terms `(1 / (2 * π * G))` and the `sin³(i)` term (which is ≈ 1 for both) will cancel out in the ratio. This leaves a direct proportionality:\n    M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³\n\n    The ratio can thus be written as:\n    M₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K₁ₐ + K₁ₑ)³] / [P₂ * (K₂ₐ + K₂ₑ)³]\n\n4.  **Extract Data and Calculate Intermediate Values:**\n    *   **For system_1:**\n        *   Period (P₁) = 2 years\n        *   Sum of RV amplitudes (K_total₁) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   **For system_2:**\n        *   Period (P₂) = 1 year\n        *   Sum of RV amplitudes (K_total₂) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:** Substitute the values into the proportionality equation.

For a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the total mass (`M_total = m1 + m2`) is related to the orbital period (`P`), the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (`K1`, `K2`), and the orbital inclination (`i`) by the formula:\n    `M_total = (P / (2 * π * G)) * (K1 + K2)³ / sin³(i)`\n    where `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n2.  **Utilize Key Information:** The problem states that both systems are \"eclipsing.\" This is a critical piece of information. For eclipses to occur, the orbit must be viewed nearly edge-on, meaning the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°. When `i` ≈ 90°, `sin(i)` ≈ 1, and therefore `sin³(i)` ≈ 1. This assumption simplifies the formula for both systems.\n\n3.  **Establish Proportionality:** Since we are calculating a ratio of two masses, the constant term `1 / (2 * π * G)` will cancel out. With `sin³(i) ≈ 1`, the mass of a system becomes directly proportional to its period multiplied by the cube of the sum of its velocity amplitudes:\n    `M_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³`\n\n4.  **Gather Data for Each System:**\n    *   **System 1:**\n        *   Period `P1` = 2 years\n        *   Sum of RV amplitudes `K1_total` = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n    *   **System 2:**\n        *   Period `P2` = 1 year\n        *   Sum of RV amplitudes `K2_total` = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n5.  **Calculate the Mass Ratio:** We need to find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, which is the ratio `M1 / M2`.\n    `M1 / M2 = [P1 * (K1_total)³] / [P2 * (K2_total)³]`\n\n    Substitute the values:\n    `M1 / M2 = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]`\n    `M1 / M2 = 2 * (15/25)³`\n    `M1 / M2 = 2 * (3/5)³`\n    `M1 / M2 = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n    `M1 / M2 = 54 / 125`\n    `M1 / M2 = 0.432`\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated ratio is `0.432`.

This is crucial information, as it means the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90 degrees. For `i ≈ 90°`, `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and therefore `sin³(i) ≈ 1`. This allows us to simplify the analysis.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Mass Ratio:** When we calculate the ratio `M₁ / M₂`, the constant term `1 / (2πG)` cancels out. Since `sin³(i)` is approximately 1 for both systems, it also cancels out. The ratio simplifies to:\n    `M₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K₁ₐ + K₁ᵦ)³] / [P₂ * (K₂ₐ + K₂ᵦ)³]`\n\n5.  **Extract Data and Substitute:**\n    *   **For system_1:**\n        *   `P₁ = 2` years\n        *   `K₁_total = K₁ₐ + K₁ᵦ = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s`\n    *   **For system_2:**\n        *   `P₂ = 1` year\n        *   `K₂_total = K₂ₐ + K₂ᵦ = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s`\n\n    Substitute these values into the ratio formula:\n    `M₁ / M₂ = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Result:**\n    *   `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (15/25)³`\n    *   Simplify the fraction: `15/25 = 3/5`\n    *   `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3/5)³`\n    *   `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n    *   `M₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125`\n    *   `M₁ / M₂ = 0.432`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated factor is `0.432`.

Use the \"Eclipsing\" Information**\n\nThe problem states that both systems are \"eclipsing.\" This is crucial information because an eclipse can only happen if we view the orbital plane almost perfectly edge-on. This means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°.\n*   When `i ≈ 90°`, `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and therefore `sin³(i) ≈ 1`.\n\nThis simplifies the relationship to a direct proportionality, as the term `1 / (2 * π * G)` is a constant that will cancel out when we take a ratio:\n\n`M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³`\n\n**3.

The key physical principle is Kepler's Third Law as applied to double-lined spectroscopic binaries. The formula for the total mass (`M_total = m₁ + m₂`) is:\n    `M_total = (P * (K₁ + K₂)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))`\n    where `P` is the orbital period, `K₁` and `K₂` are the radial velocity amplitudes, `G` is the gravitational constant, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n2.  **Use the Simplifying Condition:** A critical piece of information provided is that both systems are \"eclipsing.\" This implies that the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°, so `sin(i) ≈ 1` and `sin³(i) ≈ 1`. This allows us to ignore the `sin³(i)` term.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** To find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need the ratio `M₁ / M₂`. When forming this ratio, the constant term `1 / (2 * π * G)` cancels out. This leaves a direct proportionality:\n    `M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³`\n    The ratio is therefore:\n    `M₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K₁a + K₁b)³] / [P₂ * (K₂a + K₂b)³]`\n\n4.  **Substitute Values and Calculate:**\n    *   **For system_1:** `P₁ = 2` years. The sum of velocities is `K₁_total = 10 + 5 = 15` km/s.\n    *   **For system_2:** `P₂ = 1` year. The sum of velocities is `K₂_total = 15 + 10 = 25` km/s.\n\n    Plugging these into the ratio formula:\n    `M₁ / M₂ = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (15 / 25)³`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3 / 5)³`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 0.432`\n\n5.  **Conclusion from Candidates:** Almost all candidate answers correctly follow this exact line of reasoning and arrive at the same numerical result of `0.432`.

This means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°. For an angle of 90°, `sin(i) = 1`, and therefore `sin³(i) = 1`. This allows us to simplify the mass relationship.\n\n**4. Establish the Mass Proportionality**\nSince `G` is a constant and `sin³(i)` is approximately 1 for both systems, these terms (along with `2π`) will cancel out when we take a ratio. This leaves us with a direct proportionality:\nM_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³\n\n**5. Gather Data and Calculate Intermediate Values**\nLet's extract the data for each system and calculate the sum of the velocity amplitudes.\n*   **System 1:**\n    *   Period (P1) = 2 years\n    *   Sum of RV amplitudes (K1_total) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n*   **System 2:**\n    *   Period (P2) = 1 year\n    *   Sum of RV amplitudes (K2_total) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n**6.

Use the \"Eclipsing\" Information**\n\nThe problem states that both systems are \"eclipsing.\" This is crucial information because an eclipse can only happen if we view the orbital plane almost perfectly edge-on. This means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°.\n*   When `i ≈ 90°`, `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and therefore `sin³(i) ≈ 1`.\n\nThis simplifies the relationship to a direct proportionality, as the term `1 / (2 * π * G)` is a constant that will cancel out when we take a ratio:\n\n`M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³`\n\n**3. Collate the Data for Each System**\n\n*   **System 1:**\n    *   Period `P₁` = 2 years\n    *   Sum of velocity amplitudes `K₁_total` = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n*   **System 2:**\n    *   Period `P₂` = 1 year\n    *   Sum of velocity amplitudes `K₂_total` = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n**4. Calculate the Mass Ratio**\n\nWe need to find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, which is the ratio `M₁ / M₂`.\n\n`M₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K₁_total)³] / [P₂ * (K₂_total)³]`\n\nNow, substitute the values:\n\n`M₁ / M₂ = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]`\n`M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (15/25)³`\n`M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3/5)³`\n`M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n`M₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125`\n`M₁ / M₂ = 0.432`\n\n**5.

Let's compare this to the provided options:\n*   A) ~ 0.4\n*   B) ~ 0.6\n*   C) ~ 0.7\n*   D) ~ 1.2\n\nThe value 0.432 is closest to 0.4.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n**Analysis of the Problem and Candidate Answers**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The problem requires calculating the mass ratio of two binary star systems using observational data. The key physical principle is Kepler's Third Law as applied to double-lined spectroscopic binaries. The formula for the total mass (`M_total = m₁ + m₂`) is:\n    `M_total = (P * (K₁ + K₂)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))`\n    where `P` is the orbital period, `K₁` and `K₂` are the radial velocity amplitudes, `G` is the gravitational constant, and `i` is the orbital inclination.\n\n2.  **Use the Simplifying Condition:** A critical piece of information provided is that both systems are \"eclipsing.\" This implies that the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°, so `sin(i) ≈ 1` and `sin³(i) ≈ 1`. This allows us to ignore the `sin³(i)` term.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** To find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need the ratio `M₁ / M₂`. When forming this ratio, the constant term `1 / (2 * π * G)` cancels out. This leaves a direct proportionality:\n    `M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂)³`\n    The ratio is therefore:\n    `M₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K₁a + K₁b)³] / [P₂ * (K₂a + K₂b)³]`\n\n4.  **Substitute Values and Calculate:**\n    *   **For system_1:** `P₁ = 2` years. The sum of velocities is `K₁_total = 10 + 5 = 15` km/s.\n    *   **For system_2:** `P₂ = 1` year. The sum of velocities is `K₂_total = 15 + 10 = 25` km/s.\n\n    Plugging these into the ratio formula:\n    `M₁ / M₂ = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (15 / 25)³`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3 / 5)³`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125`\n    `M₁ / M₂ = 0.432`\n\n5.  **Conclusion from Candidates:** Almost all candidate answers correctly follow this exact line of reasoning and arrive at the same numerical result of `0.432`. The discrepancies in the final chosen letter (A, B, C, or D) are due to inconsistencies in the option lists provided to those agents. The core calculation is robustly confirmed.\n\n6.  **Final Decision:** The calculated factor is `0.432`. Comparing this to the provided options in the question:\n    A) ~ 1.2\n    B) ~ 0.4\n    C) ~ 0.7\n    D) ~ 0.6\n\nThe value `0.432` is closest to `0.4`.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the factor by which the total mass of system_1 is greater than the total mass of system_2. This means we need to calculate the ratio M_system1 / M_system2.\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Physical Principle**\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (M_total = m1 + m2) is related to the orbital period (P) and the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocities (K1 and K2) by a formula derived from Kepler's Third Law:\nM_total = (1 / (2πG)) * [ P * (K1 + K2)³ / sin³(i) ]\nwhere:\n*   `P` is the orbital period.\n*   `K1` and `K2` are the radial velocity amplitudes.\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.\n\n**3. Apply the Simplifying Condition**\nThe problem states that both systems are **eclipsing**. This is crucial information because eclipses only happen when we view the system's orbit nearly edge-on. This means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°. For an angle of 90°, `sin(i) = 1`, and therefore `sin³(i) = 1`. This allows us to simplify the mass relationship.\n\n**4. Establish the Mass Proportionality**\nSince `G` is a constant and `sin³(i)` is approximately 1 for both systems, these terms (along with `2π`) will cancel out when we take a ratio. This leaves us with a direct proportionality:\nM_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³\n\n**5. Gather Data and Calculate Intermediate Values**\nLet's extract the data for each system and calculate the sum of the velocity amplitudes.\n*   **System 1:**\n    *   Period (P1) = 2 years\n    *   Sum of RV amplitudes (K1_total) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n*   **System 2:**\n    *   Period (P2) = 1 year\n    *   Sum of RV amplitudes (K2_total) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Ratio**\nNow, we can compute the ratio of the masses using the proportionality we established:\nM_system1 / M_system2 = [P1 * (K1_total)³] / [P2 * (K2_total)³]\n\nSubstitute the values:\nM_system1 / M_system2 = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\nM_system1 / M_system2 = 2 * (15/25)³\nM_system1 / M_system2 = 2 * (3/5)³\nM_system1 / M_system2 = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM_system1 / M_system2 = 54 / 125\nM_system1 / M_system2 = 0.432\n\n**7.

Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for a factor, which is a ratio. Specifically, we need to find the ratio of the total mass of system_1 to the total mass of system_2 (`M_system1 / M_system2`).\n\n**2. Identify the Core Physics**\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, the total mass (`M_total = m1 + m2`) is related to its orbital period (`P`) and the radial velocity semi-amplitudes of its components (`K1` and `K2`). The governing equation, derived from Kepler's Third Law, is:\n\n`M_total = (P * (K1 + K2)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))`\n\nWhere:\n*   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n*   `i` is the orbital inclination (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n\n**3. Use Key Information to Simplify**\nThe problem states that both systems are **eclipsing**. This is a critical detail. Eclipses can only be observed if the orbit is viewed nearly edge-on. This means the inclination angle `i` is very close to 90°.\n*   If `i` ≈ 90°, then `sin(i)` ≈ 1, and consequently `sin³(i)` ≈ 1.\n*   The term `(1 / (2 * π * G))` is a constant that will appear in the mass calculation for both systems.\n\nSince we are calculating a ratio (`M_system1 / M_system2`), these constant terms (`1 / (2 * π * G)`) and the `sin³(i)` terms (which are both ≈1) will cancel out. This leaves a simple proportionality:\n\n`M_total ∝ P * (K1 + K2)³`\n\n**4. Extract Data and Perform the Calculation**\n\nFirst, let's gather the data provided in the question:\n\n*   **System 1:**\n    *   Period `P1` = 2 years\n    *   Sum of RV amplitudes `K1_total` = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n*   **System 2:**\n    *   Period `P2` = 1 year\n    *   Sum of RV amplitudes `K2_total` = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\nNow, we set up the ratio using the proportionality:\n\n`M_system1 / M_system2 = [P1 * (K1_total)³] / [P2 * (K2_total)³]`\n\nSubstitute the values:\n\n`Ratio = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]`\n`Ratio = 2 * (15/25)³`\n`Ratio = 2 * (3/5)³`\n`Ratio = 2 * (27 / 125)`\n`Ratio = 54 / 125`\n`Ratio = 0.432`\n\n**5.

Understand the Underlying Physics**\nThe question requires us to compare the total mass of two binary star systems. The mass of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system can be found using a form of Kepler's Third Law. The formula that relates the total mass (M_total = m₁ + m₂), the orbital period (P), the radial velocity amplitudes (K₁ and K₂), and the orbital inclination (i) is:\n\nM_total = (P / (2πG)) * (K₁ + K₂)³ / sin³(i)\n\nWhere `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n### **2. Incorporate Key Information**\nA critical piece of information given is that both systems are **eclipsing**. For an eclipse to be observed from Earth, the inclination `i` of the orbital plane must be very close to 90° (meaning we are viewing the system edge-on).\n\nIf `i ≈ 90°`, then `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and consequently `sin³(i) ≈ 1`. This simplifies the mass formula significantly. Since we are asked to find a ratio between the masses of two such systems, the constant term `1 / (2πG)` will be the same for both and will cancel out.\n\nThis leaves us with a direct proportionality:\n\n**M_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂ )³**\n\n### **3. Extract Data and Calculate Values for Each System**\nWe can now apply this proportionality to the data given for each system.\n\n**System 1:**\n*   Period (P₁): 2 years\n*   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K_total₁): 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n*   Proportional Mass (M₁): M₁ ∝ 2 * (15)³\n\n**System 2:**\n*   Period (P₂): 1 year\n*   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K_total₂): 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n*   Proportional Mass (M₂): M₂ ∝ 1 * (25)³\n\n### **4. Calculate the Final Ratio**\nThe question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, which is the ratio M₁ / M₂.\n\nM₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K_total₁)³] / [P₂ * (K_total₂)³]\nM₁ / M₂ = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\nM₁ / M₂ = (2 * 3375) / (15625)\nM₁ / M₂ = 6750 / 15625\nM₁ / M₂ = 0.432\n\n### **5.

Therefore, option A is the correct answer. The analysis of the candidate answers shows that while most arrived at the correct numerical result (0.432), there was confusion in matching it to the correct letter option due to inconsistent option lists. Based on the options in the main problem description, 0.432 matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nAn analysis of the candidate answers reveals a strong consensus on the calculation method, even if the final letter chosen varies. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the correct approach to solve the problem.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Underlying Physics**\n\nThe total mass (M_total) of a double-lined spectroscopic binary system is related to its orbital period (P) and the radial velocity semi-amplitudes of its component stars (K₁ and K₂) through Kepler's Third Law. The formula is:\n\nM_total = m₁ + m₂ = (P * (K₁ + K₂)³) / (2 * π * G * sin³(i))\n\nWhere `G` is the gravitational constant and `i` is the inclination of the orbital plane to our line of sight.\n\n### **Step 2: Apply the Simplifying Condition**\n\nThe problem states that both systems are **eclipsing**. This is critical information because eclipses only happen when we view the orbit almost perfectly edge-on. This means the inclination angle `i` is approximately 90°.\n\nFor `i ≈ 90°`, `sin(i) ≈ 1`, and therefore `sin³(i) ≈ 1`.\n\nThis simplifies the mass relationship significantly. Since we are comparing two systems, the constant term `1 / (2 * π * G)` will cancel out, leaving us with a direct proportionality:\n\nM_total ∝ P * (K₁ + K₂ )³\n\n### **Step 3: Extract Data and Calculate Values for Each System**\n\n**For System 1:**\n*   Period (P₁): 2 years\n*   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K₁_total): 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n\n**For System 2:**\n*   Period (P₂): 1 year\n*   Sum of velocity amplitudes (K₂_total): 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Mass Ratio**\n\nThe question asks for the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, which is the ratio M₁ / M₂.\n\nM₁ / M₂ = [P₁ * (K₁_total)³] / [P₂ * (K₂_total)³]\n\nSubstitute the values:\n\nM₁ / M₂ = [2 * (15)³] / [1 * (25)³]\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (15/25)³\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (3/5)³\nM₁ / M₂ = 2 * (27 / 125)\nM₁ / M₂ = 54 / 125\nM₁ / M₂ = 0.432\n\n### **Step 5: Compare the Result to the Options**\n\nThe calculated ratio is 0.432.
