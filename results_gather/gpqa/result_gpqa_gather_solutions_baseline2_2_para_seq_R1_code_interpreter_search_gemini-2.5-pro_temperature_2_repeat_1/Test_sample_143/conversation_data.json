Here is a definitive step-by-step breakdown.\n\n### 1. Key Physical Principles\n\nTo find the mean decay distance of a relativistic particle, we need to combine three core concepts:\n1.  **Mean Lifetime and Decay Width**: The lifetime of a particle in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime, $\\tau_0$) is inversely proportional to its decay width ($\\Gamma$) via the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n    $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n2.  **Relativistic Time Dilation**: Because the particle is moving at a high velocity, its lifetime as measured in the laboratory frame ($\\tau_{\\text{lab}}$) will be longer than its proper lifetime. The two are related by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n    $\\tau_{\\text{lab}} = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n3.  **Distance Calculation**: The mean distance the particle travels in the lab is its velocity ($v$) multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime:\n    $d = v \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{lab}}$.\n\n### 2. Deriving the Calculation Formula\n\nCombining these principles leads to a practical formula for calculation.\n1.  Substitute the lifetime expressions into the distance formula:\n    $d = v \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0) = v \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n2.  It is convenient to work with the term $\\hbar c$ (Planck's constant times the speed of light) and the velocity ratio $\\beta = v/c$. The formula becomes:\n    $d = (\\gamma \\beta) \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n3.  The kinematic term $\\gamma\\beta$ can be calculated directly from the particle's energy and mass without needing to find $v$ and $\\gamma$ separately. Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$, and the definition of momentum, $pc = \\gamma\\beta (m c^2)$:\n    $\\gamma\\beta = \\frac{pc}{m c^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (m c^2)^2}}{m c^2}$\n4.  The final, most direct formula for the mean decay distance is:\n    $d = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (m c^2)^2}}{m c^2} \\right) \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n\n### 3.

This is a standard problem in particle physics that combines concepts from special relativity and quantum mechanics.\n\n**Step-by-step Derivation:**\n\n1.  **Proper Lifetime ($\\tau_0$)**: The mean lifetime of a particle in its own rest frame (proper lifetime) is inversely proportional to its decay width ($\\Gamma_X$), a relationship derived from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle ($\\Delta E \\Delta t \\ge \\hbar/2$). The formula is:\n    $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n2.  **Lifetime in Lab Frame ($\\tau_{lab}$)**: Due to relativistic time dilation, the lifetime of the particle as observed in the laboratory frame (where it is moving with a high velocity) is longer than its proper lifetime. The relationship is given by:\n    $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0 = \\gamma \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Mean Decay Distance ($L$)**: The mean distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying is its velocity ($v$) multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime:\n    $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab} = v \\cdot \\gamma \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n4.  **Practical Calculation Formula**: The expression can be simplified for calculation. We can write $v = \\beta c$, where $\\beta$ is the speed as a fraction of the speed of light, $c$. The formula becomes $L = (\\beta \\gamma) \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$. The term $\\beta\\gamma$ can be calculated directly from the particle's energy and mass without needing to find $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ separately.\n    *   From the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$, we find the momentum: $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}$.\n    *   The momentum is also related to $\\beta\\gamma$ by $pc = \\beta\\gamma \\cdot mc^2$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\beta\\gamma = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2}$.\n    *   Substituting this back, we get the final formula:\n        $L = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n**Numerical Calculation:**\n\n1.  **Gather and Unify Values**:\n    *   $E_X = 8 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n    *   $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n    *   $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\, \\text{MeV} = 0.320 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n    *   Use the physical constant $\\hbar c \\approx 1.973 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{GeV} \\cdot \\text{m}$\n\n2.  **Calculate the Kinematic Factor ($\\beta\\gamma$)**:\n    *   $\\beta\\gamma = \\frac{\\sqrt{(8.0)^2 - (1.2)^2}}{1.2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{64 - 1.44}}{1.2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{62.56}}{1.2} \\approx \\frac{7.9095}{1.2} \\approx 6.5912$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Distance ($L$)**:\n    *   $L \\approx (6.5912) \\times \\frac{1.973 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{GeV} \\cdot \\text{m}}{0.320 \\, \\text{GeV}}$\n    *   $L \\approx (6.5912) \\times (6.1656 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{m})$\n    *   $L \\approx 4.064 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$\n\n**Conclusion and Comparison with Options:**\n\nThe calculated mean decay distance is approximately $4.064 \\times 10^{-15}$ meters.\n\nLet's compare this to the provided options:\nA) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\nB) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\nC) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\nD) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n\nThe calculated value, $4.064 \\times 10^{-15}$ m, is extremely close to the value in option D, $4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m.

Problem Analysis and Physical Principles**\n\nThe task is to compute the mean decay distance ($L$) of a particle in the laboratory frame. This requires a combination of principles from special relativity and particle physics.\n\n*   **Mean Lifetime and Decay Width:** The intrinsic lifetime of an unstable particle in its own rest frame (proper lifetime, $\\tau_0$) is inversely proportional to its decay width ($\\Gamma$) according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n    $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{lab}}$\n    $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n*   **Relativistic Time Dilation:** A moving particle's lifetime appears longer when measured from a stationary frame (like the laboratory). This is called time dilation, and the lab-frame lifetime ($\\tau_{\\text{lab}}$) is related to the proper lifetime by the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$):\n    $\\tau_{\\text{lab}} = \\gamma \\tau_0 = \\gamma \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n\n*   **Mean Decay Distance:** The mean distance the particle travels before decaying is its velocity ($v$) multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime:\n    $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{lab}} = v \\gamma \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n\n*   **Calculation Simplification:** To avoid calculating velocity and $\\gamma$ separately, we can use a more convenient form. The relativistic momentum $p$ is $p = \\gamma m v$. We can rearrange this to express the product $v\\gamma$ as $v\\gamma = p/m$. It is most convenient to work with quantities in energy units (GeV, MeV) by using $pc$ and $mc^2$:\n    $L = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n\n    The momentum term ($pc$) can be found from the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. This gives:\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}$\n\n*   **Final Formula:** Combining these expressions gives the formula for the mean decay distance:\n    $L = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n\n**2.

Let's break down the problem into clear, sequential steps.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Relevant Physical Principles and Formulas\n\nThe mean decay distance ($L$) is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. In the laboratory frame, this is given by its velocity ($v$) multiplied by its mean lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{\\text{lab}}$):\n$L = v \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{lab}}$\n\nDue to relativistic time dilation, the lifetime measured in the lab is longer than the particle's lifetime in its rest frame (proper lifetime, $\\tau_0$). The relationship is governed by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\tau_{\\text{lab}} = \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0$\n\nThe proper lifetime $\\tau_0$ is fundamentally related to the particle's decay width ($\\Gamma_X$) via the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n$\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nCombining these equations gives us a more complete formula for the decay distance:\n$L = v \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\nFor convenience, we often use the fact that $v = \\beta c$ (where $\\beta$ is the speed as a fraction of the speed of light, $c$). This leads to:\n$L = \\gamma\\beta c \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X} = \\gamma\\beta \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\nThe term $\\gamma\\beta$ can be calculated from the particle's total energy ($E$) and rest mass energy ($mc^2$) using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. The relativistic momentum $pc$ is related to $\\gamma\\beta$ by $pc = \\gamma\\beta \\cdot mc^2$. Therefore, we can find $\\gamma\\beta$:\n$\\gamma\\beta = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2}$\n\nSubstituting this into our formula for $L$, we arrive at the final expression we will use for the calculation:\n$L = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2} \\right) \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n### Step 2: Unify Units and List Values\n\nBefore calculating, we must ensure all energy values are in the same unit.

Analysis of the Physics Principles\n\nThe problem asks for the mean decay distance of a moving particle. This requires combining concepts from special relativity and particle physics.\n\n1.  **Proper Lifetime ($\\tau_0$)**: The lifetime of a particle in its own rest frame is inversely proportional to its decay width ($\\Gamma_X$), a consequence of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n    $$ \\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X} $$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation**: Because the particle is moving at a relativistic speed in the laboratory frame, its lifetime appears longer to a lab observer.

The lab-frame lifetime is $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The mean decay distance is the particle's speed in the lab ($v$) multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime: $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$.\n    *   Combining these gives: $L = v \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot (\\hbar / \\Gamma)$.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Practical Calculation:** It's often more convenient to work with a combined expression.

Identify the Goal and Principles**\n\nThe objective is to calculate the **mean decay distance ($L$)** of the meson X in the laboratory frame. This requires combining principles from special relativity and particle physics.\n\n*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle**: The proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) of a particle in its rest frame is inversely proportional to its decay width ($\\Gamma$). The formula is $\\tau_0 = \\hbar / \\Gamma$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n*   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation)**: A particle moving with a Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ will have its lifetime extended in the lab frame. The lab lifetime is $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n*   **Distance Calculation**: The mean distance traveled is the particle's velocity ($v$) multiplied by its lab lifetime, $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$.\n\n### **2.

Therefore, $\\gamma\\beta = \\frac{pc}{mc^2}$.\n4.  The momentum term $pc$ is found from the energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 \\implies pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}$.\n\nSubstituting this back into the formula for $L$ gives us the final equation for the calculation:\n$L = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n\n### **3.

A supermajority of the candidate answers, despite labeling the options differently, all point to this numerical value as the correct one.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe problem is to determine the mean decay distance of a meson resonance, X.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Relevant Physical Principles\n\n1.  **Mean Lifetime in the Rest Frame ($\\tau$)**: The lifetime of a particle in its own rest frame (proper lifetime) is determined by its decay width ($\\Gamma_X$) via the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n    $\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation**: Due to special relativity, the lifetime observed in the laboratory frame ($T_{lab}$), where the particle is moving, is longer than its proper lifetime. This is described by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n    $T_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau$\n\n3.  **Mean Decay Distance ($L$)**: The average distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying is its velocity ($v$) multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime:\n    $L = v \\cdot T_{lab} = v \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\tau$\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Calculation\n\nTo make the calculation more straightforward using the given quantities, we can express the formula in terms of energy and momentum.\nWe know that $v = \\beta c$, where $\\beta = v/c$. So, the formula for distance becomes:\n$L = c \\beta \\gamma \\tau = (\\beta \\gamma) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\nThe kinematic term $\\beta\\gamma$ can be calculated from the particle's energy and mass. The relativistic momentum $pc$ and total energy $E_X$ are related by:\n$E_X^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2 \\implies pc = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}$\nAlso, we know that $pc = \\beta \\gamma (m_X c^2)$. Therefore:\n$\\beta\\gamma = \\frac{pc}{m_X c^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the formula for $L$, we get the final equation for the calculation:\n$L = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2} \\right) \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n### Step 3: Perform the Calculation\n\nFirst, ensure all units are consistent. Let's use GeV for energy.\n*   $E_X = 8.0 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n*   $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n*   $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\, \\text{MeV} = 0.320 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n*   Physical Constant: $\\hbar c \\approx 1.97327 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{GeV} \\cdot \\text{m}$\n\nNow, plug the values into the formula:\n*   Calculate the kinematic factor, $\\beta\\gamma$:\n    $\\beta\\gamma = \\frac{\\sqrt{(8.0)^2 - (1.2)^2}}{1.2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{64 - 1.44}}{1.2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{62.56}}{1.2} \\approx 6.59124$\n\n*   Calculate the proper decay length, $c\\tau$:\n    $c\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X} = \\frac{1.97327 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{GeV} \\cdot \\text{m}}{0.320 \\, \\text{GeV}} \\approx 6.16647 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{m}$\n\n*   Calculate the mean decay distance, $L$:\n    $L = (\\beta\\gamma) \\cdot (c\\tau) \\approx 6.59124 \\times (6.16647 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{m}) \\approx 4.0645 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$\n\n### Step 4: Compare with Options\n\nThe calculated mean decay distance is approximately $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$.\nLet's compare this to the provided options:\nA) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\nB) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\nC) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\nD) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\n\nThe calculated value of $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$ is extremely close to option A, $4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$. The minor difference (~0.025%) is likely due to small variations in the precision of the physical constant $\\hbar c$ used when creating the problem's options versus the standard value used here. The result clearly indicates that A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Goal\nThe primary objective is to calculate the mean decay distance ($L$) of the meson resonance X in the laboratory reference frame.\n\n### 2. Physical Principles and Formula\nThe correct physical formula to calculate the mean decay distance of a relativistic particle is derived from combining principles of special relativity (time dilation) and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.\n\n*   The proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$), which is the particle's lifetime in its rest frame, is inversely proportional to its decay width ($\\Gamma_X$):\n    $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n*   In the laboratory frame, the particle is moving, and its lifetime appears longer due to time dilation. This lab-frame lifetime ($\\tau_{lab}$) is:\n    $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n    where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = E / (mc^2)$.\n\n*   The mean distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying is its velocity ($v$) multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime:\n    $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab} = v \\gamma \\tau_0 = v \\gamma \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n*   This expression can be simplified by using the quantity $\\hbar c$ and expressing the velocity-dependent term ($v\\gamma$) in terms of momentum ($p$). Since the relativistic momentum $pc = \\gamma \\beta (mc^2)$ (with $\\beta = v/c$), we can write $\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{pc}{mc^2}$. Therefore:\n    $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau_0 = \\left(\\frac{pc}{mc^2}\\right) c \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}\\right) = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n*   Finally, we find the momentum term $pc$ from the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E_X^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2$, which gives $pc = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}$.\n\nThe final, comprehensive formula is:\n$L = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n### 3. Numerical Calculation\nLet's substitute the given values into this formula.\n\n*   **Given values:**\n    *   $E_X = 8.0 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n    *   $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n    *   $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\, \\text{MeV} = 0.320 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n\n*   **Physical constant:**\n    *   $\\hbar c \\approx 1.97327 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{GeV} \\cdot \\text{m}$\n\n*   **Step-by-step calculation:**\n    1.  Calculate the numerator of the first term (the momentum $pc$):\n        $pc = \\sqrt{(8.0)^2 - (1.2)^2} = \\sqrt{64 - 1.44} = \\sqrt{62.56} \\approx 7.9095 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n    2.  Calculate the first term (the kinematic factor $\\gamma\\beta$):\n        $\\frac{pc}{m_X c^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{62.56}}{1.2} \\approx 6.5912$\n    3.  Calculate the second term (the rest-frame decay length $c\\tau_0$):\n        $\\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X} = \\frac{1.97327 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{GeV} \\cdot \\text{m}}{0.320 \\, \\text{GeV}} \\approx 6.1665 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{m}$\n    4.  Multiply the results:\n        $L \\approx (6.5912) \\times (6.1665 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{m}) \\approx 4.0645 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$\n\n### 4. Comparison with Options and Conclusion\nThe calculated value is $L \\approx 4.0645 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$.\nNow, we compare this result with the provided options:\nA) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\nB) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\nC) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\nD) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n\nOur calculated value ($4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m) is extremely close to option D ($4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m). The very small difference (about 0.025%) is well within the expected range for physics problems due to potential minor variations in the precision of constants used to create the question. The other options differ by a larger margin or by an order of magnitude. Therefore, option D is the correct choice. The consensus of the most reliable candidate agents confirms this result.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to determine the mean decay distance of a meson resonance, X, given its total energy, rest mass, and decay width in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics:**\n    *   The mean decay distance ($L$) is the particle's velocity ($v$) multiplied by its lifetime in the lab frame ($t_{\\text{lab}}$): $L = v \\cdot t_{\\text{lab}}$.\n    *   The lifetime in the lab frame is subject to relativistic time dilation.

This gives us the useful term $v \\gamma = p/m$.\n    *   To work entirely in energy units (like GeV), we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$ and $c^2$ to get:\n        $L = \\frac{pc}{m_X c^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    *   The momentum term $pc$ is found using the energy-momentum relation: $E_X^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2$, which gives $pc = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}$.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   **Unify Units:** Ensure all energy-related values are in the same unit.

Key Physical Principles\n\nTo find the mean decay distance of a relativistic particle, we need to combine three core concepts:\n1.  **Mean Lifetime and Decay Width**: The lifetime of a particle in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime, $\\tau_0$) is inversely proportional to its decay width ($\\Gamma$) via the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n    $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n2.  **Relativistic Time Dilation**: Because the particle is moving at a high velocity, its lifetime as measured in the laboratory frame ($\\tau_{\\text{lab}}$) will be longer than its proper lifetime. The two are related by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n    $\\tau_{\\text{lab}} = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n3.  **Distance Calculation**: The mean distance the particle travels in the lab is its velocity ($v$) multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime:\n    $d = v \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{lab}}$.\n\n### 2. Deriving the Calculation Formula\n\nCombining these principles leads to a practical formula for calculation.\n1.  Substitute the lifetime expressions into the distance formula:\n    $d = v \\cdot (\\gamma \\tau_0) = v \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n2.  It is convenient to work with the term $\\hbar c$ (Planck's constant times the speed of light) and the velocity ratio $\\beta = v/c$. The formula becomes:\n    $d = (\\gamma \\beta) \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n3.  The kinematic term $\\gamma\\beta$ can be calculated directly from the particle's energy and mass without needing to find $v$ and $\\gamma$ separately. Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2$, and the definition of momentum, $pc = \\gamma\\beta (m c^2)$:\n    $\\gamma\\beta = \\frac{pc}{m c^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (m c^2)^2}}{m c^2}$\n4.  The final, most direct formula for the mean decay distance is:\n    $d = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (m c^2)^2}}{m c^2} \\right) \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n\n### 3.

This is a standard problem in particle physics that combines concepts from special relativity and quantum mechanics.\n\n**Step-by-step Derivation:**\n\n1.  **Proper Lifetime ($\\tau_0$)**: The mean lifetime of a particle in its own rest frame (proper lifetime) is inversely proportional to its decay width ($\\Gamma_X$), a relationship derived from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle ($\\Delta E \\Delta t \\ge \\hbar/2$). The formula is:\n    $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n2.  **Lifetime in Lab Frame ($\\tau_{lab}$)**: Due to relativistic time dilation, the lifetime of the particle as observed in the laboratory frame (where it is moving with a high velocity) is longer than its proper lifetime. The relationship is given by:\n    $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0 = \\gamma \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n3.  **Mean Decay Distance ($L$)**: The mean distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying is its velocity ($v$) multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime:\n    $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab} = v \\cdot \\gamma \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n4.  **Practical Calculation Formula**: The expression can be simplified for calculation.

The term $\\beta\\gamma$ can be calculated directly from the particle's energy and mass without needing to find $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ separately.\n    *   From the relativistic energy-momentum relation, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$, we find the momentum: $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}$.\n    *   The momentum is also related to $\\beta\\gamma$ by $pc = \\beta\\gamma \\cdot mc^2$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\beta\\gamma = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2}$.\n    *   Substituting this back, we get the final formula:\n        $L = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n**Numerical Calculation:**\n\n1.  **Gather and Unify Values**:\n    *   $E_X = 8 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n    *   $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n    *   $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\, \\text{MeV} = 0.320 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n    *   Use the physical constant $\\hbar c \\approx 1.973 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{GeV} \\cdot \\text{m}$\n\n2.  **Calculate the Kinematic Factor ($\\beta\\gamma$)**:\n    *   $\\beta\\gamma = \\frac{\\sqrt{(8.0)^2 - (1.2)^2}}{1.2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{64 - 1.44}}{1.2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{62.56}}{1.2} \\approx \\frac{7.9095}{1.2} \\approx 6.5912$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Mean Decay Distance ($L$)**:\n    *   $L \\approx (6.5912) \\times \\frac{1.973 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{GeV} \\cdot \\text{m}}{0.320 \\, \\text{GeV}}$\n    *   $L \\approx (6.5912) \\times (6.1656 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{m})$\n    *   $L \\approx 4.064 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$\n\n**Conclusion and Comparison with Options:**\n\nThe calculated mean decay distance is approximately $4.064 \\times 10^{-15}$ meters.\n\nLet's compare this to the provided options:\nA) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\nB) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\nC) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\nD) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n\nThe calculated value, $4.064 \\times 10^{-15}$ m, is extremely close to the value in option D, $4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m.

Problem Analysis and Physical Principles**\n\nThe task is to compute the mean decay distance ($L$) of a particle in the laboratory frame. This requires a combination of principles from special relativity and particle physics.\n\n*   **Mean Lifetime and Decay Width:** The intrinsic lifetime of an unstable particle in its own rest frame (proper lifetime, $\\tau_0$) is inversely proportional to its decay width ($\\Gamma$) according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:\n    $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{lab}}$\n    $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n*   **Relativistic Time Dilation:** A moving particle's lifetime appears longer when measured from a stationary frame (like the laboratory). This is called time dilation, and the lab-frame lifetime ($\\tau_{\\text{lab}}$) is related to the proper lifetime by the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$):\n    $\\tau_{\\text{lab}} = \\gamma \\tau_0 = \\gamma \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n\n*   **Mean Decay Distance:** The mean distance the particle travels before decaying is its velocity ($v$) multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime:\n    $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{lab}} = v \\gamma \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma}$\n\n*   **Calculation Simplification:** To avoid calculating velocity and $\\gamma$ separately, we can use a more convenient form. The relativistic momentum $p$ is $p = \\gamma m v$. We can rearrange this to express the product $v\\gamma$ as $v\\gamma = p/m$. It is most convenient to work with quantities in energy units (GeV, MeV) by using $pc$ and $mc^2$:\n    $L = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n\n    The momentum term ($pc$) can be found from the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. This gives:\n    $pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}$\n\n*   **Final Formula:** Combining these expressions gives the formula for the mean decay distance:\n    $L = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n\n**2.

Let's break down the problem into clear, sequential steps.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Relevant Physical Principles and Formulas\n\nThe mean decay distance ($L$) is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. In the laboratory frame, this is given by its velocity ($v$) multiplied by its mean lifetime in the lab frame ($\\tau_{\\text{lab}}$):\n$L = v \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{lab}}$\n\nDue to relativistic time dilation, the lifetime measured in the lab is longer than the particle's lifetime in its rest frame (proper lifetime, $\\tau_0$). The relationship is governed by the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\tau_{\\text{lab}} = \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0$\n\nThe proper lifetime $\\tau_0$ is fundamentally related to the particle's decay width ($\\Gamma_X$) via the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:\n$\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nCombining these equations gives us a more complete formula for the decay distance:\n$L = v \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\nFor convenience, we often use the fact that $v = \\beta c$ (where $\\beta$ is the speed as a fraction of the speed of light, $c$).

Analysis of the Physics Principles\n\nThe problem asks for the mean decay distance of a moving particle. This requires combining concepts from special relativity and particle physics.\n\n1.  **Proper Lifetime ($\\tau_0$)**: The lifetime of a particle in its own rest frame is inversely proportional to its decay width ($\\Gamma_X$), a consequence of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n    $$ \\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X} $$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation**: Because the particle is moving at a relativistic speed in the laboratory frame, its lifetime appears longer to a lab observer.

The lab-frame lifetime is $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   The mean decay distance is the particle's speed in the lab ($v$) multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime: $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$.\n    *   Combining these gives: $L = v \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot (\\hbar / \\Gamma)$.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Practical Calculation:** It's often more convenient to work with a combined expression.

The formula is $\\tau_0 = \\hbar / \\Gamma$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n*   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation)**: A particle moving with a Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ will have its lifetime extended in the lab frame. The lab lifetime is $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\n*   **Distance Calculation**: The mean distance traveled is the particle's velocity ($v$) multiplied by its lab lifetime, $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$.\n\n### **2.

Therefore, $\\gamma\\beta = \\frac{pc}{mc^2}$.\n4.  The momentum term $pc$ is found from the energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 \\implies pc = \\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}$.\n\nSubstituting this back into the formula for $L$ gives us the final equation for the calculation:\n$L = \\frac{\\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{mc^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma}$\n\n### **3.

So, the formula for distance becomes:\n$L = c \\beta \\gamma \\tau = (\\beta \\gamma) \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\nThe kinematic term $\\beta\\gamma$ can be calculated from the particle's energy and mass. The relativistic momentum $pc$ and total energy $E_X$ are related by:\n$E_X^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2 \\implies pc = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}$\nAlso, we know that $pc = \\beta \\gamma (m_X c^2)$. Therefore:\n$\\beta\\gamma = \\frac{pc}{m_X c^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2}$\n\nSubstituting this back into the formula for $L$, we get the final equation for the calculation:\n$L = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2} \\right) \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n### Step 3: Perform the Calculation\n\nFirst, ensure all units are consistent. Let's use GeV for energy.\n*   $E_X = 8.0 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n*   $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n*   $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\, \\text{MeV} = 0.320 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n*   Physical Constant: $\\hbar c \\approx 1.97327 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{GeV} \\cdot \\text{m}$\n\nNow, plug the values into the formula:\n*   Calculate the kinematic factor, $\\beta\\gamma$:\n    $\\beta\\gamma = \\frac{\\sqrt{(8.0)^2 - (1.2)^2}}{1.2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{64 - 1.44}}{1.2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{62.56}}{1.2} \\approx 6.59124$\n\n*   Calculate the proper decay length, $c\\tau$:\n    $c\\tau = \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X} = \\frac{1.97327 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{GeV} \\cdot \\text{m}}{0.320 \\, \\text{GeV}} \\approx 6.16647 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{m}$\n\n*   Calculate the mean decay distance, $L$:\n    $L = (\\beta\\gamma) \\cdot (c\\tau) \\approx 6.59124 \\times (6.16647 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{m}) \\approx 4.0645 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$\n\n### Step 4: Compare with Options\n\nThe calculated mean decay distance is approximately $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$.\nLet's compare this to the provided options:\nA) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\nB) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\nC) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\nD) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\n\nThe calculated value of $4.0645 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$ is extremely close to option A, $4.0655 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$. The minor difference (~0.025%) is likely due to small variations in the precision of the physical constant $\\hbar c$ used when creating the problem's options versus the standard value used here. The result clearly indicates that A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Goal\nThe primary objective is to calculate the mean decay distance ($L$) of the meson resonance X in the laboratory reference frame.\n\n### 2. Physical Principles and Formula\nThe correct physical formula to calculate the mean decay distance of a relativistic particle is derived from combining principles of special relativity (time dilation) and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.\n\n*   The proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$), which is the particle's lifetime in its rest frame, is inversely proportional to its decay width ($\\Gamma_X$):\n    $\\tau_0 = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n*   In the laboratory frame, the particle is moving, and its lifetime appears longer due to time dilation. This lab-frame lifetime ($\\tau_{lab}$) is:\n    $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\tau_0$\n    where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = E / (mc^2)$.\n\n*   The mean distance the particle travels in the lab before decaying is its velocity ($v$) multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime:\n    $L = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab} = v \\gamma \\tau_0 = v \\gamma \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n*   This expression can be simplified by using the quantity $\\hbar c$ and expressing the velocity-dependent term ($v\\gamma$) in terms of momentum ($p$). Since the relativistic momentum $pc = \\gamma \\beta (mc^2)$ (with $\\beta = v/c$), we can write $\\gamma \\beta = \\frac{pc}{mc^2}$. Therefore:\n    $L = \\gamma \\beta c \\tau_0 = \\left(\\frac{pc}{mc^2}\\right) c \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}\\right) = \\frac{pc}{mc^2} \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n*   Finally, we find the momentum term $pc$ from the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E_X^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2$, which gives $pc = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}$.\n\nThe final, comprehensive formula is:\n$L = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n### 3. Numerical Calculation\nLet's substitute the given values into this formula.\n\n*   **Given values:**\n    *   $E_X = 8.0 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n    *   $m_X c^2 = 1.2 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n    *   $\\Gamma_X = 320 \\, \\text{MeV} = 0.320 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n\n*   **Physical constant:**\n    *   $\\hbar c \\approx 1.97327 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{GeV} \\cdot \\text{m}$\n\n*   **Step-by-step calculation:**\n    1.  Calculate the numerator of the first term (the momentum $pc$):\n        $pc = \\sqrt{(8.0)^2 - (1.2)^2} = \\sqrt{64 - 1.44} = \\sqrt{62.56} \\approx 7.9095 \\, \\text{GeV}$\n    2.  Calculate the first term (the kinematic factor $\\gamma\\beta$):\n        $\\frac{pc}{m_X c^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{62.56}}{1.2} \\approx 6.5912$\n    3.  Calculate the second term (the rest-frame decay length $c\\tau_0$):\n        $\\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X} = \\frac{1.97327 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{GeV} \\cdot \\text{m}}{0.320 \\, \\text{GeV}} \\approx 6.1665 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{m}$\n    4.  Multiply the results:\n        $L \\approx (6.5912) \\times (6.1665 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{m}) \\approx 4.0645 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$\n\n### 4. Comparison with Options and Conclusion\nThe calculated value is $L \\approx 4.0645 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}$.\nNow, we compare this result with the provided options:\nA) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m\nB) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m\nC) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\nD) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m\n\nOur calculated value ($4.0645 \\times 10^{-15}$ m) is extremely close to option D ($4.0655 \\times 10^{-15}$ m). The very small difference (about 0.025%) is well within the expected range for physics problems due to potential minor variations in the precision of constants used to create the question. The other options differ by a larger margin or by an order of magnitude. Therefore, option D is the correct choice. The consensus of the most reliable candidate agents confirms this result.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to determine the mean decay distance of a meson resonance, X, given its total energy, rest mass, and decay width in the laboratory frame.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Physics:**\n    *   The mean decay distance ($L$) is the particle's velocity ($v$) multiplied by its lifetime in the lab frame ($t_{\\text{lab}}$): $L = v \\cdot t_{\\text{lab}}$.\n    *   The lifetime in the lab frame is subject to relativistic time dilation.

This gives us the useful term $v \\gamma = p/m$.\n    *   To work entirely in energy units (like GeV), we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$ and $c^2$ to get:\n        $L = \\frac{pc}{m_X c^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n    *   The momentum term $pc$ is found using the energy-momentum relation: $E_X^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_X c^2)^2$, which gives $pc = \\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}$.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   **Unify Units:** Ensure all energy-related values are in the same unit.

The minor difference (~0.04%) is negligible and is expected due to variations in the precision of physical constants used to generate the problem and the options.\n\nThe overwhelming consensus among the provided candidate answers also converges on this value, despite some confusion with the option lettering (A, B, C, D) which seems to have been shuffled in different versions of the problem shown to the agents. The core numerical result remains consistent.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis is a problem from particle physics that requires combining concepts from special relativity and quantum mechanics (specifically, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle).\n\n### 1. Goal\nThe objective is to calculate the mean decay distance ($L$) of the meson resonance X in the laboratory frame.\n\n### 2. Physical Principles and Formula\nThe mean decay distance of a particle is its velocity in the lab frame ($v$) multiplied by its lifetime in the lab frame ($T_{\\text{lab}}$).\n$L = v \\cdot T_{\\text{lab}}$\n\n*   **Relativistic Time Dilation**: The lifetime of the moving particle in the lab frame ($T_{\\text{lab}}$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau$, the lifetime in its rest frame) due to time dilation. The relationship is $T_{\\text{lab}} = \\gamma \\tau$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Uncertainty Principle**: The proper lifetime ($\\tau$) of an unstable particle is related to its decay width ($\\Gamma_X$) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: $\\tau = \\hbar / \\Gamma_X$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nCombining these principles, we get the formula for the mean decay distance:\n$L = v \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\nFor easier calculation using the given energy units, this formula can be rewritten. We can express the term $v \\cdot \\gamma$ as $\\gamma\\beta c$ (where $\\beta = v/c$). Then we can use the constant $\\hbar c$ and the relation $\\gamma\\beta = \\frac{pc}{mc^2}$, where $pc$ is the momentum and $mc^2$ is the rest energy. The momentum term can be found from the relativistic energy-momentum relation: $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.\n\nThis leads to the final, most practical formula:\n$L = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_X^2 - (m_X c^2)^2}}{m_X c^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\hbar c}{\\Gamma_X}$\n\n### 3.
