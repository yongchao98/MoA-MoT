    "To determine the relative radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same signal as the observed starspots, we first need to calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots.\n\n### 1. Light Variation due to Starspots\n\nThe star's brightness varies because one hemisphere is partially covered by cooler, dark spots, while the other is unspotted. The maximum brightness (F_max) occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer, and the minimum brightness (F_min) occurs when the spotty hemisphere is visible.\n\nThe flux from a stellar surface is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that flux is proportional to the fourth power of the effective temperature (T⁴).\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This corresponds to the unspotted hemisphere, with a uniform temperature of T_eff = 6000 K. The flux is proportional to T_eff⁴.\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This comes from the hemisphere where 20% of the area (a filling factor, `f_spot` = 0.2) is covered by spots. The spots have a temperature T_spot = 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K. The remaining 80% of this hemisphere is at the star's effective temperature, T_eff.\n\nThe flux from the spotty hemisphere is a combination of the flux from the normal photosphere and the cooler spots:\nF_min is proportional to `(1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴`\n\nThe amplitude of the signal (A_spot) is the relative drop in flux:\nA_spot = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\n\nSubstituting the expressions for flux:\nA_spot = [T_eff⁴ - ((1 - f_spot) * T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_spot⁴)] / T_eff⁴\nA_spot = [T_eff⁴ - T_eff⁴ + f_spot * T_eff⁴ - f_spot * T_spot⁴] / T_eff⁴\nA_spot = f_spot * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n*   `f_spot` = 0.20\n*   `T_eff` = 6000 K\n*   `T_spot` = 5000 K\n\nA_spot = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)\nA_spot = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)\nA_spot = 0.20 * (1 - 0.48225)\nA_spot = 0.20 * 0.51775\nA_spot ≈ 0.10355\n\n### 2. Light Variation due to an Exoplanet Transit\n\nThe dimming of a star caused by a transiting exoplanet is known as the transit depth. The amplitude of this signal (A_planet) is equal to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. This can be expressed as the square of the ratio of their radii (R_pl / R_star).\n\nA_planet = (π * R_pl²) / (π * R_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n### 3. Equating the Signals\n\nThe problem asks for the planet-to-star radius ratio (R_pl / R_star) that would produce the same amplitude as the starspots. Therefore, we set the two amplitudes equal to each other:\n\nA_planet = A_spot\n(R_pl / R_star)² = 0.10355\n\nTo find the relative radius, we take the square root of this value:\nR_pl / R_star = √0.10355\nR_pl / R_star ≈ 0.32179\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~0.39\nB) ~0.32\nC) ~0.11\nD) ~0.07\n\nThe calculated relative radius of ~0.32 matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
