    "Based on the analysis of the physical theories:\n\n*   **A) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** As a quantum field theory, QCD exhibits ultraviolet divergences in perturbative calculations which necessitate regularization and renormalization. Although it is asymptotically free, meaning its coupling constant decreases at high energies, the theory itself still requires regularization to handle these divergences.\n\n*   **B) Classical Electrodynamics:** When dealing with idealized point charges, classical electrodynamics suffers from singularities and infinities, such as the infinite self-energy of a point particle. This breakdown at small distance scales (corresponding to high energies) requires a form of regularization, for instance by assuming a finite particle radius or other modifications to the theory.\n\n*   **D) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** QED is a quantum field theory that was one of the first to encounter ultraviolet divergences in calculations involving loop diagrams. These divergences require regularization and renormalization to yield finite, physically meaningful predictions. Furthermore, QED is thought to break down at extremely high energies due to a feature known as a Landau pole.\n\n*   **C) Superstring Theory:** A key feature of superstring theory is that it is believed to be free of ultraviolet (UV) divergences. Unlike theories based on point particles, the interactions in string theory are \"smeared out,\" which softens the high-energy behavior of scattering amplitudes and removes the infinities that plague quantum field theories. It is considered a UV-finite theory, meaning it does not require regularization for high-energy processes.\n\nTherefore, the theory that does not require regularization at high energies is Superstring Theory.\n\n<<<C>>>"
