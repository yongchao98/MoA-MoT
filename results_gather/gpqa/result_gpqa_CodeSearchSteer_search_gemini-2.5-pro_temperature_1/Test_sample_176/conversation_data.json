    "To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we can use the principles of black-body radiation. The key formulas are the Stefan-Boltzmann law and Wien's displacement law.\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: This law states that the total energy radiated per unit surface area of a black body is directly proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature (T). The total luminosity (L) of a spherical star with radius (R) is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Wien's Displacement Law**: This law relates the temperature of a black body to the wavelength (λ_max) at which it emits the most radiation. The relationship is inverse: λ_max = b/T, where b is Wien's constant. Therefore, a star's temperature determines its peak emission wavelength.\n\n3.  **Doppler Effect**: The observed wavelength of light from a moving source is shifted. If the source is moving away, its light is redshifted to longer wavelengths; if it is moving closer, it is blueshifted to shorter wavelengths. For speeds much less than the speed of light (c), the observed wavelength (λ_obs) is related to the rest wavelength (λ_rest) by the formula λ_obs ≈ λ_rest(1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity.\n\n**Applying these principles to the problem:**\n\nThe astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest were the same. This refers to the *observed* peak wavelength (λ_obs).\n\n*   For Star_1, the radial velocity is 0 km/s, so its observed peak wavelength is equal to its intrinsic (rest) peak wavelength: λ_obs,1 = λ_rest,1.\n*   For Star_2, the radial velocity is 700 km/s. This velocity causes a Doppler shift. Its light is redshifted, so the observed peak wavelength is longer than its intrinsic peak wavelength: λ_obs,2 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v₂/c).\n\nSince λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2, we have:\nλ_rest,1 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v₂/c)\n\nAccording to Wien's Law, the temperature (T) is inversely proportional to the rest wavelength (T = b/λ_rest). So, the ratio of the temperatures is:\nT₁/T₂ = λ_rest,2 / λ_rest,1 = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the luminosities using the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴) = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\nWe are given that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂. Substituting the known ratios:\nL₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v₂/c)]⁴\n\nNow, we plug in the values:\n*   v₂ = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s\n*   c (speed of light) ≈ 300,000,000 m/s\n*   v₂/c = 700,000 / 300,000,000 = 7/3000 ≈ 0.002333\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + 0.002333)]⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.009364\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is approximately 2.23. The information about the stars' masses is not needed for this calculation.\n\nTherefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of approximately 2.23.\n\n<<<C>>>"
