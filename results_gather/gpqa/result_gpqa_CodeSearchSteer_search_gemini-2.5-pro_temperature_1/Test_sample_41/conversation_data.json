    "To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we can use the fundamental principles of planetary physics: the equilibrium temperature formula and Kepler's Third Law. The additional information regarding the masses of the planets and the Transit Timing Variation (TTV) discovery method is not necessary for this calculation.\n\n### Key Physical Principles:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature (T_eq):** The equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the energy it absorbs from its host star. For a planet in a circular orbit, this temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance (a) from the star, assuming the star's luminosity and the planet's albedo are constant. The formula is given by:\n\n    *T_eq ∝ 1 / √a*\n\n    This implies that the orbital distance is inversely proportional to the square of the equilibrium temperature:\n\n    *a ∝ 1 / T_eq²*\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** This law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). For circular orbits, the semi-major axis is the orbital distance. Therefore:\n\n    *P² ∝ a³  or  P ∝ a^(3/2)*\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\nFirst, we establish a direct relationship between the orbital period (P) and the equilibrium temperature (T_eq) by combining the two principles above.\n\n*   From Kepler's Third Law, we have *P ∝ a^(3/2)*.\n*   Substituting the relationship for 'a' from the equilibrium temperature principle (*a ∝ 1 / T_eq²*), we get:\n    *P ∝ (1 / T_eq²)^(3/2)*\n    *P ∝ 1 / T_eq³*\n\nThis final relationship shows that the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature. This means that for any two planets (x and y) orbiting the same star, the ratio of their periods is:\n\n*(P_y / P_x) = (T_x / T_y)³*\n\nNext, we use the given temperature ratios to find the ratio between Planet1 and Planet3.\n\n*   Given: T_eq(Planet1) / T_eq(Planet2) = 1.4\n*   Given: T_eq(Planet2) / T_eq(Planet3) = 2.3\n\nWe can find the temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet3 by multiplying these two ratios:\n\n*(T_eq(Planet1) / T_eq(Planet3)) = (T_eq(Planet1) / T_eq(Planet2)) * (T_eq(Planet2) / T_eq(Planet3))*\n*T_eq(Planet1) / T_eq(Planet3) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22*\n\nFinally, we calculate the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 (P3 / P1).\n\n*   Using the derived relationship: *P3 / P1 = (T_eq(Planet1) / T_eq(Planet3))³*\n*   *P3 / P1 = (3.22)³*\n*   *P3 / P1 ≈ 33.386*\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
