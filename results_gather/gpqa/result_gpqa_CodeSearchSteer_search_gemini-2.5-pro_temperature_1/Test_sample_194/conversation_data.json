    "To solve this astronomical problem, a step-by-step calculation based on the principles of orbital mechanics and transit geometry is required. Here is the breakdown of the solution:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Transit and Occultation Conditions\n\nA planet is said to transit when it passes in front of its star, and it undergoes occultation (or secondary eclipse) when it passes behind its star. For a planet in a circular orbit, if a transit is observed, an occultation will also occur.\n\nThe condition for a transit to happen is that the projected distance of the planet's center from the star's center must be less than the sum of the stellar radius (R_s) and the planetary radius (R_p). This can be expressed using the impact parameter (b), which is the projected distance in units of the stellar radius.\n\nThe maximum impact parameter for a transit to occur is given by:\n`b_max = (R_s + R_p) / R_s = 1 + R_p / R_s`\n\n### 2. Utilizing Data from the First Planet\n\nFor the first planet, we are given:\n*   Orbital Period (P₁) = 3 days\n*   Impact Parameter (b₁) = 0.2\n\nThe impact parameter is defined as `b₁ = (a₁ * cos(i)) / R_s`, where `a₁` is the semi-major axis of the first planet and `i` is the orbital inclination, which is common to both planets. From this, we can establish a relationship for the orbital inclination:\n`cos(i) = (b₁ * R_s) / a₁ = (0.2 * R_s) / a₁`\n\n### 3. Determining the Maximum Orbit for the Second Planet\n\nFor the second planet to exhibit transits, its impact parameter (b₂) must be less than or equal to its maximum possible value. To find the maximum orbital period (P₂), we must first find its maximum possible semi-major axis (a₂_max). This occurs at the maximum possible impact parameter for the second planet (b₂_max).\n\nThe parameters for the second planet are:\n*   Planetary Radius (R_p₂) = 2.5 Earth radii (R_earth)\n\nThe parameters for the star are:\n*   Stellar Radius (R_s) = 1.5 Solar radii (R_sun)\n\nFirst, we calculate the ratio of the second planet's radius to the star's radius. Using the known values for the Sun's radius (approx. 696,000 km) and Earth's radius (approx. 6,371 km), the ratio of the Sun's radius to Earth's radius is about 109.\n*   R_s / R_earth ≈ 1.5 * 109 = 163.5\n*   R_p₂ / R_s = (2.5 * R_earth) / (1.5 * R_sun) = (2.5 / 1.5) * (R_earth / R_sun) ≈ 1.667 / 109 ≈ 0.0153\n\nNow, we find the maximum impact parameter for the second planet:\n`b₂_max = 1 + R_p₂ / R_s ≈ 1 + 0.0153 = 1.0153`\n\nThe semi-major axis for the second planet is `a₂ = (b₂ * R_s) / cos(i)`. To find the maximum `a₂`, we use `b₂_max`:\n`a₂_max = (b₂_max * R_s) / cos(i)`\n\nSubstituting the expression for `cos(i)` from the first planet's data:\n`a₂_max = (b₂_max * R_s) / ((0.2 * R_s) / a₁) = a₁ * (b₂_max / 0.2)`\n`a₂_max = a₁ * (1.0153 / 0.2) ≈ 5.0765 * a₁`\n\n### 4. Applying Kepler's Third Law\n\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`P² ∝ a³`). For two planets orbiting the same star, this gives us the relation:\n`(P₂ / P₁)² = (a₂ / a₁ )³`\n\nTo find the maximum period for the second planet (P₂_max), we use its maximum semi-major axis (a₂_max):\n`(P₂_max / P₁)² = (a₂_max / a₁ )³`\n`(P₂_max / 3)² = (5.0765 * a₁ / a₁ )³ = (5.0765)³ ≈ 130.8`\n\nNow, we solve for P₂_max:\n`P₂_max² = 9 * 130.8 = 1177.2`\n`P₂_max = √1177.2 ≈ 34.3` days\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated maximum orbital period is approximately 34.3 days. This value is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
