    "Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism where isomers have the ability to rotate the plane of polarized light. This property arises from molecular chirality, meaning the molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n\n1.  **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule belongs to a class of compounds known as biphenyls. Due to the large, bulky nitro (-NO2) and dimethyl carboxylate (-COOCH3) groups at the ortho positions (2, 2', 6, and 6'), the free rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is severely restricted. This restricted rotation, known as atropisomerism, can lead to chirality if the molecule as a whole is asymmetric. Since the substitution pattern on the rings prevents the molecule from having a plane of symmetry, it is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This molecule, also known as methyl lactate, has a central carbon atom (the second carbon) bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a methyl ester group (-COOCH3). A carbon atom bonded to four distinct groups is a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are inherently chiral and thus optically active.\n\n3.  **Benzophenone**: The chemical structure of benzophenone, (C6H5)2CO, is a diphenyl ketone. This molecule possesses elements of symmetry, including a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule. It does not contain any chiral centers. A molecule that has a plane of symmetry is achiral and cannot be optically active. While it can exhibit induced optical activity in specific environments, such as when forming a complex, the molecule itself is achiral.\n\n4.  **Dimethyl fumarate**: This molecule is the trans-isomer of a butenedioate ester. Its structure is planar and possesses a center of symmetry as well as a plane of symmetry. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n\nBased on this analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the two compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
