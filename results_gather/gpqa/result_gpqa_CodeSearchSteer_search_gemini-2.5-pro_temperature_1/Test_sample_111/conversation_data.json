    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Normalize the initial state |α>**\n\nThe given state is proportional to `(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>`. To make it a valid quantum state, we must normalize it. Let the normalized state be:\n`|α> = C * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n\nThe normalization condition is `<α|α> = 1`. The corresponding bra vector `<α|` is:\n`<α| = C* * [(1-i)<up| + (2+i)<down|]`\n\nNow, we compute the inner product `<α|α>`:\n`<α|α> = |C|² * [(1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)] = 1`\n`|C|² * [(1² - i²) + (2² - i²)] = 1`\n`|C|² * [(1 + 1) + (4 + 1)] = 1`\n`|C|² * (2 + 5) = 1`\n`|C|² = 1/7`\n\nChoosing the real, positive root for C, we get `C = 1/√7`.\nSo, the normalized state is:\n`|α> = (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]`\n\n**2. Find the Eigenstates and Eigenvalues of the Operator A**\n\nThe operator A is given by the matrix:\n`A = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation `det(A - λI) = 0`:\n`det([[ -λ, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, -λ ]]) = λ² - (ħ/2)² = 0`\nThis gives two eigenvalues: `λ₁ = +ħ/2` and `λ₂ = -ħ/2`.\n\nNext, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors (eigenstates).\n*   For `λ₁ = +ħ/2`, the eigenvector `|v₁>` is found by solving `(A - λ₁I)|v₁> = 0`. This yields the normalized eigenstate `|v₁> = (1/√2) * (|up> + |down>)`.\n*   For `λ₂ = -ħ/2`, the eigenvector `|v₂>` is found by solving `(A - λ₂I)|v₂> = 0`. This yields the normalized eigenstate `|v₂> = (1/√2) * (|up> - |down>)`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Probabilities**\n\nThe probability of measuring the system in a particular eigenstate is the squared magnitude of the inner product of the system state and the eigenstate `P = |<eigenstate|α>|²`.\n\n*   **Probability of measuring λ₁ = +ħ/2 (state |v₁>):**\n    `P(λ₁) = |<v₁|α>|²`\n    `<v₁|α> = [(1/√2)(<up| + <down|)] * [(1/√7)((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<v₁|α> = (1/√14) * [(1+i) + (2-i)] = 3/√14`\n    `P(λ₁) = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.64`\n\n*   **Probability of measuring λ₂ = -ħ/2 (state |v₂>):**\n    `P(λ₂) = |<v₂|α>|²`\n    `<v₂|α> = [(1/√2)(<up| - <down|)] * [(1/√7)((1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>)]`\n    `<v₂|α> = (1/√14) * [(1+i) - (2-i)] = (-1 + 2i)/√14`\n    `P(λ₂) = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.36`\n\nThe probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n**4. Find the Average (Expectation) Value of the Operator A**\n\nThe average value `<A>` can be calculated in two ways.\n\n*   **Method 1: Using eigenvalues and probabilities.**\n    `<A> = P(λ₁)λ₁ + P(λ₂)λ₂`\n    `<A> = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2)`\n    `<A> = (ħ/28) * (9 - 5) = 4ħ/28 = ħ/7`\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the definition `<A> = <α|A|α>`.**\n    `A|α> = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * (1/√7) * [[1+i], [2-i]] = (ħ/(2√7)) * [[2-i], [1+i]]`\n    `<α|A|α> = (1/√7) * [1-i, 2+i] * (ħ/(2√7)) * [[2-i], [1+i]]`\n    `<A> = (ħ/14) * [(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)]`\n    `<A> = (ħ/14) * [(2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1)]`\n    `<A> = (ħ/14) * [1 - 3i + 1 + 3i] = 2ħ/14 = ħ/7`\n\nBoth methods give the average value as `ħ/7`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of the operator is `ħ/7`. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
