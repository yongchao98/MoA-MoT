    "To find the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$, we use the formula derived from the principles of quantum mechanics. The uncertainty of an operator $A$ is defined as the standard deviation of its measurements, given by the formula:\n\n$\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$\n\nHere, $\\langle A \\rangle$ represents the expectation value of the operator $A$, and $\\langle A^2 \\rangle$ is the expectation value of the operator $A^2$. For an operator $A$ and a system in a state $|\\psi\\rangle$, the expectation value is calculated as $\\langle A \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | A | \\psi \\rangle$.\n\nThe problem provides the necessary information:\n*   The state of the system is given by the column vector:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   The matrix form of the operator $P_z$ is:\n    $P_z = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe steps to calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ are as follows:\n\n**1. Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$**\n\nFirst, we apply the operator $P_z$ to the state vector $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNext, we calculate the inner product of $\\langle \\psi |$ (which is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$) with the resulting vector $P_z |\\psi\\rangle$:\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)(0) + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + 0 - \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = 0$\n\n**2. Calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$**\n\nFirst, we need to find the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$:\n$P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, we calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle$:\n$P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)(0) + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\right)$\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + 0 + \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n**3. Calculate the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$**\n\nUsing the values calculated above, we can now find the uncertainty:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nThe uncertainty of $P_z$ is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n<<<C>>>"
