    "To find the expectation value of the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x, we must calculate ⟨ψ| (10σ_z + 5σ_x) |ψ⟩ for the given spin state |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩.\n\nThe calculation can be broken down into two parts:\n1.  The expectation value of σ_z.\n2.  The expectation value of σ_x.\n\nThe state is given by |ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, with a = 0.5 and b = √3/2. The corresponding bra is ⟨ψ| = a*⟨↑| + b*⟨↓|, which is 0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓| since the coefficients are real.\n\nThe Pauli matrices, σ_z and σ_x, act on the basis states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ as follows:\n*   σ_z|↑⟩ = |↑⟩\n*   σ_z|↓⟩ = -|↓⟩\n*   σ_x|↑⟩ = |↓⟩\n*   σ_x|↓⟩ = |↑⟩\n\n**1. Expectation value of σ_z:**\n⟨σ_z⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩ = (0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|) σ_z (0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩)\n= (0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|) (0.5|↑⟩ - (√3)/2|↓⟩)\nUsing the orthonormality of the basis states (⟨↑|↑⟩ = 1, ⟨↓|↓⟩ = 1, ⟨↑|↓⟩ = 0, ⟨↓|↑⟩ = 0), we get:\n= (0.5)² - (√3/2)² = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5\n\n**2. Expectation value of σ_x:**\n⟨σ_x⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ = (0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|) σ_x (0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩)\n= (0.5⟨↑| + (√3)/2⟨↓|) (0.5|↓⟩ + (√3)/2|↑⟩)\n= (0.5)(√3/2)⟨↑|↑⟩ + (0.5)(0.5)⟨↑|↓⟩ + (√3/2)(√3/2)⟨↓|↑⟩ + (√3/2)(0.5)⟨↓|↓⟩\n= (√3/4) * 1 + 0 + 0 + (√3/4) * 1\n= 2 * (√3/4) = √3/2\n\n**Combining the results:**\nThe expectation value of the full operator is:\n⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ = 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩\n= 10(-0.5) + 5(√3/2)\n= -5 + 2.5 * √3\n\nUsing the approximation √3 ≈ 1.732:\n= -5 + 2.5 * 1.732\n= -5 + 4.33\n= -0.67\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the value is -0.7.\n\n<<<D>>>"
