    "To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we need to calculate its lifetime in the laboratory frame and its velocity.\n\n### 1. Calculation of the Proper Lifetime (τ)\n\nThe proper lifetime (τ) of a particle is the lifetime in its own rest frame. It is inversely proportional to its decay width (Γ) according to the formula:\nτ = ħ / Γ\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nGiven:\n*   Decay width Γ_X = 320 MeV\n*   Reduced Planck constant ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s\n\nCalculation:\nτ = (6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s) / 320 MeV\nτ ≈ 2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s\n\n### 2. Calculation of Relativistic Factors\n\nThe mean decay distance is measured in the laboratory frame, where the particle is moving. Due to relativistic effects, the particle's lifetime is dilated, and its decay length is given by the formula L = γβcτ. Here, γ is the Lorentz factor, β is the velocity as a fraction of the speed of light (v/c), and c is the speed of light.\n\nThe term γβ can be calculated from the particle's total energy (E) and mass (m) using the relation:\nγβ = p / m = sqrt(E² - m²) / m\nwhere p is the momentum.\n\nGiven:\n*   Total energy E_X = 8 GeV = 8000 MeV\n*   Mass m_X = 1.2 GeV = 1200 MeV\n\nCalculation of momentum (p):\np = sqrt(E_X² - m_X²) = sqrt((8000 MeV)² - (1200 MeV)²)\np = sqrt(64,000,000 - 1,440,000) MeV/c\np = sqrt(62,560,000) MeV/c\np ≈ 7909.5 MeV/c\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Mean Decay Distance (d)\n\nThe mean decay distance (d) can be calculated more directly using the formula:\nd = (p/m) * cτ = (p*c / m*c²) * (ħc / Γ)\n\nWe can use the value of ħc ≈ 197.3 MeV·fm (where 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m).\n\nCalculation:\nd = (7909.5 MeV / 1200 MeV) * (197.3 MeV·fm / 320 MeV)\nd ≈ 6.591 * 0.6166 fm\nd ≈ 4.0655 fm\n\nSince 1 fm = 10⁻¹⁵ m, the mean decay distance is:\nd ≈ 4.0655 x 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
