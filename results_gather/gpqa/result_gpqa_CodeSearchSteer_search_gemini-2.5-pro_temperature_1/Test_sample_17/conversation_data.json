    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star 1 and Star 2.\n\n### Understanding the Notation\n\nIn astronomy, the abundance of an element is often expressed using a bracket notation, which compares the ratio of two elements in a star to the same ratio in the Sun. The general form is:\n\n`[X/Y] = log10(nX/nY)_star - log10(nX/nY)_Sun`\n\nWhere `nX` and `nY` are the number densities of elements X and Y. A key identity derived from this notation is:\n\n`[X/H] = [X/Y] + [Y/H]`\n\nThis identity will be used to simplify the calculations.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star 1\n\nWe are given the following for Star 1:\n*   `[Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3`\n*   `[Fe/H]₁ = 0`\n\nUsing the abundance identity, we can find the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio, `[Si/H]₁`:\n\n`[Si/H]₁ = [Si/Fe]₁ + [Fe/H]₁`\n`[Si/H]₁ = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3`\n\nThis means:\n`log₁₀((nSi/nH)₁) - log₁₀((nSi/nH)Sun) = 0.3`\nTherefore, the abundance of silicon in Star 1 is:\n`(nSi/nH)₁ = (nSi/nH)Sun * 10^0.3`\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Silicon Abundance for Star 2\n\nFor Star 2, we are given:\n*   `[Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3`\n*   `[Mg/H]₂ = 0`\n\nUsing the abundance identity `[X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H]`, we can write:\n\n`[Mg/Si]₂ = [Mg/H]₂ - [Si/H]₂`\n`0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]₂`\n`[Si/H]₂ = -0.3`\n\nThis means:\n`log₁₀((nSi/nH)₂) - log₁₀((nSi/nH)Sun) = -0.3`\nTherefore, the abundance of silicon in Star 2 is:\n`(nSi/nH)₂ = (nSi/nH)Sun * 10^-0.3`\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Ratio of Silicon Atoms\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star 1 and Star 2. This corresponds to the ratio of their silicon abundances, `(nSi/nH)₁ / (nSi/nH)₂`.\n\n`Ratio = [(nSi/nH)Sun * 10^0.3] / [(nSi/nH)Sun * 10^-0.3]`\n\nThe solar abundance term `(nSi/nH)Sun` cancels out:\n\n`Ratio = 10^0.3 / 10^-0.3`\n`Ratio = 10^(0.3 - (-0.3))`\n`Ratio = 10^0.6`\n\nCalculating the final value:\n`10^0.6 ≈ 3.981`\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9. The information regarding the stellar masses and the specific solar abundances of Iron and Magnesium were not necessary for this calculation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
