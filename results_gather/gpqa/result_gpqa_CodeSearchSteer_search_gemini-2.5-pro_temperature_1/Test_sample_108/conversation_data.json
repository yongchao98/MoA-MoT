    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the non-permitted partial wave.\n\n### 1. Define the Initial State and Conservation Laws\n\n*   **Initial State:** A two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n    *   From the term symbol `(2S+1)L(J)`, we can determine the quantum numbers:\n        *   `2S_i + 1 = 1`  implies initial spin `S_i = 0`.\n        *   `L` is 'S', which means initial orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n        *   `J` is '0', which means initial total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The parity of the initial state is given by `P_i = (-1)^L_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n*   **The Process:** The initial NN system emits a particle X and transitions to a final NN state.\n    *   `NN_i -> NN_f + X`\n    *   The intrinsic parity of particle X is given as `P_X = -1`.\n    *   The final NN state has an isospin `T(NN)_f = 0`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Angular Momentum (J):** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal the total angular momentum of the final state.\n    *   `J_i = J_f`\n    *   `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The final angular momentum `J_f` is the vector sum of the final NN state's angular momentum (`J_{NN_f}`) and the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X (`l_X`).\n    *   For `vec(J_{NN_f}) + vec(l_X)` to equal 0, their magnitudes must be equal: `J_{NN_f} = l_X`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Parity (P):** The total parity of the initial state must equal the total parity of the final state.\n    *   `P_i = P_f`\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   The final parity `P_f` is the product of the final NN state's parity (`P_{NN_f}`), the intrinsic parity of X (`P_X`), and the parity of the relative orbital motion (`(-1)^{l_X}`).\n    *   `P_f = P_{NN_f} * P_X * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{L_{NN_f}} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   Setting `P_i = P_f`: `+1 = (-1)^{L_{NN_f}} * (-1) * (-1)^{l_X}`.\n    *   This simplifies to `(-1)^{L_{NN_f} + l_X} = -1`, which means the sum `L_{NN_f} + l_X` must be an **odd** number.\n\n### 2. Apply the Pauli Statistics Constraint\n\n*   The problem states that for the final NN state, `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   We are given that the final NN state has `T(NN)_f = 0`.\n*   Substituting this into the rule: `0 = S_{NN_f} + L_{NN_f} + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This implies that the sum `S_{NN_f} + L_{NN_f}` must be an **odd** number.\n\n### 3. Summary of Conditions for a Permitted Transition\n\nA transition is permitted only if it satisfies all three of the following conditions:\n1.  `J_{NN_f} = l_X` (from J conservation)\n2.  `L_{NN_f} + l_X` is **odd** (from P conservation)\n3.  `S_{NN_f} + L_{NN_f}` is **odd** (from Pauli statistics for T=0)\n\n### 4. Evaluate Each Option\n\nLet's check each of the given final states against these three conditions.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`3S1`): `S=1, L=0, J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X = 1`.\n1.  `J = l_X`?  `1 = 1`. (✓)\n2.  `L + l_X` odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. (✓)\n3.  `S + L` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓)\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state (`3D3`): `S=1, L=2, J=3`.\n*   Particle X (`f`-wave): `l_X = 3`.\n1.  `J = l_X`?  `3 = 3`. (✓)\n2.  `L + l_X` odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. (✓)\n3.  `S + L` odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. (✓)\n*   Conclusion: This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state (`7D1`): `2S+1=7` -> `S=3`, `L=2`, `J=1`.\n*   Particle X (`p`-wave): `l_X = 1`.\n*   *Note on the state's existence:* A system of two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles) can only have a total spin of S=0 or S=1. Therefore, a state with S=3 is physically impossible for a two-nucleon system. This means the transition is forbidden because the final state cannot exist. However, we will proceed to check the transition rules as instructed.\n1.  `J = l_X`?  `1 = 1`. (✓)\n2.  `L + l_X` odd? `2 + 1 = 3`. (✓)\n3.  `S + L` odd? `3 + 2 = 5`. (✓)\n*   Conclusion: This transition satisfies all the given conservation laws and rules, but is forbidden on the more fundamental ground that the final NN state is impossible.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state (`3P0`): `S=1, L=1, J=0`.\n*   Particle X (`s`-wave): `l_X = 0`.\n1.  `J = l_X`?  `0 = 0`. (✓)\n2.  `L + l_X` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. (✓)\n3.  `S + L` odd? `1 + 1 = 2`. (**X**)\n*   Conclusion: This transition violates the Pauli statistics condition for a T=0 final state. Therefore, this partial wave is **not permitted**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nWhile option (C) describes a transition to a physically impossible state, option (D) is the one that violates the specific selection rules derived from the conservation laws and the Pauli constraint provided in the problem statement. In the context of such physics problems, the goal is typically to apply these specific transition rules. The transition in option (D) is dynamically forbidden by these rules.\n\n<<<D>>>"
