    "The interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions is described by the Lagrangian:\n\n$ \\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\lambda_f f \\bar{\\psi}_f (v + X) \\psi_f $\n\nFor the boson X to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair ($X \\rightarrow f\\bar{f}$), the process must be kinematically allowed. This means that the mass of the decaying particle, $m_X$, must be greater than the sum of the masses of the decay products, $2m_f$. Given that the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, the condition for a decay to be kinematically allowed is:\n\n$ m_X > 2m_f $\n$ 6\\, \\text{GeV} > 2m_f $\n$ 3\\, \\text{GeV} > m_f $\n\nTherefore, the boson X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the mass of the fermion is less than 3 GeV. We will now examine the masses of the fundamental fermions (quarks and leptons) to determine the allowed decays.\n\n**Fermion Masses:**\n\n**Leptons:**\n*   **Electron (e):** The mass of an electron is approximately 0.511 MeV/c², which is equivalent to 0.000511 GeV/c². This is less than 3 GeV, so the decay $X \\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$ is allowed.\n*   **Muon ($\\mu$):** The mass of a muon is approximately 105.7 MeV/c², or 0.1057 GeV/c². This is less than 3 GeV, making the decay $X \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ allowed.\n*   **Tau ($\\tau$):** The tau lepton has a mass of about 1777 MeV/c², or 1.777 GeV/c². Since this is less than 3 GeV, the decay $X \\rightarrow \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ is kinematically allowed.\n\n**Quarks:**\n*   **Up (u):** The mass of an up quark is approximately 2.2 MeV/c², or 0.0022 GeV/c². This is less than 3 GeV, so the decay $X \\rightarrow u\\bar{u}$ is allowed.\n*   **Down (d):** The down quark has a mass of about 4.7 MeV/c², or 0.0047 GeV/c². This is below the 3 GeV threshold, allowing the decay $X \\rightarrow d\\bar{d}$.\n*   **Strange (s):** The mass of the strange quark is approximately 95 MeV/c², or 0.095 GeV/c². This is less than 3 GeV, so the decay $X \\rightarrow s\\bar{s}$ is permitted.\n*   **Charm (c):** The charm quark has a mass of about 1.27 GeV/c². Since this is less than 3 GeV, the decay $X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$ is allowed.\n*   **Bottom (b):** The mass of the bottom quark is approximately 4.18 GeV/c². This is greater than 3 GeV, so the decay $X \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ is kinematically forbidden.\n*   **Top (t):** The top quark is the most massive fundamental particle, with a mass of about 173 GeV/c². This is far greater than 3 GeV, and thus the decay $X \\rightarrow t\\bar{t}$ is not allowed.\n\nBased on this analysis, the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X at the lowest order are into pairs of up, down, strange, and charm quarks, as well as electron-positron, muon-antimuon, and tau-antitau pairs.\n\nThe complete set of allowed decays is:\n$ X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}, s\\bar{s}, u\\bar{u}, d\\bar{d}, \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}, \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-} $\n\nComparing this with the given options:\n*   A) Includes the forbidden decay into bottom quarks and omits decays into charm quarks and muons.\n*   B) Matches the derived set of allowed decays precisely.\n*   C) Includes the forbidden decay into top quarks.\n*   D) Includes the forbidden decay into bottom quarks.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
