    "To determine the time it will take for the astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective, we must account for the effects of time dilation, a consequence of traveling at speeds approaching the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud. This satellite galaxy of the Milky Way is approximately 163,000 light-years from Earth. For the purpose of this calculation, we will use a commonly cited distance of about 160,000 light-years.\n\nFrom the perspective of an observer on Earth, the time of the journey (t) would be the distance divided by the speed. Given the spacecraft's speed (v) is 0.99999987 times the speed of light (c), the time would be:\n\nt = Distance / Speed\nt ≈ 160,000 light-years / 0.99999987c\nt ≈ 160,000 years\n\nHowever, for the astronaut moving at this high velocity, time will pass much more slowly. This phenomenon is known as time dilation and is calculated using the Lorentz transformation equation:\n\nt' = t * √(1 - v²/c²)\n\nWhere:\n*   t' is the time experienced by the astronaut (the proper time).\n*   t is the time measured by the observer on Earth.\n*   v is the velocity of the spacecraft.\n*   c is the speed of light.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nt' ≈ 160,000 * √(1 - (0.99999987c)²/c²)\nt' ≈ 160,000 * √(1 - 0.99999987²)\nt' ≈ 160,000 * √(0.00000025999998)\nt' ≈ 160,000 * 0.0005099\nt' ≈ 81.58 years\n\nThe journey will take approximately 81.6 years from the astronaut's point of view.\n\nThe astronaut is 22 years old and has an average lifespan of 150 solar years, meaning they have 128 years of life remaining. Since the journey of roughly 81 years is well within this remaining lifespan, the astronaut will survive. Upon arrival, the astronaut will be approximately 22 + 81.6 = 103.6 years old.\n\nBased on the calculation, the closest answer is 81 years.\n\n<<<C>>>"
