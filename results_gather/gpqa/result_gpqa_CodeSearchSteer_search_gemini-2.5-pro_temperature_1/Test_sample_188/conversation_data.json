    "When a continuous symmetry of a physical system is spontaneously broken, a massless particle known as a Nambu-Goldstone boson emerges. If the symmetry is only approximate, the resulting particle will have a small mass and is called a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson.\n\n*   **A) Pion:** Pions are the pseudo-Goldstone bosons that result from the spontaneous breaking of the chiral-flavor symmetries in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This symmetry breaking is responsible for most of the mass of nucleons. The pions are the effective particles associated with the broken symmetry generators.\n\n*   **B) Phonon:** In a solid crystal, the continuous translational symmetry of space is spontaneously broken because the atoms arrange themselves into a fixed lattice. Phonons, which are quantized sound waves or vibrational modes in the crystal, are the Goldstone bosons associated with this broken translational symmetry.\n\n*   **C) Magnon:** In ferromagnetic materials, below the Curie temperature, the magnetic moments of the atoms align, spontaneously breaking the rotational symmetry of the system. The resulting Goldstone bosons are magnons, which are quantized spin waves.\n\n*   **D) Skyrmion:** A skyrmion is a topologically stable, particle-like excitation in a field. They were originally proposed as a model for baryons (like protons and neutrons) as topological solitons of a pion field. While skyrmions arise in systems where symmetries are broken, they are not the Nambu-Goldstone bosons themselves. Instead, they are more complex, topologically protected structures. Goldstone bosons are the massless (or light) excitations corresponding to the broken symmetry generators, whereas skyrmions are massive, stable configurations of the field itself.\n\nTherefore, the pion, phonon, and magnon are all effective particles (Goldstone or pseudo-Goldstone bosons) associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. The skyrmion is not.\n\n<<<D>>>"
