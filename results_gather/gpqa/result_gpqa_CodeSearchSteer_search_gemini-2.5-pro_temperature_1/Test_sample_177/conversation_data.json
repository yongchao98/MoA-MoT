    "To determine the mass dimension of κ and the renormalizability of the theory described by the Lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$, we must analyze the mass dimensions of each component of the interaction term.\n\n### 1. Mass Dimensions of Fields and the Lagrangian\n\nIn natural units (where $\\hbar = c = 1$), the action $S = \\int d^4x \\mathcal{L}$ is dimensionless. Since the spacetime volume element $d^4x$ has a mass dimension of $[d^4x] = -4$, the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have a mass dimension of $[\\mathcal{L}] = +4$.\n\nThe mass dimensions of the individual fields are determined from their kinetic terms in the standard model Lagrangian:\n*   **Fermion Field $\\psi$**: The kinetic term for a fermion is $\\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu - m)\\psi$. For the term $\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu\\psi$ to have a mass dimension of 4, and knowing the derivative $\\partial_\\mu$ has a dimension of +1, we find that $2[\\psi] + 1 = 4$. This gives the mass dimension of the fermion field as $[\\psi] = [\\bar{\\psi}] = 3/2$.\n*   **Field Strength Tensor $F^{\\mu\\nu}$**: The kinetic term for the electromagnetic field is $-\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$. For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, the field strength tensor must have a dimension of $[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 2$.\n*   **Sigma Tensor $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$**: This is defined as $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_\\mu, \\gamma_\\nu]$. The gamma matrices $\\gamma_\\mu$ are dimensionless. Therefore, $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is also dimensionless, i.e., $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] = 0$.\n\n### 2. Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant κ\n\nThe interaction Lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}_{int}$ must also have a mass dimension of 4. We can now write the dimensional equation for the given interaction:\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa] + [\\bar{\\psi}] + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] + [\\psi] + [F^{\\mu\\nu}]$\n\nSubstituting the known dimensions:\n$4 = [\\kappa] + \\frac{3}{2} + 0 + \\frac{3}{2} + 2$\n$4 = [\\kappa] + 3 + 2$\n$4 = [\\kappa] + 5$\n\nSolving for the mass dimension of $\\kappa$:\n$[\\kappa] = 4 - 5 = -1$\n\n### 3. Renormalizability of the Theory\n\nThe renormalizability of a quantum field theory is related to the mass dimension of its coupling constants.\n*   If a coupling constant has a **positive** mass dimension, the interaction is called \"super-renormalizable.\"\n*   If a coupling constant has a **zero** mass dimension (it is dimensionless), the interaction is \"renormalizable.\"\n*   If a coupling constant has a **negative** mass dimension, the interaction is \"non-renormalizable.\"\n\nSince the mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1, the theory is non-renormalizable. This means that as we calculate higher-order corrections in perturbation theory, new, more severe divergences appear at each order. An infinite number of counterterms would be required to cancel all these divergences, which strips the theory of its predictive power.\n\nTherefore, the mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable.\n\n<<<B>>>"
