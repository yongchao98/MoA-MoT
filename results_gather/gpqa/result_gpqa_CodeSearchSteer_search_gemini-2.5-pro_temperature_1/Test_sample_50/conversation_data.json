    "To determine the net potential energy of the system, we can use the method of image charges.\n\n1.  **System Description:** We have a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`). The sphere being \"grounded\" means its potential is held at zero.\n\n2.  **Method of Images:** The electric field outside the sphere can be modeled by replacing the sphere with an \"image charge\" `q'`. This image charge is placed at a specific location inside the sphere such that the potential on the surface of the sphere remains zero.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -q * (R/d)`.\n    *   The location of the image charge is at a distance `d' = R^2 / d` from the center, along the line connecting the center and the point charge `q`.\n\n3.  **Calculating Potential Energy:** The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charge on the sphere, which is equivalent to the force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\n    A common misconception is to calculate the potential energy simply as the interaction energy between the point charge `q` and its image `q'`. The correct potential energy of the system is half of the interaction potential energy between the charge and its image.\n\n    The potential `V_image` created by the image charge `q'` at the location of the point charge `q` (at distance `d`) is:\n    `V_image = k * q' / (d - d')`\n    Substituting the values for `q'` and `d'`:\n    `V_image = k * (-qR/d) / (d - R^2/d)`\n    `V_image = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    `V_image = -k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n    The net potential energy `U` of the system is half the product of the real charge `q` and the potential at its location due to the image charge.\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * qR / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Comparing this result with the given options:\n    A) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\n    B) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n    C) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\n    D) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\n\n    The calculated potential energy `U = -(1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)` matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
