    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, let's analyze each option based on established planetary science principles.\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is our baseline. The average density of Earth is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** The density is explicitly given as ~5.5 g/cm³, which is virtually the same as Earth's density.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** For terrestrial (rocky) planets of the same composition, density decreases with mass. This is because there is less gravitational force to compress the planet's material. Therefore, this planet would be less dense than Earth.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** For rocky planets with the same basic composition, an increase in mass leads to greater gravitational compression of the interior. This self-compression results in a higher overall density. A rocky planet that is five times more massive than Earth, but made of the same materials, will be significantly denser than Earth. Studies of exoplanets show that for rocky worlds, density generally increases with mass and radius up to a certain point.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the options:\n*   Planet (a) has a density of ~5.51 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (b) has a density of ~5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (d) has a density lower than 5.51 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (c) has a density significantly higher than 5.51 g/cm³ due to gravitational compression.\n\nTherefore, the planet with five times the mass of Earth will have the highest density.\n\n<<<D>>>"
