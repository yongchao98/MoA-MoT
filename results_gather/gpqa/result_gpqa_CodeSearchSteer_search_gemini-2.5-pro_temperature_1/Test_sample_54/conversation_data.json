    "Based on the analysis of the provided ¹H NMR data, the unknown organic compound is identified as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n1.  **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This signal corresponds to the three protons of a methyl group (CH₃) attached to a carbonyl carbon in an acetate functional group (-OCOCH₃). The 's' (singlet) indicates that there are no adjacent protons to couple with. This feature is present in all four possible compounds.\n\n2.  **Signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This signal represents a methyl group attached to a carbon-carbon double bond (an allylic methyl group). The 'd' (doublet) indicates that it is coupled to a single adjacent proton.\n\n3.  **Signals at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz) and 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** These signals are in the vinylic region, indicating they are protons attached directly to the carbons of a double bond (-CH=CH-).\n    *   The key piece of information is the coupling constant, *J* = 16.0 Hz. For vinylic protons, a coupling constant in the range of 11-18 Hz is characteristic of a *trans* configuration, where the protons are on opposite sides of the double bond. A *cis* configuration would show a smaller coupling constant, typically in the 6-15 Hz range. The large value of 16.0 Hz strongly supports a *trans* geometry, thus eliminating the *cis*-isomers.\n    *   The proton at 7.0 ppm is a doublet ('d'), meaning it's split by one neighboring proton. This is the other vinylic proton.\n    *   The proton at 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets ('dq'). The doublet arises from coupling to the other vinylic proton (at 7.0 ppm), and the quartet arises from coupling to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group (at 1.6 ppm).\n\n### Structure Determination:\n\n*   The data indicates a *trans*-alkene, which eliminates Cis-propenyl acetate (A) and Cis-butenyl acetate (C).\n*   The molecule contains an acetate group, a vinylic methyl group, and two vinylic protons. This matches the structure of propenyl acetate (CH₃COOCH=CHCH₃). A butenyl acetate structure (e.g., CH₃COOCH=CHCH₂CH₃) would have additional, different signals (e.g., for a -CH₂- group) that are not observed in the spectrum.\n*   Therefore, the compound must be a propenyl acetate with a *trans* configuration.\n\nThe structure is confirmed as **Trans-propenyl acetate**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
