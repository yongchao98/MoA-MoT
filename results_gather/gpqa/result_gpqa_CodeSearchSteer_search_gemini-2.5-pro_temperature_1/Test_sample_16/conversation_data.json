    "To determine the concentration of free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) from a solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, we must consider the dissociation of the complex.\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex (represented as CaY²⁻) is given by the equilibrium:\nCa²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ CaY²⁻\n\nThe formation constant, K_f (also denoted as K_Ca-EDTA), is the equilibrium constant for this reaction:\nK_f = [CaY²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\nWe are interested in the dissociation of the complex, which is the reverse reaction:\nCaY²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\nThe initial stoichiometric concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex, [CaY²⁻], is 0.02 M. As the complex dissociates, the concentrations of Ca²⁺ and Y⁴⁻ will increase by an amount 'x', while the concentration of the complex will decrease by 'x'.\n\nWe can set up an equilibrium table:\n\n| Species | Initial Concentration (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium Concentration (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| CaY²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| Y⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\nNow, we substitute these equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression:\nK_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x) = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\nSince the formation constant K_f is very large (5 x 10¹⁰), the equilibrium lies far to the right for the formation reaction, meaning the dissociation is very small. Therefore, 'x' will be significantly smaller than the initial concentration of the complex, 0.02 M. We can make the approximation that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\nNow, we solve for x, which represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ ions:\nx² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻²) / (5 x 10¹⁰)\nx² ≈ 0.4 x 10⁻¹²\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n\nx ≈ √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 2 x 10⁻⁶.⁵\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 2.0x10⁻² M\nB) 1.0x10⁻² M\nC) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\nD) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n\nThe calculated value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
