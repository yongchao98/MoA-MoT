    "The decay of a hydrogen atom from an initial state to a final state via intermediate states is governed by the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the selection rules for electric dipole transitions. These rules dictate which transitions are \"allowed\" to occur.\n\nThe selection rules for a transition from a state $|n, l, m\\rangle$ to $|n', l', m'\\rangle$ are:\n*   The change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number, $\\Delta l$, must be $\\pm 1$.\n*   The change in the magnetic quantum number, $\\Delta m$, must be $0, \\pm 1$.\n\nLet's analyze the proposed decay route $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$:\n\n1.  **First transition: $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$**\n    *   Initial state: $n=3, l=0, m=0$.\n    *   Intermediate state: $n'=2, l'=1, m'=0$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = 1 - 0 = +1$. This is an allowed transition.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0 - 0 = 0$. This is also an allowed transition.\n    Therefore, the first step of the decay is valid according to the selection rules.\n\n2.  **Second transition: $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$**\n    *   Intermediate state: $n=2, l=1, m=0$.\n    *   Final state: $n'=1, l'=0, m'=0$.\n    *   $\\Delta l = l' - l = 0 - 1 = -1$. This is an allowed transition.\n    *   $\\Delta m = m' - m = 0 - 0 = 0$. This is also an allowed transition.\n    Therefore, the second step is also valid. The entire cascade is an allowed process.\n\nNext, we must determine the probability of this specific decay channel. The decay process begins with the transition from the $|3,0,0\\rangle$ (or 3s) state. The only allowed decay according to the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule is to a state with $l=1$ (a p-state). For $n=2$, this corresponds to the $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ (or 2p) states.\n\nThe initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (since $l=0$). Because of this symmetry, there is no preferred direction for the emission of the photon. This means that the three possible intermediate states, $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$, are populated with equal probability. The total probability of transitioning to one of these three states is 1, so the probability for transitioning to any specific one of them is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nOnce the atom is in the intermediate state $|2,1,0\\rangle$, it must decay to a lower energy level. The only possible final state via an electric dipole transition is $|1,0,0\\rangle$, as it is the only state that satisfies the selection rules for a subsequent decay. Thus, the probability of the second step, $|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$, is 1.\n\nThe total probability for the cascade is the product of the probabilities of each step:\n$P(\\text{total}) = P(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times P(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThis matches the path and probability described in option A.\n\nThe correct transition route and probability are:\n$|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$\n\n<<<A>>>"
