    "My initial calculations were correct. The google search results confirm the methodology and the final values.\n\n*   Several sources confirm the process is a two-body decay where the pion is at rest, meaning the decay products must have definite energies.\n*   A source from the Feynman Lectures provides a worked solution using slightly different mass values (in terms of electron mass) but arrives at kinetic energies of 4.08 MeV for the muon and 29.65 MeV for the neutrino, which is very close to my result.\n*   Another source explicitly solves the problem with the given masses (139.6 MeV for the pion) and calculates the muon kinetic energy to be 4.1 MeV and the neutrino energy to be 29.8 MeV.\n*   A publication from Cloudylabs mentions that in the decay of a positive pion, the resulting muon has a kinetic energy of 4.12 MeV.\n\nThe calculations are as follows:\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy**: The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the stationary pion (E_π = m_π * c²). After decay, it is the sum of the total energies of the muon (E_μ) and the neutrino (E_ν).\n    *   m_π * c² = E_μ + E_ν\n    *   139.6 MeV = (KE_μ + m_μ * c²) + E_ν\n    *   139.6 MeV = (KE_μ + 105.7 MeV) + E_ν\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum**: Since the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. The final momenta of the muon (p_μ) and neutrino (p_ν) must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n    *   p_μ = p_ν\n\n3.  **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**:\n    *   For the muon: E_μ² = (p_μ * c)² + (m_μ * c²)²\n    *   For the neutrino (assuming massless): E_ν = p_ν * c\n\n4.  **Solving for Energies**:\n    *   From momentum conservation, we can say p_μ * c = p_ν * c = E_ν.\n    *   Substitute this into the muon's energy relation: E_μ² = E_ν² + (m_μ * c²)²\n    *   From energy conservation, substitute E_ν = m_π * c² - E_μ:\n        E_μ² = (m_π * c² - E_μ)² + (m_μ * c²)²\n    *   Expanding this gives: E_μ² = (m_π * c²)² - 2(m_π * c²)(E_μ) + E_μ² + (m_μ * c²)²\n    *   Solving for E_μ (the total energy of the muon):\n        E_μ = [(m_π * c²)² + (m_μ * c²)²] / [2 * m_π * c²]\n        E_μ = [(139.6)² + (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\n        E_μ = [19488.16 + 11172.49] / 279.2\n        E_μ = 30660.65 / 279.2 ≈ 109.82 MeV\n\n5.  **Calculating Kinetic Energies**:\n    *   **Muon Kinetic Energy (KE_μ)**:\n        KE_μ = E_μ - m_μ * c²\n        KE_μ = 109.82 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 4.12 MeV\n    *   **Neutrino Kinetic Energy (KE_ν)**:\n        The total energy released (Q-value) is the change in rest mass energy: Q = 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV. This is distributed as kinetic energy.\n        KE_total = KE_μ + KE_ν\n        33.9 MeV = 4.12 MeV + KE_ν\n        KE_ν = 33.9 MeV - 4.12 MeV = 29.78 MeV ≈ 29.8 MeV.\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino.\n\nFinal Answer should be B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
