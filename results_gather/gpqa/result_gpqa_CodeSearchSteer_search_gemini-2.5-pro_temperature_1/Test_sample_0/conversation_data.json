    "To clearly distinguish between two quantum energy levels, the difference in their energies must be significantly greater than the energy broadening, or uncertainty, of each level. This energy uncertainty is a consequence of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nThe principle states that the uncertainty in a state's energy (ΔE) and its lifetime (Δt) are inversely related. A quantum state that exists for only a short time cannot have a precisely defined energy. The lifetime of an excited state (τ) gives a measure of the uncertainty in time (Δt), which in turn determines the minimum uncertainty in its energy, often called the natural linewidth. The relationship can be approximated as:\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). A shorter lifetime leads to a broader, more uncertain energy level.\n\nLet's calculate the energy uncertainty for each of the two states:\n\n*   **State 1:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **State 2:**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ ≈ (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nTo resolve the two energy levels, their energy separation must be greater than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties. The total line broadening is dominated by the state with the shorter lifetime (State 1), which has the larger energy uncertainty. Therefore, the required energy difference must be significantly larger than ΔE₁, which is approximately 6.58 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nNow let's examine the given options:\n*   **A) 10⁻¹¹ eV:** This is much smaller than the required energy separation.\n*   **B) 10⁻⁹ eV:** This is also much smaller than the required energy separation.\n*   **C) 10⁻⁴ eV:** This value is several orders of magnitude larger than the calculated energy uncertainty (~10⁻⁷ eV), ensuring the two levels can be clearly distinguished.\n*   **D) 10⁻⁸ eV:** This is smaller than the energy uncertainty of State 1 and is not sufficient for clear resolution.\n\nTherefore, the only energy difference that allows for the two levels to be clearly resolved is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
