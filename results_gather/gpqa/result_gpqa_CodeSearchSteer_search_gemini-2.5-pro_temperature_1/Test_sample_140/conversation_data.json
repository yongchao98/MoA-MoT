    "The reaction of 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds through a benzyne intermediate. The number of possible products is determined by the different intermediates that can form and the ways the nucleophile can add to them.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction pathways:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe strong base, the amide anion (NH2⁻), abstracts an acidic hydrogen (or deuterium) from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the bromine-bearing carbon. In 1-bromo-2-deuterobenzene, there are two such positions:\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of a proton (H):** The base can remove a proton from the C6 position. This is generally faster than removing deuterium due to the kinetic isotope effect. This elimination of HBr leads to a benzyne intermediate where the triple bond is between C1 and C6, and the deuterium remains at C2. This intermediate is **2-deuterobenzyne**.\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of a deuteron (D):** The base can also remove the deuteron from the C2 position. This is a slower process but is still possible. This elimination of DBr results in a benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between C1 and C2. Since the deuterium was removed, this is a **standard, non-deuterated benzyne** intermediate.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Addition to the Benzyne Intermediates**\n\nThe nucleophile, NH2⁻, then attacks the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is protonated by the solvent (liquid ammonia, NH3) to give the final products.\n\n*   **Products from 2-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):**\n    *   **Attack at C1:** The amino group (-NH2) adds to C1, and a subsequent protonation at C6 yields **1-amino-2-deuterobenzene** (also known as 2-deuteroaniline).\n    *   **Attack at C6:** The amino group adds to C6, and a subsequent protonation at C1 yields **1-amino-3-deuterobenzene** (also known as 3-deuteroaniline).\n    *   Thus, the deuterated benzyne intermediate leads to two distinct deuterated aniline products.\n\n*   **Product from standard benzyne (from Pathway B):**\n    *   **Attack at C1 or C2:** The amino group can add to either C1 or C2 of the symmetrical benzyne. In either case, subsequent protonation yields the same single product: **aniline** (which contains no deuterium).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the outcomes of both possible pathways, three different organic products can be formed in this reaction:\n1.  1-amino-2-deuterobenzene\n2.  1-amino-3-deuterobenzene\n3.  Aniline\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 3 possible organic products.\n\n<<<A>>>"
