    "To identify the unknown compound, the provided spectroscopic data must be matched with one of the four possible chemical structures.\n\n### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration, also consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   All four options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so the FTIR data confirms the presence of this functional group but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The information that no peaks correspond to vinyl hydrogens indicates the absence of carbon-carbon double bonds, which is consistent with all four saturated structures.\n    *   The key to identifying the correct structure lies in analyzing the complex splitting patterns, which arise from the coupling of a proton with its non-equivalent neighboring protons.\n        *   **Doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq):** This pattern indicates a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons: one proton (causing a doublet), a set of two equivalent protons (causing a triplet), and a set of three equivalent protons (causing a quartet).\n        *   **Doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt):** This pattern suggests a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: one proton (doublet), a set of two equivalent protons (triplet), and another distinct set of two equivalent protons (triplet).\n\n### Evaluation of Potential Structures\n\nLet's analyze the expected splitting for the most complex proton signals in each molecule:\n\n*   **Structure A: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**\n    *   Let's label the protons on the main chain: `CH₃(a)-CH(b)(C₂H₅)-CH(e)(C₂H₅)-CH₂(h)-COOH`.\n    *   The proton **H(b)** is coupled to three neighbors: H(e) (1H, creating a doublet), the adjacent CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, creating a triplet), and the terminal CH₃ group (3H, creating a quartet). This combination results in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   The proton **H(e)** is coupled to three neighbors: H(b) (1H, creating a doublet), the adjacent CH₂ of its ethyl group (2H, creating a triplet), and the CH₂ group alpha to the carbonyl (2H, creating another triplet). This results in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   This structure is the only one that produces both a dtq and a dtt signal.\n\n*   **Structure B: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH (2,4-diethylhexanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton at the C4 position is coupled to the proton at C2 (1H), the methylene protons of the C4-ethyl group (2H), and the methylene protons of the adjacent CH₂CH₃ group (2H). This would give a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n    *   However, no proton in this molecule is adjacent to a single proton, a group of two protons, *and* a group of three protons simultaneously. Therefore, a dtq signal is not expected.\n\n*   **Structure C: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH (2,4-dimethylhexanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton at the C4 position is coupled to the proton at C2 (1H), the adjacent methyl group (3H), and the adjacent methylene group (2H). This would produce a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   No proton in this molecule is adjacent to one proton and two separate groups of two protons. Therefore, a dtt signal is not expected.\n\n*   **Structure D: CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH (3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid)**\n    *   The proton at the C3 position is coupled to the proton at C4 (1H), the C3-methyl group (3H), and the C2-methylene group (2H). This would result in a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n    *   No proton in this structure has the required neighbors to produce a dtt signal.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, only structure A can account for both the \"doublet of triplets of quartets\" and the \"doublet of triplets of triplets\" signals described in the ¹H NMR data.\n\n<<<A>>>"
