    "### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n**Reaction I:** The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, a chiral ketone with one stereocenter at the C5 position. Reduction of the ketone at C3 with Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LAH) creates a new stereocenter. Because a new stereocenter is formed in a molecule that is already chiral, the two possible products are diastereomers. The starting (S) configuration at C5 remains unchanged, while the new alcohol at C3 can be either (R) or (S). This results in the formation of two distinct diastereomeric products: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n\n**Reaction II:** The starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, an achiral diketone. Treatment with excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) reduces both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups, forming pentane-2,4-diol. This reaction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The possible stereoisomers are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), and a meso compound, (2R, 4S). The (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers are a pair of enantiomers. The meso compound is achiral and is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair. Therefore, Reaction II produces three distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe final mixture, containing the products from both reactions, consists of a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n### Chromatographic Analysis\n\n**Normal-Phase HPLC:**\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in polarity. It can distinguish between constitutional isomers and diastereomers because they have different physical properties. However, it cannot separate enantiomers, which have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n\n*   **From Reaction I:** The two products, (3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers and will be separated into **two peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will not be separated and will elute as a **single peak**. The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will elute as a separate, **second peak**.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C6 ether-alcohols) and Reaction II (C5 diols) are structurally different molecules and will have different retention times.\n*   Therefore, the total number of peaks observed in the normal-phase HPLC will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Chiral HPLC:**\nChiral HPLC utilizes a chiral stationary phase (CSP) which allows for the separation of enantiomers in addition to diastereomers. The different stereoisomers interact differently with the CSP, leading to different retention times.\n\n*   Each of the five unique stereoisomers in the mixture will be resolved by the chiral column.\n    *   (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 1)\n    *   (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (Peak 2)\n    *   (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 3)\n    *   (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (Peak 4)\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso) (Peak 5)\n*   Therefore, the total number of peaks observed in the chiral HPLC will be **5 peaks**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC.\n\n<<<B>>>"
