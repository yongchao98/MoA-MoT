    "The provided 1H NMR data for a 1:1 mixture of two C10H14 aromatic compounds indicates the presence of two singlets in the aromatic region (~6.7 ppm) with a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets in the alkyl region (~2.2 ppm) with a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's analyze the expected 1H NMR signals for each potential compound:\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, all four methyl groups are equivalent, and the two aromatic protons are equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** One singlet (for 2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** One singlet (for 12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry. The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at positions 2 and 3 are equivalent. The two aromatic protons at positions 5 and 6 are also equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** One singlet (for 2H).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** Two singlets (one for 6H, one for 6H, a 1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule has lower symmetry. It shows two distinct aromatic protons and three sets of non-equivalent methyl groups.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** Two singlets (1H each).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** Three singlets (in a 6H:3H:3H ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has four equivalent aromatic protons. The ethyl groups would produce a quartet and a triplet, not singlets, in the alkyl region. Therefore, it can be ruled out.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the mixture options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would result in three aromatic signals (one from the first compound and two from the second), which contradicts the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic Spectrum:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet, and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives one 2H singlet. In a 1:1 mixture, this results in two singlets of equal integration (1:1 ratio), which matches the experimental data.\n    *   **Alkyl Spectrum:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene gives one singlet (corresponding to 12H). 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene gives two singlets (each corresponding to 6H). The combination would show three singlets with an integration ratio of 12H:6H:6H, which simplifies to 2:1:1. This perfectly matches the experimental data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** This mixture would produce three aromatic signals, which is inconsistent with the observed spectrum.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:** This combination is incorrect due to the number of aromatic signals and the signal splitting (quartet/triplet) from 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\nBased on the analysis, the mixture must contain 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
