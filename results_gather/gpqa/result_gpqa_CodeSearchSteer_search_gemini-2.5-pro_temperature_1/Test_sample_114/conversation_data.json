    "To solve this problem, we must apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum to the electron-positron annihilation process.\n\n**1. Initial State: Energy and Momentum**\n\nFirst, we calculate the total energy and momentum of the system before the collision. The electron and positron have the same rest mass (let's call it `m`).\n\n*   **Relativistic Energy:** The total energy of a particle is given by `E = γmc²`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor, `m` is the rest mass, and `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   Energy of the electron (E_e): `E_e = γ_e * mc² = 4mc²`\n    *   Energy of the positron (E_p): `E_p = γ_p * mc² = 2mc²`\n    *   **Total Initial Energy (E_initial):** `E_initial = E_e + E_p = 4mc² + 2mc² = 6mc²`\n\n*   **Relativistic Momentum:** The magnitude of the relativistic momentum of a particle is `p = sqrt(E² - (mc²)²) / c`.\n    *   Momentum of the electron (p_e): `p_e = sqrt((4mc²)² - (mc²)²) / c = sqrt(16m²c⁴ - m²c⁴) / c = sqrt(15m²c⁴) / c = mc * sqrt(15)`\n    *   Momentum of the positron (p_p): `p_p = sqrt((2mc²)² - (mc²)²) / c = sqrt(4m²c⁴ - m²c⁴) / c = sqrt(3m²c⁴) / c = mc * sqrt(3)`\n\nSince the electron moves from the left and the positron from the right along the horizontal axis, their momenta have opposite signs.\n*   **Total Initial Momentum (p_initial):** `p_initial = p_e - p_p = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * mc`\n\n**2. Final State: Energy and Momentum**\n\nAfter annihilation, two photons are produced. Let the energy of each photon be `E_γ` and their momentum be `p_γ`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total initial energy equals the total final energy.\n    *   `E_initial = E_final`\n    *   `6mc² = E_γ1 + E_γ2`\n    *   Since the problem states the photons have the same energy: `6mc² = 2E_γ`, which means `E_γ = 3mc²`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum must also be conserved. The momentum of a photon is `p_γ = E_γ / c`.\n    *   `p_γ = (3mc²) / c = 3mc`.\n    *   The two photons move away at angles `θ` and `-θ` with respect to the initial horizontal axis. The total final momentum in the horizontal direction is the sum of the horizontal components of each photon's momentum.\n    *   `p_final = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(-θ) = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)`\n    *   The vertical components of the momentum cancel each other out `(p_γ * sin(θ) - p_γ * sin(θ) = 0)`, which is consistent with the initial state.\n\n**3. Calculating the Angle**\n\nBy equating the initial and final momentum:\n*   `p_initial = p_final`\n*   `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * mc = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)`\n\nNow, substitute the value of `p_γ`:\n*   `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * mc = 2 * (3mc) * cos(θ)`\n*   `(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * mc = 6mc * cos(θ)`\n\nWe can cancel `mc` from both sides and solve for `cos(θ)`:\n*   `cos(θ) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6`\n\nUsing a calculator:\n*   `sqrt(15) ≈ 3.87298`\n*   `sqrt(3) ≈ 1.73205`\n*   `cos(θ) ≈ (3.87298 - 1.73205) / 6 ≈ 2.14093 / 6 ≈ 0.35682`\n\nNow, we find the angle `θ`:\n*   `θ = arccos(0.35682) ≈ 69.09°`\n\nThe question asks for the angle *between* the directions of the two photons, which is `2θ`.\n*   Angle = `2 * 69.09° = 138.18°`\n\nThis value is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
