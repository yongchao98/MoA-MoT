    "When 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated, it undergoes a-sigmatropic rearrangement known as the Cope rearrangement. This type of reaction is characteristic of 1,5-dienes and involves a concerted, cyclic shift of electrons through a six-membered transition state.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n1.  **Identify the starting material:** The starting molecule is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Its structure is a nine-carbon chain with double bonds starting at carbons 2 and 6, and a butyl group attached to carbon 5.\n\n    CH₃–CH=CH–CH₂–CH(C₄H₉)–CH=CH–CH₂–CH₃\n\n2.  **Apply the Cope Rearrangement:** The core of the molecule that participates in the rearrangement is the 1,5-diene system, which includes carbons 2 through 7 (C2=C3-C4-C5-C6=C7). In this pericyclic reaction, the sigma (σ) bond between carbons 4 and 5 breaks, while a new sigma bond forms between carbons 2 and 7. Simultaneously, the pi (π) bonds shift from their original positions (C2=C3 and C6=C7) to new positions (C3=C4 and C5=C6).\n\n3.  **Determine the product's structure:** This reorganization of bonds results in a new molecule with a different carbon skeleton. To determine its name, we must identify the new longest carbon chain that contains the principal functional groups (the double bonds).\n\n    *   The rearrangement connects the original C2 and C7 atoms.\n    *   The new double bonds are located at C3=C4 and C5=C6.\n    *   The substituents (methyl group from C1, ethyl group from C8-C9, and the butyl group on C5) are now positioned on a new parent chain.\n\n4.  **Name the product:** By tracing the longest carbon chain that includes both new double bonds, we find a 10-carbon chain (a decadiene). Following IUPAC nomenclature rules for numbering the chain to give the double bonds the lowest possible locants (positions 1 and 5) and identifying the attached groups, the resulting product is named **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**.\n\nTherefore, heating 5-butylnona-2,6-diene yields 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene.\n\n<<<B>>>"
