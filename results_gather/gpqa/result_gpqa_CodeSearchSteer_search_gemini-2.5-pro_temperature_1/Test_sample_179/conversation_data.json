    "The problem asks for the minimum energy of an isolated system of 13 identical particles. Each particle has a charge of `q = 2e`. One particle is fixed at a point P, and the other 12 are constrained to be on the surface of a sphere of radius `R = 2 m` centered at P.\n\nThe total electrostatic potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of all unique pairs of charges. This can be divided into two parts:\n1.  The interaction energy between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere (`U_center`).\n2.  The interaction energy among the 12 charges on the sphere themselves (`U_sphere`).\n\nThe total minimum energy is `U_total = U_center + U_sphere`.\n\n**1. Interaction Energy `U_center`**\n\nThe central charge `q` interacts with each of the 12 charges `q` on the sphere. The distance for each of these interactions is fixed at `R = 2 m`.\nThe potential energy for one such pair is `k * q^2 / R`, where `k` is Coulomb's constant.\nSince there are 12 such pairs, the total energy for this part is:\n`U_center = 12 * (k * q^2 / R)`\n\n**2. Interaction Energy `U_sphere`**\n\nThe 12 charges on the sphere will arrange themselves to minimize their mutual repulsion energy. This is a classic physics problem known as the Thomson problem. For N=12 particles, the minimum energy configuration is achieved when the charges are located at the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\nThe potential energy of this configuration is given by:\n`U_sphere = k * q^2 * Σ(1/r_ij)` where the sum is over all 66 pairs of charges on the sphere, and `r_ij` is the distance between them.\n\nThis can be expressed as `U_sphere = (k * q^2 / R) * E_12`, where `E_12` is the dimensionless energy constant for the icosahedral configuration on a unit sphere. `E_12` is the sum of the reciprocal distances between the vertices of an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius 1.\n\nThe value of `E_12` can be calculated from the geometry of the icosahedron. An icosahedron has 30 edges (shortest distance between vertices), 30 shorter diagonals, and 6 main diagonals (longest distance, passing through the center). A detailed calculation based on the coordinates of the vertices of an icosahedron `(0, ±1, ±φ)` (where `φ` is the golden ratio) leads to the following value for `E_12`:\n`E_12 = 15 * φ * sqrt(φ+2) + 3 ≈ 49.1753`\n\n**3. Total Minimum Energy `U_total`**\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of these two components:\n`U_total = U_center + U_sphere = (12 * k * q^2 / R) + (E_12 * k * q^2 / R)`\n`U_total = (12 + E_12) * (k * q^2 / R)`\n\nNow, we plug in the values for the constants:\n*   Charge `q = 2e = 2 * 1.602176634 × 10^-19 C`.\n*   Coulomb's constant `k = 1 / (4πε₀) ≈ 8.98755 × 10^9 N⋅m²/C²`.\n*   Radius `R = 2 m`.\n*   Dimensionless energy `E_12 ≈ 49.1753`.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the term `k * q^2 / R`:\n`q^2 = (2 * 1.602176634 × 10^-19)^2 ≈ 1.02678 × 10^-37 C²`\n`k * q^2 ≈ (8.98755 × 10^9) * (1.02678 × 10^-37) ≈ 9.2285 × 10^-28 J⋅m`\n`k * q^2 / R ≈ (9.2285 × 10^-28) / 2 ≈ 4.61425 × 10^-28 J`\n\nFinally, we calculate the total energy:\n`U_total = (12 + 49.1753) * (4.61425 × 10^-28 J)`\n`U_total = 61.1753 * 4.61425 × 10^-28 J`\n`U_total ≈ 2.82245 × 10^-26 J`\n\nRounding to three decimal places, the minimum energy of the system is `2.822 x 10^-26 J`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
