    "The derivation performed in the thought process is consistent and accurate based on fundamental principles of statistical mechanics applied to astrophysics.\n\n1.  **Boltzmann Equation:** The relationship between the populations of two energy levels (a and b) for a system in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in the higher energy state (N_b) to the number in the lower energy state (N_a) is:\n    N_b / N_a = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-(E_b - E_a) / (k * T)]\n    where `g_b` and `g_a` are the statistical weights of the levels, ΔE = (E_b - E_a) is the energy difference, `k` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature.\n\n2.  **Applying to the Stars:**\n    *   Let R_1 be the population ratio for star_1 at temperature T_1.\n    *   Let R_2 be the population ratio for star_2 at temperature T_2.\n\n    R_1 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)]\n    R_2 = (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n3.  **Using the Problem's Condition:** The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2, which means R_1 = 2 * R_2.\n\n    (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * (g_b / g_a) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n4.  **Simplifying the Equation:** The statistical weight term `(g_b / g_a)` cancels out.\n    exp[-ΔE / (k * T_1)] = 2 * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_2)]\n\n    Dividing both sides by the exponential term for star_2 gives:\n    exp[(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2))] = 2\n    exp[(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)] = 2\n\n5.  **Taking the Natural Logarithm:**\n    (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\n6.  **Substituting Given Values:** The problem provides that the energy difference ΔE is approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. The Boltzmann constant, k, is defined as exactly 1.380649 x 10^(-23) J/K. Therefore, the ratio ΔE / k is approximately 1.\n\n    (1) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\n7.  **Final Algebraic Step:** Combining the fractions on the left side gives the final relation:\n    (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) = ln(2)\n\nThis result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
