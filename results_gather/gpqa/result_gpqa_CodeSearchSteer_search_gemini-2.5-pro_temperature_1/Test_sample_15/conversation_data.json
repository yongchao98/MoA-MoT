    "To determine how many of the compounds will exhibit optical activity, we need to assess each one for chirality. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This often, but not always, involves the presence of a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) and the absence of any internal planes of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\n1.  ***(Z)***-**1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This is an alkene. The carbons involved in the double bond (C1 and C2) are sp2-hybridized and cannot be chiral centers. There are no other carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. Therefore, the molecule has no chiral centers. Its mirror image is superimposable, making it achiral and optically inactive.\n\n2.  ***(3aR,7aS,E)***-**8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name of this complex bicyclic compound includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. These descriptors specify a single, specific enantiomer. By definition, a single enantiomer of a chiral compound is optically active.\n\n3.  ***(2R,3S)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons C2 and C3. However, the `(2R,3S)` configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry. Such compounds are called meso compounds. Despite having chiral centers, meso compounds are achiral overall and thus optically inactive.\n\n4.  ***(2R,3R)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration lacks an internal plane of symmetry. This molecule is chiral, and its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2S,3S) enantiomer. As a specific enantiomer, it is optically active.\n\n5.  ***(R)***-**cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The name specifies the `(R)` configuration at the carbon atom C1, which is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), and two different carbon pathways within the ring (-CH=CH- and -CH2-CH2-). This makes C1 a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is optically active.\n\n6.  ***(1s,3s,5s)***-**cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: The `(1s,3s,5s)` notation, often equivalent to *cis*, indicates that all three hydroxyl (-OH) groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement gives the molecule a high degree of symmetry, including a C3 rotational axis and three planes of symmetry that each pass through a C-OH bond. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: Examining the structure, `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`, reveals no chiral centers. The carbon at position 3 is bonded to a hydrogen and two identical methyl groups. The carbonyl carbon is sp2-hybridized. No carbon in the cyclopentyl ring is attached to four different groups. The molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n\nCounting the compounds that will exhibit optical activity:\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: **Yes**\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: **Yes**\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: **Yes**\n\nA total of 3 compounds will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<B>>>"
