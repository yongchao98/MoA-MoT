    "Here's a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct option:\n\n1.  **Identify the Radiating System**: The problem describes an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution. The simplest, most dominant form of radiation from an oscillating charge system is electric dipole radiation. This occurs when the center of charge oscillates, creating a time-varying electric dipole moment. While a deforming spheroid could also produce higher-order radiation (like quadrupole), electric dipole radiation is the most fundamental and a \"possible form\" as requested by the question.\n\n2.  **Angular Dependence of Radiated Power (f(θ))**: For an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, the time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle (`dP/dΩ`) is given by the Larmor formula. The angular part of this formula is proportional to `sin²(θ)`, where `θ` is the angle from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis).\n    *   `dP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)`\n\n3.  **Maximum Power (A)**: The radiated power is maximum when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis). Therefore, the maximum power, `A`, is proportional to `sin²(90°) = 1`.\n\n4.  **Fraction of Power at θ = 30°**: To find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle of 30°, we calculate `sin²(30°)`.\n    *   `sin(30°) = 1/2`\n    *   `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`\n    *   Thus, the power radiated at 30° is `A * (1/4)`, or 1/4 of the maximum power.\n\n5.  **Wavelength Dependence (f(λ))**: The power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency, `ω⁴`.\n    *   `P ∝ ω⁴`\n    *   The relationship between angular frequency (`ω`) and wavelength (`λ`) is `ω = 2πc/λ`, where `c` is the speed of light.\n    *   Substituting this into the proportionality, we get: `P ∝ (1/λ)⁴` or `P ∝ λ⁻⁴`.\n    *   Therefore, a possible form for the function `f` includes a `λ⁻⁴` dependence.\n\n6.  **Considering Other Radiation Types**: If the spheroid were deforming in a way that its dipole moment remained zero (e.g., oscillating from prolate to oblate), it would act as an electric quadrupole. Electric quadrupole radiation power is proportional to `ω⁶`, which means a `λ⁻⁶` dependence. The angular distribution for the simplest axial quadrupole is proportional to `sin²(2θ)`. In this case, the fraction at 30° would be `sin²(60°) = (√3/2)² = 3/4`. This matches the numbers in option A, but the question asks for *a possible form*, and the electric dipole is the most fundamental form of radiation.\n\n7.  **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of the most common form of radiation, the electric dipole model, the fraction of maximum power at 30° is 1/4, and the power depends on the wavelength as `λ⁻⁴`. This combination matches option D.\n\nThe fraction of A is 1/4, and a possible form of f is proportional to `λ⁻⁴`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
