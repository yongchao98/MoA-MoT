    "To calculate the amount of non-Gaussianity (nG) in the given Schrödinger cat state, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the State and Measure**:\n    *   The state is given by |ψ> = (cos(φ)|α> + sin(φ)|-α>)/N. For the given parameters φ = -π/4 and α = 0.5, the state becomes an odd Schrödinger cat state: |ψ> = (|α> - |-α>) / N', where N' is the new normalization constant.\n    *   The measure of non-Gaussianity is the relative entropy `del_b = trace(ρ ln ρ) - trace(τ ln τ)`. This can be written as S(τ) - S(ρ), where S is the von Neumann entropy.\n    *   ρ = |ψ><ψ| is the density matrix of the cat state. Since it is a pure state, its entropy S(ρ) is 0.\n    *   τ is the density matrix of the reference Gaussian state. This state is chosen to have the same first and second moments (mean displacement and covariance matrix) as ρ.\n    *   Therefore, the non-Gaussianity is simply the entropy of the reference Gaussian state, `del_b` = S(τ).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Moments of the State ρ**:\n    *   We need to find the first moment (<a>) and the second moments (<a²> and <a†a>) for the state ρ.\n    *   **First moment (mean amplitude)**: <a> = 0.\n    *   **Second moment (<a²>)**: <a²> = α² = 0.5² = 0.25.\n    *   **Second moment (mean photon number)**: The average photon number is given by <n> = <a†a> = α² coth(α²). For α = 0.5, α² = 0.25.\n        *   coth(0.25) ≈ 4.083\n        *   <n> ≈ 0.25 * 4.083 ≈ 1.021.\n\n3.  **Determine the Reference Gaussian State τ**:\n    *   The reference state τ is a Gaussian state that has the same moments as ρ: <a>_τ = 0, <a²>_τ = 0.25, and <n>_τ ≈ 1.021.\n    *   A general single-mode centered Gaussian state is a squeezed thermal state, characterized by a squeezing parameter `r` and a thermal photon number `n_th`.\n    *   By matching the moments, we can solve for `r` and `n_th`. The equations are:\n        *   n_th * cosh(2r) + sinh²(r) = 1.021\n        *   sinh(2r) * (n_th + 1/2) = 0.25\n    *   Solving this system of equations yields a thermal photon number `n_th` that is very close to 1 (approximately 1.01).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Entropy of the Reference State S(τ)**:\n    *   The entropy of a squeezed thermal state is determined solely by its thermal photon number `n_th`. Squeezing is a unitary operation that does not change the entropy of the initial thermal state.\n    *   The entropy is given by the formula S(τ) = (n_th + 1)ln(n_th + 1) - n_thln(n_th).\n    *   Using the calculated value of n_th ≈ 1, we can approximate the entropy:\n        *   S(τ) ≈ (1 + 1)ln(1 + 1) - 1*ln(1) = 2ln(2).\n        *   S(τ) ≈ 2 * 0.693 = 1.386.\n\nThis value is very close to option A. A more precise calculation using n_th = 1.01 gives an entropy of approximately 1.39, confirming that 1.38 is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
