    "In a universe with isolated magnetic north or south poles (magnetic monopoles), two of Maxwell's equations would need to be modified.\n\n*   **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** This law, which in our universe is expressed as ∇·B = 0, is the mathematical statement that magnetic monopoles do not exist. It signifies that magnetic field lines are always closed loops, with no starting or ending points. If magnetic monopoles did exist, they would act as sources or sinks for the magnetic field, much like electric charges do for the electric field. The equation would change to show that the divergence of the magnetic field (∇·B) is proportional to the density of magnetic charge.\n\n*   **Faraday's Law of Induction:** To maintain the symmetry of Maxwell's equations, the existence of magnetic monopoles implies the possibility of a \"magnetic current,\" which is the flow of these magnetic charges. In our universe, Faraday's Law (∇×E = -∂B/∂t) states that a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field. In a universe with magnetic monopoles, a magnetic current would also create a circulating electric field, adding a new term to the equation. This makes the equation for the circulation of the electric field different.\n\nTherefore, the two equations that would change are the one related to the divergence of the magnetic field (Gauss's law for magnetism) and the one related to the circulation of the electric field (Faraday's law of induction).\n\n<<<C>>>"
