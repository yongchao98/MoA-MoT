    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], we must first calculate the fraction of each cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\nThe relevant equilibria for the formation of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are:\nCo²⁺ + SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)]⁺, with an overall stability constant β₁ = 9\nCo²⁺ + 2SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂], with an overall stability constant β₂ = 40\nCo²⁺ + 3SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, with an overall stability constant β₃ = 63\nCo²⁺ + 4SCN⁻ ⇌ [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻, with an overall stability constant β₄ = 16\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of all cobalt-containing species:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nThe fraction of any single species, for instance [Co(SCN)ₙ]²⁻ⁿ, is its concentration divided by the total cobalt concentration. This fraction, denoted as αₙ, can be calculated using the following general formula, which is a standard method for determining species distribution in complexation equilibria.\n\nαₙ = (βₙ[L]ⁿ) / (1 + Σ(βᵢ[L]ⁱ))\n\nWhere:\n*   αₙ is the fraction of the complex with 'n' ligands.\n*   βₙ is the overall stability constant for that complex (note that β₀ is defined as 1).\n*   [L] is the concentration of the free ligand, which is [SCN⁻] in this case.\n\nGiven the concentrations c(Co) = 10⁻² M and [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M, and because the ligand concentration is significantly higher than the metal ion concentration, we can approximate the free ligand concentration [SCN⁻] to be equal to its total concentration, 0.1 M.\n\nWe are interested in the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)₂], which corresponds to n=2. The fraction α₂ is:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻]¹ + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the denominator (D):\nD = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.1²) + (63 * 0.1³) + (16 * 0.1⁴)\nD = 1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001)\nD = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016\nD = 2.3646\n\nNext, calculate the numerator for α₂:\nNumerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\nNow, we can find the fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage of [Co(SCN)₂] = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nThus, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex in the solution is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<B>>>"
