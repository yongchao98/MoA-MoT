    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine**\nThis reaction is the α-bromination of a ketone. A bromine atom is added to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-Bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide**\nWhen an α-halo ketone with available protons on the other side of the carbonyl is treated with a strong base like sodium hydroxide, it can undergo a Favorskii rearrangement. This reaction involves the formation of a bicyclic intermediate (a cyclopropanone) which then opens up to form a ring-contracted carboxylic acid (after protonation). In this case, the six-membered ring of 2-bromocyclohexanone contracts to a five-membered ring.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine**\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl).\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O*t*-Bu)₃) is a mild, sterically hindered reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce reactive acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to an alcohol.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Determining the Number of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe structure is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\n1.  **Aldehyde Proton:** The single proton of the aldehyde group (-CHO) is in a unique chemical environment. This is **one** type of hydrogen.\n2.  **Alpha-Proton:** The proton on the carbon atom of the ring to which the aldehyde group is attached (C1) is also unique. This is a **second** type of hydrogen.\n3.  **Beta-Protons:** The two carbon atoms adjacent to C1 (C2 and C5) are equivalent due to a plane of symmetry that bisects the molecule. However, the two protons on C2 are not equivalent to each other; they are diastereotopic because of the chiral center at C1. One proton is *cis* to the aldehyde group, and the other is *trans*. The same applies to the protons on C5. The *cis* proton on C2 is equivalent to the *cis* proton on C5, and the *trans* proton on C2 is equivalent to the *trans* proton on C5. This gives **two** more distinct types of hydrogens.\n4.  **Gamma-Protons:** The remaining two carbons (C3 and C4) are also equivalent due to the same plane of symmetry. Like the beta-protons, the two protons on C3 are diastereotopic, as are the two on C4. This results in **two** additional distinct types of hydrogens.\n\nCounting them up:\n*   1 (aldehyde H) + 1 (alpha H) + 2 (beta H's) + 2 (gamma H's) = **6**\n\nTherefore, there are 6 chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
