    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n1.  **Define Mean Free Path (MFP):** The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between successive collisions. It is inversely proportional to the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ). The general formula is:\n    λ = 1 / (n * σ)\n\n2.  **Analyze λ1 (MFP of Gas Molecules):**\n    *   λ1 represents the mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules.\n    *   The particle and the target are both gas molecules.\n    *   The collision cross-section, let's call it σ₁, is the kinetic cross-section for molecule-molecule collisions. This is determined by the effective size of the molecules. For two identical spherical molecules of radius R, the collision cross-section is σ = π(2R)².\n    *   Because the target molecules are also in random motion, a correction factor of the square root of 2 is introduced to account for the average relative velocity.\n    *   Therefore, the formula for λ1 is: **λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ₁) **\n\n3.  **Analyze λ2 (MFP of Electrons):**\n    *   λ2 represents the mean free path of a beam electron colliding with the gas molecules.\n    *   The particle is a high-energy electron, and the target is a gas molecule.\n    *   The collision cross-section, σ₂, is for electron-molecule scattering.\n    *   A high-energy (1000 kV) electron is a tiny, penetrating point-like particle compared to the much larger gas molecule. The interaction is governed by electromagnetic forces rather than simple \"hard-sphere\" collisions.\n    *   Crucially, the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron with a gas molecule (σ₂) is significantly smaller than the kinetic collision cross-section between two gas molecules (σ₁). The electron can often pass through the atomic structure of the molecule without a significant scattering event that would count as a \"collision\" in the MFP context.\n    *   In the formula for λ2, the target gas molecules can be considered nearly stationary compared to the very high-velocity beam electrons, so the √2 correction factor is not used.\n    *   Therefore, the formula for λ2 is: **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ₂) **\n\n4.  **Compare λ1 and λ2:**\n    *   We have λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ₁) and λ2 = 1 / (n * σ₂).\n    *   The ratio of the two is: λ2 / λ1 = (1 / (n * σ₂)) / (1 / (√2 * n * σ₁)) = (√2 * σ₁) / σ₂.\n    *   From our physical understanding, the electron-molecule scattering cross-section is much smaller than the molecule-molecule cross-section (σ₂ << σ₁).\n    *   This means the ratio σ₁/σ₂ is a large number (much greater than 1).\n    *   Therefore, λ2 / λ1 is also a large number, meaning **λ2 >> λ1**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ2 = λ1: Incorrect.\n    *   B) λ2 < λ1: Incorrect.\n    *   C) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1: This aligns with the conclusion that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1. It provides a lower bound for the relationship, which is consistent with our finding that λ2 >> λ1.\n    *   D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1: This is incorrect. It suggests that λ2 is only slightly larger than λ1 (less than 22% larger), which contradicts the physics. The difference in cross-sections dictates a much larger difference in the mean free paths.\n\nThe correct conclusion is that the mean free path of the electrons is substantially longer than the mean free path of the gas molecules. Option C is the only one that reflects this physical reality.\n\n<<<C>>>"
