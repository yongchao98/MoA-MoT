    "Here is the step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Identify the Frames of Reference and Given Information\n\n*   **Ejecta's Reference Frame (Moving Frame):** This is the frame of reference of the supernova ejecta. The time that passes in this frame is the proper time, `Δt₀`.\n*   **Galaxy's Reference Frame (Stationary Frame):** This is the frame from which we want to measure the distance traveled. Time in this frame is `Δt`.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** The speed of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is 60,000 km/s.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time elapsed in the ejecta's frame is 50 seconds.\n*   **Speed of Light (c):** Approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n### 2. Understand the Goal\n\nThe question asks for the distance the ejecta travels as measured from the Galaxy's reference frame. To find this distance (`d`), we need to multiply the ejecta's velocity (`v`) by the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (`Δt`).\n\n`d = v * Δt`\n\n### 3. Apply the Time Dilation Formula\n\nDue to the effects of special relativity, time passes differently for observers in relative motion. The time elapsed in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is related to the proper time in the moving frame (`Δt₀`) by the time dilation formula.\n\nThe formula for time dilation is: `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n\nWhere:\n*   `Δt` is the time observed in the stationary frame (the Galaxy).\n*   `Δt₀` is the proper time observed in the moving frame (the ejecta), which is 50 s.\n*   `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ)\n\nThe Lorentz factor accounts for the relativistic effects and is calculated using the formula:\n\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nFirst, let's find the ratio of the ejecta's velocity to the speed of light:\n`v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n\nNow, substitute this into the Lorentz factor formula:\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √(0.96)`\n`γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206`\n\n### 5. Calculate the Time Elapsed in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt)\n\nNow we can calculate the time that has passed in the Galaxy's reference frame using the time dilation formula:\n\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀ ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n\nSo, while 50 seconds have passed for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy's frame would measure about 51.03 seconds.\n\n### 6. Calculate the Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame (d)\n\nFinally, calculate the distance the ejecta traveled as measured from the Galaxy's frame:\n\n`d = v * Δt ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km`\n\nThis value is very close to 3,060,000 km.\n\nAlternatively, we can combine the steps into a single formula for a more precise calculation:\n`d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀) = v * (1 / √(1 - v²/c²)) * Δt₀`\n`d = 60,000 km/s * 50 s / √(1 - 0.2²)`\n`d = 3,000,000 km / √(0.96)`\n`d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798`\n`d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\nThe result of approximately 3,060,000 km matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
