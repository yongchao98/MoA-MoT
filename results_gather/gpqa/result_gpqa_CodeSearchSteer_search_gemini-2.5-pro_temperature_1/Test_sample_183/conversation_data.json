    "An evaluation of the reaction sequences is necessary to determine the one that results in the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene. The target molecule has a 1,2,3-substitution pattern (ethoxy, tert-butyl, nitro), which is sterically crowded and requires a carefully planned synthetic route.\n\n### Analysis of the Synthetic Options:\n\n*   **Option A:** This sequence attempts to use a sulfonic acid group as a directing group.\n    1.  `i)` Friedel-Crafts alkylation gives tert-butylbenzene.\n    2.  `ii)` Sulfonation blocks the para position, yielding 4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid.\n    3.  `iii)` Nitration occurs ortho to the tert-butyl group, giving 4-(tert-butyl)-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\n    4.  `iv)` Reduction of the nitro group gives 2-amino-4-(tert-butyl)benzenesulfonic acid.\n    5.  `v)` Diazotization converts the amino group to a diazonium salt.\n    6.  `vi)` The addition of `HNO3/H2SO4` to a diazonium salt is not a standard or logical synthetic step, making this pathway incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence has a fatal flaw in its ordering. Step `iv) NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization) is attempted before step `viii) Fe/HCl` (reduction of a nitro group to an amine). Diazotization requires a primary aromatic amine, which has not yet been formed. Therefore, this sequence is impossible.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence begins by forming aniline, then attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on rings with strongly deactivating groups, and the Lewis acid catalyst (AlClâ‚ƒ) would react with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and directing substitution to the meta position. This would lead to the wrong isomer and is an invalid step.\n\n*   **Option B:** Let's analyze this sequence step-by-step.\n    1.  `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`: Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  `ii) HNO3/H2SO4`: Nitration of tert-butylbenzene occurs. The tert-butyl group is an ortho, para-director. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the para product is major, but the ortho product, **1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, is also formed. While this step may not be high-yield for the ortho isomer, the sequence proceeds with this intermediate.\n    3.  `iii) Fe/HCl`: The nitro group of 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene is reduced to an amino group, yielding **2-tert-butylaniline**.\n    4.  `iv) HNO3/H2SO4`: This step involves the nitration of 2-tert-butylaniline. The amino group is a very strong ortho, para-director. The para position is already occupied by the bulky tert-butyl group. Of the two available ortho positions (3 and 6), position 6 is sterically hindered by the adjacent tert-butyl group. Therefore, the incoming nitro group is directed to position 3, yielding **2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. This is a known regioselective reaction.\n    5.  `v) NaNO2/HCl`: The amino group of 2-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline is converted into a diazonium salt via diazotization.\n    6.  `vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat`: The diazonium salt is hydrolyzed to a phenol, replacing the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group, which forms **2-tert-butyl-3-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  `vii) NaOH/EtBr`: The phenol is converted to an ether via Williamson ether synthesis. The NaOH deprotonates the hydroxyl group, and the resulting phenoxide ion reacts with ethyl bromide to form the final product, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThe sequence of steps `i` through `vii` in option B correctly describes a valid, albeit potentially low-yield in one step, synthesis of the target molecule. The final two steps, `viii) SO3/H2SO4` and `ix) dilute H2SO4`, are extraneous and would perform a sulfonation and then a desulfonation on the final product, which serves no purpose. Their inclusion is likely an error in the question's option listing. However, compared to the other options which contain chemically impossible or incorrect steps, the core synthetic route of Option B is the only one that logically leads to the desired product.\n\n<<<B>>>"
