    "This is a classic quantum mechanics problem describing the Larmor precession of a spin-1/2 particle. The average, or expectation value, of the spin components perpendicular to an applied magnetic field will oscillate. The frequency of this oscillation is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Initial State:** The particle's magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in the spin-up eigenstate with respect to the Z-axis.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian:** When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, the new Hamiltonian (the energy operator) of the system is given by `H = -μ · B = -γ * B * S_y`, where `μ` is the magnetic moment operator, `B` is the magnetic field, `γ` is the gyromagnetic ratio, and `S_y` is the spin operator for the y-component.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution:** The state of the particle evolves according to the Schrödinger equation. The expectation value of the z-component of the spin, `<S_z>`, can be shown to evolve according to the equation:\n    `d²<S_z>/dt² = -(γB)² * <S_z>`\n\n4.  **Oscillation Frequency:** This is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator. The solution for `<S_z>(t)` is a sinusoidal oscillation. The angular frequency `ω` of this oscillation is the term inside the square, which is `ω = γB`. The expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, `<μ_z>`, is directly proportional to `<S_z>` (since `μ_z = γS_z`), so it oscillates at the same frequency.\n\nThis precession of the spin's expectation value around the magnetic field is known as Larmor precession, and the frequency `ω = γB` is the Larmor frequency.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment is `γB`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
