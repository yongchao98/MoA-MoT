    "To determine the correct option, we need to calculate two quantities: the relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.\n\n### 1. Relative Speed (v_rel)\n\nThe formula for relativistic velocity addition (or in this case, finding the relative velocity of one astronaut with respect to the other) is given by:\n\nv_rel = (v₂ - v₁) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)\n\nWhere:\n*   v₁ is the velocity of the first astronaut = 0.6 c\n*   v₂ is the velocity of the second astronaut = 0.5 c\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nv_rel = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = -0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = -0.1c / 0.7\nv_rel ≈ -0.142857 c\n\nThe magnitude of the relative speed is approximately 0.14c.\n\n### 2. Total Energy of the System (E)\n\nThe total relativistic energy of a particle is given by the equation E = γmc², where γ (the Lorentz factor) is 1 / √(1 - v²/c²). The total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of the two astronauts.\n\n**Astronaut 1:**\n*   Mass (m₁) = 2m\n*   Velocity (v₁) = 0.6c\n*   Lorentz factor (γ₁):\n    γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n*   Energy (E₁):\n    E₁ = γ₁ * m₁ * c² = 1.25 * (2m) * c² = 2.5 mc²\n\n**Astronaut 2:**\n*   Mass (m₂) = 3m\n*   Velocity (v₂) = 0.5c\n*   Lorentz factor (γ₂):\n    γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √(0.75) ≈ 1.1547\n*   Energy (E₂):\n    E₂ = γ₂ * m₂ * c² ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c² ≈ 3.4641 mc²\n\n**Total System Energy (E_total):**\nE_total = E₁ + E₂\nE_total = 2.5 mc² + 3.4641 mc²\nE_total = 5.9641 mc²\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is 5.96 mc².\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately 0.14c, and the total energy of the system is approximately 5.96 mc². These values correspond to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
