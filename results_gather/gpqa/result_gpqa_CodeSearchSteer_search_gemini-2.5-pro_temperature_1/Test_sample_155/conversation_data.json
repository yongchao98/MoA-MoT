    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reactions**\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n    *   **Step 1 (Epoxidation):** The reaction of a trans-alkene like (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid) is a stereospecific *syn*-addition, which forms a trans-epoxide. Because the alkene is symmetrical, the mCPBA can attack from either face of the double bond, resulting in a racemic mixture of two enantiomeric epoxides, ((4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    *   **Step 2 (Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening):** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) opens the epoxide ring via an *anti*-addition mechanism. The opening of this racemic mixture of trans-epoxides results in the formation of a single, achiral meso compound: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n    *   **Step 1 (Epoxidation):** The reaction of a cis-alkene like (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA is also a *syn*-addition. This stereospecific reaction produces a single, achiral meso-epoxide (cis-4,5-epoxyoctane).\n    *   **Step 2 (Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening):** The acid-catalyzed *anti*-addition of water to this meso-epoxide opens the ring. Because the nucleophilic attack can occur with equal probability at either of the two epoxide carbons, this step produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Composition of the Final Product Mixture**\n\nAfter combining the products of both reactions, the final mixture contains three distinct compounds:\n1.  **Meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1).\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2).\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2).\n\nThe (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) diols are enantiomers of each other. The meso-diol is a diastereomer of the other two compounds.\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis**\n\nThe combined product mixture is analyzed using two different HPLC techniques.\n\n*   **Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   This technique separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, such as polarity.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated. Therefore, the meso-diol will be separated from the other two compounds.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and cannot be separated by a standard HPLC column. Consequently, the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol will elute together as a single peak.\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n*   **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   This technique uses a chiral stationary phase (CSP) to create a chiral environment inside the column.\n    *   This chiral environment allows for the separation of enantiomers because they form transient diastereomeric complexes with the CSP that have different stabilities. Therefore, the (4R,5R)-diol and the (4S,5S)-diol will be resolved into two separate peaks.\n    *   The meso-compound, being a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair, will also have a different retention time and will elute as a distinct, third peak.\n    *   **Observation:** The chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<A>>>"
