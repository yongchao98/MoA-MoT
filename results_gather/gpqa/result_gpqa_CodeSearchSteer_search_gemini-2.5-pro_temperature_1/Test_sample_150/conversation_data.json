    "To determine the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield a specific value, we must follow the principles of quantum mechanics. The possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the observable's operator. The probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the squared magnitude of the projection of the system's state vector onto the eigenvector corresponding to that eigenvalue.\n\nHere is a step-by-step calculation:\n\n**1. Define the State Vector and the Observable Operator**\nThe state of the system, `|ψ⟩`, is given by the column matrix:\n```\n|ψ⟩ = [-1]\n       [ 2]\n       [ 1]\n```\nThe observable, `P`, is represented by the matrix:\n```\nP = [0, 1/√2, 0]\n    [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]\n    [0, 1/√2, 0]\n```\n\n**2. Find the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of the Observable `P`**\nWe need to find the value `λ` (eigenvalue) and vector `v` (eigenvector) that satisfy the equation `Pv = λv`. The possible outcomes of the measurement are the eigenvalues of `P`. We are interested in the outcome `λ = 0`.\n\nTo find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ = 0`, we solve `Pv = 0v`, which simplifies to `Pv = 0`:\n```\n[0, 1/√2, 0]   [x]   [0]\n[1/√2, 0, 1/√2] * [y] = [0]\n[0, 1/√2, 0]   [z]   [0]\n```\nThis matrix equation gives us a system of linear equations:\n*   (1/√2) * y = 0  =>  y = 0\n*   (1/√2) * x + (1/√2) * z = 0  =>  x + z = 0  =>  x = -z\n\nFrom these equations, we see that the eigenvector for `λ=0` has the form `[x, 0, -x]`. We can choose a simple representation for this eigenvector, for instance by setting x=1, which gives `v₀ = [1, 0, -1]`.\n\nNext, we must normalize this eigenvector. The squared norm is `||v₀||² = 1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2`. The norm is `√2`.\nThe normalized eigenvector `|v₀⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 is:\n```\n|v₀⟩ = (1/√2) * [ 1]\n               [ 0]\n               [-1]\n```\n\n**3. Normalize the State Vector `|ψ⟩`**\nFor probability calculations in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized to have a length of 1.\nFirst, calculate the squared norm of `|ψ⟩`:\n`||ψ||² = ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\nThe norm is `||ψ|| = √6`.\n\nThe normalized state vector, `|ψ_norm⟩`, is:\n```\n|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1]\n                   [ 2]\n                   [ 1]\n```\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability**\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product (or projection) of the normalized state vector onto the corresponding normalized eigenvector.\nProbability(λ=0) = |⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩|²\n\nFirst, we compute the inner product `⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩`. The bra vector `⟨v₀|` is the conjugate transpose of the ket `|v₀⟩`.\n`⟨v₀| = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`\n\nNow, we calculate the inner product:\n`⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩ = ( (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1] ) ⋅ ( (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1] )`\n`⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√12) * ( (1)*(-1) + (0)*(2) + (-1)*(1) )`\n`⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√12) * (-1 - 1) = -2/√12 = -2/(2√3) = -1/√3`\n\nFinally, the probability is the squared magnitude of this value:\nProbability(0) = `|-1/√3|² = 1/3`\n\nTherefore, the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 is 1/3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
