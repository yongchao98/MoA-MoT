    "Here is a step-by-step explanation of the physics involved to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** When a positive charge `+q` is placed inside the cavity, it attracts the free electrons within the conductor. These electrons accumulate on the inner surface of the cavity, inducing a total charge of `-q` on this surface.\n\n2.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** The conductor was initially uncharged. To maintain overall electrical neutrality, since a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner cavity surface, a charge of `+q` must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that a conductor shields its exterior from the electric fields of charges inside it. This means the charge `+q` on the outer surface distributes itself *uniformly*, regardless of the position of the charge `+q` and the cavity inside. The external electric field is produced only by the charge on the outer surface.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** For any point outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field is the same as that of a point charge with the same total charge located at the center of the sphere. This is a consequence of Gauss's Law.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The electric field at point P is therefore determined solely by the uniform charge `+q` on the outer surface. Since point P is at a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor, the magnitude of the electric field `E` is given by Coulomb's Law for a point charge:\n\n    $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe distances related to the cavity's position (`s`, `l`, and `Î¸`) are irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor due to electrostatic shielding.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
