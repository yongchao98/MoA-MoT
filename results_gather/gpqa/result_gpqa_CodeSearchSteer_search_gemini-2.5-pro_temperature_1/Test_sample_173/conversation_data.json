    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Define Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   A nucleus of mass M is at rest.\n    *   Initial momentum: \\(P_{initial} = 0\\).\n    *   Rest-mass energy: \\(E_0 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}\\).\n\n*   **Final State:**\n    *   The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses \\(m_1\\) and \\(m_2\\).\n    *   The fragments move with momenta \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\) and kinetic energies \\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\).\n\n### 2. Determine the Rest-Masses of the Fragments\n\nThe problem states:\n1.  One fragment is twice as massive as the other: \\(m_1 = 2m_2\\).\n2.  The sum of the rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: \\(m_1 + m_2 = 0.99 M\\).\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n\\(2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies 3m_2 = 0.99 M \\implies m_2 = 0.33 M\\)\nThen, \\(m_1 = 2 \\times (0.33 M) = 0.66 M\\).\n\nNow, let's find their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (fragment 1):\n    \\(m_1c^2 = 0.66 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.66 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 198 \\text{ GeV}\\).\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (fragment 2):\n    \\(m_2c^2 = 0.33 \\times (Mc^2) = 0.33 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 99 \\text{ GeV}\\).\n\nThe total rest-mass energy of the fragments is \\(198 + 99 = 297 \\text{ GeV}\\).\n\n### 3. Apply Conservation Laws\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The initial energy is conserved. The initial energy (300 GeV) is converted into the rest-mass energy of the fragments plus their kinetic energies. The total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is:\n    \\(Q = T_1 + T_2 = (\\text{Initial mass energy}) - (\\text{Final mass energy})\\)\n    \\(Q = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 297 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV}\\).\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum is zero. The two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum:\n    \\(p_1 = p_2 = p\\).\n\n### 4. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) Kinetic Energy \\(T_1\\)\n\nThe relativistic relationship between a particle's total energy (E), momentum (p), and rest-mass (m) is \\(E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2\\). A particle's total energy is also the sum of its rest-mass energy and kinetic energy, \\(E = T + mc^2\\).\n\nFrom the momentum conservation, we can write:\n\\(p_1^2 = p_2^2\\)\n\\(\\frac{E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2}{c^2} = \\frac{E_2^2 - (m_2c^2)^2}{c^2}\\)\n\\(E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = E_2^2 - (m_2c^2)^2\\)\n\nWe also know from energy conservation that the total final energy is the initial energy: \\(E_1 + E_2 = Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}\\). Thus, \\(E_2 = 300 - E_1\\).\n\nSubstitute \\(E_2\\) into the momentum equation:\n\\(E_1^2 - (m_1c^2)^2 = (300 - E_1)^2 - (m_2c^2)^2\\)\n\nNow, plug in the values for the rest-mass energies (\\(m_1c^2 = 198\\) GeV, \\(m_2c^2 = 99\\) GeV):\n\\(E_1^2 - (198)^2 = (300 - E_1)^2 - (99)^2\\)\n\\(E_1^2 - 39204 = (90000 - 600E_1 + E_1^2) - 9801\\)\n\nThe \\(E_1^2\\) terms cancel out:\n\\(-39204 = 90000 - 600E_1 - 9801\\)\n\\(-39204 = 80199 - 600E_1\\)\n\\(600E_1 = 80199 + 39204\\)\n\\(600E_1 = 119403\\)\n\\(E_1 = \\frac{119403}{600} \\text{ GeV} = 199.005 \\text{ GeV}\\)\n\nThe kinetic energy \\(T_1\\) is the total energy minus the rest-mass energy:\n\\(T_1 = E_1 - m_1c^2 = 199.005 \\text{ GeV} - 198 \\text{ GeV} = 1.005 \\text{ GeV}\\)\n\\(T_1 = 1005 \\text{ MeV}\\).\n\n### 5. Calculate the Classical Kinetic Energy \\(T_{1, classical}\\)\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is \\(T = \\frac{p^2}{2m}\\). Since the momenta are equal (\\(p_1 = p_2\\)), the kinetic energies are inversely proportional to the masses:\n\\(\\frac{T_{1,cl}}{T_{2,cl}} = \\frac{p^2 / (2m_1)}{p^2 / (2m_2)} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} = \\frac{99 \\text{ GeV}/c^2}{198 \\text{ GeV}/c^2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\nSo, \\(T_{2,cl} = 2 T_{1,cl}\\).\n\nThe total kinetic energy is \\(T_{1,cl} + T_{2,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}\\).\n\\(T_{1,cl} + 2T_{1,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}\\)\n\\(3T_{1,cl} = 3 \\text{ GeV}\\)\n\\(T_{1,cl} = 1 \\text{ GeV} = 1000 \\text{ MeV}\\).\n\n### 6. Find the Difference\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) value and the classical approximation is:\n\\(\\Delta T_1 = T_1 - T_{1,cl} = 1005 \\text{ MeV} - 1000 \\text{ MeV} = 5 \\text{ MeV}\\).\n\n<<<C>>>"
