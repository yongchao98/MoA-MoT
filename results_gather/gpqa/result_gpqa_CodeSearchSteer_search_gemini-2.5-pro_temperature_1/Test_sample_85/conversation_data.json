    "An analysis of the two reactions is required to determine the correct starting materials, A and B. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the selectivity of the two different reducing agents and tracing the stereochemistry from the starting material to the product.\n\n### **Analysis of the Product**\n\nBoth reactions yield a lactone (a cyclic ester) named 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, differing only in their stereochemistry at the C4 position. A tetrahydropyran-2-one is a six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom and a carbonyl group at the C2 position (a delta-lactone). This structure is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxy-carboxylic acid. In this specific case, the precursor must be **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**. The stereocenter at C3 of this precursor becomes the stereocenter at C4 of the lactone product. The stereochemistry is retained during this cyclization.\n\n*   To form the **(R)**-lactone, the precursor must be **(R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n*   To form the **(S)**-lactone, the precursor must be **(S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n\n### **Analysis of the Starting Materials and Reagents**\n\nThe proposed starting materials are stereoisomers of **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This is a derivative of a five-carbon dicarboxylic acid (3-ethylglutaric acid) where the C1 is a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and the C5 is an isobutyl ester (-COO-isobutyl). The stereocenter is at C3, which corresponds to the C4 position in the final lactone product.\n\nThe goal of each reaction is to convert the starting material into the corresponding 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid precursor, which then cyclizes. This requires the selective reduction of the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH2OH) while leaving the carboxylic acid group at C1 intact.\n\n**Reaction 1: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-lactone**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that is known to selectively reduce esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Transformation:** LiBH₄ will reduce the isobutyl ester at C5 to a primary alcohol, leaving the C1 carboxylic acid untouched. This correctly forms the necessary (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid precursor from starting material A.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Since the reaction does not affect the stereocenter, starting material **A must have the (R) configuration** to produce the (R)-lactone.\n\n**Reaction 2: B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-lactone**\n\n*   **Reagent:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent known for its high selectivity in reducing carboxylic acids to alcohols, typically leaving esters unaffected under the same conditions.\n*   **Transformation:** Based on standard textbook selectivity, BH₃ would reduce the carboxylic acid at C1, not the ester at C5. This would result in a hydroxy-ester intermediate that cannot form the specified lactone product. This indicates a likely flaw in the premise of the question for this specific reaction.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** However, to arrive at the specified (S)-lactone product, the reaction would need to proceed by reducing the ester group, just as in Reaction 1. Assuming the question intends for this outcome despite the incorrect choice of reagent, the stereochemistry would be preserved. Therefore, to produce the (S)-lactone, starting material **B must have the (S) configuration**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the chemically sound analysis of Reaction 1 and the logical inference for the intended (though chemically inaccurate) Reaction 2, the stereochemistry of the starting materials can be determined:\n*   Starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
