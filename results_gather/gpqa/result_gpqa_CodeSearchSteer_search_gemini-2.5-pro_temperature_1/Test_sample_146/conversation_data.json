    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the velocity of particle A.\n\n### 1. Conservation of Energy\n\nThe process begins with a proton ($p$) and a slowly moving antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The term \"slowly moving\" implies that we can neglect the kinetic energy of the antiproton. Assuming the proton is at rest, the total initial energy ($E_i$) is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton.\n\nThe rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938 MeV. Since a proton and an antiproton have the same mass, their rest energies are identical.\n\n*   **Initial Energy ($E_i$):**\n    $E_i = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2 \\times m_p c^2$\n    $E_i = 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nThe annihilation results in four particles ($2A^+$, $2A^-$), each with a mass corresponding to a rest energy ($m_A c^2$) of 300 MeV. The total final energy ($E_f$) is the sum of the relativistic energies of these four particles. Due to the conservation of momentum (the initial momentum is near zero), the four resulting particles will share the energy, and by symmetry, they will all have the same speed, $v$.\n\nThe relativistic energy of a single particle A is given by $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\n*   **Final Energy ($E_f$):**\n    $E_f = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\times \\gamma m_A c^2$\n    $E_f = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times 300 \\text{ MeV} = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\nAccording to the law of conservation of energy, the initial energy must equal the final energy ($E_i = E_f$).\n\n$1876 \\text{ MeV} = 1200 \\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n### 2. Calculate the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)\n\nWe can now solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876}{1200} \\approx 1.5633$\n\n### 3. Calculate the Velocity (v)\n\nThe Lorentz factor is related to the velocity by the equation:\n\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n\nTo find the velocity, we rearrange the formula to solve for $v$:\n\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n\n$1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n\n$(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nNow, we can substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}}$\n\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}}$\n\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4092}$\n\n$v/c = \\sqrt{0.5908}$\n\n$v/c \\approx 0.7686$\n\nTherefore, the velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\n$v \\approx 0.77c$\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 0.77c\nB) 0.91c\nC) 0.86c\nD) 0.96c\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
