    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds detectable by ground-based optical telescopes, we must consider the wavelength at which Earth's atmosphere becomes transparent to light. The Lyman-alpha (Lyα) line, which is absorbed by these clouds, has a rest wavelength of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å).\n\nEarth's atmosphere blocks most ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Ground-based telescopes can generally detect light down to an \"atmospheric cutoff\" wavelength. This cutoff is not perfectly sharp, but a significant drop in atmospheric transmission occurs around 3200-3500 Å. For a ground-based instrument to detect the absorbed Lyα line, the line must be redshifted from its original UV wavelength into the visible part of the spectrum that can penetrate the atmosphere. Specifically, the observed wavelength must be longer than this atmospheric cutoff.\n\nUsing the atmospheric cutoff as the minimum observable wavelength, we can calculate the minimum redshift (z) with the following formula:\n\nλ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + z)\n\nTo find the lower limit on the redshift, we set λ_observed to the minimum wavelength that can pass through the atmosphere. Let's use a conservative value of approximately 3500 Å for the atmospheric cutoff.\n\nz = (λ_observed / λ_emitted) - 1\nz = (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\nz ≈ 2.88 - 1\nz ≈ 1.88\n\nThis calculation indicates that the redshift must be at least ~1.88 for the 1216 Å Lyman-alpha line to be shifted to an observable wavelength of 3500 Å. Looking at the provided options, 1.9 is the closest value to this estimate. Some of the most capable ground-based facilities, like the Very Large Telescope (VLT), can observe down to the atmospheric cutoff of 300 nm (3000 Å), which would correspond to a minimum redshift of approximately 1.47. However, a more typical limit for many observatories is slightly higher.\n\nConsidering the typical atmospheric limitations, a redshift of around 1.9 is a reasonable lower limit for detecting these Lyman-alpha absorption features from the ground.\n\n<<<B>>>"
