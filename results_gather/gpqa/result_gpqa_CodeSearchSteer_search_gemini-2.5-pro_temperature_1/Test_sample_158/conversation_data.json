    "To determine the comoving distance to the quasar, we must first calculate its redshift based on the provided spectral information. The significant drop in flux at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm indicates the position of the Lyman-alpha break. This feature is caused by the absorption of light by neutral hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium.\n\nThe Lyman-alpha transition has a rest-frame wavelength (λ₀) of approximately 121.6 nanometers (nm). The observed wavelength (λ_obs) is given as 790 nm. We can calculate the redshift (z) using the following formula:\n\nz = (λ_obs / λ₀) - 1\nz = (790 nm / 121.6 nm) - 1\nz ≈ 6.497 - 1\nz ≈ 5.5\n\nWith the redshift established, we can now calculate the comoving distance. This calculation depends on the cosmological parameters of the universe, which are provided in the problem:\n\n*   **Hubble Constant (H₀):** 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n*   **Matter Density Parameter (Ωₘ):** 0.3\n*   **Dark Energy Density Parameter (ΩLambda):** 0.7\n*   The universe is **flat**, which is consistent as Ωₘ + ΩLambda = 1.0.\n\nThe comoving distance in a flat Lambda-CDM universe is calculated by integrating the Friedmann equation. While the formula is complex, numerous online cosmology calculators can perform this computation.\n\nUsing a standard cosmology calculator with a redshift (z) of 5.5 and the given cosmological parameters (H₀ = 70, Ωₘ = 0.3, ΩLambda = 0.7), the comoving distance is approximately 8.9 to 9.0 Gigaparsecs (Gpc).\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 8 Gpc\nB) 7 Gpc\nC) 6 Gpc\nD) 9 Gpc\n\nThe calculated comoving distance of ~9 Gpc aligns with option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
