    "To find the energy spectrum for a particle of mass `m` in the given potential, we first need to express the potential in a more convenient coordinate system.\n\n**1. Convert the Potential to Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\n`V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)`\n\nWe can convert this to Cartesian coordinates (x, y) using the relationships:\n*   `x = r cos(θ)`\n*   `y = r sin(θ)`\n*   `r^2 = x^2 + y^2`\n\nSubstituting these into the potential equation:\n`V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 k(r cos(θ))^2`\n`V(x, y) = 1/2 k(x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 kx^2`\n\nNow, we group the terms with `x^2` and `y^2`:\n`V(x, y) = (1/2 kx^2 + 3/2 kx^2) + 1/2 ky^2`\n`V(x, y) = (4/2 kx^2) + 1/2 ky^2`\n`V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2`\n\n**2. Identify the System**\n\nThe resulting potential `V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 ky^2` is the potential for a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. This means the system behaves as two independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators, one in the x-direction and one in the y-direction, with different angular frequencies.\n\nThe potential can be written as `V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)`, where:\n*   `V_x(x) = 1/2 (4k)x^2`\n*   `V_y(y) = 1/2 (k)y^2`\n\n**3. Determine the Angular Frequencies**\n\nThe energy of a quantum harmonic oscillator depends on its angular frequency, `ω`, which is related to the spring constant `k_eff` and mass `m` by `ω = sqrt(k_eff / m)`.\n\nFor the motion in the x-direction:\n*   The effective spring constant is `k_x = 4k`.\n*   The angular frequency is `ω_x = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k / m)`.\n\nFor the motion in the y-direction:\n*   The effective spring constant is `k_y = k`.\n*   The angular frequency is `ω_y = sqrt(k / m)`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Energy**\n\nThe total energy of the 2D system is the sum of the energies of the two independent 1D oscillators. The energy for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator is given by `E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω`.\n\n*   Energy for the x-oscillator: `E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 * sqrt(k / m)`\n*   Energy for the y-oscillator: `E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y = (n_y + 1/2)ħ * sqrt(k / m)`\n\nThe total energy `E` is the sum `E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}`:\n`E = (n_x + 1/2) * 2 * ħ * sqrt(k / m) + (n_y + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k / m)`\n\nNow, we factor out the common term `ħ * sqrt(k / m)`:\n`E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] * ħ * sqrt(k / m)`\n`E = [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] * ħ * sqrt(k / m)`\n`E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)ħ * sqrt(k / m)`\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
