    "Here's a breakdown of the observations and an analysis of each potential explanation:\n\n**Analysis of Observations**\n*   **Peptidic Compound:** This means the molecule contains chiral centers (at the alpha-carbons) and amide bonds.\n*   **Two alpha-proton NMR peaks:** A single proton is showing up as two distinct peaks of roughly equal size. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, this means the proton exists in two different chemical environments.\n*   **Two LC-MS peaks:** The compound separates into two components during liquid chromatography.\n*   **Same Mass Spectrum:** Both LC peaks produce the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected molecular weight. This rules out impurities with a different chemical formula, such as precursors or byproducts of a different mass (Option D and C). The two species must be isomers.\n*   **Equal Intensities/Integrals:** The 1:1 ratio of the peaks in both NMR and LC-MS suggests the two isomeric forms are present in roughly equal amounts.\n*   **LC separation at elevated temperature:** This indicates the two species are stable enough to be separated chromatographically and are not rapidly interconverting on the chromatography timescale.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options**\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) NMR solvent, they are chemically indistinguishable and would produce a single set of peaks. Similarly, they would not separate on a standard (achiral) LC column. While they can be separated using chiral chromatography or distinguished in an NMR experiment using a chiral solvating agent, these are specialized techniques not mentioned in the prompt. Therefore, this explanation is inconsistent with the observations.\n\n*   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n    *   **NMR:** Because they are chemically distinct, diastereomers give different NMR spectra. It is expected that corresponding protons, like the alpha-proton, would have different (though often similar) chemical shifts. This matches the observation of two alpha-proton peaks.\n    *   **LC-MS:** Due to their different physical properties, diastereomers can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography, which explains the two LC peaks.\n    *   **How they form:** In peptide synthesis, this can happen in two common ways. First, **racemization** of one amino acid's alpha-carbon during the coupling reaction can occur. If you are synthesizing a dipeptide of two L-amino acids (L-L), racemization of the second amino acid would produce a mixture of L-L and L-D peptides. These are diastereomers and would be formed in roughly a 1:1 ratio, explaining the equal peak intensities. A second possibility is **atropisomerism** (isomers resulting from hindered rotation around a single bond) or *cis-trans* isomerization around an amide bond, particularly one involving proline. These rotational isomers are also a form of diastereomer and can be stable enough to be separated by LC and distinguished by NMR.\n\n*   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This side reaction involves the addition of an extra amino acid residue. The resulting molecule would have a significantly higher molecular weight than the expected product. The mass spectrometry data, which shows both peaks have the *same mass* as the expected molecule, rules this out.\n\n*   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor from the synthesis would be a different molecule, almost certainly with a different molecular weight (e.g., a protected amino acid or a shorter peptide fragment). This is inconsistent with the MS data showing both peaks have the same mass.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe observation of two separable species of the same mass that are distinguishable by NMR is the classic signature of a mixture of diastereomers. This is a common issue in chemical peptide synthesis, often arising from racemization at one of the chiral centers.\n\n<<<B>>>"
