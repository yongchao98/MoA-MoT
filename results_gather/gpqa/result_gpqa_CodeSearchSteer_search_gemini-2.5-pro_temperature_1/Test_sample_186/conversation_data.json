    "### Three Stars Would be Detectable by the ESPRESSO Spectrograph\n\nBased on the capabilities of the ESPRESSO spectrograph coupled with one of the 8m Very Large Telescope (VLT) units, and considering the observability from the Paranal Observatory, three of the listed stars would be detectable. A star's detectability is defined as achieving a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a one-hour exposure.\n\nESPRESSO, when used with a single VLT Unit Telescope, can achieve the required S/N of 10 in a one-hour exposure for stars as faint as an apparent V magnitude of approximately 16 to 17, depending on the specific instrument mode. Additionally, the Paranal Observatory is located in the Southern Hemisphere at a latitude of about -24.6 degrees, which restricts its view of the northern sky.\n\nHere is a detailed analysis of each star:\n\n*   **a) Canopus:** This is the second-brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent magnitude of about -0.74. Its declination is approximately -52° 41', making it easily observable from the Paranal Observatory. Given its extreme brightness, it is well within the detection limits of ESPRESSO.\n\n*   **b) Polaris:** Known as the North Star, Polaris has an apparent magnitude that fluctuates around 1.98. However, its declination is very close to +90° North. The VLT's location in the Southern Hemisphere makes it impossible to observe stars this far north. Therefore, Polaris is not detectable from Paranal.\n\n*   **c) Star with Absolute V magnitude of 15 at 10 pc:** The apparent magnitude (m) can be calculated from the absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d) using the formula m = M + 5 * log10(d/10). For this star, the apparent magnitude is 15.0. With a declination of 0 degrees, it is observable from Paranal. Since its magnitude of 15.0 is brighter than the limiting magnitude of ESPRESSO (~16-17), it would be detectable.\n\n*   **d) Star with Absolute V magnitude of 15 at 200 pc:** Using the same formula, the apparent magnitude for this star is approximately 21.5. This is far too faint for ESPRESSO to achieve the required S/N in one hour.\n\n*   **e) Star with Absolute V magnitude of 15 at 5 pc:** The calculated apparent magnitude for this star is approximately 13.5. At a declination of 0 degrees, it is observable and well within the brightness limit for detection by ESPRESSO.\n\n*   **f) Star with Absolute V magnitude of 15 at 50 pc:** This star's apparent magnitude calculates to approximately 18.5. This is fainter than the detection threshold for a one-hour exposure with the specified S/N.\n\nIn summary, Canopus, the star at 10 parsecs, and the star at 5 parsecs are all detectable. This brings the total count to three.\n\n<<<D>>>"
