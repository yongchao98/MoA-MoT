    "To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, ⟨S_y⟩, for an electron in the spin state |ψ⟩ = (3i, 4), we use the formula:\n\n⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩\n\nHere, S_y is the spin operator in the y-direction, which is defined as S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant and σ_y is the Pauli Y matrix.\n\nThe steps for the calculation are as follows:\n\n1.  **Define the state vector and its conjugate transpose.**\n    The spin state is given as a column vector:\n    |ψ⟩ = ( 3i )\n          (  4 )\n\n    The bra vector ⟨ψ| is the conjugate transpose of |ψ⟩. The transpose is (3i, 4), and the complex conjugate of this is (-3i, 4):\n    ⟨ψ| = (-3i, 4)\n\n2.  **Calculate the normalization factor ⟨ψ|ψ⟩.**\n    This is the inner product of the state with itself:\n    ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-3i, 4) * ( 3i ) = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = -9i² + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25.\n                          (  4 )\n\n3.  **Define the S_y operator.**\n    The S_y operator is given by:\n    S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y = (ħ/2) * ( 0  -i )\n                               ( i   0 )\n\n4.  **Calculate the term S_y|ψ⟩.**\n    Apply the S_y operator to the state vector |ψ⟩:\n    S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * ( 0  -i ) * ( 3i ) = (ħ/2) * ( (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) ) = (ħ/2) * ( -4i )\n                   ( i   0 )   (  4 )     ( (i)(3i) + (0)(4)  )     (  -3 )\n\n5.  **Calculate the numerator ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩.**\n    Now, multiply the bra vector ⟨ψ| with the result from the previous step:\n    ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (-3i, 4) * (ħ/2) * ( -4i ) = (ħ/2) * [(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)]\n                                  (  -3 )\n    = (ħ/2) * [12i² - 12] = (ħ/2) * [-12 - 12] = (ħ/2) * [-24] = -12ħ\n\n6.  **Compute the final expectation value.**\n    Divide the result from step 5 by the normalization factor from step 2.\n    ⟨S_y⟩ = (-12ħ) / 25 = -12ħ/25.\n\nA detailed calculation confirming this result can be found in solved physics problems.\n\n<<<C>>>"
