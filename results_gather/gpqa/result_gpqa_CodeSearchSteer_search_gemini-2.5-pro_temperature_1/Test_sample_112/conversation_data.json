    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n### 1. Analysis of Functional Groups from FTIR Data\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This peak is notably broad due to hydrogen bonding and is centered around 3000 cm⁻¹, often overlapping with C-H stretching peaks.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Specifically, carboxylic acid carbonyls absorb strongly in the 1690-1760 cm⁻¹ region.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\nThe combination of the very broad O-H stretch and the C=O stretch at 1700 cm⁻¹ is a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid functional group. The presence of a C=C bond is confirmed by the peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Hydrogen Types from ¹H NMR Data\n\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbon atoms of a C=C double bond. Their presence in the ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the existence of an alkene functional group, which supports the FTIR data. Vinyl protons typically appear in the chemical shift range of 5-7 ppm.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Molecular Fragments from Mass Spectrometry Data\n\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a well-known fragment in mass spectrometry corresponding to the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺. The presence of this fragment provides further strong evidence for the compound being a carboxylic acid.\n\n### 4. Determination of the Degree of Unsaturation\n\nThe degree of unsaturation (DoU) indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. It can be calculated from the chemical formula CₓHᵧO₂ using the formula: DoU = x - y/2 + 1.\n\nThe spectroscopic data indicate the presence of:\n*   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid).\n*   One C=C double bond (from the alkene).\n\nThis means the molecule must have at least two degrees of unsaturation. Let's calculate the DoU for the possible formulas:\n\n*   **A) C6H12O:** DoU = 6 - 12/2 + 1 = 1\n*   **B) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 - 12/2 + 1 = 1\n*   **C) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 - 10/2 + 1 = 2\n*   **D) C6H10O:** DoU = 6 - 10/2 + 1 = 2\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\n1.  The FTIR and Mass Spectrometry data strongly indicate the presence of a carboxylic acid (-COOH), which contains two oxygen atoms. This eliminates options A (C6H12O) and D (C6H10O).\n2.  The combined spectroscopic evidence points to a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid (one C=O double bond) and an alkene (one C=C double bond). This requires a total of two degrees of unsaturation.\n3.  Comparing the remaining options, C6H10O2 has a DoU of 2, which is consistent with the data. C6H12O2 has a DoU of 1, which is not sufficient to account for both the carbonyl and the alkene double bonds.\n\nTherefore, the chemical formula of the unknown compound must be C6H10O2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
