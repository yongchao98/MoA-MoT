    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound:\n\n1.  **Understand the Process:** The textile dye contains an extensively conjugated pi-electron system, which is characteristic of molecules that can exhibit fluorescence. Fluorescence is a process where a molecule absorbs light at one wavelength and then emits it at a longer, lower-energy wavelength. The difference in energy between the absorbed and emitted light is known as the Stokes shift.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Wavelength of Emitted Light:** The problem states that the emitted light has an energy (E) of 2.3393 eV. We can calculate the corresponding wavelength (λ) using the formula E = hc/λ, where 'h' is Planck's constant and 'c' is the speed of light. A convenient form of this equation is λ (in nm) = 1240 / E (in eV).\n\n    *   λ = 1240 eV·nm / 2.3393 eV\n    *   λ ≈ 530 nm\n\n3.  **Determine the Color of Emitted Light:** A wavelength of 530 nm falls within the green region of the visible light spectrum. Therefore, the textile dye emits green light and would appear green to an observer.\n\n4.  **Determine the Color of Absorbed Light:** According to the principle of fluorescence, the energy of the absorbed light must be higher than the energy of the emitted light. This means the wavelength of the absorbed light must be shorter than the wavelength of the emitted light.\n\n    *   Energy of emitted light = 2.3393 eV (~530 nm, Green).\n    *   Energy of absorbed light must be > 2.3393 eV (or λ < 530 nm).\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:** Let's examine the energy ranges of the given color options:\n    *   **A) Violet:** Wavelength ≈ 380-436 nm. Energy > 2.84 eV.\n    *   **B) Red:** Wavelength ≈ 627-780 nm. Energy < 1.98 eV.\n    *   **C) Blue:** Wavelength ≈ 436-495 nm. Energy ≈ 2.51 - 2.84 eV.\n    *   **D) Yellow:** Wavelength ≈ 566-589 nm. Energy < 2.19 eV.\n\n    Based on the energy requirement (E_absorbed > 2.3393 eV), both Red and Yellow can be eliminated because they have lower energy than the emitted green light. This leaves Violet and Blue as possible answers.\n\n6.  **Distinguish Between Blue and Violet:** In many fluorescent dyes, the absorption and emission spectra are relatively close to each other. A very common example is the dye fluorescein, which absorbs blue light (peak at ~494 nm) and emits green light (peak at ~521 nm). Given that the dye emits green light (530 nm), it is most probable that it absorbs light of the next highest energy, which is blue light.\n\n*Note on Complementary Colors:* The rule of complementary colors (where the perceived color is the complement of the absorbed color) applies to objects that reflect or transmit light, not for objects that emit light. If we incorrectly applied this rule, we would say that since the object appears green, it must absorb the complementary color, red. This is physically incorrect because red light has less energy than the green light that is emitted, violating the principles of fluorescence.\n\nTherefore, the dye absorbs higher-energy blue light and emits lower-energy green light.\n\n<<<C>>>"
