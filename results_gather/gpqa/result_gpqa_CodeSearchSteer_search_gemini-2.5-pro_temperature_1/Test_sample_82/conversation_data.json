    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at both points in the titration.\n\n### 1. Initial State and Dilution\n\n*   **Initial Moles of Acetic Acid (CH₃COOH):**\n    Volume = 20.00 cm³ = 0.02000 L\n    Molarity = 0.05 M\n    Moles = 0.02000 L * 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol\n\n*   **Dilution:**\n    The initial 20.00 cm³ is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n    New Volume = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L\n    **New Concentration of Acetic Acid:**\n    Molarity = Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = **0.025 M**\n\n### 2. pH at 25% Titration\n\nThis is a buffer region because some of the weak acid has been converted to its conjugate base, but the acid has not been fully neutralized. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\n**pH = pKa + log ( [A⁻] / [HA] )**\n\n*   **Calculate pKa:**\n    Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n\n*   **Determine the ratio of conjugate base to acid:**\n    At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid (HA) has reacted to form acetate (A⁻), and 75% remains as acetic acid.\n    The ratio [A⁻] / [HA] is 25 / 75 = 1 / 3.\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    pH = 4.733 + log(1/3)\n    pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    pH ≈ **4.26**\n\n### 3. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH, forming sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution now contains only the conjugate base of the weak acid. This conjugate base (acetate ion, CH₃COO⁻) will hydrolyze water, creating a basic solution.\n\n*   **Volume of NaOH needed for equivalence:**\n    Moles of NaOH must equal initial moles of CH₃COOH.\n    Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n*   **Total volume at the equivalence point:**\n    Volume = (Volume of diluted acid) + (Volume of NaOH)\n    Volume = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L\n\n*   **Concentration of Acetate (CH₃COO⁻):**\n    The moles of acetate formed are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid.\n    [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.05000 L = **0.02 M**\n\n*   **Hydrolysis Reaction:**\n    CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n\n*   **Calculate Kb for acetate:**\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n\n*   **Calculate [OH⁻] using the Kb expression:**\n    Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02)  *(assuming x is small)*\n    x² = (5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰) * 0.02 = 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n\n*   **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n    pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.48 ≈ **8.52**\n\nThe calculated values are a pH of **4.26** at 25% titration and **8.52** at the equivalence point.\n\n<<<A>>>"
