    "The process described is somatic hypermutation. Here's a breakdown of the evidence from the scenario:\n\n*   **Oral Antigen Delivery and Peyer's Patches:** The rotavirus proteins are delivered orally, and the immune response is localized to the Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches are a crucial part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and act as the primary immune surveillance sites for the intestine. They are secondary lymphoid organs where mature B cells are activated to respond to antigens.\n\n*   **Proliferating Cells in a Secondary Lymphoid Organ:** The identification of a proliferating cell population within the Peyer's patches points to an active immune response. Specifically, this proliferation occurs in transiently formed structures called germinal centers. Inside germinal centers, B cells that have recognized an antigen rapidly divide.\n\n*   **High Variability in the Variable Heavy Chain Gene:** This is the key piece of information. The sequencing of the variable heavy chain (V-region) of the immunoglobulin (antibody) gene and the observation of \"high variability\" is the definitive hallmark of somatic hypermutation (SHM). SHM is a process where point mutations are intentionally introduced into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes in activated B cells within the germinal centers. This process does not affect the constant region of the antibody. The purpose of SHM is to create a diverse pool of B cell receptors, from which those with the highest affinity for the antigen are selected, a process known as affinity maturation.\n\nHere is why the other options are incorrect:\n\n*   **A) VDJ recombination:** This process creates the initial diversity of B cell receptors by combining different Variable (V), Diversity (D), and Joining (J) gene segments. However, it occurs in the bone marrow (a primary lymphoid organ) during the initial development of B cells, *before* they encounter an antigen. The scenario describes a process happening in a secondary lymphoid organ *after* antigen exposure.\n\n*   **B) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers. However, CSR changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain, not the variable region. This switch changes the antibody's isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgA) and its effector function, but it does not alter the antigen-binding specificity, which is determined by the variable region. The experiment explicitly found variability in the *variable* heavy chain.\n\n*   **C) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate and adaptive immune system involving a cascade of plasma proteins that help clear pathogens. It does not involve the genetic mutation of B cell genes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
