    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the mass changes in the tubes**\n\n1.  **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong drying agent and absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.02 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n2.  **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases like CO₂. Since its weight did not change, no such gases were formed.\n\n3.  **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Copper at high temperatures reacts with oxygen (O₂). The mass increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.00 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n### **Step 2: Identify the remaining gas C**\n\n*   A total of 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n*   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar volume at STP = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n*   The total initial mass of the salt mixture was 7.20 g. By the law of conservation of mass, this must equal the total mass of the gaseous products.\n*   Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass of H₂O - Mass of O₂\n*   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n*   Now, we can find the molar mass of Gas C:\n*   Molar Mass of C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28 g/mol.\n*   A gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol that is inert to the reagents used is nitrogen (N₂).\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the elemental composition of the initial mixture**\n\nThe gaseous products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. The atoms in these products must have come from the initial salts A and B.\n\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H) atoms:** from 0.2 mol of H₂O = 2 × 0.2 = 0.4 mol.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N) atoms:** from 0.1 mol of N₂ = 2 × 0.1 = 0.2 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O) atoms:** from 0.2 mol of H₂O and 0.025 mol of O₂ = (1 × 0.2) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\nThe molar ratio of the elements in the combined salts (A+B) is N : H : O = 0.2 : 0.4 : 0.25. To get a simple integer ratio, we can multiply by 20, which gives N₈H₁₆O₁₀, or more simply, multiply by 4 (the inverse of the smallest fraction 0.25) to clear the decimal which gives N₄H₈O₅.\n\n### **Step 4: Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states we have an equimolar mixture of two salts. The combined chemical formula is N₄H₈O₅. The presence of nitrogen and hydrogen strongly suggests the presence of the ammonium cation (NH₄⁺).\n\n*   The H₈ part of the formula corresponds to two ammonium ions: 2 × NH₄⁺ = N₂H₈²⁺.\n*   The remaining atoms are N₂O₅. These must form the anions.\n*   The most common nitrogen-oxygen anions (oxyanions) are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n*   The sum of these two anions is (NO₃⁻) + (NO₂⁻) = N₂O₅²⁻.\n*   Combining the cations and anions, we get the two salts: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n\nSo, Salt A is **NH₄NO₃** and Salt B is **NH₄NO₂**.\n\n### **Step 5: Calculate the total number of atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in salts A and B, which means the sum of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 1 (in NH₄⁺) + 1 (in NO₃⁻) = 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 3\n    *   Total atoms in NH₄NO₃ = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   Nitrogen (N): 1 (in NH₄⁺) + 1 (in NO₂⁻) = 2\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 4\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2\n    *   Total atoms in NH₄NO₂ = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms in both salts =** Atoms in A + Atoms in B = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is 17.\n\n<<<B>>>"
