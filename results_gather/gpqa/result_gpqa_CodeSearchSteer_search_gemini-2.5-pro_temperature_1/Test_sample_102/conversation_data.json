    "To determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, we must analyze the directing effects of the substituents at each step.\n\n**Target Molecule:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   The substituents are an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   All three groups are in a meta-relationship to each other (at positions 1, 3, and 5).\n\n**Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects:**\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a meta-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a meta-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an ortho-, para-director.\n\nLet's evaluate the proposed synthetic routes:\n\n**Option A:** This sequence begins with nitration, followed by reduction to aniline, diazotization, and then deamination (H3PO2). This sequence (ii, iii, iv) converts the initial nitrobenzene back into benzene, which is an illogical and inefficient pathway. Therefore, A is incorrect.\n\n**Option B:**\n1.  **i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a meta-director. This is a good first step.\n2.  **ii) Br2/FeBr3 (Bromination):** Acetophenone is brominated. The meta-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the meta position, yielding 3-bromoacetophenone. This step is correct.\n3.  **iii) HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration):** Now we nitrate 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring has two substituents: the acetyl group at position 1 (meta-director) and the bromo group at position 3 (ortho-, para-director).\n    *   The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5.\n    *   The bromo group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   The directing effects are conflicting, which can lead to a mixture of products and thus a lower yield. However, among the given choices, we must evaluate the entire sequence. Assuming the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one is formed, the subsequent steps (iv-vii) involve reduction of the nitro group, another nitration, and then deamination. This sequence of transformations after step (iii) is chemically nonsensical for arriving at the target molecule. There appears to be a significant error in the steps listed after (iii). However, the initial three steps (Acylation -> Bromination -> Nitration) represent a plausible, though not ideal, route to the target compound.\n\n**Option C:**\n1.  **i) HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration):** Benzene to nitrobenzene.\n2.  **ii) Fe/HCl (Reduction):** Nitrobenzene to aniline.\n3.  **iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This reaction fails. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic lone pair of the aniline's amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing the acylation reaction. Therefore, C is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\n1.  **i) Br2/FeBr3 (Bromination):** Benzene to bromobenzene.\n2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4 (Nitration):** Bromobenzene is nitrated. The bromo group is an ortho-, para-director. This step yields a mixture of 2-bromonitrobenzene and 4-bromonitrobenzene. It does not produce the required 3-bromonitrobenzene isomer where the groups are meta to each other. Therefore, D is incorrect from the second step.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOptions A, C, and D contain steps that are either chemically impossible or lead to the wrong isomers. Option B describes an initial sequence (i, ii, iii) that can produce the target molecule, although the yield of the third step may be compromised due to conflicting directing groups. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) in option B are nonsensical and likely erroneous.\n\nHowever, if we compare the initial three steps of Option B to an alternative route (Acylation -> Nitration -> Bromination), the latter would be superior. In that route (Acetophenone -> 3-Nitroacetophenone -> 3-Bromo-5-nitroacetophenone), the two meta-directing groups (-COCH3 and -NO2) would cooperatively direct the incoming bromine to position 5, ensuring a high yield. This ideal sequence is not presented as an option.\n\nGiven the choices, Option B is the only one whose initial steps provide a viable (though imperfect) pathway to the target molecule without encountering a definite reaction failure or producing the wrong constitutional isomer. The flaws in A, C, and D are more fundamental. Therefore, B is the most plausible answer despite the likely errors in the latter half of its sequence.\n\n<<<B>>>"
