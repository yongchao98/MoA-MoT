    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to identify the unknown substances and determine the molecular symmetry of product E.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactions:**\n    *   **Reaction 1:** A(solid) + 8 B(gas) → C(bright red)\n    *   **Reaction 2:** C + 2 D(gas) → E(extremely hazardous)\n    *   **Reaction 3:** C + H₂O → A + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)\n    *   **Reaction 4:** D(gas) + B(gas) (1:1 ratio) → H(solvent)\n\n2.  **Identify D, B, and H:** Reaction 4 is a 1:1 reaction between two gases (D and B) to form a solvent (H). A classic example of such a reaction is the addition of chlorine to ethylene.\n    *   Let **D** be ethylene (C₂H₄), a gas.\n    *   Let **B** be chlorine (Cl₂), a gas.\n    *   The reaction is C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l). The product, 1,2-dichloroethane (**H**), is a well-known solvent. This fits the 1:1 stoichiometry.\n\n3.  **Identify A and C:** Now that B is identified as Cl₂, we can analyze Reaction 1.\n    *   A(solid) + 8 Cl₂(gas) → C(bright red)\n    *   The most common solid elemental reactant for chlorine is sulfur (S₈). Let's test this.\n    *   Let **A** be sulfur (S₈).\n    *   The reaction would be S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → 8SCl₂(l). Sulfur dichloride (**C**) is described as a cherry-red liquid. While the riddle states C is a solid, it's a common liberty in such puzzles for a red liquid to be described as a \"bright red product\". The 1:8 stoichiometry for the reactants (1 mole of S₈ contains 8 moles of S atoms, reacting with 8 moles of Cl₂) to form 8 moles of the product fits perfectly.\n\n4.  **Verify with Hydrolysis (Reaction 3):** This is a critical check.\n    *   C + H₂O → A + F(strong acid) + G(weak acid)\n    *   The hydrolysis of sulfur dichloride (SCl₂) is known to proceed as follows: 2SCl₂ + 2H₂O → SO₂ + 4HCl + S. The elemental sulfur (S) produced can be in the form of S₈.\n    *   This reaction reforms **A** (sulfur).\n    *   It produces hydrochloric acid (**F**, HCl), which is a strong acid.\n    *   It produces sulfur dioxide (SO₂), which dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid (**G**, H₂SO₃), a weak acid.\n    *   This reaction perfectly matches the description.\n\n5.  **Identify E:** Now we use Reaction 2 to find the identity of the hazardous product E.\n    *   C + 2 D → E\n    *   SCl₂ + 2 C₂H₄ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂\n    *   This is the Levinstein synthesis for mustard gas. Therefore, **E** is bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide, commonly known as mustard gas, an extremely hazardous chemical warfare agent.\n\n6.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry of E:** The final step is to determine the point group for E (mustard gas, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂).\n    *   The molecule is flexible due to free rotation around the C-C and C-S single bonds. We consider the symmetry of its most stable conformation.\n    *   The molecule lacks any mirror planes (σ) or an inversion center (i).\n    *   However, it does possess a two-fold rotational axis (C₂) that passes through the sulfur atom. This makes the molecule chiral.\n    *   A molecule whose only symmetry element is a C₂ axis belongs to the **C₂** point group.\n\n**Summary of Identities:**\n*   **A:** S₈ (Sulfur)\n*   **B:** Cl₂ (Chlorine)\n*   **C:** SCl₂ (Sulfur dichloride)\n*   **D:** C₂H₄ (Ethylene)\n*   **E:** S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂ (Mustard gas)\n*   **F:** HCl (Hydrochloric acid)\n*   **G:** H₂SO₃ (Sulfurous acid)\n*   **H:** C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)\n\nThe molecular symmetry group of E (mustard gas) is C₂.\n\n<<<B>>>"
