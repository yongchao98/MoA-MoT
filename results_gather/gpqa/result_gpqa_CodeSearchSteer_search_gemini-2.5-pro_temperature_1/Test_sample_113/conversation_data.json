    "### Analysis of the Reactions\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone (butan-2-one). The process involves the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide ion (CN⁻) from NaCN on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This initially forms an alkoxide intermediate. To obtain the final product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, this intermediate must be protonated. Reagent A must therefore be a source of protons (H⁺). An acidic workup, represented by H₃O⁺, is typically used for this protonation step. Therefore, A = H₃O⁺.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is known as hydrolysis. The hydrolysis of nitriles can be carried out under either acidic or basic conditions. The reaction is typically performed by heating the nitrile with a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), or a strong base like NaOH. Given the options, HCl (a strong acid) is an effective reagent for the acidic hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. Therefore, B = HCl.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   For the first reaction, the required reagent **A** is **H₃O⁺**.\n*   For the second reaction, the required reagent **B** is **HCl**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
