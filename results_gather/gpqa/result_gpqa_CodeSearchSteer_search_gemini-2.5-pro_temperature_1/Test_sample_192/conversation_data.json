    "To determine how the number of stars changes with distance, we can follow these steps:\n\nFirst, we need to understand the relationship between a star's distance and its parallax. The parallax (plx) of a star is inversely proportional to its distance (r). This can be expressed as:\n\nplx ∝ 1/r\n\nor\n\nr = 1/plx\n\nThe problem states that the number of stars (N) observed in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as:\n\nN ∝ 1/plx⁵\n\nTo find out how the number of stars changes with distance, we can substitute the relationship between distance and parallax into the given expression. Since r is proportional to 1/plx, it follows that plx is proportional to 1/r. Substituting this into the equation for N gives:\n\nN ∝ 1 / (1/r)⁵\nN ∝ r⁵\n\nThis equation tells us that the total number of stars up to a certain distance *r* is proportional to *r* to the fifth power.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the number of stars *per unit range of distance*, which is not the total number of stars, but the rate of change of the number of stars with distance. This can be found by taking the derivative of N with respect to r (dN/dr):\n\ndN/dr ∝ d(r⁵)/dr\ndN/dr ∝ 5r⁴\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to r⁴.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ r²\nB) ~ r³\nC) ~ r⁵\nD) ~ r⁴\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
