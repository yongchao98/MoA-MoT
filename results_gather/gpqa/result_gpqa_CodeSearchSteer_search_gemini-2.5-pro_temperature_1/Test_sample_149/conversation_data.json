    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product:\n\n**1. Identification of the Starting Compound**\n\nThe molecular formula is C8H9NO. The ¹H-NMR data provides the following information:\n*   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift and multiplicity (triplet) are characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO) adjacent to a methylene (-CH2-) group.\n*   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, indicate a para-substituted benzene ring.\n*   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is typical of an amino group (-NH2).\n*   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet for two protons, consistent with a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the aldehyde proton.\n\nAssembling these fragments (a p-substituted benzene ring, an amino group, and a -CH2CHO group) leads to the structure **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\nThe starting material, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde, is subjected to a three-step reaction sequence:\n\n*   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization)**\n    Primary aromatic amines react with nitrous acid (formed in situ from NaNO2 and HCl) at low temperatures (0-5 °C) to form diazonium salts. The amino group (-NH2) is converted to a diazonium group (-N₂⁺).\n    *   *Intermediate Product:* 4-(diazoniumchloride)phenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **Step 2: H2O (Hydrolysis)**\n    Warming an aqueous solution of a diazonium salt results in the replacement of the diazonium group with a hydroxyl (-OH) group, releasing nitrogen gas.\n    *   *Intermediate Product:* 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde.\n\n*   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation)**\n    This step involves treating 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde with a strong base (KOH) and heat. This molecule has both an aldehyde and acidic α-protons (on the -CH2- group), which are the required components for an aldol condensation.\n    1.  The base (OH⁻) removes an acidic α-proton to form an enolate.\n    2.  The enolate acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of another molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (aldol addition).\n    3.  The resulting β-hydroxy aldehyde is named 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This corresponds to option (A).\n    4.  The \"Heat\" condition promotes the dehydration (loss of a water molecule) of the aldol addition product to form a more stable, conjugated system. This elimination reaction creates a double bond between the α and β carbons (C2 and C3).\n    *   *Final Product:* The dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal yields **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the starting material and the reaction sequence, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>"
