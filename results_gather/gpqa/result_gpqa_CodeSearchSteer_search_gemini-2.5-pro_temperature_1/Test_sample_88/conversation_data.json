    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final product and the coupling pattern of its most deshielded hydrogen atom.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Product 1**\n\n*   **Starting material:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess potassium hydroxide (KOH) at a high temperature (240 °C).\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction involves a strong base and high temperature acting on a dihaloalkane. The adamantane cage is prone to rearrangement under these conditions. The reaction of 1,3-dihaloadamantanes with strong bases is a known method to produce derivatives of protoadamantane, an isomer of adamantane. The characteristic IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates the formation of a ketone, likely one in a strained ring system. The product of this reaction is **protoadamantan-4-one**.\n*   **Product 1:** Protoadamantan-4-one (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]decan-4-one).\n\n**Step 2: Identify Product 2**\n\n*   **Starting material:** Product 1 (protoadamantan-4-one).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess aluminum isopropoxide, with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction. The ketone (Product 1) is reduced to an alcohol, 4-protoadamantanol. The subsequent heating likely causes dehydration (elimination of water) of this alcohol. The elimination will favor the formation of the most stable alkene, which is **protoadamant-4-ene**. The double bond is formed between carbons C4 and C5, which is more stable than forming a bridgehead double bond (which would violate Bredt's Rule).\n*   **Product 2:** Protoadamant-4-ene (tricyclo[4.3.1.0³,⁸]dec-4-ene).\n\n**Step 3: Identify Product 3**\n\n*   **Starting material:** Product 2 (protoadamant-4-ene).\n*   **Reagents:** Ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a reductive ozonolysis reaction, which cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond (C4=C5) and replaces it with two carbonyl groups. Since both C4 and C5 in the alkene are bonded to one hydrogen atom each, the ozonolysis will yield two aldehyde groups. The cleavage of the C4=C5 bond opens one of the rings of the tricyclic protoadamantane system, resulting in a bicyclic dialdehyde.\n*   **Product 3:** Bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Coupling Pattern**\n\n*   **Task:** Identify the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in Product 3 (excluding exchangeable protons).\n*   **Most Deshielded Proton:** In Product 3, the most deshielded protons are the aldehyde protons (-CHO) due to the strong deshielding effect of the carbonyl group. Their chemical shift is typically in the 9-10 ppm range. Due to the symmetry of the bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarbaldehyde molecule, the two aldehyde protons are chemically equivalent, and we will analyze the coupling for one of them.\n*   **Coupling Analysis:** Let's consider the aldehyde group at position C3. The aldehyde proton can couple with protons on adjacent atoms.\n    1.  **Three-bond coupling (³J):** The aldehyde proton can couple with the proton on the carbon to which the aldehyde group is attached (C3). This is the H3 proton. This would split the signal into a doublet.\n    2.  **Four-bond coupling (⁴J):** In rigid bicyclic systems like this, long-range coupling can occur, particularly \"W-coupling,\" where the four bonds form a 'W' shape. The aldehyde proton is in a W-arrangement with the equatorial protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C4. Due to symmetry, the two protons (H2eq and H4eq) are equivalent. Coupling to these two equivalent protons would split the signal into a triplet.\n\n*   **Resulting Pattern:** If both couplings were significant and had different coupling constants, the pattern would be a doublet of triplets (Option A). However, in systems of this type, a specific conformational arrangement is often adopted. The ³J coupling constant is highly dependent on the dihedral angle (the angle between the H-C-C-H bonds). It is a known phenomenon in these rigid bicyclic aldehydes that the molecule adopts a conformation where this dihedral angle is close to 90°. According to the Karplus equation, a dihedral angle of ~90° results in a coupling constant (J) that is close to zero.\n\n*   Therefore, the ³J coupling to the vicinal proton (H3) is negligible and not observed. The dominant coupling is the long-range ⁴J W-coupling to the two equivalent equatorial protons (H2eq and H4eq).\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The aldehyde proton signal is split only by the two equivalent protons it couples to via the W-pathway. According to the n+1 rule, coupling to two equivalent protons (n=2) results in a signal that is a **triplet**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
