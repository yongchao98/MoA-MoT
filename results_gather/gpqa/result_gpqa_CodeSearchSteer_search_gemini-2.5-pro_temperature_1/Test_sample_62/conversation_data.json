    "### Calculation of Photon Momentum for Molecular Transition\n\nTo solve this problem, we must first identify the energy difference (ΔE) between the molecule's ground state and its next lowest possible excited state. This energy difference will equal the energy of the absorbed photon. Subsequently, the photon's momentum (p) can be determined using the relationship E = pc, where c is the speed of light.\n\n**1. Energy Levels of the Rotation-Vibration Model**\n\nThe total energy E(v, J) of a diatomic molecule in the non-rigid rotor model is the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n\n*   **Vibrational Energy:** E_v = ħω(v + 1/2)\n*   **Rotational Energy:** E_r = B·J(J + 1), where B = ħ² / (2I) is the rotational constant.\n\nHere, *v* is the vibrational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...), *J* is the rotational quantum number (0, 1, 2, ...), ħ is the reduced Planck constant, ω is the angular frequency of vibration, and *I* is the moment of inertia.\n\nThe total energy is E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + B·J(J + 1).\n\n**2. Initial and Final States**\n\nThe molecule starts in its fundamental (ground) state, where both quantum numbers are at their minimum: v = 0 and J = 0.\n*   **Initial Energy:** E_initial = E(0, 0) = (1/2)ħω\n\nFor a diatomic molecule to absorb a photon, it must adhere to spectroscopic selection rules. For infrared absorption, the rules for the change in quantum numbers are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1. A transition from J=0 is only possible to J=1 (ΔJ = +1).\n\nTherefore, the \"next state with the lowest possible energy\" reachable via an allowed transition from the ground state is the one with v = 1 and J = 1.\n*   **Final Energy:** E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + B·1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + 2B\n\n**3. Energy of the Absorbed Photon**\n\nThe energy of the photon (ΔE) is the difference between the final and initial states:\n\nΔE = E_final - E_initial\nΔE = [ (3/2)ħω + 2B ] - [ (1/2)ħω ]\nΔE = ħω + 2B\n\nSubstituting B = ħ² / (2I), we get:\nΔE = ħω + ħ²/I\n\n**4. Numerical Calculation**\n\nFirst, we calculate the necessary physical quantities using the provided data:\n*   Mx = 20 amu\n*   My = 2 amu\n*   R = 2 Å = 2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   ω = 4 × 10¹⁴ rad/s\n*   ħ (reduced Planck constant) ≈ 1.0546 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   c (speed of light) ≈ 2.998 × 10⁸ m/s\n*   1 amu ≈ 1.6605 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n**a. Reduced Mass (μ):**\nμ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\nμ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.8182 amu\nμ ≈ 1.8182 * (1.6605 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.0192 × 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n**b. Moment of Inertia (I):**\nI = μ * R²\nI ≈ (3.0192 × 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\nI ≈ 1.2077 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n**c. Photon Energy (ΔE):**\nΔE = ħω + ħ²/I\nΔE ≈ (1.0546 × 10⁻³⁴ * 4 × 10¹⁴) + ( (1.0546 × 10⁻³⁴)² / 1.2077 × 10⁻⁴⁶ )\nΔE ≈ (4.2184 × 10⁻²⁰ J) + (9.208 × 10⁻²³ J)\nΔE ≈ 4.2184 × 10⁻²⁰ J\n*(Note: The rotational energy contribution is significantly smaller than the vibrational energy.)*\n\n**d. Photon Momentum (p):**\nThe momentum of a photon is related to its energy by p = E/c.\np = ΔE / c\np ≈ (4.2184 × 10⁻²⁰ J) / (2.998 × 10⁸ m/s)\np ≈ 1.407 × 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis calculated value is a very close match to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
