    "### Deciphering the Molecular Formula through Spectral Analysis\n\nBy meticulously analyzing the provided FTIR and 1H NMR data, the chemical formula for the unknown di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound can be determined.\n\n#### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data:\n\n1.  **Hydrogen Count from 1H NMR:** The spectrum provides crucial information for determining the total number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** Two signals in the aromatic region, characteristic of a di-substituted benzene ring, strongly suggest a para (1,4) substitution pattern. This accounts for 4 hydrogen atoms (4H).\n    *   **Vinyl Protons:** The presence of a doublet and a doublet of quartets for the two vinyl protons is a classic pattern for a prop-1-enyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). This indicates there are 2 vinyl hydrogens.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** The spectrum shows two distinct signals for methyl (-CH3) groups. One of these belongs to the prop-1-enyl group, and the other must be part of another substituent. These two methyl groups account for a total of 6 hydrogen atoms (3H + 3H).\n    *   **No -CH2 groups:** The explicit absence of signals for methylene (-CH2) groups is a key constraint.\n    *   **Total Hydrogens:** Summing these up (4 aromatic H + 2 vinyl H + 3 vinyl-methyl H + 3 other-methyl H) gives a total of 12 hydrogen atoms in the molecule.\n\n2.  **Evaluating the Options based on Hydrogen Count:**\n    *   A) C12H14O2 (14 H) - Incorrect.\n    *   B) C11H12O2 (12 H) - **Possible.**\n    *   C) C11H14O2 (14 H) - Incorrect.\n    *   D) C12H12O2 (12 H) - **Possible.**\n\n3.  **Determining the Carbon Count and Degree of Unsaturation:** To differentiate between the remaining possibilities (B and D), we can assemble the molecular structure from the spectral data and calculate its degree of unsaturation (DoU). The DoU is the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.\n    *   **Structural Components:**\n        *   A di-substituted (para) benzene ring (C6H4). This has 1 ring and 3 double bonds, contributing 4 to the DoU.\n        *   An ester group (-COO-), confirmed by FTIR. The C=O double bond adds 1 to the DoU.\n        *   A prop-1-enyl group (-CH=CH-CH3). The C=C double bond adds 1 to the DoU.\n    *   **Total Degree of Unsaturation from Structure:** The total DoU is 4 (from the ring) + 1 (from C=O) + 1 (from C=C) = 6.\n\n4.  **Cross-checking with Formulas:** Now, we calculate the DoU for the remaining possible formulas using the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   **For C11H12O2:** DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6. This **matches** the DoU derived from the structure.\n    *   **For C12H12O2:** DoU = 12 + 1 - (12/2) = 13 - 6 = 7. This **does not match** the DoU derived from the structure.\n\nThis inconsistency eliminates C12H12O2. The only formula that is fully consistent with all the provided data is C11H12O2. Two plausible structures for C11H12O2 that fit the data are methyl p-(prop-1-enyl)benzoate and prop-1-enyl p-toluate, both of which have the same molecular formula.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe detailed analysis of the 1H NMR spectrum indicates the molecule contains exactly 12 hydrogen atoms. The structural features inferred from the spectra correspond to a degree of unsaturation of 6. Only the molecular formula C11H12O2 satisfies both of these conditions.\n\n<<<B>>>"
