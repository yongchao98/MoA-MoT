    "The \"impulse\" approximation in many-body nuclear calculations is a simplifying assumption that treats the interaction with a nucleus as a collection of interactions with individual, quasi-free nucleons. This approximation is valid under specific conditions related to the energy of the interaction and the nature of the nuclear forces. The core assumptions that collectively define the impulse approximation are:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons:** The fundamental premise of the impulse approximation is that the incoming probe (for instance, in an electroweak interaction) interacts with only one nucleon at a time. The other nucleons in the nucleus are considered \"spectators\" to this primary interaction. This is often referred to as the \"one-body current\" assumption.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon:** This assumption implies that neither the incoming probe before the interaction nor the struck nucleon after the interaction are significantly affected by the surrounding nuclear medium. This means that final-state interactions (FSI), where the outgoing nucleon rescatters off the remaining (A-1) nucleons, are considered negligible.\n\n3.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces:** During the very short timescale of the high-energy interaction, the forces that bind the nucleon within the nucleus are neglected. The interaction is treated as if it occurs with a free nucleon that just happens to have a certain momentum distribution from its previous state within the nucleus.\n\nThe statement that the quarks internal to the nucleon are non-relativistic (assumption 3) is not a defining feature of the impulse approximation. The impulse approximation can be formulated in both relativistic and non-relativistic frameworks, and it primarily concerns the behavior of nucleons within the nucleus, not the internal structure of the nucleons themselves.\n\nTherefore, the three assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
