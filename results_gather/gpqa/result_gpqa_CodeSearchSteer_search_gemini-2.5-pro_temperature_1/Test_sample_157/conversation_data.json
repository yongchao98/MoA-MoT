    "A dominant-negative mutation produces an altered protein that interferes with the function of the wild-type protein produced by the non-mutated allele. This is particularly common in proteins that must form dimers or other multi-unit complexes to be active.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the scenario:\n\n*   **Normal Function:** The transcription factor subunit must dimerize (pair up) to enter the nucleus and activate genes.\n*   **Mutation Y:** This mutation is in the dimerization domain. This means the mutant protein subunit (Y) can still interact with and bind to a normal, wild-type protein subunit (WT).\n*   **Dominant-Negative Effect:** When a mutant Y subunit dimerizes with a WT subunit, it forms a \"poisoned\" heterodimer (WT-Y). This complex is non-functional. By trapping the WT subunit in an inactive pair, the mutant protein prevents the WT subunit from forming functional WT-WT dimers. This interference leads to an overall loss of the protein's function, even though functional WT subunits are being produced.\n\nAnalyzing the options based on this mechanism:\n\n*   **A) protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele:** This is the most likely molecular phenotype. The \"loss-of-function of the wild-type allele\" accurately describes the outcome where the mutant protein prevents the normal protein from doing its job. Furthermore, a common mechanism for dominant-negative action is that the cell's quality control machinery recognizes the abnormal heterodimer (the WT-mutant pair) and targets the entire complex for degradation. This would lead to the destruction of the wild-type protein along with the mutant one, causing a severe loss of function.\n*   **B) protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype:** While some mutations cause protein aggregation, it is a specific mechanism and not the general definition of a dominant-negative effect.\n*   **C) loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype:** This is incorrect. For a dominant-negative effect to occur in a dimeric protein, the mutant must be *able* to dimerize with the wild-type protein to interfere with it. If it couldn't dimerize at all, it would be a recessive mutation, and the wild-type subunits would function normally.\n*   **D) change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype:** This is incorrect. The term \"dominant-negative\" explicitly implies a loss-of-function phenotype, not a gain-of-function.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description of the molecular phenotype is the loss of function of the wild-type protein's product, potentially mediated by the degradation of the non-functional heterodimer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
