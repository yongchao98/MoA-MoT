    "### Analysis of the Reactions\n\nBoth reactions presented are examples of the Michael addition, a fundamental carbon-carbon bond-forming reaction in organic chemistry. This reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile (a Michael donor) to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound or other electron-withdrawing group (a Michael acceptor).\n\n#### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is a Michael addition. The base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), deprotonates the ketone to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the ethyl acrylate.\n2.  **Enolate Formation**: The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The α-carbons are at positions 2 and 6. Carbon 2 has no protons as it is fully substituted with an ethyl and a methyl group. Carbon 6 has one acidic proton. Therefore, the bulky base t-BuOK will selectively deprotonate at the C6 position to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n3.  **Michael Addition**: The C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is a 1,4-conjugate addition.\n4.  **Product Structure & Nomenclature**: A new carbon-carbon bond forms between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate. To name the resulting product as a propanoate ester, the cyclohexanone ring is treated as a substituent on the ethyl propanoate chain. Following IUPAC rules, the point of attachment on the ring is designated as C1'. The numbering of the ring then proceeds to give the principal functional group (the ketone's oxo group) the lowest possible number, which is C2'. The original substituents of the ketone are located accordingly.\n    *   **Substituent at C3 of ethyl propanoate**: `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)`\n    *   **Full name of Product A**: `ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate`\n\n#### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type**: This is also a Michael addition. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the carbon alpha to the nitro group.\n2.  **Nucleophile Formation**: Protons on the carbon adjacent to a nitro group are acidic. KOH is a sufficiently strong base to deprotonate the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂NO₂), forming a nitronate anion, which acts as the nucleophile.\n3.  **Michael Addition**: The nucleophilic α-carbon of the nitronate attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile, CH₃CH=CHCN).\n4.  **Product Structure & Nomenclature**: A new C-C bond is formed. The resulting acyclic product needs to be named according to IUPAC rules for nitriles. The longest carbon chain containing the nitrile group (-CN) is identified as the parent chain.\n    *   **Structure**: `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`\n    *   **Parent chain**: The longest chain including the nitrile carbon has six carbons, making it a hexanenitrile.\n    *   **Numbering**: The chain is numbered starting from the nitrile carbon as C1.\n    *   **Substituents**: A methyl group is at C3 and a nitro group is at C4.\n    *   **Full name of Product B**: `3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the mechanistic analysis of both Michael addition reactions and the application of IUPAC nomenclature rules:\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nThis combination matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
