    "To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in the electrophilic bromination of the given substances, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric properties of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n**Analysis of Substituents**\n\nThe rate and orientation of electrophilic aromatic substitution are governed by the nature of the substituent already present on the benzene ring. Substituents are classified as either activating (electron-donating) or deactivating (electron-withdrawing), and as ortho, para-directing or meta-directing.\n\n1.  **Meta-Directing Groups:** These groups deactivate the ring and direct the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br+) primarily to the meta position. Consequently, the yield of the para-isomer is extremely low, close to zero. The substances with meta-directing groups will have the lowest para-isomer yields.\n    *   **C₆H₅-NO₂ (Nitrobenzene, 4):** The nitro group (-NO₂) is a very strong electron-withdrawing group, making it a strong deactivator and a meta-director. It will produce the least amount of para-isomer.\n    *   **C₆H₅-COOC₂H₅ (Ethyl benzoate, 2):** The ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is an electron-withdrawing group, a deactivator, and a meta-director.\n    *   **C₆H₅-COOH (Benzoic acid, 6):** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is also an electron-withdrawing, deactivating, and meta-directing group.\n\n    Among these three, the deactivating strength generally follows the order -NO₂ > -COOR ≈ -COOH. The stronger the deactivating and meta-directing effect, the lower the yield of the para-isomer. Therefore, the order of increasing para-yield among these is: Nitrobenzene (4) < Ethyl benzoate (2) < Benzoic acid (6).\n\n2.  **Ortho, Para-Directing Groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. The yield of the para-isomer is significant for these substances. The ratio of para to ortho product is primarily influenced by steric hindrance – larger substituents will sterically hinder the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer.\n    *   **C₆H₅-Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3):** The chloro group (-Cl) is deactivating overall but is ortho, para-directing due to electron donation by resonance. Halogens typically yield a high proportion of the para-isomer compared to the ortho-isomer. For bromination, the para-isomer is the major product.\n    *   **C₆H₅-CH₃ (Toluene, 1):** The methyl group (-CH₃) is an activating, ortho, para-directing group. Due to its relatively small size, a considerable amount of the ortho-isomer is formed, although the para-isomer is still slightly favored. In bromination, the para/ortho ratio is approximately 1.8:1, meaning about 64% of the mixture is the para-isomer.\n    *   **C₆H₅-C₂H₅ (Ethylbenzene, 5):** The ethyl group (-C₂H₅) is also an activating, ortho, para-directing group. It is sterically bulkier than the methyl group. This increased steric hindrance at the ortho positions leads to a higher yield of the para-isomer compared to toluene. For bromination, the para-isomer constitutes about 93% of the ortho-para product mixture.\n\n    Ordering the ortho, para-directors by increasing para-yield: The -C₂H₅ group is significantly bulkier than the -CH₃ group, leading to a higher para/ortho ratio for ethylbenzene than for toluene. The -Cl group, while also favoring the para position, results in a very high para yield, often the highest among these three common substituents due to a combination of electronic and steric factors. Thus, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\n**Overall Ordering**\n\nCombining the two groups, we first list the meta-directors in order of increasing (but still very low) para-yield, followed by the ortho, para-directors in order of increasing para-yield.\n\n*   **Meta-directors (lowest para-yield):** 4 < 2 < 6\n*   **Ortho, para-directors (highest para-yield):** 1 < 5 < 3\n\nThe complete sequence in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 2 < 6 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
