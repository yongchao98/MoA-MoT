    "Based on the detailed analysis of the provided spectral data, the correct compound is identified by systematically evaluating each option.\n\n### **Analysis of Provided Data**\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula:** C9H11NO2\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as 5. This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional double bond, likely a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n2.  **IR Spectrum:**\n    *   The two distinct bands at **3420 cm-1** and **3325 cm-1** are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n    *   The strong absorption at **1720 cm-1** is typical for the C=O stretch of a carbonyl group, specifically an aromatic ester.\n\n3.  **1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons indicates a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons suggests a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3). The significant downfield shift to 4.5 ppm is characteristic of a methylene group attached to an ester oxygen (-O-CH2-). Together, the signals at 1.20 and 4.5 ppm confirm the presence of an **ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3)** attached to the carbonyl carbon of an ester.\n    *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is indicative of a primary amine (-NH2). The broadness is due to proton exchange and quadrupolar relaxation from the nitrogen atom.\n    *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons at 8.0 ppm are downfield due to the deshielding effect of the electron-withdrawing ester group, while the protons at 7.0 ppm are upfield due to the electron-donating effect of the amino group.\n\n### **Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** The structure, also known as Benzocaine, has a primary amine (-NH2), an ethyl ester group, and a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring. This structure perfectly matches all the IR and 1H NMR data, including the chemical formula C9H11NO2.\n\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** This compound is a primary amide, not an ester. The C=O stretch for an amide would be at a lower frequency (around 1650-1690 cm-1), which contradicts the IR band at 1720 cm-1. Also, as a 1,3-disubstituted (meta) benzene, it would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum, not two simple doublets.\n\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** This is a secondary amide, which would show only a single N-H stretch in the IR spectrum and a 1H signal for the N-H proton in the NMR, contradicting the data indicating a primary amine (-NH2) with two N-H stretches and two protons.\n\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This compound is a phenyl ester with a propionate group (-CO-CH2CH3). The NMR would show a quartet for the -CH2- group adjacent to the carbonyl at around 2.2-2.6 ppm, not at 4.5 ppm. The data clearly shows an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3), not a propionate group.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAll spectral evidence points unequivocally to **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
