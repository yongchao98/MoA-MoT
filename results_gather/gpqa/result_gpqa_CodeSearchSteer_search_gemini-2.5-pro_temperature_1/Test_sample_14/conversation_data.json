    "The search results confirm the formulas I used.\n\n1.  **Transit Probability:** For a circular orbit, the geometric transit probability is approximated as p_transit ≈ R_star / a, where R_star is the radius of the star and 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. This is the formula I used.\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** The relationship between orbital period (P), semi-major axis (a), and the mass of the host star (M_star) is given by P² = (4π²a³) / (G * M_star). This can be rearranged to solve for 'a', which shows that 'a' is proportional to (M_star * P²)^(1/3). This confirms the proportionality I used in my derivation.\n\nMy derivation was as follows:\n- p_transit1 / p_transit2 = [R_star1 / a1] / [R_star2 / a2]\n- Since a is proportional to (M_star * P²)^(1/3), the ratio becomes:\n- p_transit1 / p_transit2 = (R_star1 / R_star2) * [(M_star2 * P2²)/(M_star1 * P1²)]^(1/3)\n\nGiven information:\n- R_star1 = R_star2\n- M_star1 = 2 * M_star2\n- P1 = P2 / 3\n\nSubstituting these into the ratio equation:\n- p_transit1 / p_transit2 = (1) * [(M_star2 * P2²) / ( (2 * M_star2) * (P2 / 3)² )]^(1/3)\n- p_transit1 / p_transit2 = [(M_star2 * P2²) / (2 * M_star2 * P2² / 9)]^(1/3)\n- The M_star2 and P2² terms cancel out.\n- p_transit1 / p_transit2 = [1 / (2/9)]^(1/3)\n- p_transit1 / p_transit2 = (9/2)^(1/3)\n- p_transit1 / p_transit2 = (4.5)^(1/3)\n- p_transit1 / p_transit2 ≈ 1.65096\n\nThis confirms that the probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred target for observation. This matches option D.\n\nFinal check of the question and options.\n- The question asks which planet has the highest probability of transiting and by what factor.\n- My calculation shows Planet_1 has a ~1.65 times higher probability.\n- Option D states: Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\n\nThe logic and calculations are sound and confirmed by the search results.\n\nFinal Answer is D.\n\nThe probability of a planet transiting its host star is determined by the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital semi-major axis. For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-major axis can be determined using Kepler's Third Law, which relates the orbital period, the semi-major axis, and the mass of the host star.\n\nThe transit probability (p) can be expressed as:\np ∝ R_star / a\n\nWhere:\n*   R_star is the radius of the host star.\n*   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nFrom Kepler's Third Law, the semi-major axis (a) is related to the orbital period (P) and the host star's mass (M_star) as follows:\na³ ∝ M_star * P²\nTherefore, a ∝ (M_star * P²)^(1/3)\n\nWe can now write the proportionality for the transit probability as:\np ∝ R_star / (M_star * P²)^(1/3)\n\nTo find which planet has a higher transit probability, we can calculate the ratio of the probabilities for Planet_1 (p₁) and Planet_2 (p₂):\np₁ / p₂ = [R_star₁ / (M_star₁ * P₁²)^(1/3)] / [R_star₂ / (M_star₂ * P₂²)^(1/3)]\n\nThe problem provides the following relationships:\n*   The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2: P₁ = P₂ / 3.\n*   The mass of the host star of Planet_1 is twice that of the host star of Planet_2: M_star₁ = 2 * M_star₂.\n*   The radii of both host stars are the same: R_star₁ = R_star₂.\n\nSubstituting these values into the ratio equation:\np₁ / p₂ = [R_star₂ / ((2 * M_star₂) * (P₂ / 3)²)^(1/3)] / [R_star₂ / (M_star₂ * P₂²)^(1/3)]\n\nThe R_star₂ terms cancel out:\np₁ / p₂ = (M_star₂ * P₂²)^(1/3) / ((2 * M_star₂) * (P₂² / 9))^(1/3)\np₁ / p₂ = (M_star₂ * P₂²)^(1/3) / ((2/9) * M_star₂ * P₂²)^(1/3)\n\nThe M_star₂ and P₂² terms also cancel out:\np₁ / p₂ = 1 / (2/9)^(1/3)\np₁ / p₂ = (9/2)^(1/3)\np₁ / p₂ = (4.5)^(1/3)\n\nCalculating the cube root of 4.5:\np₁ / p₂ ≈ 1.65\n\nThis means the transit probability for Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than for Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.\nB) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.\nC) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.\nD) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\n\nThe calculated result matches option D.\nTo determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we need to compare their geometric transit probabilities. For a planet in a circular orbit, the transit probability (p_transit) is the ratio of the stellar radius (R_star) to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (a).\n\nThe formula for transit probability is:\n`p_transit = R_star / a`\n\nAccording to Kepler's Third Law, the semi-major axis (a) is related to the orbital period (P) and the mass of the host star (M_star) by the following equation:\n`P² = (4π² * a³) / (G * M_star)`\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for the semi-major axis, 'a':\n`a = (G * M_star * P² / (4π²))^(1/3)`\n\nThis shows that the semi-major axis 'a' is proportional to `(M_star * P²)^(1/3)`. Therefore, the transit probability is proportional to:\n`p_transit ∝ R_star / (M_star * P²)^(1/3)`\n\nNow, let's establish the ratio of the transit probabilities of Planet_1 (p₁) to Planet_2 (p₂):\n`p₁ / p₂ = (R_star₁ / (M_star₁ * P₁²)^(1/3)) / (R_star₂ / (M_star₂ * P₂²)^(1/3))`\n\nWe are given the following information:\n*   `P₁ = P₂ / 3`\n*   `M_star₁ = 2 * M_star₂`\n*   `R_star₁ = R_star₂`\n\nSubstituting these relationships into the ratio equation:\n`p₁ / p₂ = (R_star₂ / ((2 * M_star₂) * (P₂ / 3)²)^(1/3)) / (R_star₂ / (M_star₂ * P₂²)^(1/3))`\n\nWe can simplify this by canceling out terms:\n`p₁ / p₂ = (M_star₂ * P₂²)^(1/3) / (2 * M_star₂ * P₂² / 9)^(1/3)`\n`p₁ / p₂ = 1 / (2/9)^(1/3)`\n`p₁ / p₂ = (9/2)^(1/3)`\n`p₁ / p₂ = (4.5)^(1/3)`\n`p₁ / p₂ ≈ 1.65`\n\nThe calculation shows that the transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_1 is the preferred object for observation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
