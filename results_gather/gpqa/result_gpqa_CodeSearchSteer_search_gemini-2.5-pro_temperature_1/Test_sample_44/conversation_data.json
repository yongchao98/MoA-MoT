    "To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we must apply the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n### Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nFirst, the energy levels for a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L are quantized and given by the formula:\n*   E_n = n² * (π²ħ² / 2mL²)\n\nWhere `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...). The problem defines the base energy unit as E = π²ħ² / 2mL². Therefore, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n*   E_n = n²E\n\nThis gives us the following energy levels for increasing `n`:\n*   E₁ = 1²E = 1E\n*   E₂ = 2²E = 4E\n*   E₃ = 3²E = 9E\n*   E₄ = 4²E = 16E\n*   and so on.\n\n### Multi-Particle System (Fermions)\n\nThe particles are described as identical and having spin-1/2, which means they are fermions. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. For a particle in this potential well, a quantum state is defined by its energy level `n` and its spin (either up or down). This means each energy level `n` can hold a maximum of two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down.\n\n### Calculation of System Energies\n\nTo find the total energy of the four-particle system, we sum the energies of the individual particles.\n\n**Ground State:**\nTo achieve the lowest possible total energy (the ground state), we fill the energy levels from the bottom up.\n*   Two particles fill the n=1 level. Their combined energy is 2 × E₁ = 2 × 1E = 2E.\n*   The remaining two particles fill the n=2 level. Their combined energy is 2 × E₂ = 2 × 4E = 8E.\n*   **Total Ground State Energy** = 2E + 8E = **10E**.\n\n**First Excited State:**\nTo find the energy of the first excited state, we promote one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state to the lowest unoccupied energy level.\n*   The ground state configuration is two particles in n=1 and two in n=2.\n*   We move one particle from the n=2 level to the next available level, n=3.\n*   The new configuration is: two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, and one particle in n=3.\n*   The total energy for this configuration is (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E.\n*   **Total First Excited State Energy** = **15E**.\n\n**Second Excited State:**\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy above the first excited state. We must consider all possible promotions from the ground state that would result in a higher energy than the first excited state.\n*   **Possibility 1: Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.**\n    *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × E₁) + (2 × E₂) + (1 × E₃) = (1 × 1E) + (2 × 4E) + (1 × 9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = **18E**.\n*   **Possibility 2: Promote both particles from n=2 to n=3.**\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, zero in n=2, and two in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (2 × E₃) = (2 × 1E) + (2 × 9E) = 2E + 18E = **20E**.\n*   **Possibility 3: Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.**\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × E₁) + (1 × E₂) + (1 × E₄) = (2 × 1E) + (1 × 4E) + (1 × 16E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = **22E**.\n\nComparing these possible energies (18E, 20E, 22E), the lowest among them is 18E. This is the energy of the second excited state.\n*   **Total Second Excited State Energy** = **18E**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated energies for the system are:\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
