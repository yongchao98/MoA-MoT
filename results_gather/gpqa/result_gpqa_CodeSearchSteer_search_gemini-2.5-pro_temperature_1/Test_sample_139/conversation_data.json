    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify Substance X and calculate the required atomic masses:\n\n**1. Identifying Substance X**\n\n*   **Heavier Isotope & Organic Chemistry Reagent:** The problem states that Substance X contains a heavier isotope of one of its elements and is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, along with its close analog. This points towards deuterated reducing agents, as deuterium (D or ²H) is a common heavy isotope used in organic synthesis. The most common of these reagents are Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄) and its deuterated analog, Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n\n*   **Reaction with Liquid Y:** Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to produce a gas W and a precipitate G.\n    *   **Gas W:** The key clue is that a molecule of gas W has an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's analyze the possibilities:\n        *   Hydrogen gas (H₂): Each atom has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. A molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. (Incorrect)\n        *   Deuterium gas (D₂): Each atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. A molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. (Correct)\n    *   To produce D₂ gas, LiAlD₄ would need to react with a source of deuterium, meaning **Liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O)**. The reaction is: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂.\n\n*   **Precipitate G and Substance B:** The reaction produces lithium deuteroxide (LiOD), which is soluble, and aluminum deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), which is a precipitate. Therefore, **G is Al(OD)₃**. When aluminum hydroxide is heated, it decomposes to aluminum oxide and water. Similarly, heating G (Al(OD)₃) would produce aluminum oxide and heavy water (D₂O). Thus, **Substance B is D₂O**.\n\n*   **Melting Point of B:** The melting point of B is close to 277 K. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C, which is 276.97 K. This is extremely close to the given value.\n\n*   **Reaction with a Keto Acid:** The problem states the product of the reaction between a keto acid and substance X contains 2 oxygen atoms. LiAlH₄ (and by extension LiAlD₄) is a powerful reducing agent capable of reducing both ketones and carboxylic acids to alcohols. For instance, the reduction of an α-keto acid like pyruvic acid (CH₃COCOOH, which has 3 oxygen atoms) with LiAlH₄ yields 1,2-propanediol (CH₃CH(OH)CH₂OH, which has 2 oxygen atoms). This matches the description.\n\nBased on this evidence, **Substance X is Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n\n**2. Calculating the Cumulative Atomic Masses**\n\nThe question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in LiAlD₄.\n\n*   **Elements in LiAlD₄:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Deuterium (D, an isotope of Hydrogen).\n*   **Lightest Element:** The element with the lowest atomic number is Hydrogen (Z=1). In Substance X, it is present as its heavier isotope, Deuterium.\n*   **Heaviest Element:** The element with the highest atomic number is Aluminum (Z=13).\n*   **Atomic Masses:**\n    *   The mass of the single heaviest element atom, Aluminum (²⁷Al), is approximately 27 amu.\n    *   The mass of the lightest element's isotopes must be summed. There are four atoms of Deuterium (²H). The mass of one deuterium atom is approximately 2 amu.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Mass of the heaviest element (Aluminum) = 1 × 27 = 27 amu\n    *   Mass of the lightest element (Hydrogen as Deuterium) = 4 × 2 = 8 amu\n    *   Cumulative Mass = 27 + 8 = 35 amu\n\nThe cumulative atomic mass is 35.\n\n<<<B>>>"
