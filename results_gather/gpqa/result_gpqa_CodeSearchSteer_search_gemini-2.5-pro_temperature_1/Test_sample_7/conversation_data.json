  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

    "Here is an analysis of the experimental results to determine the interactions between genes G1, G2, and G3.\n\n### Analysis of the Genetic Data\n\n1.  **Analyze the single-gene mutants:**\n    *   **g1 mutant:** Shows 75% resistance. This indicates that gene G1 contributes to the resistance phenotype, as its removal causes a 25% drop in resistance.\n    *   **g2 mutant:** Shows 0% resistance. The loss of gene G2 completely abolishes resistance, meaning G2 is essential for this trait.\n    *   **g3 mutant:** Shows 50% resistance. The loss of gene G3 causes a 50% drop, indicating it plays a more significant role in resistance than G1.\n\n2.  **Analyze the double-gene mutants:**\n    *   **g1g2 and g2g3 mutants:** Both of these double mutants show 0% resistance. This phenotype is identical to that of the g2 single mutant. When the effect of a mutation in one gene masks the effect of a mutation in another gene, this is known as **epistasis**. In this case, the `g2` mutation is epistatic to both the `g1` and `g3` mutations. In a biological pathway, a gene that is upstream is often epistatic to genes that are downstream. Given that the prompt states at least one gene is a transcription factor, the most logical conclusion is that G2 is an upstream transcription factor that regulates the expression or function of G1 and G3.\n\n    *   **g1g3 mutant:** Shows 10% resistance. This phenotype is more severe than either of the single mutants (`g1` at 75% and `g3` at 50%). If the genes acted independently, we would expect an additive effect, resulting in approximately 25% resistance (100% - 25% drop from g1 - 50% drop from g3). The observed resistance of 10% is much lower than the expected additive effect, an interaction known as **synergistic epistasis** or a synergistic interaction. This type of interaction often occurs when two genes have partially overlapping or **redundant** functions; while the loss of one can be partially compensated for, the loss of both results in a much more severe phenotype.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** The conclusion that G2 is a transcription factor is strongly supported. However, the claim that G3 is epistatic to G1 is incorrect; the `g1g3` phenotype (10% resistance) is not the same as the `g3` phenotype (50% resistance).\n\n*   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** The conclusion that G2 is a transcription factor is correct. However, pleiotropy refers to a single gene affecting multiple traits, which cannot be determined from this experiment. The claim that G1 is epistatic to G3 is also incorrect, as the `g1g3` phenotype (10%) differs from the `g1` phenotype (75%).\n\n*   **C) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** This is incorrect because G2, not G1, shows the epistatic effect over the other genes, indicating it is the upstream regulator.\n\n*   **D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** This option correctly identifies G2 as a transcription factor. It also correctly describes the relationship between G1 and G3 as gene redundancy, which is a plausible interpretation of their synergistic interaction. The final clause, \"G1 is epistatic towards G3,\" is factually inconsistent with the data. However, compared to the other options, this one contains the two most accurate descriptions of the genetic relationships derived from the experiment. The error in the final clause is likely a flaw in the question's design, but the first two statements make this the best possible answer.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the first two statements in option D provide the most accurate description of the experimental outcomes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
