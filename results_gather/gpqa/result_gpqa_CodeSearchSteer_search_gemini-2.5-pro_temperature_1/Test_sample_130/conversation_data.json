    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dicarboxylic Anhydride:** A *cis*-alkene dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated. The resulting anhydride shows a single ¹H NMR peak at 7 ppm and two ¹³C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons). This high degree of symmetry, along with the chemical shifts, points unequivocally to **maleic anhydride**. The two vinyl protons are chemically equivalent, as are the two alkene carbons and the two carbonyl carbons.\n    *   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This [4+2] cycloaddition forms a bicyclic adduct.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is the sum of the reactants: C₉H₁₄ (diene) + C₄H₂O₃ (anhydride) = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the information given.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Major and Minor Products:**\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and *exo* products.\n    *   The *endo* product is often favored due to secondary orbital interactions (kinetic control). However, the diene used here is heavily substituted with four methyl groups.\n    *   The methyl groups at the C1 and C4 positions of the diene create significant steric hindrance. This hindrance disfavors the *endo* transition state, where the anhydride ring would be tucked underneath and clash with these methyl groups.\n    *   Consequently, the *exo* transition state is less sterically hindered and leads to the **exo adduct as the major product**. The *endo* adduct is the minor product.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Structures and Expected NOESY Spectra:**\n    *   A 2D NOESY spectrum shows cross-peaks between protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å). We are looking for a spatial proximity that exists in the major (*exo*) product but not in the minor (*endo*) product.\n    *   Let's identify the key protons in the product:\n        *   **Vinyl Methyl Protons (Meₐ):** Two methyl groups attached to the double bond of the newly formed cyclohexene ring. They are equivalent by symmetry. Signal: **6H singlet, ~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons (Meₑ):** Two methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons. They are also equivalent by symmetry. Signal: **6H singlet, ~1.0-1.2 ppm**.\n        *   **Anhydride-Junction Protons (Hₓ):** The two protons on the carbons where the anhydride ring is fused. They are equivalent by symmetry and not coupled to other protons. Signal: **2H singlet, ~3.5 ppm** (deshielded by adjacent carbonyl groups).\n    *   Now, let's consider the spatial arrangement in each isomer:\n        *   **Exo Isomer (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is *anti* (on the opposite side) to the CH₂ bridge. In this arrangement, the anhydride-junction protons (Hₓ) are oriented inward, pointing directly toward the vinyl methyl groups (Meₐ). This proximity will result in a **strong NOESY cross-peak** between Hₓ and Meₐ.\n        *   **Endo Isomer (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is *syn* (on the same side) to the CH₂ bridge. Here, the anhydride-junction protons (Hₓ) are oriented outward, far away from the vinyl methyl groups (Meₐ). Therefore, the corresponding NOESY cross-peak will be **absent or very weak**.\n\n5.  **Match the Findings with the Options:**\n    *   The distinguishing cross-peak, present in the major product (*exo*) but absent in the minor (*endo*), connects the anhydride-junction protons (Hₓ) and the vinyl methyl protons (Meₐ).\n    *   The signals are: a **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (Hₓ) and a **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** (Meₐ).\n    *   This corresponds directly to option D.\n\n    *   **A) A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** Incorrect integration and multiplicity for the methyl group signal.\n    *   **B) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** Incorrect signal for the anhydride-junction protons.\n    *   **C) A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** This would be a cross-peak between the two different sets of methyl groups. While possible, it is not the key distinguishing interaction between the two isomers.\n    *   **D) A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** This perfectly matches the expected NOE correlation between the vinyl methyl protons and the anhydride-junction protons in the major *exo* product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
