    "To identify the unknown white solid, we must analyze the provided spectral data and compare it with the structures of the possible options.\n\n### Analysis of Spectral Data:\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   A molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156** indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156 g/mol.\n    *   The presence of a peak at **m/z = 158** with a relative intensity of about 32% (M+2 peak) is a strong indicator of a single chlorine atom in the molecule, due to the natural isotopic abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl (approximately 3:1 ratio).\n    *   Let's check the molecular weight of the options: The chemical formula for all four options is C₇H₅ClO₂, which has a molecular weight of approximately 156.5 g/mol, consistent with the mass spectrum.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very **broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹** is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   A **strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   This combination of peaks strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. This eliminates option A (aldehyde and hydroxyl) and option B (chloroformate, which would lack the broad O-H peak).\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal in this region (typically 10-13 ppm) that is a singlet and integrates to one proton is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals are in the aromatic region. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a *para* (1,4) disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options:\n\n*   **A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:** This molecule is an aldehyde with a hydroxyl group. It would not have the characteristic carboxylic acid proton at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR spectrum or the specific broad IR peak of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n*   **B) Phenyl chloroformate:** This is an ester-like molecule (an acid chloride). It lacks the acidic proton and therefore would not show a signal at 11.0 ppm in the ¹H NMR or the broad O-H stretch in the IR spectrum.\n*   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **MS:** It contains chlorine and has the correct molecular weight.\n    *   **IR:** It is a carboxylic acid, matching the IR data perfectly.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** It has a carboxylic acid proton (matches 11.0 ppm signal) and a *para*-substituted ring, which would produce two doublets for the aromatic protons. The protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group would be further downfield (8.02 ppm) than the protons adjacent to the chlorine atom (7.72 ppm). This matches the data exactly.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n    *   **MS and IR:** As a chlorobenzoic acid isomer, it matches the mass and IR data.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Although it has the carboxylic acid proton, its *ortho* (1,2) substitution pattern on the benzene ring would create a more complex splitting pattern for the four aromatic protons, not two simple doublets integrating to 2H each.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe combined evidence from mass spectrometry, IR spectroscopy, and ¹H NMR spectroscopy points unequivocally to **4-chlorobenzoic acid** as the identity of the unknown compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
