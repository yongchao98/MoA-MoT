    "To determine the order of magnitude of the entropy of the supermassive black hole, we can follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Understand the Relationships and Formulas\n\n*   **Angular Size:** The physical diameter (`D`) of an object is related to its angular size (`θ`) and its distance (`d`) by the formula `D = θ * d`. The angle `θ` must be in radians for this formula.\n*   **Schwarzschild Radius:** The diameter of a non-rotating black hole's event horizon is twice its Schwarzschild radius (`R_s`). The formula for the Schwarzschild radius is `R_s = 2GM/c^2`, where `G` is the gravitational constant, `M` is the mass of the black hole, and `c` is the speed of light.\n*   **Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy:** The entropy of a black hole (`S`) is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula: `S = (k_B * A) / (4 * l_p^2)`, where `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant, `A` is the area of the event horizon, and `l_p` is the Planck length. An equivalent and more direct formula is `S = (k_B * A * c^3) / (4 * G * ħ)`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant. The area of the event horizon, `A`, is `4πR_s^2`.\n\n### 2. List Given Values and Constants\n\n**Given Values:**\n*   Distance, `d = 10^10` parsecs\n*   Angular size, `θ = 10^-17` degrees\n\n**Physical Constants:**\n*   Speed of light, `c ≈ 3.00 × 10^8` m/s\n*   Gravitational constant, `G ≈ 6.674 × 10^-11` m³⋅kg⁻¹⋅s⁻²\n*   Boltzmann constant, `k_B ≈ 1.38 × 10^-23` J/K\n*   Reduced Planck constant, `ħ ≈ 1.054 × 10^-34` J⋅s\n*   Parsec to meter conversion: `1 pc ≈ 3.086 × 10^16` m\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Step 1: Convert Units**\nFirst, convert the distance from parsecs to meters and the angular size from degrees to radians.\n*   `d = 10^10 pc * (3.086 × 10^16 m/pc) = 3.086 × 10^26 m`\n*   `θ_rad = 10^-17 degrees * (π / 180) ≈ 1.745 × 10^-19` radians\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Schwarzschild Radius (`R_s`)**\nThe diameter of the event horizon is `D = 2 * R_s`. Using the small angle formula, `D = θ_rad * d`.\n*   `2 * R_s = (1.745 × 10^-19) * (3.086 × 10^26 m) ≈ 5.385 × 10^7 m`\n*   `R_s = (5.385 × 10^7 m) / 2 ≈ 2.693 × 10^7 m`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Area of the Event Horizon (`A`)**\nThe area of a sphere is `A = 4πR_s^2`.\n*   `A = 4 * π * (2.693 × 10^7 m)^2 ≈ 4 * π * (7.252 × 10^14 m^2) ≈ 9.113 × 10^15 m^2`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Entropy (`S`)**\nUsing the Bekenstein-Hawking formula: `S = (k_B * A * c^3) / (4 * G * ħ)`.\n*   Numerator: `k_B * A * c^3 ≈ (1.38 × 10^-23 J/K) * (9.113 × 10^15 m^2) * (3.00 × 10^8 m/s)^3`\n    `≈ (1.258 × 10^-7) * (2.7 × 10^25) ≈ 3.396 × 10^18` J⋅m²⋅s³/K\n*   Denominator: `4 * G * ħ ≈ 4 * (6.674 × 10^-11 m³⋅kg⁻¹⋅s⁻²) * (1.054 × 10^-34 J⋅s)`\n    `≈ 4 * (7.034 × 10^-45) ≈ 2.814 × 10^-44` m³⋅kg⁻¹⋅s⁻¹⋅J⋅s\n*   `S ≈ (3.396 × 10^18) / (2.814 × 10^-44) ≈ 1.207 × 10^62` J/K\n\nThe calculated entropy is approximately `1.207 × 10^62` J/K. The order of magnitude is `10^62`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
