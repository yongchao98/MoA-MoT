    "The problem involves the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and its effect on particle decay.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Understand the particle decay formula in the lab frame.**\n    The fraction of particles, N/N₀, that survive after a time `t` in the lab frame is given by the exponential decay law:\n    N/N₀ = exp(-t / τ_lab)\n    where:\n    *   N is the number of particles remaining.\n    *   N₀ is the initial number of particles.\n    *   `t` is the time of flight in the lab frame.\n    *   τ_lab is the average lifetime of the particle in the lab frame.\n\n2.  **Relate lab frame quantities to the problem's parameters.**\n    *   The time of flight `t` for a particle to reach the detector wall of radius `R` (30 m) at a velocity `v` is `t = R/v`. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic (v ≈ c, the speed of light), we can approximate `t ≈ R/c`.\n    *   The particle's lifetime in the lab frame, τ_lab, is dilated due to its high speed. It is related to its proper lifetime τ (the lifetime in its own rest frame) by the Lorentz factor γ: τ_lab = γτ.\n\n3.  **Combine the formulas.**\n    Substituting these into the decay equation gives the survival fraction:\n    N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γτ)) = exp(-R / (γcτ))\n\n4.  **Use the initial conditions to find the constant `cτ`.**\n    We are given that for the first scenario:\n    *   Survival fraction (N₁/N₀) = 1/3\n    *   Lorentz factor (γ₁) = 20\n    *   Radius (R) = 30 m\n\n    Plugging these values into the equation:\n    1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * cτ))\n\n    To solve for `cτ`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * cτ)\n    -ln(3) = -1.5 / (cτ)\n    ln(3) = 1.5 / (cτ)\n\n    This gives us a relationship for the constant term `cτ`: `cτ = 1.5 / ln(3)`. We don't need to calculate its exact value yet.\n\n5.  **Use the target conditions to find the new Lorentz factor (γ₂).**\n    For the second scenario, we want:\n    *   Survival fraction (N₂/N₀) = 2/3\n    *   Radius (R) = 30 m\n\n    We need to find the new Lorentz factor, γ₂. Using the same survival equation:\n    2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * cτ))\n\n    Again, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n    -ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n    ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)\n\n6.  **Solve for γ₂.**\n    We can now set up a ratio between the two scenarios to eliminate the constant `cτ`.\n    From step 4: `ln(3) = 1.5 / cτ`\n    From step 5: `ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * cτ)`\n\n    Let's rearrange both to isolate `cτ`:\n    `cτ = 1.5 / ln(3)`\n    `cτ = 30 / (γ₂ * ln(3/2))`\n\n    Now, set the two expressions for `cτ` equal to each other:\n    1.5 / ln(3) = 30 / (γ₂ * ln(3/2))\n\n    Now, solve for γ₂:\n    γ₂ * ln(3/2) * 1.5 = 30 * ln(3)\n    γ₂ = (30 * ln(3)) / (1.5 * ln(3/2))\n    γ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2)\n\n    Using the approximate values for the natural logarithms (ln(3) ≈ 1.0986 and ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055):\n    γ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)\n    γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709\n    γ₂ ≈ 54.18\n\nThis value is approximately 54.\n\n<<<D>>>"
