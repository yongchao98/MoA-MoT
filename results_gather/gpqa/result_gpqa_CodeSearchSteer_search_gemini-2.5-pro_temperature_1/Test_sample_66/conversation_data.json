    "The search results confirm my reasoning.\n\n*   **Rule of m addition:** Several sources explicitly state that when adding two angular momenta, $j_1$ and $j_2$, to get a total angular momentum $j$, the z-component quantum number $m$ of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-component quantum numbers, $m_1$ and $m_2$. This is expressed as a selection rule for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which are the coefficients used to expand the coupled state in terms of the uncoupled states. The coefficient $<j_1, m_1; j_2, m_2 | j, m>$ is zero unless $m = m_1 + m_2$.\n\n*   **Initial State:** The system is in the state $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>$. This is a coupled state. Here, the quantum number for the z-component of the *total* orbital angular momentum is $m = -1$.\n\n*   **Measurement Outcome:** We want to find the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ to be $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ corresponds to the quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$ corresponds to the quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\n*   **Analysis:** For the measurement outcome ($m_{l1} = -1$, $m_{l2} = -1$), the sum of the individual z-component quantum numbers is $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\n*   **Contradiction:** The initial state has a total z-component quantum number $m = -1$. The desired measurement outcome corresponds to a state with a total z-component quantum number of $m_{total} = -2$.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The probability of measuring an outcome is given by the square of the amplitude of the projection of the initial state onto the final state. Because the initial state is an eigenstate of the total z-component operator $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ with eigenvalue $-1\\hbar$, and the measured state is an eigenstate of the same operator with a different eigenvalue ($-2\\hbar$), the states are orthogonal. Their inner product is zero. Therefore, the probability of this measurement is zero.\n\nThe reasoning holds. The answer must be D.\nFinal Answer Check:\nInitial state: $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$. This state is an eigenstate of $L_z = L_{1z}+L_{2z}$ with eigenvalue $-\\hbar$.\nMeasurement is made of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$.\nWe want the probability of getting eigenvalues $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ and $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$. This corresponds to the final uncoupled state $|m_1=-1, m_2=-1\\rangle$.\nFor this final state, the value of the total z-component of angular momentum is $m_{1} + m_{2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$. The eigenvalue of $L_z$ for this state is $-2\\hbar$.\nSince the initial state and the final state are eigenstates of the same operator ($L_z$) but with different eigenvalues ($-\\hbar$ and $-2\\hbar$), they are orthogonal.\nThe probability is the squared magnitude of the inner product of the initial and final states: $P = |\\langle m_1=-1, m_2=-1 | l=2, m=-1\\rangle|^2$.\nBecause the states are orthogonal, this inner product is zero.\nSo, the probability is 0.\nThe answer is D.\n\nFinal verification:\nThe expansion of $|l=2, m=-1\\rangle$ in terms of $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$ is:\n$|2, -1\\rangle = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} \\langle 1, m_1; 1, m_2 | 2, -1 \\rangle |m_1, m_2\\rangle$.\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficients $\\langle 1, m_1; 1, m_2 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ are non-zero only if $m_1+m_2 = -1$.\nThe state we are interested in is $|-1, -1\\rangle$. For this state, $m_1+m_2 = -2$.\nTherefore, the coefficient $\\langle 1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1 \\rangle$ is zero.\nThe probability is the square of this coefficient, which is 0.\nThe logic is sound.In quantum mechanics, when adding two angular momenta, the z-component of the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual z-components. This is a fundamental principle known as a selection rule.\n\nThe state of the two-electron system is given in the coupled basis as $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1, 2, -1>$.\nHere:\n*   $l_1 = 1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron.\n*   $l_2 = 1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron.\n*   $l = 2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n*   $m = -1$ is the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum.\n\nThe total z-component of the orbital angular momentum, $L_z$, is the sum of the individual components for each electron, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. The corresponding quantum numbers are related by the rule:\n$m = m_{l1} + m_{l2}$\n\nThe initial state of the system is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operator $L_z$ with a total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$.\n\nA measurement is made of the individual orbital angular momentum components, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. We want to find the probability of obtaining the following eigenvalues simultaneously:\n*   Eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l1} = -1$.\n*   Eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $-\\hbar$, which corresponds to the magnetic quantum number $m_{l2} = -1$.\n\nFor this specific measurement outcome, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers would be:\n$m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\nThis result, $m_{total} = -2$, contradicts the fact that the system was initially in a state with a total magnetic quantum number of $m = -1$. Because the quantum number for the z-component of the total angular momentum must be conserved, it is impossible to measure a combination of individual components that does not sum to the initial total.\n\nTherefore, the probability of finding the system in a state where $m_{l1} = -1$ and $m_{l2} = -1$ is zero.\n\n<<<D>>>"
