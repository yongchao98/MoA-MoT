    "Here is a breakdown of the three Michael addition reactions:\n\n### Reaction A: Dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) → (A)\n\n1.  **Reactants**: The Michael donor is the enolate of dimethyl malonate, formed when the base sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) removes an acidic α-hydrogen. The Michael acceptor is the α,β-unsaturated ester, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.\n2.  **Reaction**: The nucleophilic enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the β-carbon of the acrylate. Subsequent protonation of the resulting enolate intermediate yields the final product.\n3.  **Product (A)**: The addition results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond between the α-carbon of the malonate and the β-carbon of the acrylate. The resulting structure is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) → (B)\n\n1.  **Reactants**: This is a Stork enamine synthesis, a variant of the Michael reaction. The Michael donor is the enamine, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine, which is formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are nucleophilic at the α-carbon. The Michael acceptor is the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, (E)-but-2-enenitrile.\n2.  **Reaction**: The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the butenenitrile. The resulting iminium ion intermediate is then hydrolyzed with aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) to convert the enamine back into a ketone.\n3.  **Product (B)**: The final product is a 1,5-dicarbonyl compound (or in this case, a keto-nitrile). The keto form is generally more stable and thus the major product under these conditions. The product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) → 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Reactants**: In this problem, we must identify the starting Michael donor (C). We are given the Michael acceptor, but-3-en-2-one (also known as methyl vinyl ketone, MVK), and the final product, 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n2.  **Reaction**: This is a classic Michael addition that forms the precursor for a Robinson annulation. The product is formed by adding a nucleophile to the β-carbon of MVK. The \"3-oxobutyl\" group in the product comes directly from MVK.\n3.  **Reactant (C)**: By working backward from the product, we can see that the 3-oxobutyl group has been added to the C2 position of a cyclohexane-1,3-dione ring. The C2 position of this dione is highly acidic due to the two adjacent carbonyl groups, making it readily deprotonated by a base like potassium hydroxide (KOH) to form a nucleophilic enolate. Therefore, reactant C is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct combination of products and reactants is:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
