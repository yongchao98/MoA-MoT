    "The initial analysis strongly suggests that element Y is Plutonium (Pu). The calculated atomic weight based on the mass fraction of fluorine in A2 (ɷF=31,96%) points towards Pu when the number of fluorine atoms is 6. The mass fraction of fluorine in PuF6 is approximately 31.84%, which is very close to the given value. Plutonium is also known to form multiple binary fluorides and its compounds are strong oxidizing agents.\n\nHere is a step-by-step deduction based on the provided clues and search results:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and A2**:\n    *   A2 is a binary fluoride of Y (YF_n) with a fluorine mass percentage (ɷF) of 31.96%.\n    *   The atomic weight of Y can be expressed as Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n.\n    *   For n=6, Ar(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol. This is very close to the atomic weight of Plutonium (Pu, Ar ≈ 244 g/mol).\n    *   Let's verify with Y = Pu and n = 6. A2 would be PuF6. The molar mass of PuF6 is 244 + 6 * 19 = 358 g/mol. The mass fraction of fluorine is (6 * 19) / 358 ≈ 31.84%. This is a strong match.\n    *   Therefore, **Y is Plutonium (Pu)** and **A2 is Plutonium hexafluoride (PuF6)**.\n\n2.  **Identify the five binary compounds**:\n    *   Plutonium is known to form several binary fluorides: PuF3, PuF4, PuF5, and PuF6.\n    *   A fifth compound, PuF8, has been studied theoretically and is predicted to be unstable, decomposing to PuF6 and F2.\n    *   The five known binary compounds are likely **PuF3, PuF4, PuF5, PuF6, and the theoretically known PuF8**.\n\n3.  **Identify A1**:\n    *   A1 is a bright-red substance. PuF6 is a reddish-brown solid.\n    *   A1 decomposes at 293 K (20°C) into A2 (PuF6) and fluorine (F2). The reaction is A1 → PuF6 + F2.\n    *   This decomposition reaction points to A1 being **Plutonium octafluoride (PuF8)**. Theoretical calculations show that PuF8 is expected to decompose into PuF6 and F2.\n    *   A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. PuF6 is already an extremely strong oxidizing agent capable of this. PuF8 would be an even stronger oxidizing agent, consistent with this property.\n\n4.  **Identify A3**:\n    *   A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y (Pu) with fluorine.\n    *   The direct fluorination of plutonium can yield PuF4 or PuF6 depending on the conditions.\n    *   A3 can also interact with xenon, implying it is a strong oxidizing agent. Both PuF4 (under harsh conditions) and PuF6 can react with or be catalysts for reactions involving xenon compounds. Given the context of powerful fluorinating agents, **A3 is most likely PuF6**, formed by the aggressive fluorination of plutonium metal.\n\n5.  **Identify A4 and A5**:\n    *   A5 is obtained by adding Y (Pu metal) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4.\n    *   In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.\n    *   Let's examine plutonium oxyfluorides, which can be formed from reactions involving plutonium fluorides and an oxygen source (like water in a \"solution\").\n    *   A key reaction is the hydrolysis of plutonium hexafluoride (PuF6) in water, which produces plutonyl fluoride (PuO2F2) and hydrogen fluoride (HF). The reaction is: PuF6 + 2H2O → PuO2F2 + 4HF.\n    *   Let's hypothesize that **A4 is Plutonyl fluoride (PuO2F2)**.\n    *   The problem states A4 is in a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\". PuO2F2 can be handled in solution.\n    *   The reaction to form A5 is: Y + A4 → A5 (in a 1:1 molar ratio).\n        Pu + PuO2F2 → A5\n    *   This suggests a comproportionation reaction. Plutonium is in the 0 oxidation state, and in PuO2F2, it is in the +6 oxidation state. A reaction between them could yield an intermediate oxidation state.\n    *   Pu(0) + Pu(VI)O2F2 → 2 Pu(III)OF?\n    *   A known, stable plutonium oxyfluoride is **PuOF** (plutonium(III) oxyfluoride). So, the reaction could be: Pu + PuO2F2 → 2PuOF. This fits the 1:1 molar ratio of the reactants Pu and PuO2F2 to form the product A5 (PuOF).\n    *   Therefore, **A5 is Plutonium(III) oxyfluoride (PuOF)**.\n    *   The final clue is that A5 (PuOF) decomposes in water into two substances. PuOF does not dissolve in water but would likely react/decompose under certain conditions, potentially forming Pu(OH)3 and HF, or other plutonium oxide/hydroxide species and fluoride ions.\n\n6.  **Determine the molecular weight of A4**:\n    *   Based on the deductions above, **A4 is Plutonyl fluoride (PuO2F2)**.\n    *   We need to calculate its molecular weight.\n    *   Atomic weight of Plutonium (Pu) ≈ 244 g/mol\n    *   Atomic weight of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16 g/mol\n    *   Atomic weight of Fluorine (F) ≈ 19 g/mol\n    *   Molecular weight of PuO2F2 = 244 + (2 * 16) + (2 * 19) = 244 + 32 + 38 = 314 g/mol.\n\n7.  **Re-evaluating A4 and A5 with another possibility**:\n    *   Let's reconsider the reaction for A5. What if A4 is a plutonium fluoride in solution?\n    *   PuF6 (A2 or A3) reacts violently with water, so a \"solution of A4\" is less likely to be PuF6.\n    *   Could A4 be PuF4? PuF4 is a solid. Let's assume a solution of a complex fluoride.\n    *   Let's stick with the most plausible identification from the reaction stoichiometry.\n    *   The identification of A4 as PuO2F2 seems the most chemically sound. However, the molecular weight of 314 g/mol does not fall into any of the given ranges. This indicates an error in my deduction or an issue with the problem statement/options.\n\nLet's re-read the problem carefully. \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\n\nWhat if Y is not Pu? Let's reconsider Krypton (Kr).\n*   Y = Kr, A2 = KrF2. ɷF = 31.2%, close but not as close as Pu.\n*   \"Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\" This is a major problem for Krypton. Only KrF2 is well-established.\n*   The high reactivity and colors are more consistent with a heavy element like Plutonium.\n\nLet's re-examine the compounds of Plutonium.\nPuF3, PuF4, PuF5, PuF6, PuF8.\nA1: PuF8\nA2: PuF6\nA3: PuF6\n\n\"By adding Y (Pu) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\"\nWhat if A4 is not a plutonium compound but the solvent? The wording \"solution of A4\" makes this unlikely. It implies A4 is the solute.\n\nLet's reconsider the reaction: Pu + A4 -> A5.\nIf A4 = PuF4 (M=320 g/mol), could a solution be made? PuF4 is poorly soluble.\nIf A4 = PuO2F2 (M=314 g/mol).\nIf A5 = PuOF (M=279 g/mol). Reaction: Pu + PuO2F2 -> 2PuOF. This is balanced.\n\nLet's look at the options again.\nA) 140-160\nB) 160-180\nC) 110-130\nD) 220-240\n\nNone of the plausible high-oxidation state plutonium fluorides (PuF4, PuF5, PuF6) or oxyfluorides (PuO2F2) have molecular weights in these ranges.\nPuF3: 301 g/mol\nPuF4: 320 g/mol\nPuF5: 339 g/mol\nPuF6: 358 g/mol\nPuO2F2: 314 g/mol\n\nThere must be a different interpretation. Let's reconsider Y. What if the mass percentage is for a different formula?\n\nAr(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\nIf n=3, Ar(Y) ≈ 121.35. This is close to Antimony (Sb, 121.76).\nLet's test Y = Sb.\n*   A2 = SbF3. M(SbF3) = 121.76 + 3*19 = 178.76 g/mol.\n    ɷF(SbF3) = (3*19)/178.76 = 57 / 178.76 = 31.88%. This is an excellent match.\n*   So, **Y = Antimony (Sb)** and **A2 = SbF3**.\n*   **Five binary compounds of Sb and F?** Only SbF3 and SbF5 are common. This premise is weak for Sb as well. However, in the context of a puzzle, perhaps it refers to less stable or complex species.\n*   **A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (SbF3) and fluorine.** A1 -> SbF3 + F2. This implies A1 is SbF5. Reaction: SbF5 -> SbF3 + F2. This decomposition is known to occur at higher temperatures, but maybe at 293K under specific conditions.\n*   **A1 (SbF5) is bright-red.** SbF5 is a colorless, viscous liquid/solid. This contradicts the \"bright-red\" description.\n*   **A1 (SbF5) oxidizes xenon.** SbF5 is a very powerful Lewis acid and oxidizing agent, it reacts with XeF2 to form salts. Plausible.\n*   **A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y (Sb) with fluorine.** Sb + F2 -> SbF5. So **A3 = SbF5**.\n*   **A3 (SbF5) can also interact with xenon.** Yes, this is correct.\n*   **A5 is obtained by adding Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4.**\n    Sb + A4 -> A5.\n*   **In water, A5 decomposes with the formation of two substances.**\n\nNow we need to identify A4 and A5 in the antimony system. The reaction is Sb(0) + A4 -> A5. This is a comproportionation. A4 must be a compound with Sb in a positive oxidation state. The most likely candidate for A4 is SbF5, and for A5 is SbF3.\nReaction: 2Sb + 3SbF5 -> 5SbF3. The molar ratio is not 1:1.\n\nLet's reconsider the plutonium hypothesis, as the chemistry seems more consistent despite the molecular weight mismatch. Is there any other compound that could be A4?\n\nPerhaps A4 is not a plutonium compound. The problem states a \"solution of A4\". What if A4 is an acid?\n\"adding Y (Pu) ... to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\"\nMaybe A4 is an acid like HClO4 or H2SO4. This seems unlikely as it deviates from the \"binary compounds of fluorine with element Y\" theme.\n\nLet's assume there is an error in my chain of logic for Pu and re-examine the molecular weights of *all* possible compounds.\nPuF3 = 301.06\nPuF4 = 320.06\nPuF5 = 339.05\nPuF6 = 358.05\nPuOF = 279.06\nPuO2F2 = 314.05\nPuF8 = 396.04\n\nNone of these fit. Let's reconsider Y = Kr.\nKrF2 = 121.8. This fits in range C (110-130). Could A4 be KrF2?\nA2 was KrF2. A3 could be KrF2. Let's test if A4 is KrF2.\n*   Y = Krypton (Kr)\n*   A2 = KrF2 (ɷF ≈ 31.2%, close to 31.96%).\n*   A1 = KrF4 (decomposes to KrF2 + F2).\n*   A3 = KrF2 (from Kr + F2).\n*   A4 = KrF2.\n*   Reaction to get A5: Y(Kr) + A4(KrF2) -> A5. (1:1 molar ratio). Kr + KrF2 -> A5. This reaction doesn't seem to lead to a known stable product.\n*   Also, the \"five binary compounds\" issue persists.\n\nThere seems to be a significant inconsistency in the problem statement, the options, and known chemistry. However, let's revisit the first deduction, which had the best fit for the mass percentage.\nY = Pu, A2 = PuF6.\nLet's assume my identification of A4 is wrong and that A4's molecular weight *must* fall into one of the ranges. Let's look for any other plausible compound.\n\nWhat if \"binary compounds\" includes oxyfluorides? This is a stretch of the definition, but possible in a puzzle context.\nThe five compounds could be: PuF4, PuF6, PuOF, PuO2F2, and another one.\n\nLet's work backward from the answers.\nA) 140-160: ?\nB) 160-180: ? Could match SbF3 (178.76). But the red color of A1 (SbF5) is wrong.\nC) 110-130: ? Could match KrF2 (121.8). But \"five compounds\" is wrong.\nD) 220-240: ?\n\nLet's try one more element. Y=Ruthenium (Ru). Ar(Ru) = 101.07.\nAr(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n101.07 ≈ 40.45 * n => n ≈ 2.5. Doesn't fit well.\n\nLet's go back to Y=Pu and assume A4 is an unusual species or there's a typo in the problem.\nIf A4 had to be in one of those ranges, which part of my deduction is most likely wrong? The identification of A4=PuO2F2 is based on interpreting the formation of A5.\nPu + A4 -> A5 (1:1).\nLet's rethink. If A4 is PuF4 (MW=320), the reaction could be: Pu + 3PuF4 -> 4PuF3. Ratio is 1:3, not 1:1.\nIf A4 is PuF6 (MW=358), the reaction could be: 2Pu + PuF6 -> 3PuF2 (hypothetical) or other mixtures. 2Pu + PuF6 -> 3PuF4 is not balanced. Pu + 2PuF6 -> 3PuF4. Not 1:1.\n\nThe reaction `Pu + PuO2F2 → 2PuOF` is stoichiometrically sound (1:1) and involves known (though perhaps uncommon) species. The MW of PuO2F2 is 314. This is outside all ranges.\n\nLet's reconsider the question's source. It might be from a specific curriculum or competition where certain non-standard facts are assumed. Is there any other interpretation of \"five binary compounds\"? Maybe it includes anions like PuF7^- or PuF8^2-? But these are not binary compounds *of fluorine with element Y*.\n\nGiven the contradictions, let's review the most solid piece of evidence: Ar(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n leading to Y=Pu and A2=PuF6. The chemical properties align well with Plutonium.\n- Five fluorides (PuF3, PuF4, PuF5, PuF6, PuF8).\n- A1(PuF8) -> A2(PuF6) + F2.\n- Strong oxidizer, reacts with Xenon (PuF6, PuF8).\n- A3 (PuF6) from fluorination of Pu.\n- A5 from Pu + A4.\n\nThe problem seems to hinge on identifying A4. All evidence points to A4 being PuO2F2, but its molecular weight (314) doesn't fit the options. Let's re-read again. \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". Plutonyl fluoride (PuO2F2) is a solid. It can be formed from hydrolysis of PuF6. Perhaps it forms a complex in solution.\n\nLet's assume there is an error in the question and my identification of A4=PuO2F2 is correct, and the question is flawed. But I must choose an answer.\nIs there any other possibility for Y?\nY = Technetium (Tc), Ar = 98. 98 ≈ 40.45 * n => n ≈ 2.42. No.\nY = Neptunium (Np), Ar = 237. 237 ≈ 40.45 * n => n ≈ 5.86. This is also very close to n=6. Let's test Y = Np.\n*   A2 = NpF6. M(NpF6) = 237 + 6*19 = 351 g/mol.\n    ɷF(NpF6) = (6*19)/351 = 114/351 ≈ 32.48%. This is also close to 31.96%.\n*   Neptunium chemistry is similar to Plutonium. It forms NpF3, NpF4, NpF5, NpF6.\n*   Let's check A4, which would be NpO2F2. M(NpO2F2) = 237 + 32 + 38 = 307 g/mol. Still not in the ranges.\n\nLet's reconsider Sb. Y=Sb, A2=SbF3. MW=178.76. ɷF=31.88%. This is a very good fit.\nA1 is bright-red. SbF5 is colorless. This is the main contradiction. If we ignore the color, does the rest fit?\n- A1(SbF5) -> A2(SbF3) + F2. (Decomposition).\n- A1(SbF5) oxidizes Xe. Plausible.\n- A3 is SbF5 (from Sb + F2).\n- A3(SbF5) interacts with Xe. Plausible.\n- Reaction: Sb + A4 -> A5 (1:1).\n- What could A4 and A5 be? Maybe A4 is an antimony oxyfluoride. Or maybe the reaction is different. What about addition? Sb + SbF3 -> Sb2F3? Not a simple compound.\n- SbF5 is A3. Could A4 also be SbF5? Reaction: Sb + SbF5 -> ? Does not seem to be a simple 1:1 reaction.\n\nIf we assume Y=Sb, then A2=SbF3 has a molecular weight of ~179. This is in range B. If we assume A4 is A2, this could be the answer. But there is no reason to assume A4 is A2. The color mismatch for A1 is also a strong counterargument.\n\nLet's go back to Pu. It seems the most likely candidate for Y, and the chemistry fits well, except for the final step matching the options. There must be a mistake in the problem's data or options. Let me assume my identification of A4 is wrong, and one of the other Pu-F compounds is A4, and that the description of its formation is misleading. This is a weak path.\n\nLet's try a different approach. What if A5 is PuF4? Then 3Pu + Pu(X) -> 4PuF4. What if A5 is PuF3? Pu + 3A4 -> 4PuF3. If A4 is PuF4, then Pu + 3PuF4 -> 4PuF3. Ratio 1:3.\n\nThis problem is very difficult due to the inconsistencies. Let me reconsider the calculation for Y.\nAr(Y) = 40.449 * n.\nn=1, Ar=40.4 (Ca)\nn=2, Ar=80.9 (Br) -> BrF. ɷF = 19 / (79.9+19) = 19.2%. No. A2=BrF3. ɷF = 57 / (79.9+57) = 41.6%. No. A2=BrF5. ɷF = 95 / (79.9+95) = 47.9%. No.\nn=3, Ar=121.3 (Sb) -> SbF3. ɷF = 31.88%. Match.\nn=4, Ar=161.8 (Dy) -> DyF3. ɷF= 57 / (162.5+57) = 26%. No.\nn=5, Ar=202.2 (Hg, Tl) -> TlF3. ɷF=57 / (204.4+57) = 21.8%. No.\nn=6, Ar=242.7 (Pu) -> PuF6. ɷF = 31.84%. Match.\n\nSo it's either Sb or Pu.\nIf Y=Sb:\nA1=SbF5 (not red)\nA2=SbF3 (MW=178.8)\nA3=SbF5\nA4=? A5=?\nIf A4 were, for example, SbF3, its MW is 178.8, which is in range **B**.\n\nIf Y=Pu:\nA1=PuF8 (hypothetical, but fits decomposition)\nA2=PuF6 (MW=358.0)\nA3=PuF6\nA4=PuO2F2 (MW=314, based on reaction)\nA5=PuOF\nThis seems more chemically sound, but MW of A4 does not fit any option.\n\nLet's reconsider the Sb case. What if \"bright-red\" is a mistake in the problem? Then Y=Sb is a strong possibility. If we assume Y=Sb, then what is A4? \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\". SbF5 can be a colorless liquid. Reaction: Sb + SbF5 (1:1). A known reaction is 2Sb + 3SbF5 -> 5SbF3. Maybe there's another reaction, or the stoichiometry is a red herring. What if A5 is a complex salt? If we have a solvent `solv`, maybe Sb + SbF5 + solv -> [Sb(solv)][SbF5] or something similar? This is too speculative.\nThe simplest assumption if Y=Sb is that A4 is one of the known fluorides, SbF3 or SbF5.\nMW(SbF3) = 178.8 -> Range B\nMW(SbF5) = 216.8 -> outside all ranges.\nSo, if Y=Sb, the only option that could fit is if A4 is SbF3. Let's see if the reaction Sb + SbF3 -> A5 makes sense. This would be a reduction of Sb(III), which is not typical.\n\nLet's go back to Pu. What if the \"five binary compounds\" include oxides? PuO, PuO2, Pu2O3, PuF4, PuF6? This violates \"binary compounds of fluorine\".\n\nWhat if the element is **Osmium (Os)**? Ar(Os) = 190.23.\n190.23 ≈ 40.45 * n => n ≈ 4.7. Maybe n=5? OsF5.\nɷF(OsF5) = (5*19)/(190.23+95) = 95/285.23 = 33.3%. Not a great fit.\nWhat about n=4? OsF4. ɷF(OsF4) = (4*19)/(190.23+76) = 76/266.23 = 28.5%. Not good.\n\nLet's trust the math. The best fits are Pu and Sb.\nPu: Fits most chemical clues, but MW of A4 doesn't match options.\nSb: Fits MW clue for A2 perfectly. One major contradiction (color of A1). The reaction for A5 is unclear. But if we assume A4 is SbF3, its MW (178.8) is in range B.\n\nThis feels like a choice between two imperfect candidates. The mass percent is a very specific number.\nɷF(SbF3) = 31.88% -> difference of |31.88 - 31.96| = 0.08\nɷF(PuF6) = 31.84% -> difference of |31.84 - 31.96| = 0.12\nThe fit for Sb is slightly better. The main obstacle is the color of SbF5. Could \"bright-red\" refer to a complex or an impure substance? It's possible. Given the options, the path with Antimony (Sb) leads to a potential answer.\nLet's assume Y = Sb.\nA2 = SbF3.\nThen A4 could also be SbF3. Molecular Weight is ~179 g/mol. This falls in the range 160-180.\n\nLet's try to rationalize this choice.\nY=Sb. A2=SbF3.\nA1 decomposes to SbF3 and F2 -> A1=SbF5. Let's ignore the color discrepancy for a moment.\nA1 oxidizes Xe -> SbF5 does.\nA3 from Sb + F2 -> A3=SbF5.\nA3 interacts with Xe -> SbF5 does.\nA5 from Sb + A4 (1:1). If A4 is SbF3, the reaction is Sb + SbF3 -> A5. This could form sub-fluorides like (SbF)n or clusters. It's plausible in molten salt chemistry.\nIf we assume A4 is SbF3, its molecular weight is 178.76 g/mol. This falls in the range of 160-180.\n\nLet's check the Plutonium path one last time. Is there any Pu compound in the ranges? No. Therefore, despite the compelling chemical arguments for Pu, it cannot lead to one of the provided answers. The Sb path, despite the color contradiction, leads to a plausible molecular weight for A4=A2=SbF3, which is 178.8 g/mol, fitting in range B. The question might be constructed such that A4 is the same as A2.\n\nFinal check of the logic:\n1. Identify Y from ɷF(A2). Both Sb and Pu are good candidates based on the math.\n2. Analyze chemical properties. Pu fits better overall, especially the \"five compounds\" and colors. Sb has a major color discrepancy for A1.\n3. Analyze the formation of A5. The reaction for Pu (Pu + PuO2F2) is plausible but gives MW(A4)=314, which is not an option. The reaction for Sb is less clear.\n4. Work backward from the options. Range B (160-180) perfectly contains MW(SbF3) = 178.8. If we assume A4=A2=SbF3, this path leads to an answer. No other plausible compound from either the Sb or Pu systems fits any of the other ranges.\n5. Conclusion: The most likely intended answer, despite the flaws in the problem description, is based on Y=Sb and A4=SbF3.\n\nMolecular weight of A4 = SbF3 = 121.76 + 3*18.998 = 178.754 g/mol.\nThis value falls in the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<B>>>"
