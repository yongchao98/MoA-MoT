    "The Mott-Gurney law is built on a set of key assumptions about the device and the charge transport mechanism. Analyzing these assumptions reveals the conditions required for the equation to be valid.\n\nThe key assumptions for the Mott-Gurney equation are:\n*   **Single-carrier device**: The model assumes that only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes) contributes to the current.\n*   **Trap-free semiconductor**: The derivation assumes the material is an insulator or semiconductor free from traps or energetic disorder that could capture charge carriers. The presence of traps alters the current-voltage relationship.\n*   **Ohmic contact (no injection barrier)**: For SCLC to occur, the injecting contact must be \"Ohmic,\" meaning it can supply an unlimited reservoir of charge carriers to be injected into the device. This corresponds to having no energy barrier for carrier injection. A Schottky contact, which is rectifying, would create an injection barrier and is not suitable.\n*   **Drift-dominated current**: The model assumes that the current is driven by the electric field (drift) and that the contribution from carrier diffusion is negligible. This is a primary assumption in the derivation.\n\nBased on these points:\n*   Statement A is incorrect because a Schottky contact creates an injection barrier, violating a key requirement.\n*   Statement C is incorrect because SCLC is a drift-dominated current; neglecting drift current is fundamentally wrong.\n*   Statement D is incorrect because the standard Mott-Gurney law applies to single-carrier devices, not two-carrier devices.\n*   Statement B correctly combines all the necessary conditions: it is a single-carrier device, it is trap-free, there is no carrier injection barrier (which implies an Ohmic contact), and the diffusion current is negligible.\n\n<<<B>>>"
