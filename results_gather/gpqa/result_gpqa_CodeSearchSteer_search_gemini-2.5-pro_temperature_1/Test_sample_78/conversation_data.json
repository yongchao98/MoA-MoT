    "### Analysis of the Product Structure\n\nFirst, we must determine the structure of the product from the provided ¹H-NMR and ¹³C-NMR data. The molecular formula of the starting material, Compound X, is C₁₁H₁₂O. The reaction described is an isomerization, so the product will have the same molecular formula.\n\n**Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\nFor C₁₁H₁₂, the DoU is (2 * 11 + 2 - 12) / 2 = 6. A benzene ring accounts for 4 degrees, and the oxygen suggests a carbonyl group (C=O), which accounts for another degree. This leaves one degree of unsaturation, indicating a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n\n**¹³C-NMR Analysis:**\n*   A signal at **δ 197.7** is characteristic of a ketone carbonyl carbon.\n*   Signals at **δ 21.3** and **δ 28.4** correspond to two different methyl (CH₃) groups.\n*   There are nine signals in total for eleven carbons, which implies some symmetry in the molecule. The signals at **δ 126.9 (2C)** and **δ 129.1 (2C)** each represent two equivalent carbons, a feature typical of a para-substituted benzene ring.\n*   The remaining signals in the range of δ 127-145 represent the vinylic carbons and the quaternary carbons of the aromatic ring.\n\n**¹H-NMR Analysis:**\n*   Two singlets at **δ 2.28 (3H)** and **δ 2.31 (3H)** confirm the presence of two methyl groups that are not coupled to any protons.\n*   Two doublets at **δ 7.08 (2H)** and **δ 7.71 (2H)** are characteristic of the four protons on a para-substituted benzene ring.\n*   Two doublets at **δ 6.75 (1H)** and **δ 7.68 (1H)** are in the vinylic region and are coupled to each other, indicating a -CH=CH- group.\n\n**Assembling the Product Structure:**\nBased on the analysis, the product is an α,β-unsaturated ketone with a para-substituted benzene ring and two methyl groups. One methyl group is part of an acetyl group (-COCH₃), and the other is a substituent on the benzene ring, making it a tolyl group. The only structure that fits all the data is **4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one**. The observed NMR data is consistent with literature values for this compound.\n\n### Analysis of the Reaction and Identification of Compound X\n\nThe reaction involves heating Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O) with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), a non-nucleophilic base, in a nonpolar solvent. This suggests a base-catalyzed isomerization reaction. The starting materials provided are all vinyl epoxides (oxiranes). The base-catalyzed rearrangement of a vinyl epoxide can lead to the formation of an α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n\nThe mechanism typically involves the abstraction of a proton from the epoxide ring at the carbon that is not attached to the vinyl group. This is followed by the cleavage of the C-O bond and tautomerization of the resulting enol to the more stable ketone.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n*   **A) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane:** This compound has a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. Rearrangement would lead to 3-methyl-4-phenyl-but-3-en-2-one, which does not match the product's NMR data.\n*   **B) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane:** This compound has the correct molecular formula (C₁₁H₁₂O) and contains a p-tolyl group attached to a vinyl group, which is then connected to an epoxide ring. The rearrangement of this compound via the mechanism described above would yield 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one, which is the observed product.\n*   **C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane:** This compound has a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group. Its rearrangement would produce 1-phenylpent-1-en-3-one, which is inconsistent with the NMR data (it would show signals for an ethyl group, not two methyl singlets).\n*   **D) 2-styrylepoxide:** The molecular formula for this compound is C₁₀H₁₀O, which does not match the given formula for Compound X.\n\nTherefore, the only starting material that possesses the correct molecular formula and the necessary structural framework (a p-tolyl group) to form the identified product under the given reaction conditions is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<B>>>"
