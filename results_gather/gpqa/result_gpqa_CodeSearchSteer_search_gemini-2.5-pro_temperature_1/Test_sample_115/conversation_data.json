    "Here is a step-by-step identification of compound D:\n\n1.  **Identify Compound A**: The proton NMR data shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) and a quartet at 1.3 ppm (4H). This pattern is characteristic of two equivalent ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). The chemical shifts are in the alkane region. While the signal for the CH₂ groups in n-butane (CH₃CH₂CH₂CH₃) is technically a multiplet, it can be approximated as a quartet in some contexts. The subsequent reactions strongly support n-butane as compound A.\n\n2.  **Identify Compound B**: Compound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination. The bromination of an alkane proceeds via a radical mechanism. The stability of the radical intermediate is tertiary > secondary > primary. Therefore, the major product will be 2-bromobutane, where the bromine is attached to a secondary carbon.\n\n3.  **Identify Compound C**: Compound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH). This is a classic elimination reaction (dehydrohalogenation). Following Zaitsev's rule, the more substituted alkene is the major product. Elimination of HBr from 2-bromobutane yields but-2-ene (CH₃CH=CHCH₃). But-2-ene exists as two geometrical isomers: *cis*-but-2-ene and *trans*-but-2-ene. This matches the description of compound C.\n\n4.  **Identify Compound D**: The problem states that the *cis*-isomer of C (*cis*-but-2-ene) reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol. This is a Diels-Alder reaction, a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Diene**: (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol (HO-CH=CH-CH=CH-CH₃)\n    *   **Dienophile**: *cis*-but-2-ene (CH₃-CH=CH-CH₃)\n\n    The product is a substituted cyclohex-2-enol. The substituents will be an -OH group at position 1, and methyl groups at positions 4, 5, and 6, forming 4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol.\n\n5.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of Compound D**: The Diels-Alder reaction is stereospecific, meaning the stereochemistry of the reactants is preserved in the product.\n    *   **From the Dienophile**: Since the dienophile is *cis*-but-2-ene, the two methyl groups (which end up at positions C5 and C6) must be *cis* to each other in the final product.\n    *   **From the Diene**: The diene is (1E,3E). In the required *s-cis* conformation for the reaction, the substituents at the ends of the diene (the -OH at C1 and the -CH₃ at C4) are positioned on opposite sides. This *trans* relationship is maintained in the product. Therefore, the C1-OH group and the C4-CH₃ group are *trans* to each other.\n    *   **The Endo Rule**: The Diels-Alder reaction generally favors the *endo* product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions. This rule predicts that the substituents on the dienophile (the C5 and C6 methyl groups) will be oriented *cis* to the substituent on the inner carbon of the diene (the C4-methyl group).\n\n    We must find the stereoisomer that satisfies these conditions:\n    1.  C5-Methyl and C6-Methyl are *cis*.\n    2.  C1-OH and C4-Methyl are *trans*.\n    3.  C4-Methyl, C5-Methyl, and C6-Methyl are all *cis* to each other (from the endo rule).\n\n    Let's analyze the given options:\n    *   A) (1S,4R,5S,6S)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol: The (5S, 6S) configuration for adjacent stereocenters indicates a *trans* relationship between the C5 and C6 methyl groups. This contradicts the stereochemistry of the starting dienophile.\n    *   B) (1S,4R)-4,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol: This has the incorrect substitution pattern.\n    *   C) (1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol:\n        *   The (5S, 6R) configuration for the adjacent C5 and C6 methyl groups indicates they are *cis*, which is correct.\n        *   The (4R, 5S) configuration indicates that the C4-methyl and C5-methyl groups are also *cis*. This is consistent with the endo rule.\n        *   Since C4-Me is cis to C5-Me, and C5-Me is cis to C6-Me, all three methyl groups are on the same side of the ring.\n        *   To check the C1-OH and C4-Me relationship, we can assign a conformation. If the three methyl groups are \"down\", the C1-OH group must be \"up\" for the overall molecule to be (1S,4R,5S,6R). An \"up\" OH and a \"down\" C4-Me are *trans*. This matches our requirement.\n    *   D) (1S,4S)-4,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol: This has the incorrect substitution pattern.\n\nCompound (1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol is the only option that correctly represents the stereochemical outcome of the reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
