    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms changes.\n\n### 1. Understand the Core Principle: The Boltzmann Equation\nThe distribution of atoms among different energy levels in a gas that is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) is described by the Boltzmann equation. For two energy levels, 1 and 2, the ratio of the number of atoms (N) in each level is given by:\n\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T))\n\nWhere:\n*   N₂ and N₁ are the number of atoms in the higher (2) and lower (1) energy levels, respectively.\n*   g₂ and g₁ are the statistical weights of the levels. This term can be considered constant for this problem.\n*   E₂ - E₁ (or ΔE) is the energy difference between the two levels.\n*   k is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K).\n*   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Energy Difference (ΔE)\nThe energy difference between the two levels corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given wavelength (λ). The formula to find the energy of a photon is:\n\nΔE = h * c / λ\n\nWhere:\n*   h is the Planck constant.\n*   c is the speed of light.\n*   λ is the wavelength of the transition (1448 Å).\n\nA convenient formula for astrophysical calculations relates energy in electron-volts (eV) to wavelength in angstroms (Å):\n\nΔE (eV) ≈ 12398 / λ (Å)\n\nPlugging in the given wavelength:\n\nΔE ≈ 12398 / 1448 Å ≈ 8.56 eV\n\n### 3. Set Up the Ratios for Both Scenarios\nLet's define the ratio of the atomic populations for the two temperature conditions:\n\n*   **R_nospots**: The ratio when the star has no spots and a temperature (T_nospots) of 6000 K.\n*   **R_spots**: The ratio when the star has spots and a temperature (T_spots) of 5500 K.\n\nUsing the Boltzmann equation:\n\nR_nospots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots))\nR_spots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots))\n\n### 4. Calculate the Factor of Change\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. This is the ratio of the two ratios: `Factor = R_nospots / R_spots`.\n\nFactor = [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) ] / [ (g₂ / g₁) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]\n\nThe term for the statistical weights (g₂ / g₁) cancels out. Using the properties of exponents, the expression simplifies to:\n\nFactor = exp [ (-ΔE / k) * ( (1 / T_nospots) - (1 / T_spots) ) ]\n\n### 5. Plug in the Values and Solve\nNow, we can substitute the known values into the equation:\n\n*   ΔE ≈ 8.56 eV\n*   k ≈ 8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K\n*   T_nospots = 6000 K\n*   T_spots = 5500 K\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of the ΔE / k term:\n\nΔE / k ≈ 8.56 eV / (8.617 x 10⁻⁵ eV/K) ≈ 99338 K\n\nNow substitute this into the factor equation:\n\nFactor = exp [ -99338 K * ( (1 / 6000 K) - (1 / 5500 K) ) ]\nFactor = exp [ -99338 * (0.00016667 - 0.00018182) ]\nFactor = exp [ -99338 * (-0.00001515) ]\nFactor = exp(1.505)\n\nCalculating the final value:\n\nFactor ≈ 4.50\n\nThe calculation shows that the ratio of atoms in the two energy levels is approximately 4.5 times higher when the star has no spots compared to when it is covered in spots. This aligns with the observation that the ratio decreases when spots are present. The extra information about the star's radius, mass, and the percentage of spot coverage is not needed for this specific calculation, as the effective temperatures were provided.\n\n<<<D>>>"
