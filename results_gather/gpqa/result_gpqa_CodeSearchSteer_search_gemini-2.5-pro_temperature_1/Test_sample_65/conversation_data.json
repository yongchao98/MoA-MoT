    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model Lagrangian. These operators are built from the Standard Model fields and must respect certain fundamental symmetries.\n\n*   **Lorentz and Poincaré Symmetry:** SMEFT is a quantum field theory designed to be consistent with special relativity. Therefore, its Lagrangian, including all higher-dimensional operators, must be invariant under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) and, more generally, Poincaré transformations (which also include spacetime translations). Several sources confirm that SMEFT operators are constructed to obey Poincaré symmetry.\n\n*   **CPT Symmetry:** CPT (Charge, Parity, Time) symmetry is a fundamental tenet of local, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theories. As SMEFT falls into this category, it is constructed to be CPT-invariant. The violation of CPT would imply a violation of Lorentz invariance.\n\n*   **CP Symmetry:** Unlike the other symmetries, CP (Charge, Parity) symmetry is known to be violated in the Standard Model itself. SMEFT, as an extension, not only accommodates this violation but also introduces new potential sources of CP violation through higher-dimensional operators. There are numerous studies dedicated to classifying and constraining these CP-violating operators within the SMEFT framework. Therefore, SMEFT operators are not required to respect CP symmetry.\n\nBased on this, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<A>>>"
