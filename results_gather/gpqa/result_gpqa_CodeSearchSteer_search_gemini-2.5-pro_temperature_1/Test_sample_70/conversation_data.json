    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can use the principles of planetary equilibrium temperature and orbital mechanics.\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature\nA planet's equilibrium temperature (T_eq) is the theoretical temperature it would have if it were a perfect blackbody, heated only by its parent star. The formula shows that the equilibrium temperature is dependent on the star's properties and the planet's distance from the star. For a planet in a circular orbit, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital radius (a), also known as the semi-major axis.\n\nThe relationship can be expressed as:\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √a\n\nGiven that the planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo (the fraction of light reflected), these factors cancel out when comparing the two planets.\n\n### 2. Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion\nKepler's Third Law states that the square of a planet's orbital period (P) is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (a). For planets orbiting the same star, this can be written as:\nP² ∝ a³\n\nFrom this relationship, we can deduce that the semi-major axis is proportional to the orbital period to the power of 2/3:\na ∝ P^(2/3)\n\n### 3. Combining the Relationships\nBy substituting the relationship from Kepler's Third Law into the equilibrium temperature formula, we can establish a direct relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital period:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1 / √(P^(2/3))\nT_eq ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)\n\nThis shows that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Temperature Ratio\nWe can now calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet_4 and Planet_2:\n\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = [P_4^(-1/3)] / [P_2^(-1/3)] = (P_2 / P_4)^(1/3)\n\nFrom the problem statement, the ratio of orbital periods is given as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planet_1 through Planet_5, respectively. Therefore, the ratio of the periods for Planet_2 to Planet_4 is:\n\nP_2 / P_4 = 2 / 3.5\n\nNow, we substitute this value into our temperature ratio equation:\n\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)\nT_eq(Planet_4) / T_eq(Planet_2) ≈ 0.8298\n\nThis value is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<D>>>"
