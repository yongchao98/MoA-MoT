    "This problem requires the application of Einstein's velocity-addition formula. Here is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Identify the frames of reference.**\n    *   The laboratory frame, where the observer is at rest. Let's call this frame S.\n    *   The rest frame of the moving glass. Let's call this frame S'.\n\n2.  **Define the velocities.**\n    *   The velocity of the glass (frame S') relative to the laboratory (frame S) is *v*.\n    *   The speed of light within the glass, as measured in its own rest frame (S'), is *u'*. According to the definition of the index of refraction (*n*), this speed is *u' = c/n*.\n    *   The problem states to take the speed of light in a vacuum, *c*, as 1. Therefore, the speed of light in the glass, relative to the glass, is *u' = 1/n*.\n\n3.  **Apply the relativistic velocity-addition formula.**\n    The formula for adding velocities that are in the same direction is:\n    *u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v / c²)*\n    Here, *u* is the speed of light in the glass as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame (S).\n\n4.  **Substitute the known values into the formula.**\n    *   *u'* = 1/n\n    *   *v* = v\n    *   *c* = 1\n\n    This gives:\n    *u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v / 1²)*\n    *u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)*\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression.**\n    To clear the fractions in the numerator and the denominator, multiply both by *n*:\n    *u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)*\n    *u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)*\n\nThis result corresponds to the formula derived by Max von Laue in 1907, which provided a theoretical explanation for the results of the Fizeau experiment using special relativity. The Fizeau experiment, conducted in 1851, was a key piece of evidence that shaped Einstein's thinking on the matter. The relativistic velocity-addition formula is a cornerstone of special relativity, ensuring that the speed of an object as measured by different observers is consistent with the postulate that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all observers.\n\nComparing the derived result with the given options:\nA) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\nB) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\nC) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\nD) 1\n\nThe calculated speed matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
