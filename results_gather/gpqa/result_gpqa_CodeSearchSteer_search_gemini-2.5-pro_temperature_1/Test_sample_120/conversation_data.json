    "The reaction of saturated epoxides with organocuprates, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), is a well-established method in organic synthesis. The reaction proceeds via an S_N2 mechanism, which dictates both the regioselectivity and the stereoselectivity of the product.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n1.  **Reactants**:\n    *   **Epoxide**: (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. The core structure is a cyclohexane ring fused to an epoxide ring.\n    *   **Nucleophile**: Lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), which acts as a source of a soft methyl nucleophile (Me‚Åª).\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity**: The problem states that the alkyl group of the cuprate is introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. This is a general rule for the S_N2-type opening of epoxides by basic or neutral nucleophiles.\n    *   The epoxide ring is formed between carbons C1 and C6 of the bicyclic system.\n    *   Carbon C1 has a methyl group attached, making it a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n    *   Carbon C6 does not have a methyl group, making it a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophilic attack will occur at C6, the sterically less hindered position.\n\n3.  **Product Structure Determination**:\n    *   The attack of the methyl group at C6 breaks the C6-O bond.\n    *   After an aqueous workup, the oxygen atom (attached to C1) is protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The resulting product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups. Let's determine their positions based on IUPAC nomenclature for the final product:\n        *   The carbon bearing the -OH group is designated C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the reactant. This carbon also has its original methyl group.\n        *   Numbering the ring to give the other substituents the lowest possible locants, the adjacent carbon (the original C6) where the new methyl group attached becomes C2.\n        *   The original methyl groups at C3 and C4 of the reactant are now at positions C5 and C4, respectively, in the product.\n        *   Thus, the product is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. This allows us to eliminate options B and C.\n\n4.  **Stereoselectivity**: The problem states that inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile is added. This is a hallmark of the S_N2 reaction, where the nucleophile performs a backside attack relative to the leaving group.\n    *   The nucleophilic attack occurs at C6, which has an initial configuration of (S) as given in the reactant's name.\n    *   The inversion of configuration means the stereocenter at this carbon will become (R) in the product.\n    *   In the product's IUPAC name, this carbon is C2. Therefore, the product must have a (2R) configuration.\n    *   The stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C3 and C4 in the reactant) are expected to retain their configuration. In the product, these correspond to C5 and C4. The reactant had (3R) and (4R), which correspond to (5R) and (4R) in the product.\n    *   The configuration at C1 is given as (1R) in the reactant. This center is not attacked, and its configuration is generally retained.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the product must be a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol with a (2R), (4R), and (5R) configuration. Comparing the remaining options:\n    *   A) (1R,**2S**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n    *   D) (1R,**2R**,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nThe inversion at the site of attack (reactant C6 becoming product C2) from (S) to (R) definitively points to option D as the correct product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
