    "To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of the electron, we can use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n**1. Find the Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp):**\n\nAccording to the position-momentum uncertainty principle, the relationship between the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) is:\n\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (approximately 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n\nTo find the *minimum* uncertainty, we use the equality:\n\nΔp = ħ / (2 * Δx)\n\nGiven:\n*   Uncertainty in position, Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   Reduced Planck's constant, ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\nCalculation:\nΔp = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 10⁻¹⁰ m)\nΔp ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\n**2. Relate Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE) to Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp):**\n\nThe relationship between the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in momentum can be approximated by:\n\nΔE ≈ v * Δp\n\nHere, 'v' is the velocity of the particle. This relationship is valid for both relativistic and non-relativistic cases, as it stems from the general definition of a particle's group velocity (v = dE/dp).\n\nGiven:\n*   Velocity of the electron, v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   Calculated uncertainty in momentum, Δp ≈ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s\n\n**3. Calculate the Minimum Uncertainty in Energy (ΔE):**\n\nNow, we can calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy:\n\nΔE ≈ (2 x 10⁸ m/s) * (5.27 x 10⁻²⁵ kg·m/s)\nΔE ≈ 10.54 x 10⁻¹⁷ J\nΔE ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nThis value is approximately 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\nB) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\nC) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\nD) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\n\nThe calculated value aligns with option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
