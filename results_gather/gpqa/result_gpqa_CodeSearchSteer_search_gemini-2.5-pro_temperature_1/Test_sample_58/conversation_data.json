    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH of the final solution.\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial moles of each reactant.**\n    *   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n        *   Moles = Volume × Concentration\n        *   Moles = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.05 mol CH3COOH\n    *   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n        *   Moles = Volume × Concentration\n        *   Moles = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = 0.08 mol HCl\n        *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.08 mol of H⁺ ions.\n    *   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2), a strong base:**\n        *   Moles = Volume × Concentration\n        *   Moles = 0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2\n        *   Ba(OH)2 dissociates to yield two hydroxide ions per formula unit (Ba(OH)2 → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n        *   Moles of OH⁻ = 2 × 0.09 mol = 0.18 mol OH⁻\n\n2.  **Determine the total moles of acid and base.**\n    *   Total moles of acid (H⁺ ions) = Moles from HCl + Moles from CH3COOH\n    *   Total moles of H⁺ = 0.08 mol (strong) + 0.05 mol (weak) = 0.13 mol\n    *   Total moles of base (OH⁻ ions) = 0.18 mol\n\n3.  **Perform the neutralization reaction.**\n    The strong base (OH⁻) will react with all available acid (H⁺).\n    *   Moles of excess OH⁻ = Total moles of OH⁻ - Total moles of H⁺\n    *   Moles of excess OH⁻ = 0.18 mol - 0.13 mol = 0.05 mol\n\n    The final solution contains an excess of 0.05 moles of hydroxide ions, making it basic.\n\n4.  **Calculate the concentration of the excess hydroxide ions.**\n    *   Total volume of the solution = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n    *   Concentration of OH⁻ ([OH⁻]) = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n5.  **Calculate the pOH of the solution.**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH⁻]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n6.  **Calculate the pH of the solution.**\n    *   The relationship between pH and pOH at 25°C is pH + pOH = 14.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<B>>>"
