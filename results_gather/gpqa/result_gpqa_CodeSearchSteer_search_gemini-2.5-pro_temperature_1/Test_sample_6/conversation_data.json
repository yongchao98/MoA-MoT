    "The user has asked for the threshold energy at which high-energy gamma-rays (γ) have their lifetimes limited by annihilation with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. This process, γγ→e⁺e⁻, is known as pair production.\n\n### Calculation\nThe reaction is:\nγ (high energy) + γ (CMB) → e⁺ (positron) + e⁻ (electron)\n\nFor this reaction to occur, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame must be at least the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair. The threshold energy is the minimum energy of the incoming gamma-ray required for the reaction. This occurs when the collision is head-on.\n\nThe threshold condition is given by the formula:\nE_γ * E_CMB ≥ (m_e * c²)²\n\nwhere:\n*   **E_γ** is the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray.\n*   **E_CMB** is the energy of the CMB photon.\n*   **m_e*c²** is the rest mass energy of an electron.\n\nFrom this, we can solve for the threshold energy E_γ:\nE_γ ≥ (m_e*c²)² / E_CMB\n\n### Given Values\n*   The average energy of a CMB photon (E_CMB) is provided as **10⁻³ eV**.\n*   The rest mass energy of an electron (m_e*c²) is approximately **0.511 MeV**.\n\n### Conversion to Consistent Units\nFirst, we convert the electron's rest mass energy to eV:\nm_e*c² = 0.511 MeV = 0.511 × 10⁶ eV\n\n### Plugging in the Values\nNow we can calculate the threshold energy E_γ:\nE_γ = (0.511 × 10⁶ eV)² / (10⁻³ eV)\nE_γ = (0.261121 × 10¹² eV²) / (10⁻³ eV)\nE_γ = 0.261121 × 10¹⁵ eV\nE_γ = 2.61121 × 10¹⁴ eV\n\n### Final Conversion to GeV\nThe options are given in giga-electronvolts (GeV). We convert our result to GeV:\n1 GeV = 10⁹ eV\nE_γ = (2.61121 × 10¹⁴ eV) / (10⁹ eV/GeV)\nE_γ = 2.61121 × 10⁵ GeV\n\nThis result is approximately **2.6 × 10⁵ GeV**. This corresponds to option A. Below this energy, the process is kinematically forbidden, meaning the gamma-ray's lifetime is not limited by pair production with the CMB. Above this energy, the interaction can occur, limiting the distance high-energy gamma-rays can travel through the universe.\n\n<<<A>>>"
