    "### Analysis of Compound X\n\n**1. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad absorption is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong band is typical for a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. In conjunction with the broad O-H band, it confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **1610 cm⁻¹:** This absorption suggests C=C stretching, which is characteristic of an aromatic ring.\n*   **1450 cm⁻¹:** This is within the region for C-H bending vibrations.\n\nThe IR data strongly indicate that Compound X is an aromatic carboxylic acid.\n\n**2. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet at such a high chemical shift is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n*   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** These two signals in the aromatic region, both appearing as doublets and integrating to 2 protons each, are a classic pattern for a para-disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield signal at 8.0 ppm is ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield signal at 7.2 ppm is ortho to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n*   **Alkyl Group Signals:**\n    *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for one proton, located at a chemical shift indicative of a benzylic proton (a proton on a carbon attached to the benzene ring).\n    *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for two protons, likely a CH₂ group.\n    *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for three protons, which must be a CH₃ group adjacent to a carbon with one proton (a CH group).\n    *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for three protons, indicating a CH₃ group next to a CH₂ group.\n\n**Assembling the Structure of Compound X:**\nPutting the pieces together, the alkyl substituent is a *sec*-butyl group [-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)]. The benzylic proton is the CH at 2.9 ppm. This CH is coupled to the adjacent CH₃ group (1.4 ppm, doublet) and the CH₂ group (1.7 ppm, multiplet). The CH₂ group is, in turn, coupled to the other CH₃ group (0.9 ppm, triplet).\n\nTherefore, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n### The Reaction\n\nCompound X, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, is treated with red phosphorus (P) and hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent. It is capable of the complete reduction of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). The reaction is generally represented as:\nR-COOH + 6HI → R-CH₃ + 2H₂O + 3I₂\n\nThe red phosphorus is used to regenerate HI from the iodine (I₂) produced during the reaction.\n\n### Identifying the Final Product\n\nApplying this reduction to Compound X:\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Reaction:** The carboxylic acid group at position 1 is reduced to a methyl group.\n*   **Product:** The benzene ring and the *sec*-butyl group at position 4 remain unchanged. The final product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n*   A) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material.\n*   B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - The alkyl group is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n*   C) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches the predicted product.\n*   D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - This structure is incorrect.\n\n<<<C>>>"
