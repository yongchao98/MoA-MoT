    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we must first understand the chemical reaction and the resulting structure.\n\n1.  **The Reactant and Reagents**: The starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. This compound is treated with red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\n2.  **The Reaction**: The combination of red phosphorus and excess HI is a powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. This reagent is capable of reducing multiple functional groups completely to their corresponding alkanes. Specifically:\n    *   Aldehyde groups (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   Carboxylic acid groups (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   Carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C), like those in the cyclohexene ring and the vinyl group, are saturated to become single bonds (C-C).\n    *   The red phosphorus serves to regenerate the HI from the iodine (I2) that is formed during the reaction, allowing the reduction to go to completion.\n\n3.  **Determining the Product's Structure**:\n    *   The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The carboxylic acid at position 1 becomes a methyl group.\n    *   The formyl group at position 2 becomes a methyl group.\n    *   The vinyl group (-CH=CH2) at position 5 is reduced to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n\n    Therefore, the final product is **1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane**.\n\n4.  **Determining the Molecular Formula of the Product**:\n    *   The cyclohexane ring has 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   The ethyl group has 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   The two methyl groups have 1 carbon atom each.\n    *   Total carbons = 6 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10 carbons.\n    *   A saturated acyclic alkane with 10 carbons would have the formula C10H(2*10 + 2) = C10H22.\n    *   Since the product has one ring, two hydrogen atoms are removed.\n    *   Therefore, the molecular formula of the product is **C10H20**.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD)**: The IHD, also known as the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. It can be calculated from the molecular formula or by examining the structure.\n\n    *   **From the structure**: The product, 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane, contains one ring and no double or triple bonds. A ring counts as one unit of hydrogen deficiency. Therefore, the IHD is 1.\n\n    *   **From the formula (CxHy)**: The IHD can be calculated using the formula: IHD = x - (y/2) + 1.\n        For the product C10H20:\n        IHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1\n        IHD = 10 - 10 + 1\n        IHD = 1\n\nThe index of hydrogen deficiency of the final product is 1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
