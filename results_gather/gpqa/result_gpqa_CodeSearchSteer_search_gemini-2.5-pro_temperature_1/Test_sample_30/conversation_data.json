    "The reaction sequence is as follows:\n\n1.  **Step 1:** Toluene is treated with nitric acid (HNO₃) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically nitration. The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an ortho-, para-director. Due to less steric hindrance, the major product formed is *p*-nitrotoluene. Thus, **Product 1 is *p*-nitrotoluene**.\n2.  **Step 2:** Product 1 (*p*-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is an oxidation reaction. For the subsequent reaction with acetone to proceed, the methyl group must be oxidized to an aldehyde. While various oxidation products are possible depending on the conditions, the formation of an aldehyde is a known process. Therefore, **Product 2 is *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde**.\n3.  **Step 3:** Product 2 (*p*-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone (CH₃COCH₃) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a base-catalyzed crossed-aldol condensation known as the Claisen-Schmidt condensation. The enolate of acetone attacks the aldehyde carbonyl of *p*-nitrobenzaldehyde. The resulting aldol adduct readily dehydrates to form an α,β-unsaturated ketone. The final product, **Product 3**, is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one, which is the more stable trans-isomer.\n\nNow, we need to determine the molecular symmetry group (point group) of Product 3, **(E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one**.\n\nThe structure of this molecule is:\n\n```\n      O=N⁺-O⁻\n      |\n    / \\\n  //   \\\\\n-C     C-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH₃\n  \\\\   //\n    \\ /\n      C\n```\n\nTo determine the point group, we look for its symmetry elements:\n*   **Rotational Axes (Cₙ):** There are no rotational axes of symmetry (Cₙ where n > 1). Rotating the molecule 180° around any axis does not result in an identical structure.\n*   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** Due to the extensive system of sp² hybridized atoms, the molecule is essentially planar. This molecular plane acts as a plane of symmetry, reflecting the top half of the atoms onto the bottom half.\n*   **Center of Inversion (i):** There is no center of inversion.\n*   **Improper Rotation Axis (Sₙ):** There are no improper rotation axes.\n\nSince the molecule possesses only the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ), its point group is **Cₛ**.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA) D₂h\nB) C₂h\nC) C₃\nD) Cₛ\n\nThe correct molecular symmetry group is Cₛ.\n\n<<<D>>>"
