    "The reaction between an enol and bromine is a key step in the acid-catalyzed alpha-halogenation of ketones. The starting material provided, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, is an enol. Enols have an electron-rich double bond and are highly reactive towards electrophiles like bromine.\n\nThe mechanism proceeds as follows:\n1.  The pi bond of the enol's double bond (C1=C2) acts as a nucleophile and attacks a bromine molecule (Br2).\n2.  This attack leads to the formation of a new C-Br bond at the alpha-carbon (C2) and an oxonium ion intermediate (where the oxygen of the original hydroxyl group is positively charged and double-bonded to C1).\n3.  A base (which could be the bromide ion, Br-, formed in the first step, or a solvent molecule) removes the proton from the oxygen.\n4.  This final step results in the formation of a carbonyl group (C=O) at C1 and neutralizes the charge.\n\nThe overall result of this reaction is the replacement of the C=C double bond and the OH group of the enol with a C=O group and a new C-Br bond at the alpha-position.\n\nApplying this to 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol:\n*   The double bond is between C1 and C2.\n*   The hydroxyl group is on C1.\n*   The reaction with bromine will form a carbonyl group at C1 and add a bromine atom to C2.\n\nThe final product is therefore **2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone**.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n*   A) 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone: This would involve bromination at the C4 position, which is a quaternary carbon with no alpha-hydrogens, making it an unlikely site for this reaction.\n*   B) (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol: This product would result from the simple addition of Br2 across the double bond without the rearrangement of the enol. While addition is a reaction of alkenes, the reactivity of the enol functional group strongly favors alpha-halogenation.\n*   C) 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone: This is the alpha-brominated ketone, which is the expected product from the reaction of an enol with bromine.\n*   D) (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol: This is another stereoisomer of the simple addition product and is incorrect for the same reasons as option B.\n\nThus, the major product is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.\n\n<<<C>>>"
