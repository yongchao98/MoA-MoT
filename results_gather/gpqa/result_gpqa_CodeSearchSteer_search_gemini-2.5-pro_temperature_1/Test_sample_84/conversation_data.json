    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we can follow a step-by-step derivation based on the information provided.\n\n### 1. Equilibrium Temperature Ratio\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is the theoretical temperature it would have if it were a black body heated only by its parent star. It is determined by the star's effective temperature (T_star), the star's radius (R_star), and the planet's semi-major axis (a). The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * √(R_star / (2a)) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nwhere A is the planet's albedo.\n\nTo find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 (T_eq1) and Planet2 (T_eq2), we can set up the following equation:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_star * √(R_star / (2 * a1)) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_star * √(R_star / (2 * a2)) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are identical for both. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (A1 = A2). Therefore, these terms cancel out, and the formula simplifies to:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a2 / a1)\n\nThis shows that the temperature ratio depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes.\n\n### 2. Semi-Major Axis Ratio from Radial Velocity Data\n\nThe problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method, which can be used to determine the semi-major axes. The maximum periodic Doppler shift corresponds to the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) of the star. For a planet in a circular orbit, this is given by:\n\nK ≈ M_p * √(G / (M_star * a))\n\nHere, M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, G is the gravitational constant, and `a` is the semi-major axis. This formula is a good approximation when the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (M_p << M_star). The detection of the planets via the transit method implies that their orbital inclination is close to 90°, so sin(i) ≈ 1.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\n\na ≈ (M_p² * G) / (K² * M_star)\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a2 / a1):\n\na2 / a1 = [(M_p2² * G) / (K2² * M_star)] / [(M_p1² * G) / (K1² * M_star)]\n\nThe terms for the star's mass (M_star) and the gravitational constant (G) cancel out, leaving:\n\na2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)² * (K1 / K2)²\n\n### 3. Calculating the Ratios\n\nFirst, we determine the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K1 / K2). The Doppler shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the radial velocity. Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is the same as the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts:\n\nK1 / K2 = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 0.03 Å / 0.04 Å = 0.75\n\nNext, we find the ratio of the planetary masses:\n\nM_p2 / M_p1 = 5 Earth masses / 7 Earth masses = 5/7\n\nNow we can calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n\na2 / a1 = (5/7)² * (0.75)² = (25/49) * (9/16) = 225 / 784\n\n### 4. Final Temperature Ratio Calculation\n\nFinally, we substitute the value of a2 / a1 back into the simplified equilibrium temperature ratio equation:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = √(a2 / a1) = √(225 / 784)\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) ~ 1.30\nB) ~ 0.53\nC) ~ 1.05\nD) ~ 0.98\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
