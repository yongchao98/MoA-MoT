    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Normalize the initial state vector:**\n    The initial state of the system is given by the column matrix `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]`.\n    First, we need to normalize this state vector. The squared norm is:\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n    The normalization constant is `1/√6`.\n    The normalized state vector is `|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]`.\n\n2.  **Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator P:**\n    The matrix for operator P is `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`.\n    To find the probability of measuring a certain value, we first need the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of P. The eigenvalues `λ` are found by solving the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n    `det([[ -λ, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, -λ]]) = -λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ = λ(1 - λ²) = 0`.\n    The eigenvalues of P are `λ = 0, 1, -1`.\n\n3.  **Find the eigenvector for the eigenvalue P = 0:**\n    We need to find the eigenvector `|v_P=0⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ = 0`. We solve the equation `P|v⟩ = 0|v⟩`.\n    `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z] = [0, 0, 0]`.\n    This gives the equations:\n    *   `y/√2 = 0`  => `y = 0`\n    *   `x/√2 + z/√2 = 0` => `x = -z`\n    So, the eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]`. Choosing `x = -1` gives the unnormalized eigenvector `[-1, 0, 1]`.\n    Normalizing this eigenvector: `√((-1)² + 0² + 1²) = √2`.\n    The normalized eigenvector for `P=0` is `|v_P=0⟩ = (1/√2) * [-1, 0, 1]`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the probability of measuring P = 0:**\n    The probability of measuring the eigenvalue `P=0` is given by the square of the absolute value of the inner product of the eigenvector `|v_P=0⟩` and the normalized state `|ψ_norm⟩`.\n    `Prob(P=0) = |⟨v_P=0|ψ_norm⟩|²`.\n    `⟨v_P=0|ψ_norm⟩ = [(1/√2) * [-1, 0, 1]] . [(1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]]`\n    `= (1/√12) * [(-1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (1)(1)] = (1/√12) * (1 + 0 + 1) = 2/√12 = 2/(2√3) = 1/√3`.\n    `Prob(P=0) = |1/√3|² = 1/3`.\n\n5.  **Determine the state of the system after the measurement of P:**\n    After measuring `P=0`, the state of the system collapses to the normalized eigenvector corresponding to that eigenvalue.\n    The new state is `|ψ'⟩ = |v_P=0⟩ = (1/√2) * [-1, 0, 1]`.\n\n6.  **Find the eigenvector for the eigenvalue Q = -1:**\n    The matrix for operator Q is `Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`. Since Q is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements: `λ = 1, 0, -1`. The corresponding normalized eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.\n    The eigenvector for the eigenvalue `Q = -1` is `|v_Q=-1⟩ = [0, 0, 1]`.\n\n7.  **Calculate the probability of measuring Q = -1:**\n    Now we measure Q on the new state `|ψ'⟩`. The probability of getting `Q=-1` is `|⟨v_Q=-1|ψ'⟩|²`.\n    `⟨v_Q=-1|ψ'⟩ = [[0, 0, 1]] . [(1/√2) * [-1, 0, 1]]`\n    `= (1/√2) * [(0)(-1) + (0)(0) + (1)(1)] = 1/√2`.\n    `Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = |1/√2|² = 1/2`.\n\n8.  **Calculate the final combined probability:**\n    The probability of getting `P=0` and then `Q=-1` is the product of the individual probabilities calculated in the previous steps.\n    `Total Probability = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
