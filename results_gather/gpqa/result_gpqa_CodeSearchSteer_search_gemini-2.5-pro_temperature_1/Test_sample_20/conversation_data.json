    "### Part A: Tautomerism Analysis\n\nTautomers are isomers of a compound that differ only in the position of a proton and a double bond. A common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):** In the structure of p-benzoquinone, there are no hydrogen atoms on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (alpha-carbons). The hydrogens present are attached to the doubly bonded carbons, which are vinylic hydrogens. The absence of alpha-hydrogens means that benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound has three ketone groups. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 each have two hydrogen atoms. These hydrogens are alpha-hydrogens to two carbonyl groups, which makes them particularly acidic. Due to the presence of these acidic alpha-hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione readily undergoes keto-enol tautomerism. Its enol form, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), is an aromatic compound and is significantly more stable, meaning the equilibrium favors the enol form.\n\nTherefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism Analysis\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is a chiral center— a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The chemical formula is CH₃CH(OH)COOCH₃. The second carbon atom is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). This makes the carbon atom a chiral center, and thus the molecule will exhibit optical isomerism, existing as two enantiomers (R and S isomers).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate:** This molecule, with the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, is the trans-isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. It does not contain any carbon atom bonded to four different groups, so it has no chiral center. The molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n\nTherefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Compound **A** (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound **B** (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
