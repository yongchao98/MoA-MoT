    "The energy eigenvalues for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by the formula E_n = (n + 3/2)ħω, where n is the principal quantum number (n = 0, 1, 2, ...), ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, and ω is the angular frequency of oscillation. The quantum number n is the sum of the quantum numbers for each of the three spatial dimensions (n = n_x + n_y + n_z).\n\nThe energy states are:\n*   **Ground State (n=0):** E_0 = (0 + 3/2)ħω = (3/2)ħω.\n*   **First Excited State (n=1):** E_1 = (1 + 3/2)ħω = (5/2)ħω.\n*   **Second Excited State (n=2):** E_2 = (2 + 3/2)ħω = (7/2)ħω.\n*   **Third Excited State (n=3):** E_3 = (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω.\n\nThe degeneracy of an energy level E_n, which is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy, is given by the formula g_n = (n+1)(n+2)/2.\n\nFor the third excited state, n = 3. Plugging this into the degeneracy formula:\ng_3 = (3+1)(3+2)/2 = (4)(5)/2 = 10.\n\nThis degeneracy can also be found by counting the possible combinations of the non-negative integer quantum numbers (n_x, n_y, n_z) that sum to 3:\n*   Permutations of (3, 0, 0): (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) - which makes 3 states.\n*   Permutations of (2, 1, 0): (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2) - which makes 6 states.\n*   The combination (1, 1, 1): (1,1,1) - which is 1 state.\n\nThe total number of linearly independent eigenfunctions is the sum of these possibilities: 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the third excited state is (9/2)ħω, and it has a degeneracy of 10.\n\n<<<C>>>"
