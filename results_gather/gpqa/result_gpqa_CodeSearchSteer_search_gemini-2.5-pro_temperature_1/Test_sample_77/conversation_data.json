    "The expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (A) generated by a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials are derived directly from Maxwell's equations and account for the fact that the electromagnetic field propagates at the finite speed of light, `c`.\n\nThe core of the derivation involves evaluating the potentials at the observation point `r` and time `t` by considering the state of the charge `q` at an earlier, or \"retarded,\" time `tr`. The retarded time is defined such that a light signal emitted from the charge at `tr` from position `s(tr)` reaches the observer at `r` at time `t`. This is expressed by the relation `t - tr = d/c`, where `d = |r - s(tr)|` is the distance the signal travels.\n\nThe derivation results in the following expressions for the scalar and vector potentials:\n\n*   **Scalar Potential (V):**\n    The scalar potential is given by the formula:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    where the quantities in the bracket are all evaluated at the retarded time `tr`. By multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c`, we can rewrite this as:\n    $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    This expression matches the scalar potential given in option C.\n\n*   **Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n    Similarly, the vector potential is found to be:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c} \\right]$\n    Again, multiplying the numerator and denominator by `c` yields:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n    This expression matches the vector potential in option C.\n\nFurthermore, it can be shown that the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are related by the expression $\\vec{A} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$. Let's verify this for the given expressions in option C:\n$\\dfrac{\\vec{A}}{V} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})} \\cdot \\dfrac{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}{qc} = \\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v}$\nUsing the fundamental relation $c^2 = \\dfrac{1}{\\mu_o \\epsilon_o}$, we get:\n$\\dfrac{\\vec{A}}{V} = \\dfrac{1}{c^2}\\vec{v} \\implies \\vec{A} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$\nThis confirms the internal consistency of the expressions in option C.\n\nOptions A and B incorrectly use the static Coulomb potential, which does not account for the effects of retardation. Option D has an incorrect sign in the denominator. Therefore, option C provides the correct expressions.\n\n<<<C>>>"
