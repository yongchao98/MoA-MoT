    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the required volume of acid and the resulting pH.\n\n### 1. Fundamental Information\n\n*   **Mass of Fe(OH)₃:** 0.1 g\n*   **Total volume of solution:** 100 cm³ = 0.1 L\n*   **Concentration of strong monobasic acid:** 0.1 M\n*   **Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃:** 106.867 g/mol.\n*   **Solubility Product (Ksp) of Fe(OH)₃ at 25°C:** There are varying values in the literature. Values such as 2.79 x 10⁻³⁹, 2.5 x 10⁻³⁹, and 10⁻³⁶.⁴ (which is approximately 3.98 x 10⁻³⁷) are found. We will use the value Ksp = 2.79 x 10⁻³⁹ as it is frequently cited.\n\n### 2. Dissolution Reaction\n\nThe reaction for dissolving iron(III) hydroxide in a strong acid (represented by H⁺) is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nFor the iron(III) hydroxide to remain dissolved, the ion product [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ must be less than or equal to the Ksp. The minimum amount of acid is needed when the solution is saturated.\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Final pH\n\nFirst, we calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved:\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃** = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.867 g/mol = 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\nNext, we find the concentration of Fe³⁺ in the final 100 cm³ solution:\n*   **[Fe³⁺]** = Moles / Volume = 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol / 0.1 L = 9.357 x 10⁻³ M\n\nNow, using the Ksp, we can calculate the maximum hydroxide concentration [OH⁻] that can exist in equilibrium with this concentration of Fe³⁺:\n*   Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n*   2.79 x 10⁻³⁹ = (9.357 x 10⁻³) * [OH⁻]³\n*   [OH⁻]³ = (2.79 x 10⁻³⁹) / (9.357 x 10⁻³) = 2.982 x 10⁻³⁷\n*   **[OH⁻]** = (2.982 x 10⁻³⁷)^(1/3) = 6.68 x 10⁻¹³ M\n\nWith the hydroxide concentration, we can determine the pOH and then the pH at 25°C:\n*   **pOH** = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(6.68 x 10⁻¹³) = 12.18\n*   **pH** = 14 - pOH = 14 - 12.18 = 1.82\n\nLet's re-evaluate using a different Ksp value, for instance, Ksp = 4 x 10⁻³⁸, which is also commonly cited.\n*   [OH⁻]³ = (4 x 10⁻³⁸) / (9.357 x 10⁻³) = 4.275 x 10⁻³⁶\n*   **[OH⁻]** = (4.275 x 10⁻³⁶)^(1/3) = 1.623 x 10⁻¹² M\n*   **pOH** = -log₁₀(1.623 x 10⁻¹²) = 11.79\n*   **pH** = 14 - 11.79 = 2.21\n\nThe calculated pH is very sensitive to the Ksp value. Let's check the pH provided in the options. Option D suggests a pH of 2.04. Let's work backward from this pH.\n*   If **pH = 2.04**, then pOH = 14 - 2.04 = 11.96\n*   [OH⁻] = 10⁻¹¹⁹⁶ = 1.10 x 10⁻¹² M\n*   [H⁺] = 10⁻²⁰⁴ = 9.12 x 10⁻³ M\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Required Acid Volume\n\nThe total moles of H⁺ added from the acid are used for two purposes:\n1.  **To neutralize the Fe(OH)₃:** From the stoichiometry, 3 moles of H⁺ are needed for every mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 * (9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol) = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol\n2.  **To establish the final acidity of the solution:** These are the H⁺ ions remaining in the 100 cm³ solution.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (final) = [H⁺]final * Total Volume = (9.12 x 10⁻³ M) * (0.1 L) = 9.12 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\nNow, we find the total moles of H⁺ that must be added:\n*   **Total Moles of H⁺** = Moles (reacted) + Moles (final)\n*   Total Moles of H⁺ = (2.807 x 10⁻³) + (9.12 x 10⁻⁴) = 3.719 x 10⁻³ mol\n\nFinally, we calculate the volume of the 0.1 M strong acid needed to supply these moles:\n*   **Volume of Acid** = Total Moles of H⁺ / Acid Concentration\n*   Volume of Acid = (3.719 x 10⁻³ mol) / (0.1 mol/L) = 0.03719 L\n*   **Volume of Acid = 37.19 cm³**\n\nThe calculated values (pH 2.04; 37.19 cm³) do not precisely match any of the options. Let's re-examine the calculations and options. There might be a slight variation due to the specific Ksp value used in the problem's source. Option D (pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³) has the correct pH but a different volume. Let's see what assumptions lead to that volume.\n\nIf the volume were 28.05 cm³ (0.02805 L):\n*   Total moles of H⁺ added = 0.1 M * 0.02805 L = 2.805 x 10⁻³ mol\n*   This amount is almost exactly the stoichiometric amount needed to react with the Fe(OH)₃ (2.807 x 10⁻³ mol).\n*   If only the stoichiometric amount is added, there would be virtually no free H⁺ left in the solution, and the pH would be much higher (determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺). This contradicts the acidic pH of 2.04.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the calculation based on the provided answers. The calculation seems straightforward, and the discrepancy is significant. Let's assume there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement or the options are based on a different Ksp value. However, the pH of 2.04 from option D gives a volume of 37.19 cm³, while the volume of 28.05 cm³ from option D implies almost no final acidity. Given the consistency of the chemical principles, there appears to be an inconsistency in the provided options.\n\nHowever, if forced to choose the \"best\" fit based on a logical process, we calculated a pH close to 2. Let's re-run the calculation with pH=2.69 (Option A).\n*   [H+] = 10^-2.69 = 2.04 x 10⁻³ M\n*   Moles H+ (final) = 2.04 x 10⁻³ M * 0.1 L = 2.04 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n*   Total Moles H+ = (2.807 x 10⁻³) + (2.04 x 10⁻⁴) = 3.011 x 10⁻³ mol\n*   Volume = (3.011 x 10⁻³ mol) / 0.1 M = 0.03011 L = 30.11 cm³. This matches Option A (pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³) quite well.\n\nLet's check the Ksp value that would correspond to pH 2.69:\n*   pOH = 14 - 2.69 = 11.31\n*   [OH⁻] = 10⁻¹¹·³¹ = 4.9 x 10⁻¹² M\n*   Ksp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³ = (9.357 x 10⁻³)(4.9 x 10⁻¹²)³ = 1.1 x 10⁻³⁶. This is a plausible, albeit high, value for Ksp.\n\nGiven the close match for both pH and volume, option A is the most self-consistent choice.\n\n<<<A>>>"
