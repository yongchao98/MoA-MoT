    "To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we need to analyze the relationship between the observed Doppler shift and the planet's orbital period.\n\n### Key Principles of the Radial Velocity Method\nThe radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by observing the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. This shift is caused by the star's \"wobble\" as it's pulled by the orbiting planet's gravity. The magnitude of this wobble, and thus the Doppler shift, is related to the properties of the planet and its orbit.\n\nThe key physical quantities are:\n*   **Wavelength Shift (Δλ):** This is the observed change in the wavelength of a spectral line. It is directly proportional to the star's radial velocity (the component of its velocity along our line of sight).\n*   **Radial Velocity Amplitude (K):** This is the maximum speed of the star's wobble towards or away from us. K is directly proportional to the maximum observed wavelength shift (Δλ_max).\n*   **Orbital Period (P):** This is the time the planet takes to complete one orbit.\n\n### The Relationship Between Radial Velocity and Orbital Period\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the star's radial velocity amplitude (K) is related to the orbital period (P), the star's mass (M_star), and the planet's mass (m_p) by the following proportionality:\n*K ∝ m_p / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3))*\n\nThis relationship shows that for a given star and planet mass, the radial velocity amplitude (K) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period (P).\n\n### Applying the Principles to the Problem\n\n1.  **Information Given:**\n    *   The two stars have identical masses (M_star1 = M_star2).\n    *   The two planets have similar masses (m_p1 ≈ m_p2).\n    *   The orbits are circular.\n    *   The wavelength shift for planet #1 is Δλ₁ = 5 milliangstroms.\n    *   The wavelength shift for planet #2 is Δλ₂ = 7 milliangstroms.\n\n2.  **Relating Shift to Velocity:**\n    Since the radial velocity amplitude (K) is proportional to the wavelength shift (Δλ), the ratio of the amplitudes is:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ₂ / Δλ₁ = 7 / 5 = 1.4\n\n3.  **Calculating the Period Ratio:**\n    From the proportionality K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3), we can write the ratio of the amplitudes in terms of the periods:\n    K₂ / K₁ = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    Now, we substitute the known value of the velocity ratio:\n    1.4 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To find the ratio of the periods, we cube both sides of the equation:\n    (1.4)³ = P₁ / P₂\n    2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\n    The question asks for the ratio of planet #2's period to planet #1's period (P₂ / P₁). We can find this by taking the reciprocal:\n    P₂ / P₁ = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.364\n\n    This result indicates that the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. A larger radial velocity signal implies a shorter orbital period, which is consistent with our calculation.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\n\nA) ~ 1.96\nB) ~ 0.36\nC) ~ 0.85\nD) ~ 1.40\n\nThe calculated value of ~0.36 corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
