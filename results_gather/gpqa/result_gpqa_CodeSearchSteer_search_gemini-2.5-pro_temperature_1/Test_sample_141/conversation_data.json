    "To determine the geometrical position of the given density matrix in the qubit space, we can represent it in the Bloch sphere formalism.\n\nAny density matrix ρ for a single qubit can be expressed as:\n\nρ = ½ (I + **r** ⋅ **σ**)\n\nwhere:\n*   I is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n*   **σ** = (σₓ, σᵧ, σ₂) represents the Pauli matrices.\n*   **r** = (rₓ, rᵧ, r₂) is the Bloch vector, which indicates the position of the state within the Bloch sphere.\n\nThe given density matrix is:\n\nρ = ½ (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)\n\nIn matrix form, the basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩ and their outer products are:\n*   |0⟩ = [,], so |0⟩⟨0| = [,]\n*   |1⟩ = [,], so |1⟩⟨1| = [,]\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for ρ:\n\nρ = ½ ([,] + [,])\nρ = ½ [,]\nρ = ½ I\n\nNow, we compare this result with the general Bloch sphere representation:\n\n½ I = ½ (I + **r** ⋅ **σ**)\n\nFor this equality to hold, the term **r** ⋅ **σ** must be the zero matrix. This implies that the Bloch vector **r** must be the zero vector, **r** = (0, 0, 0).\n\nThis state is known as the maximally mixed state, and its corresponding Bloch vector is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. Points on the surface of the Bloch sphere represent pure states, while points in the interior represent mixed states. The center of the sphere represents the maximally mixed state, where there is an equal probability of measuring the qubit in state |0⟩ or |1⟩.\n\nTherefore, the geometrical position of the given density matrix is **r** = (0, 0, 0).\n\n<<<C>>>"
