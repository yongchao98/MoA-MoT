    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we must first establish the detection limit for each and then calculate the apparent V magnitude for every star.\n\n### Detection Limits\n\n*   **ESPRESSO (Paranal Observatory):** Can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude brighter than 17 mag (m_V < 17).\n*   **HIRES (Keck Observatory):** Can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude brighter than 16 mag (m_V < 16).\n\nFor a star to be detectable by **both** instruments, it must satisfy the stricter of the two limits, which is m_V < 16. The problem also specifies to disregard the pointing limits of the telescopes, which means we should not consider the star's location in the sky (its declination) as a constraint.\n\n### Apparent Magnitude Calculations\n\nThe apparent magnitude (m_V) is calculated using the distance modulus formula, which relates it to the absolute magnitude (M_V) and the distance in parsecs (d). If there is interstellar dust, an extinction factor (A_V) must also be added. The formula is: m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d / 10) + A_V.\n\nHere is the analysis for each star:\n\n*   **Star1:**\n    *   M_V = 15.5 mag, d = 10 pc, no extinction mentioned.\n    *   m_V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10 / 10) = 15.5 + 5 * log10(1) = 15.5.\n    *   Since 15.5 is less than 16, **Star1 is observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star2:**\n    *   The apparent V magnitude is given directly as 16.5 mag.\n    *   Since 16.5 is not less than 16, **Star2 is not observable by HIRES.**\n\n*   **Star3:**\n    *   The apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5 mag. \"Apparent magnitude\" refers to the brightness as seen from Earth, which already accounts for any dimming by dust. The additional information about color excess and distance is not needed to determine its observed brightness.\n    *   Since 15.5 is less than 16, **Star3 is observable by both.**\n\n*   **Star4:**\n    *   M_V = 15.5 mag, d = 10 pc, E(B-V) = 0.4 mag.\n    *   First, calculate the extinction: A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n    *   Now, calculate the apparent magnitude: m_V = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10 / 10) + 1.24 = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n    *   Since 16.74 is not less than 16, **Star4 is not observable by HIRES.**\n\n*   **Star5:**\n    *   M_V = 16.5 mag, d = 5 pc, no extinction mentioned.\n    *   m_V = 16.5 + 5 * log10(5 / 10) = 16.5 + 5 * log10(0.5) ≈ 16.5 + 5 * (-0.301) ≈ 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995 mag.\n    *   Since 14.995 is less than 16, **Star5 is observable by both.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe stars that meet the brightness requirement (m_V < 16) for both observatories are Star1, Star3, and Star5. Reviewing the given options, the only pair that consists exclusively of these observable stars is Star3 and Star5.\n\n<<<D>>>"
