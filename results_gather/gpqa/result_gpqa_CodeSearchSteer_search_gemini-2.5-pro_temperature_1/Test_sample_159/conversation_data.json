    "The initial reasoning appears to be correct. The search results confirm the key physical principles and numerical values.\n\n1.  **N-sided Polygon to Circular Aperture:** As the number of sides N of a regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius 'a'. The diffraction pattern from this limiting shape is that of a circular aperture.\n\n2.  **Fraunhofer Diffraction by a Circular Aperture:** The diffraction pattern is known as an Airy pattern, which consists of a bright central disk (the Airy disk) surrounded by concentric dark and bright rings. The minima (dark rings) occur at specific angles.\n\n3.  **Condition for Minima:** The angular positions of the minima are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x). The condition for a minimum is given by `ka * sin(θ) = x`, where `k = 2π/λ`, 'a' is the radius of the aperture, and 'x' is a zero of J₁(x).\n\n4.  **Zeros of J₁(x):** The search results and physics knowledge bases confirm the values for the zeros of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n    *   The first non-zero root is x₁ ≈ 3.8317.\n    *   The second non-zero root is x₂ ≈ 7.0156. (This value is not explicitly in the snippets but is the standard, confirmed value from physics and mathematics resources like Wolfram MathWorld which is referenced).\n\n5.  **Calculating the Angular Positions:**\n    *   Using the small angle approximation (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`), the angular position of a minimum is `θ = x / (ka) = xλ / (2πa)`.\n    *   **First Minimum (θ₁):**\n        `θ₁ = 3.8317 * λ / (2π * a)`\n        `θ₁ ≈ 0.6098 * λ / a`\n        This is often expressed using the diameter D=2a as `θ₁ = 1.22 * λ / D`.\n    *   **Second Minimum (θ₂):**\n        `θ₂ = 7.0156 * λ / (2π * a)`\n        `θ₂ ≈ 1.1168 * λ / a`\n\n6.  **Angular Distance between Minima:**\n    The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima, which is `Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁`.\n    `Δθ = (1.1168 - 0.6098) * λ / a`\n    `Δθ = 0.507 * λ / a`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.500 λ / a\nB) 0.506 λ / a\nC) 0.610 λ / a (This is the position of the first minimum, θ₁)\nD) 1.220 λ / a (This is related to the first minimum and the diameter)\n\nThe calculated value `0.507 λ / a` is closest to option B, `0.506 λ / a`. The minor difference is likely due to rounding of the Bessel function zeros. Using more precise values for the zeros: j₁,₁ = 3.831706 and j₁,₂ = 7.015587.\n\n`θ₁ = 3.831706 / (2π) * (λ/a) ≈ 0.609838 * (λ/a)`\n`θ₂ = 7.015587 / (2π) * (λ/a) ≈ 1.116808 * (λ/a)`\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (1.116808 - 0.609838) * (λ/a) = 0.50697 * (λ/a)`\n\nThis rounds to `0.507 λ / a`, which matches option B extremely well.\n\nFinal check of the steps and reasoning confirms the result.\n\nAn N-sided polygon with an infinitely large number of sides and a constant apothem `a` becomes a circle of radius `a`. The problem is therefore equivalent to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius `a`.\n\nThe intensity minima for a circular aperture are given by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function, `J₁(x)`. The angular position `θ` of the minima is given by the relation:\n`sin(θ) = x / (ka)`\nwhere `k = 2π / λ` is the wave number and `x` represents the zeros of `J₁(x)`.\n\nUsing the small angle approximation (`sin(θ) ≈ θ`), the formula becomes:\n`θ = xλ / (2πa)`\n\nThe first two non-zero zeros of `J₁(x)` are:\n*   `x₁ ≈ 3.8317`\n*   `x₂ ≈ 7.0156`\n\nThe angular position of the first minimum is:\n`θ₁ = (3.8317 / 2π) * (λ / a) ≈ 0.6098 λ / a`\n\nThe angular position of the second minimum is:\n`θ₂ = (7.0156 / 2π) * (λ / a) ≈ 1.1168 λ / a`\n\nThe angular distance between these two minima is:\n`Δθ = θ₂ - θ₁ = (1.1168 - 0.6098) λ / a = 0.507 λ / a`\n\nThis value is closest to option B.\n\n`0.507 λ / a ≈ 0.506 λ / a`\n\nFinal answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
