  "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus.

    "The inability to express the GADD45G fusion protein is due to an error in the engineered genetic sequence that halts protein synthesis prematurely. A detailed analysis of the provided DNA sequence reveals the specific reason for this failure.\n\nThe construct was designed to have an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag. The standard amino acid sequence for this tag is YPYDVPDYA. The translation of the initial portion of the provided DNA sequence confirms this design:\n\n*   **DNA:** 5'- ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC ... -3'\n*   **Protein:** M Y P Y D V P D Y A ...\n\nThe translation begins correctly at the `ATG` start codon, which codes for Methionine (M), and proceeds to correctly code for the amino acids of the HA tag.\n\nHowever, by continuing to read the DNA sequence in the correct reading frame (in triplets, starting from the ATG codon), a termination signal is found immediately following the HA tag sequence:\n\n*   **Sequence portion:** ... `TAC GCC AAA TGA` ...\n*   **Translation:** ... Tyrosine (Y) - Alanine (A) - Lysine (K) - **STOP**\n\nThe codon `TGA` is one of the three standard stop codons (along with `TAA` and `TAG`) in the genetic code. When the ribosome encounters a stop codon during translation, it terminates the synthesis of the polypeptide chain. In this case, the `TGA` codon causes the ribosome to detach after only synthesizing the HA tag and a single extra amino acid (Lysine), preventing the translation of the main GADD45G protein sequence that follows.\n\nThis leads to the following conclusions regarding the proposed options:\n*   **A) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While linkers can be important for proper protein folding, the primary issue here is that the full-length protein is not even being synthesized.\n*   **C) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** The HA tag sequence itself is correctly encoded. The problem lies immediately downstream of it.\n*   **D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This statement is incorrect for two reasons. First, the stop codon in the sequence is `TGA`, not `UAA` (or `TAA` in DNA). Second, stop codons are recognized by protein release factors, not tRNAs, which is what triggers termination.\n\nTherefore, the correct explanation is that a premature stop codon was inadvertently included in the construct, causing the ribosome to terminate translation early.\n\n<<<B>>>"
