    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Substance Z\n\nSubstance Z is a hydrocarbon with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. It is a common solvent and is a saturated hydrocarbon, meaning it doesn't react further with hydrogen.\n\nThe mass percentage of hydrogen (H) in a hydrocarbon (composed of carbon C and hydrogen H) is given by:\nMass % H = (mass of H / total mass) * 100\n\nUsing the approximate atomic masses (C ≈ 12, H ≈ 1), 14.28% is equivalent to the fraction 1/7.\nIf the mass fraction of H is 1/7, the mass fraction of C is 6/7. The ratio of the number of atoms is (moles C) / (moles H) = (6/12) / (1/1) = 0.5, which gives an empirical formula of CH₂.\n\nA general formula for a cycloalkane is CₙH₂ₙ, which matches the empirical formula CH₂. Let's verify the mass percentage for this class of compounds:\nMass % H = (2n * 1.008) / (n * 12.011 + 2n * 1.008) = 2.016 / 14.027 ≈ 14.37%\nUsing integer masses: Mass % H = (2n * 1) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%.\n\nThis confirms that Z is a cycloalkane. A widely used cycloalkane solvent is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**. This fits all the descriptions for substance Z.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components of Mixture Y\n\nMixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, indicating the components are saturated or aromatic. One component is Z, which is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂).\n\nHydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions yields only cyclohexane.\n*   Hydrogenating cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) gives cyclohexane.\n*   The other component of Y must also produce cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. Since it does not decolorize bromine water, it must be an aromatic compound with the same carbon skeleton. The only possibility is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions.\n\nTherefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Reaction from Mixture X to Mixture Y\n\nMixture X, an equimolar blend of two liquids (let's call them X₁ and X₂), undergoes a disproportionation reaction when heated with platinum to form mixture Y.\n\nReaction: X₁ + X₂ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆ (equimolar products from equimolar reactants)\n\nThis is a hydrogen transfer reaction where the total number of atoms must be conserved.\n*   Total carbon atoms in products = 6 (from cyclohexane) + 6 (from benzene) = 12\n*   Total hydrogen atoms in products = 12 (from cyclohexane) + 6 (from benzene) = 18\n\nSo, one molecule of X₁ and one molecule of X₂ together must contain 12 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Components of Mixture X\n\nThe components of mixture X have the following properties:\n*   They are two different liquids.\n*   Hydrogenation of both X₁ and X₂ gives only cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), which means they are both C₆ hydrocarbons with a six-membered ring structure.\n*   They decolorize bromine water, indicating they are unsaturated (contain C=C double bonds).\n*   There are no conjugated multiple bonds in their molecules.\n\nLet the formulas be C₆Hₐ for X₁ and C₆Hₑ for X₂. From Step 3, we know that **a + b = 18**.\n\nLet's consider possible non-conjugated, unsaturated six-membered ring C₆ hydrocarbons:\n*   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**: Contains one double bond, so it is not conjugated.\n*   **Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈)**: Contains two double bonds separated by two single bonds, so they are not conjugated.\n*   *Cyclohexa-1,3-diene* (C₆H₈) is excluded because its double bonds are conjugated.\n\nLet's test the pair cyclohexene and cyclohexa-1,4-diene:\n*   X₁ = Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) → a = 10\n*   X₂ = Cyclohexa-1,4-diene (C₆H₈) → b = 8\n\nThe sum of hydrogen atoms is a + b = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our requirement from the reaction stoichiometry. All other conditions are also satisfied by this pair.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n\n*   Hydrogen atoms in X₁ (cyclohexene, C₆H₁₀) = 10\n*   Hydrogen atoms in X₂ (cyclohexa-1,4-diene, C₆H₈) = 8\n\nTotal hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
