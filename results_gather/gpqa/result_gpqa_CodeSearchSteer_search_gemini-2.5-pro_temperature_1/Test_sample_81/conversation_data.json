    "The question asks for the major isomer of the final product in a three-step reaction sequence. Let's analyze each step to determine the stereochemistry of the final product. This reaction sequence is a classic in organic chemistry, famously associated with Leo Paquette's synthesis of dodecahedrane.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclooctatetraene with maleic anhydride**\n\nWhen heated, cyclooctatetraene (COT) exists in equilibrium with its bicyclic isomer, bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene. This isomer contains a reactive 1,3-diene system (the cyclohexadiene part) that readily undergoes a Diels-Alder reaction with maleic anhydride, which acts as the dienophile. The reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition. According to the principles of stereoselectivity in Diels-Alder reactions, the kinetically favored product is the *endo* adduct. This means the anhydride ring forms on the same side (\"syn\") of the molecule as the remaining double bond in the four-membered ring. The resulting polycyclic anhydride is product 1.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 with methanol and sulfuric acid**\n\nThis step involves the acid-catalyzed opening of the anhydride ring by methanol to form a diester. This esterification process does not alter the stereochemistry of the carbocyclic framework. The anhydride is converted into two methyl ester groups (-COOCH₃) that maintain a *cis* relationship to each other, reflecting the geometry of the starting maleic anhydride. The resulting molecule, product 2, is dimethyl *endo,cis*-tricyclo[4.2.2.0²'⁵]dec-9-ene-7,8-dicarboxylate.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 with cyclopentadiene**\n\nThis is a second Diels-Alder reaction. Here, product 2 acts as the dienophile, specifically at the strained double bond of the cyclobutene ring. Cyclopentadiene serves as the diene. The stereochemical outcome of this step is governed by two factors:\n1.  **Facial Selectivity (*syn* vs. *anti*):** The cyclopentadiene will approach the dienophile from the less sterically hindered face. The existing part of the molecule containing the bulky dimethyl ester groups blocks one face (*syn* approach). Therefore, the diene adds to the opposite face, an approach termed *anti*.\n2.  **Endo/Exo Selectivity:** For Diels-Alder reactions involving cyclic dienes like cyclopentadiene, the *endo* transition state is favored due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions, leading to the kinetic product.\n\nThus, the major isomer formed, product 3, is the *anti-endo* adduct.\n\n**Identifying the Correct Structure**\n\nNow we must match the *anti-endo* stereochemistry with the given options. The options provide specific IUPAC names and SMILES strings for different stereoisomers.\n\n*   **Option C** can be eliminated because its name, `...(10R,11R)-...dicarboxylate`, indicates a *trans* relationship between the two ester groups. The reaction starts with maleic anhydride, a *cis*-dienophile, so the resulting ester groups must be *cis*.\n*   Options A, B, and D all describe *cis*-diesters (`...(10S,11R)-...`). They represent different stereoisomers of the final product.\n\nTo determine which of these corresponds to the *anti-endo* adduct, one would need to perform a detailed stereochemical analysis by drawing the molecule and applying the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules, or by using a chemical structure visualizer.\n\nUpon visualization and analysis of the structure corresponding to option B:\n*   The two ester groups are *cis* to each other.\n*   The moiety formed from the cyclopentadiene addition is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the main molecular cage relative to the bridge carrying the ester groups.\n*   The cyclopentadiene has added in an *endo* fashion, where the methano bridge is on the same side as the double bond of the newly formed norbornene-type system.\n\nThis configuration perfectly matches the predicted *anti-endo* stereochemistry of the major product. The structures in options A and D represent other, less favored stereoisomers.\n\nTherefore, the structure of the major isomer of product 3 is correctly represented by option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
