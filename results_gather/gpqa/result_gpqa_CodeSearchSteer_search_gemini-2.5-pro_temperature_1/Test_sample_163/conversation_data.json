    "To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we first need to establish the relationship between the total mass of a binary system and its observable properties: the orbital period (P) and the radial velocity amplitudes (K) of its stars.\n\n### Theoretical Basis\nFor a double-lined spectroscopic binary system with stars of mass M₁ and M₂, the total mass (M_total = M₁ + M₂) is related to the orbital period (P) and the semi-major axis (a) of the relative orbit by Kepler's Third Law:\n\nM₁ + M₂ = (4π²a³) / (GP²)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant.\n\nFor circular orbits, which are implied by the sinusoidal radial velocity curves, the orbital velocities (v₁ and v₂) are constant. The observed radial velocity amplitudes (K₁ and K₂) are related to the orbital velocities by K = v * sin(i), where 'i' is the inclination of the orbital plane to the line of sight. Since both systems exhibit eclipses, their orbits are viewed nearly edge-on, so we can assume the inclination angle i ≈ 90°, which makes sin(i) ≈ 1. Therefore, the radial velocity amplitudes can be taken as the orbital velocities (K ≈ v).\n\nThe orbital velocities are related to the semi-major axes of each star's orbit around the common center of mass (a₁ and a₂) and the period P:\n\nv₁ = 2πa₁ / P  =>  a₁ = (v₁P) / (2π)\nv₂ = 2πa₂ / P  =>  a₂ = (v₂P) / (2π)\n\nThe semi-major axis of the relative orbit is a = a₁ + a₂. Substituting the expressions for a₁ and a₂, and using K for the velocities:\n\na = ( (K₁ + K₂) * P ) / (2π)\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for 'a' back into Kepler's Third Law:\n\nM_total = (4π² / (GP²)) * [ ( (K₁ + K₂) * P ) / (2π) ]³\nM_total = (4π² / (GP²)) * ( (K₁ + K₂ )³ * P³ ) / (8π³)\nM_total = ( P * (K₁ + K₂ )³ ) / (2πG)\n\nThis final expression shows that the total mass of the system is directly proportional to the orbital period and the cube of the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes.\n\n### Calculation\nWe can now calculate the relative masses for the two systems using the derived proportionality M ∝ P * (K_sum)³.\n\n**For system_1:**\n*   Period (P₁) = 2 years\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_sum1) = 10 km/s + 5 km/s = 15 km/s\n*   Mass (M_sys1) ∝ 2 * (15)³ = 2 * 3375 = 6750\n\n**For system_2:**\n*   Period (P₂) = 1 year\n*   Sum of radial velocity amplitudes (K_sum2) = 15 km/s + 10 km/s = 25 km/s\n*   Mass (M_sys2) ∝ 1 * (25)³ = 1 * 15625 = 15625\n\n**Mass Ratio:**\nTo find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we calculate the ratio M_sys1 / M_sys2:\n\nRatio = M_sys1 / M_sys2 = 6750 / 15625\n\nRatio = 54 / 125 = 0.432\n\nThis value is approximately 0.4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
