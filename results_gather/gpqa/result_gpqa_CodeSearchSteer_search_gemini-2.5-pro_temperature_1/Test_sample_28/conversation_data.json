    "To eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, the goal is to create a non-functional protein. This is most reliably achieved by a mutation that causes a complete loss of function. Let's analyze the effect of each mutation on the protein's synthesis and structure.\n\nThe intact gene begins `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT...`, which translates to the amino acid sequence: Met-Phe-Leu-Ala... The sequence `ATG` is the start codon.\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT...`\n    *   This sequence contains two changes compared to the intact gene:\n        1.  `TTT` -> `TTC`: Both codons code for Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a *silent mutation* and has no effect on the amino acid sequence.\n        2.  `CTC` -> `TAC`: This changes the codon for Leucine (Leu) to Tyrosine (Tyr). This is a *missense mutation*.\n    *   A missense mutation changes a single amino acid. While this might alter or reduce the protein's function, it is not guaranteed to eliminate it completely. The protein might still be produced and retain some or all of its activity.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT...`\n    *   This sequence has a change from `CTC` to `TAA`.\n    *   The codon `TAA` is a stop codon (also known as a nonsense codon).\n    *   This type of mutation is called a *nonsense mutation*. It introduces a premature stop signal, causing protein synthesis to halt.\n    *   The result is a severely truncated protein (in this case, only two amino acids long: Met-Phe). A protein this short is almost certain to be non-functional. This is a highly effective way to knock out gene function.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** `5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...`\n    *   A comparison of the intact sequence (`ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT...`) with Mutant 3 (`ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTT...`) reveals an insertion of a nucleotide (`T`) after the first two codons.\n    *   Intact codons: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...`\n    *   Mutant 3 codons: `ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...`\n    *   Wait, the provided sequence strings show a different mutation. Let's re-examine the full strings:\n        *   Intact:  `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n        *   Mutant 3: `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`\n        *   The change is an insertion of a 'T' at position 6. This shifts the reading frame for all subsequent codons.\n    *   This is a *frameshift mutation*. The insertion of a single nucleotide alters the grouping of bases into codons, changing every amino acid downstream of the mutation. This almost always leads to a premature stop codon and a non-functional protein. Like a nonsense mutation, a frameshift is highly likely to eliminate the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** `5’-ATG TTT ACG CTA CTT CTG...`\n    *   Comparing the intact sequence (`...GCT GGT ACT...`) with Mutant 4 (`...GCT ACT...`) shows a deletion of the three nucleotides `GGT`.\n    *   The `GGT` codon codes for the amino acid Glycine. Since three nucleotides (a full codon) are removed, the reading frame is not shifted.\n    *   This is an *in-frame deletion*. The resulting protein will be missing one amino acid (Glycine) but will otherwise have a normal sequence. The loss of a single amino acid may or may not eliminate the protein's function, making this outcome less certain than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth the nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) and the frameshift mutation (Mutant 3) are highly likely to produce a non-functional protein and thus eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. However, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a stop codon (`TAA`) at the third position, guaranteeing the production of a tiny, non-functional dipeptide. This is the most direct and certain method among the choices to completely halt the synthesis of the target protein.\n\n<<<A>>>"
