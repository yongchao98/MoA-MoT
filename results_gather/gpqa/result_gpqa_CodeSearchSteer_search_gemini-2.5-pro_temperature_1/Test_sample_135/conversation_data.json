    "This problem requires evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a radial vector field, `∇⋅f`, within a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. The vector field is given by `f(r) = (1/r²) * r̂`, where `r̂` is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\nA direct calculation of the divergence of this field in spherical coordinates yields zero for all points where r is not zero. However, the field is undefined at the origin (r=0), creating a singularity. This singularity means that simply integrating a divergence of zero over the volume would be incorrect.\n\nThe appropriate method to solve this is to use the Divergence Theorem, also known as Gauss's Theorem. This theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux of that field through the closed surface enclosing the volume. The theorem states:\n\n`∫_V (∇ ⋅ f) dV = ∮_S (f ⋅ dS)`\n\nHere, the volume `V` is the sphere of radius R, and the surface `S` is the surface of this sphere.\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n1.  **Vector Field on the Surface:** On the surface of the sphere, the radius `r` is equal to the constant `R`. So, the vector field `f` on the surface is `f(R) = (1/R²) * r̂`.\n2.  **Surface Element:** The differential surface element `dS` on a sphere in spherical coordinates is `dS = R² sin(θ) dθ dφ * r̂`. The direction of this element is also radially outward.\n3.  **Dot Product:** The dot product `f ⋅ dS` is then `[(1/R²) * r̂] ⋅ [R² sin(θ) dθ dφ * r̂]`. Since `r̂ ⋅ r̂ = 1`, the `R²` terms cancel out, leaving `sin(θ) dθ dφ`.\n4.  **Surface Integral:** We integrate this result over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits of integration for the polar angle `θ` are from 0 to π, and for the azimuthal angle `φ` are from 0 to 2π.\n    `∮_S sin(θ) dθ dφ = ∫_0^(2π) dφ ∫_0^π sin(θ) dθ`\n5.  **Evaluation:**\n    *   The integral of `sin(θ)` from 0 to π is `[-cos(θ)]_0^π = -(-1) - (-1) = 2`.\n    *   The integral of `dφ` from 0 to 2π is `[φ]_0^(2π) = 2π`.\n    *   Multiplying these results gives `2 * 2π = 4π`.\n\nThis result, `4π`, is the value of the surface integral, and by the Divergence Theorem, it is also the value of the volume integral of the divergence. The non-zero result confirms that the singularity at the origin acts as a source, and its contribution is captured by the surface integral. The divergence at the origin can be described by the Dirac delta function, such that `∇ ⋅ (r̂/r²) = 4πδ(r)`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
