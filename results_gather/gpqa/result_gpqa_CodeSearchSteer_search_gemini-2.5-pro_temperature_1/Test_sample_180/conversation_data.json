    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the approximate ratio of the neutrino fluxes.\n\n1.  **Identify Neutrino Sources and Energy Branches:** The Sun produces neutrinos through two main processes: the proton-proton (pp) chain and the CNO cycle. The pp chain has several branches.\n    *   **pp-I Branch:** Produces low-energy `pp` neutrinos (< 420 keV). These are outside the energy bands in question.\n    *   **pp-II Branch:** This branch is responsible for producing mono-energetic `7Be` (Beryllium-7) neutrinos. The most prominent line is at 861 keV, which falls squarely into **Band 2 (800-900 keV)**.\n    *   **pp-III Branch:** This branch produces high-energy `8B` (Boron-8) neutrinos, which have a continuous energy spectrum up to about 15 MeV. These neutrinos contribute to the flux in both **Band 1 (700-800 keV)** and **Band 2 (800-900 keV)**.\n    *   **CNO Cycle:** This cycle also produces neutrinos, notably from `13N` and `15O` decays, which have continuous spectra up to about 1.2 MeV and 1.7 MeV, respectively. These contribute a small amount of flux to both energy bands.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hypothetical Scenario:** The question assumes that the **pp-III branch suddenly stopped**.\n    *   This means that the production of `8B` neutrinos ceases completely.\n    *   All other reactions, including the pp-I, pp-II, and CNO cycle, continue as they were.\n\n3.  **Determine the Flux in Each Band *After* the Change:**\n    *   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):** Before the change, the primary source of neutrinos in this energy range was the continuous spectrum of `8B` neutrinos. With the pp-III branch stopped, this source disappears. The only remaining flux comes from the CNO cycle neutrinos (`13N` and `15O`). This CNO flux is known to be very small compared to the main pp-chain fluxes.\n    *   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):** Before the change, this band had contributions from both the continuous `8B` spectrum and the very strong `7Be` line at 861 keV. After the change, the `8B` contribution is gone, but the `7Be` line from the unaffected pp-II branch remains. The flux from this single line is very large and now completely dominates this band.\n\n4.  **Estimate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio of Flux (Band 1) / Flux (Band 2).\n    *   Flux (Band 1) is now just the small contribution from CNO neutrinos.\n    *   Flux (Band 2) is now the very large contribution from `7Be` neutrinos.\n    *   The total flux of `7Be` neutrinos (~5 x 10⁹ cm⁻²s⁻¹) is roughly 100 times greater than the total flux of CNO neutrinos (~5 x 10⁸ cm⁻²s⁻¹).\n    *   Since the `7Be` flux is concentrated in a single energy line within Band 2, while the CNO flux is spread out over a wide energy range, the flux density at the `7Be` peak is vastly higher than the CNO flux density in Band 1.\n    *   Therefore, the ratio of the flux in Band 1 (small, from CNO) to the flux in Band 2 (large, from `7Be`) will be a very small number. The ratio should be on the order of the ratio of the total CNO flux to the total `7Be` flux, which is about 1 to 100.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The ratio of the flux in the first band to the second band is approximately 1/100, or 0.01.\n\nOf the given options:\nA) 1.\nB) 0.01 (10⁻²)\nC) 10.\nD) 0.1 (10⁻¹)\n\nThe most plausible answer is 0.01.\n\n<<<B>>>"
