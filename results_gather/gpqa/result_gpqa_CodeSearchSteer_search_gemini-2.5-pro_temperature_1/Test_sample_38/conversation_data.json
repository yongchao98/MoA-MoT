    "To find the numerical value of \"a\", we must use the normalization condition from quantum mechanics. This condition states that the total probability of finding the particle in the entire space where it can exist must be equal to 1. The probability is found by integrating the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |Ψ(x)|², over the given interval.\n\nThe wave function is given as:\nΨ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the probability density function, |Ψ(x)|²:\n|Ψ(x)|² = [Re(Ψ(x))]² + [Im(Ψ(x))]²\n|Ψ(x)|² = [a / sqrt(1 + x)]² + [-0.5]²\n|Ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\nThe problem states that the particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. Therefore, we must integrate the probability density function from 1 to 3, and this integral must be equal to 1.\n\n∫ [from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nNow, we solve the integral:\n∫ (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = a² * ∫ (1 / (1 + x)) dx + ∫ 0.25 dx\n\nThe integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x).\nThe integral of 0.25 is 0.25x.\n\nSo, the definite integral is:\n[a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25x] evaluated from 1 to 3.\n\nNow, we evaluate at the limits of integration:\nAt x = 3: a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3 = a² * ln(4) + 0.75\nAt x = 1: a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1 = a² * ln(2) + 0.25\n\nSubtract the value at the lower limit from the value at the upper limit:\n(a² * ln(4) + 0.75) - (a² * ln(2) + 0.25)\n= a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + (0.75 - 0.25)\n= a² * ln(4/2) + 0.5\n= a² * ln(2) + 0.5\n\nNow, we set this result equal to 1, as per the normalization condition:\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the approximate value of ln(2) ≈ 0.693:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.693\na² ≈ 0.7215\n\nNow, we take the square root to find 'a':\na ≈ sqrt(0.7215)\na ≈ 0.8494\n\nThis value is closest to the option 0.85.\n\n<<<A>>>"
