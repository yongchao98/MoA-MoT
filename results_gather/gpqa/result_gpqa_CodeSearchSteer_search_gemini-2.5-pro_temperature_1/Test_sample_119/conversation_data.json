    "Here is the step-by-step derivation for the relationship between the number of stars per unit parallax range and the parallax itself, under the assumption of a uniform stellar distribution.\n\n1.  **Uniform Star Distribution**: We begin with the assumption that stars are distributed uniformly throughout space. This means the number of stars per unit volume, known as the stellar density (represented by the Greek letter rho, ρ), is constant.\n\n2.  **Volume and Number of Stars**: The number of stars (N) within a certain distance (d) from an observer can be found by multiplying the stellar density (ρ) by the volume of a sphere with radius d.\n    *   Volume of a sphere: V = (4/3)πd³\n    *   Total number of stars within distance d: N = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³\n\n3.  **Relating Distance to Parallax**: Stellar parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance (d). The relationship is given by:\n    *   d = 1/plx\n    *   Here, distance (d) is measured in parsecs, and parallax (plx) is measured in arcseconds.\n\n4.  **Number of Stars as a Function of Parallax**: We can substitute the expression for distance (d) into our equation for the number of stars (N). This gives us the total number of stars with a parallax *greater than or equal to* a certain value `plx` (since smaller distances correspond to larger parallaxes).\n    *   N(plx) = ρ * (4/3)π * (1/plx)³\n    *   N(plx) = (4/3)πρ / plx³\n\n5.  **Number of Stars per Unit Parallax Range**: The question asks how the number of stars *per unit range of parallax* changes with parallax. This quantity is mathematically represented by the derivative of the number of stars with respect to parallax, dN/d(plx). We need to differentiate our expression for N(plx).\n    *   N(plx) = (4/3)πρ * plx⁻³\n    *   Using the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n    *   dN/d(plx) = (4/3)πρ * (-3) * plx⁻⁴\n    *   dN/d(plx) = -4πρ / plx⁴\n\n6.  **Interpreting the Result**: The negative sign indicates that as parallax increases (i.e., as we look at closer stars), the total cumulative number of stars decreases, which is expected. The magnitude of this rate of change, which represents the number of stars found within a small interval of parallax, is what we are interested in.\n    *   The magnitude is proportional to 1/plx⁴.\n\nTherefore, for a uniform distribution of stars, the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes in proportion to 1/plx⁴.\n\n<<<D>>>"
