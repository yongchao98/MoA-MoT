    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution.\n\n### 1. Verify Molar Masses\nFirst, we confirm the molar masses of the compounds involved.\n*   **KH₂PO₄ (Potassium dihydrogen phosphate):** The provided molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. Searches confirm this value.\n*   **Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (Disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate):** The provided molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. This is also confirmed by search results.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Moles of Each Compound\nThe solution has a total volume of 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.200 L.\n*   **Moles of KH₂PO₄:**\n    Moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 moles\n*   **Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O:**\n    Moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 moles\n\n### 3. Determine the Initial Concentrations of the Buffer Components\nThe primary buffer system consists of the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H₂PO₄⁻), a weak acid, and its conjugate base, the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻).\n*   **Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻:**\n    [H₂PO₄⁻] = Moles of KH₂PO₄ / Volume (L) = 0.007348 mol / 0.200 L = 0.03674 M\n*   **Concentration of HPO₄²⁻:**\n    [HPO₄²⁻] = Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O / Volume (L) = 0.005618 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02809 M\n\n### 4. Calculate the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]\nThe pH of this buffer solution is governed by the second dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄), which has a dissociation constant Ka₂.\n\nH₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻  (Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸)\n\nWe can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation framework to find the [H⁺] concentration:\n\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ( [H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻] )\n[H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * ( 0.03674 M / 0.02809 M )\n[H⁺] = (6.2 x 10⁻⁸) * (1.308)\n[H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n### 5. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion (PO₄³⁻) Concentration\nThe concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is determined by the third dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid, which is described by Ka₃.\n\nHPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻  (Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹²)\n\nWe can rearrange the equilibrium expression for Ka₃ to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n\nKa₃ = ( [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] ) / [HPO₄²⁻]\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ( [HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺] )\n\nNow, we substitute the values we've calculated:\n\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8 x 10⁻¹²) * ( 0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M )\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis result is extremely close to the value in option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
