Understand the Reaction**\n*   **Reactants:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, which is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring. The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source for a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The prompt correctly states the two key rules for this reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack occurs via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which causes an inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material and Site of Attack**\n*   The epoxide ring involves carbons C1 and C6 of the bicyclic system.\n*   **C1** has a methyl group attached, making it a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n*   Comparing the quaternary C1 and the tertiary C6, **C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon**.\n*   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack C6.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Basic Structure (Constitution)**\n*   The attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen remains attached to C1 and, after workup (an implicit step in these problems), becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups: the original ones at C1, C3, and C4, and the new one at C6.\n*   For IUPAC naming, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as the new C1. The adjacent carbon that was attacked (the original C6) becomes the new C2. The original C4 becomes the new C4, and the original C3 becomes the new C5.\n*   The product is therefore a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This constitutional analysis eliminates options A and D, which are named `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` and would result from an incorrect attack at C1. The choice is between B and C.\n\n**4. Determine the Product's Stereochemistry**\n*   The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the site of attack (C6).\n*   The configurations of the other stereocenters (C1, C3, C4) are retained, as no bonds to these chiral centers are broken.\n*   Let's trace the configuration of each center into the product, using the new numbering:\n    *   **New C1 (from original C1):** The configuration is retained. It was **(R)**, so it remains **(1R)**.\n    *   **New C2 (from original C6):** The configuration is inverted. It was **(S)**, so it becomes **(2R)**.\n    *   **New C4 (from original C4):** The configuration is retained. It was **(R)**, so it remains **(4R)**.\n    *   **New C5 (from original C3):** The configuration is retained. It was **(R)**, so it remains **(5R)**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n*   Combining the constitutional name and the stereochemical descriptors, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and the Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a substituted cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source for a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The prompt correctly states the key principles: the nucleophile attacks the less hindered carbon, and the attack proceeds with inversion of configuration (an Sₙ2-type mechanism).\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6.\n*   We must assess the steric hindrance at each carbon:\n    *   **C1** is bonded to a methyl group, as well as C2, C6, and the epoxide oxygen. It is a **quaternary** carbon.\n    *   **C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, as well as C1, C5, and the epoxide oxygen. It is a **tertiary** carbon.\n*   Comparing a quaternary carbon to a tertiary carbon, **C6 is the less sterically hindered** position.\n*   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack C6.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Constitution and IUPAC Name**\n*   The attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group after workup.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups: the original ones at C1, C3, and C4, and a new one at C6.\n*   For IUPAC naming, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) is designated as the new C1. This corresponds to the original C1.\n*   To give the substituents the lowest possible numbers (locants), we number the ring such that the original C6 becomes the new C2. The original C4 becomes the new C4, and the original C3 becomes the new C5.\n*   The resulting substitution pattern is 1, 2, 4, 5. The base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This analysis eliminates options A and C, which have a `2,2,4,5-` substitution pattern that would result from an attack at C1. The choice is between B and D.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n*   The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon that is attacked (C6) and **retention of configuration** at the other stereocenters (C1, C3, C4).\n*   Let's trace the configuration of each stereocenter from the starting material, (1R,3R,4R,6S), to the product:\n    *   **New C1 (from original C1):** The configuration is retained. It was **R**, so it remains **1R**.\n    *   **New C2 (from original C6):** The configuration is inverted. It was **S**, so it becomes **2R**.\n    *   **New C4 (from original C4):** The configuration is retained. It was **R**, so it remains **4R**.\n    *   **New C5 (from original C3):** The configuration is retained. It was **R**, so it remains **5R**.\n*   Combining these, the full stereochemical descriptor for the product is **(1R, 2R, 4R, 5R)**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\nThe final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction Type and Reagents:**\n    *   The reaction is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n    *   The substrate is `(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`. This is a substituted cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6.\n    *   The reagent is `Me₂CuLi` (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It provides a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n\n2.  **Determine the Regioselectivity (Where the attack happens):**\n    *   The problem states a key rule: \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\" This is the standard outcome for organocuprates reacting with epoxides (an Sₙ2-type reaction).\n    *   The two carbons of the epoxide are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 has a methyl group attached, making it a quaternary carbon (more hindered).\n    *   C6 has only a hydrogen atom attached (besides the ring carbons), making it a tertiary carbon (less hindered).\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product's Constitution (Connectivity):**\n    *   The attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen remains attached to C1 and is protonated during workup to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups: the original ones at C1, C3, and C4, and a new one at C6.\n    *   For IUPAC naming, the carbon with the -OH group is numbered as C1. The adjacent carbon with the new methyl group (the original C6) becomes C2. The other methyl groups fall at positions 4 and 5.\n    *   The product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This structural name eliminates options A and D, which are `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` (resulting from an attack at C1).\n\n4.  **Determine the Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The problem states: \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\" This is the hallmark of an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   The attack occurs at C6, which has an initial configuration of **(S)**. The inversion of configuration means this center will become **(R)** in the product.\n    *   The stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) retain their original configurations.\n    *   Let's map the stereochemistry to the final product's numbering:\n        *   **New C1 (from original C1):** Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n        *   **New C2 (from original C6):** Configuration inverts from (S) to **(R)**.\n        *   **New C4 (from original C4):** Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n        *   **New C5 (from original C3):** Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n    *   This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. There are methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4. The stereochemistry at these four chiral centers is specified.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. This reagent acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (CH₃⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The question provides the key rules for this reaction with organocuprates.\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Where the Nucleophile Attacks)**\n*   The problem states that \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n*   The epoxide ring involves carbons C1 and C6.\n*   Carbon C1 has a methyl group attached, making it a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   Carbon C6 is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n*   Comparing the quaternary C1 and the tertiary C6, **C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon**.\n*   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group from Me₂CuLi will attack C6.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Constitution (Which atoms are connected)**\n*   The attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1.\n*   After an aqueous workup (an implicit step in these reactions), the oxygen is protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol. It has the original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, and a new methyl group at C6.\n*   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) is numbered C1. This is the original C1.\n*   The ring is then numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. The new methyl group is on the adjacent carbon (the original C6), which becomes C2. The original C4 becomes the new C4, and the original C3 becomes the new C5.\n*   The product has methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This analysis eliminates options C and D, which are named `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`. These would result from an attack at the more hindered C1, which is incorrect.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n*   The problem states that \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\" This is characteristic of an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   The stereocenters that are not part of the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) will retain their original configuration.\n*   Let's trace the configuration of each stereocenter:\n    *   **C1 → New C1:** The configuration is retained. It was **R**, so it remains **1R**.\n    *   **C6 → New C2:** This is the site of attack, so its configuration is inverted.

Final Conclusion**\n*   Combining the constitutional name and the stereochemistry, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product.\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction**\nThe reaction is between a substituted epoxide, (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, and an organocuprate reagent, Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate). This is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The key principles, as stated in the prompt, are:\n*   **Regioselectivity**: The nucleophile (methyl group, Me⁻) attacks the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide.\n*   **Stereoselectivity**: The attack is an Sₙ2 reaction, which proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material**\n*   **Structure**: The name `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across the C1-C6 bond.\n*   **Substituents**: There are methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Epoxide Carbons**: The two carbons of the epoxide are C1 and C6.\n*   **Steric Hindrance**:\n    *   C1 has a methyl group attached, making it a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 has only a hydrogen atom attached, making it a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n    *   Comparing the quaternary C1 and the tertiary C6, **C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon**.\n\n**3. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\nBased on the principle of attacking the less hindered carbon, the methyl nucleophile from Me₂CuLi will attack **C6**. This attack breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen remains attached to C1 and is protonated during workup to form an alcohol (-OH).\n\n**4. Determine the Product's Constitution and IUPAC Name**\n*   The attack at C6 places a new methyl group on that carbon. The -OH group forms at C1.\n*   The resulting product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.\n*   For IUPAC naming, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as C1. This corresponds to the original C1.\n*   To give the substituents the lowest possible numbers (locants), we number the ring counter-clockwise. The original C6 (now with a new methyl group) becomes C2. The original C4 becomes C4, and the original C3 becomes C5.\n*   The methyl groups are at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   Therefore, the base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This immediately eliminates options A and D, which have the base name `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` (implying attack at C1).\n\n**5. Determine the Product's Stereochemistry**\n*   The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the attacked center (C6) and retention of configuration at the other centers (C1, C3, C4).\n*   Let's trace the stereochemistry from the starting material: **(1R, 3R, 4R, 6S)**.\n*   **At C1**: The configuration is retained. It was **R**, so it remains **R** in the product (new C1).\n*   **At C6**: The configuration is inverted. It was **S**, so it becomes **R** in the product (new C2).\n*   **At C4**: The configuration is retained. It was **R**, so it remains **R** in the product (new C4).\n*   **At C3**: The configuration is retained. It was **R**, so it remains **R** in the product (new C5).\n*   Combining these, the full stereochemical descriptor for the product is **(1R, 2R, 4R, 5R)**.\n\n**6.

Determine the Product's Constitution**\n\n*   The attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring. The oxygen remains attached to C1 and becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group after workup.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.\n*   According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) is numbered C1. This corresponds to the original C1.\n*   The ring is numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. The new methyl group is on the adjacent carbon (the original C6), which becomes C2. The other methyl groups are at positions 4 and 5.\n*   The product's base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This immediately eliminates options B and D, which have a `2,2,4,5-tetramethyl...` substitution pattern that would result from an attack at the more hindered C1.\n\n**4. Determine the Product's Stereochemistry**\n\nWe need to determine the configuration (R or S) of the four stereocenters in the product (C1, C2, C4, C5).\n\n*   **Unaffected Centers:** The stereocenters not directly involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4 of the starting material) retain their absolute spatial arrangement.\n    *   The configuration at the original C1 remains **R**. In the product, this is **1R**.\n    *   The configuration at the original C4 remains **R**. In the product, this is **4R**.\n    *   The configuration at the original C3 remains **R**. In the product, this becomes C5, so it is **5R**.\n\n*   **Inverted Center:** The reaction occurs at C6 with inversion of configuration.\n    *   The starting configuration at C6 is **S**.\n    *   The Sₙ2 attack inverts the stereocenter. A detailed analysis confirms that the inversion of the (6S) center results in a **(2R)** center in the product. The simple mnemonic (S → R) holds true in this case.\n\n**5.

Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by carbons C1 and C6.\n*   Carbon C1 is substituted with a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   Carbon C6 is substituted with a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n*   Comparing the steric hindrance of a quaternary carbon versus a tertiary carbon, **C6 is the less hindered position**.\n*   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack C6.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Constitution**\n*   The attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and, after an acidic workup (implicit in these reactions), becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.\n*   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated C1. The adjacent carbon that was attacked (the original C6) becomes C2. The other methyl groups are on the original C3 and C4, which become C5 and C4 in the new numbering scheme.\n*   The product's base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This constitutional analysis eliminates options B and D, which are named `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`.

Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Mechanism**\n\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across the C1-C6 bond.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which provides a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The prompt correctly states the two key rules for this reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which causes an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.\n\n**2. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6.\n*   **C1** is substituted with a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **C6** is substituted with a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n*   Comparing the quaternary C1 and the tertiary C6, **C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon**. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack C6.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemical Outcome**\n\nThis is the most critical and subtle part of the problem.\n\n*   The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at C6. The starting configuration at C6 is **(S)**.\n*   A common mistake is to assume that an (S) center automatically inverts to an (R) center. This is only true if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents do not change their relative order. In this case, the leaving group (the epoxide oxygen, priority #1) is replaced by an incoming methyl group (which will have a lower priority). This change requires a careful 3D analysis rather than a simple letter-swap.\n*   **3D Analysis:**\n    1.  Let's establish the 3D structure of the starting material. To satisfy the given stereochemistry (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S), a consistent model places the epoxide on the α-face (pointing \"down\") and the methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 on the β-face (pointing \"up\"). The hydrogen at C6 is also on the β-face.\n    2.  The C6-O bond is on the α-face (\"down\"). The Sₙ2 attack must occur from the opposite side, which is the β-face (\"up\").\n    3.  The incoming methyl group attacks from the β-face. The inversion at C6 pushes the original β-hydrogen to the α-face (\"down\").\n    4.  Now, let's assign the configuration to the product's C2 center (which was the original C6). It has a new methyl group on the β-face (\"up\") and a hydrogen on the α-face (\"down\").\n    5.  The CIP priorities for the groups attached to this carbon are: C1(-OH) > C3(-CH₂) > Methyl > Hydrogen.\n    6.  With the lowest priority group (Hydrogen) pointing away from the viewer (α-face, \"down\"), we trace the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3: C1 → C3 → Methyl. This path is counter-clockwise.\n    7.  A counter-clockwise path with the lowest priority group in the back corresponds to an **(S)** configuration.\n*   Therefore, the inversion of the (6S) center results in a **(2S)** configuration in the product.\n\n**4. Assemble the Final Product**\n\n*   **Product Skeleton:** The attack at C6 produces a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   **C1:** The configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n    *   **C2 (from C6):** The configuration inverts from (S) to **(S)** (as determined by the 3D analysis).\n    *   **C4 (from C4):** The configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n    *   **C5 (from C3):** The configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n*   The full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nComparing the derived product with the options:\nA) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nB) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nC) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nD) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nThe correct product matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product for the given reaction.\n\n**1. Analysis of Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source for a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The prompt specifies the key rules for this reaction with organocuprates.\n\n**2. Regioselectivity: Determining the Site of Attack**\n*   The first crucial point is to identify where the nucleophile will attack. The rule states that organocuprates attack the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide ring.\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide are C1 and C6.\n    *   **C1** is bonded to a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon (more hindered).\n    *   **C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon (less hindered).\n*   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile will attack **C6**.\n*   This attack opens the ring, placing a new methyl group on the original C6 and forming a hydroxyl (-OH) group on the original C1 after workup.\n*   The resulting product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This constitutional structure immediately eliminates options B and D, which are named as `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` and would result from an attack on the more hindered C1.\n\n**3. Stereochemistry: Determining the 3D Arrangement**\n*   The second crucial point is the stereochemical outcome. The reaction proceeds via an **Sₙ2 mechanism**, which results in an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.\n*   **Unaffected Centers:** The stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) retain their absolute configurations. In the re-numbered product, these will be **1R**, **4R**, and **5R** (from the original 3R).\n*   **Inversion at the Reaction Center:** The attack occurs at C6, which has an initial configuration of **(S)**. The Sₙ2 attack causes a geometric inversion at this center.\n*   **The Critical Point - Assigning the New Label:** We must carefully determine the R/S label for the new stereocenter (C2 in the product) after the geometric inversion. A simple assumption that \"S inverts to R\" can be misleading if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change.\n    *   A detailed 3D analysis of the product shows that the geometric inversion of the (6S) center results in a new center with an **(S)** configuration. The priorities of the groups attached to this carbon (C1(OH) > C5(CH2) > Methyl > H) and their new spatial arrangement after inversion lead to an (S) designation.\n\n**4. Final Product Assembly**\n*   **Constitution:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   C1: **R** (retained)\n    *   C2: **S** (from inversion of 6S)\n    *   C4: **R** (retained)\n    *   C5: **R** (retained from original 3R)\n*   The full name of the final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis name and stereochemistry exactly match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and the Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This name describes a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide. The epoxide involves carbons C1 and C6. There are methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source for a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The prompt specifies the rules for this reaction: the nucleophile attacks the less hindered carbon, and the attack causes an inversion of stereochemistry at that carbon. This is characteristic of an Sₙ2 reaction.\n\n**2. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6.\n*   Carbon C1 has a methyl group attached, making it a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   Carbon C6 is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n*   Comparing the quaternary C1 and the tertiary C6, **C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon**.\n*   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack C6.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Connectivity and IUPAC Name**\n*   The attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and is protonated during workup to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups: the original ones at C1, C3, and C4, and a new one at C6.\n*   For IUPAC naming, the carbon with the -OH group is assigned the lowest number, so the original C1 becomes the new C1. To give the other substituents the lowest possible numbers, the ring is numbered such that the original C6 becomes the new C2.\n*   The methyl groups are therefore located at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   The base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This immediately eliminates options B and D, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol) that would result from an attack at the more hindered C1.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n*   The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon that is attacked (C6).\n*   The stereocenters that are not attacked (C1, C3, C4) retain their original configuration.\n*   Let's trace the configuration of each stereocenter into the product, using the new numbering:\n    *   **New C1 (from original C1):** The configuration is retained. It was **(R)** and remains **(1R)**.\n    *   **New C2 (from original C6):** The configuration is inverted. It was **(S)** and becomes **(2R)**.\n    *   **New C4 (from original C4):** The configuration is retained. It was **(R)** and remains **(4R)**.\n    *   **New C5 (from original C3):** The configuration is retained. It was **(R)** and remains **(5R)**.\n*   Combining these, the full stereochemical name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n*   The predicted product is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n*   Comparing this to the remaining options:\n    *   A) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n    *   C) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   The calculated product perfectly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nBased on the provided candidate answers and a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction, here is the breakdown to determine the final product.\n\n### Analysis of the Reaction\n\n1.  **Reactants and Reaction Type**:\n    *   **Substrate**: (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.

The product's base name will be a `1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`, which eliminates options A and D.\n\n3.  **Stereoselectivity (The 3D Outcome)**:\n    *   The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which involves a \"backside attack\".\n    *   This backside attack results in an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.\n    *   The attack occurs at C6, which has a starting configuration of **(S)**.\n    *   The inversion changes the configuration at this center to **(R)**.\n    *   The other stereocenters (C1, C3, and C4) are not directly involved in the bond-breaking/forming steps of the attack, so their configurations are retained.\n\n4.  **Assembling the Final Product Name**:\n    *   We must re-number the product according to IUPAC rules, where the carbon with the -OH group is C1.\n    *   **New C1 (from original C1)**: Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n    *   **New C2 (from original C6)**: Configuration is inverted from (S) to **(R)**.\n    *   **New C4 (from original C4)**: Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n    *   **New C5 (from original C3)**: Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**:\n    *   The full IUPAC name for the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n    *   Comparing this to the given options:\n        *   A) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n        *   B) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n        *   C) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n        *   D) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nThe derived product name and stereochemistry perfectly match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants and the Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4. The stereochemistry at each chiral center is explicitly given.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The problem provides the key rules for this reaction with organocuprates.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n*   The first rule given is that the nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide are C1 and C6.\n*   C1 is substituted with a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   C6 is substituted with a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n*   Comparing a quaternary carbon to a tertiary carbon, **C6 is the less hindered site**.\n*   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile from Me₂CuLi will attack carbon C6.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Product's Constitution (Connectivity)**\n*   The attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and, after an aqueous workup (an implicit step in these reactions), becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol derivative with four methyl groups.\n*   For IUPAC naming, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) is numbered C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the starting material.\n*   To give the substituents the lowest possible numbers (locants), the ring is numbered such that the adjacent carbon where the new methyl group was added (original C6) becomes C2.\n*   The original methyl groups at C3 and C4 become substituents at C5 and C4, respectively, in the new numbering scheme.\n*   Therefore, the product has methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This analysis eliminates options A and D, which are named as `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`, as this would imply the attack happened at C1.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n*   The second rule given is that the reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon to which the nucleophile is added. This is characteristic of an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   The stereocenters that are not directly involved in the bond-breaking/bond-forming step retain their original configuration.\n*   Let's trace the configuration of each stereocenter:\n    *   **New C1 (from original C1):** This center is not attacked. Its configuration is retained. It was **(R)**, so it remains **(1R)**.\n    *   **New C2 (from original C6):** This is the site of nucleophilic attack. Its configuration is inverted. It was **(S)**, so it becomes **(2R)**.\n    *   **New C4 (from original C4):** This center is not attacked. Its configuration is retained. It was **(R)**, so it remains **(4R)**.\n    *   **New C5 (from original C3):** This center is not attacked. Its configuration is retained.

There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source for a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n*   A fundamental rule for the reaction of organocuprates with saturated epoxides is that the nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide ring.\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide are C1 and C6.\n    *   **C1** is substituted with a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (more hindered).\n    *   **C6** is substituted with a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon (less hindered).\n*   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereoselectivity (Stereochemical Outcome)**\n*   The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism. This involves a \"backside attack\" where the nucleophile approaches from the side opposite the C-O bond.\n*   This mechanism results in an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n*   The initial configuration at the site of attack, C6, is given as **(S)**. Due to the inversion, the configuration at this carbon in the product will become **(R)**.\n*   The stereocenters that are not directly attacked (C1, C3, and C4) retain their original configurations. They remain **(R)**, **(R)**, and **(R)**, respectively.\n\n**4. Determine the Product's Structure and IUPAC Name**\n*   The attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and, after a standard aqueous workup, is protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol ring with four methyl groups.\n*   For IUPAC naming, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) is assigned the lowest number, so the original C1 becomes the **new C1**.\n*   To give the substituents the lowest possible locants, the ring is numbered such that the original C6 becomes the **new C2**. The original C4 becomes the **new C4**, and the original C3 becomes the **new C5**.\n*   The resulting product has a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol** skeleton. This structural name eliminates options A and B.\n\n**5. Assemble the Final Stereochemistry**\n*   **New C1** (from original C1): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n*   **New C2** (from original C6): Configuration is inverted from (S) to **(R)**.\n*   **New C4** (from original C4): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n*   **New C5** (from original C3): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nCombining the structural name and the stereochemical descriptors, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

Understand the Reaction**\n*   **Reactants:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, which is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring. The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source for a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The prompt correctly states the two key rules for this reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack occurs via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which causes an inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material and Site of Attack**\n*   The epoxide ring involves carbons C1 and C6 of the bicyclic system.\n*   **C1** has a methyl group attached, making it a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n*   Comparing the quaternary C1 and the tertiary C6, **C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon**.\n*   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack C6.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Basic Structure (Constitution)**\n*   The attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen remains attached to C1 and, after workup (an implicit step in these problems), becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups: the original ones at C1, C3, and C4, and the new one at C6.\n*   For IUPAC naming, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as the new C1. The adjacent carbon that was attacked (the original C6) becomes the new C2. The original C4 becomes the new C4, and the original C3 becomes the new C5.\n*   The product is therefore a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This constitutional analysis eliminates options A and D, which are named `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` and would result from an incorrect attack at C1. The choice is between B and C.\n\n**4. Determine the Product's Stereochemistry**\n*   The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the site of attack (C6).\n*   The configurations of the other stereocenters (C1, C3, C4) are retained, as no bonds to these chiral centers are broken.\n*   Let's trace the configuration of each center into the product, using the new numbering:\n    *   **New C1 (from original C1):** The configuration is retained. It was **(R)**, so it remains **(1R)**.\n    *   **New C2 (from original C6):** The configuration is inverted. It was **(S)**, so it becomes **(2R)**.\n    *   **New C4 (from original C4):** The configuration is retained. It was **(R)**, so it remains **(4R)**.\n    *   **New C5 (from original C3):** The configuration is retained. It was **(R)**, so it remains **(5R)**.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n*   Combining the constitutional name and the stereochemical descriptors, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product.\n\n**1.

It acts as a source for a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The prompt correctly states the key principles: the nucleophile attacks the less hindered carbon, and the attack proceeds with inversion of configuration (an Sₙ2-type mechanism).\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6.\n*   We must assess the steric hindrance at each carbon:\n    *   **C1** is bonded to a methyl group, as well as C2, C6, and the epoxide oxygen. It is a **quaternary** carbon.\n    *   **C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, as well as C1, C5, and the epoxide oxygen. It is a **tertiary** carbon.\n*   Comparing a quaternary carbon to a tertiary carbon, **C6 is the less sterically hindered** position.\n*   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack C6.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Constitution and IUPAC Name**\n*   The attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group after workup.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups: the original ones at C1, C3, and C4, and a new one at C6.\n*   For IUPAC naming, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) is designated as the new C1. This corresponds to the original C1.\n*   To give the substituents the lowest possible numbers (locants), we number the ring such that the original C6 becomes the new C2. The original C4 becomes the new C4, and the original C3 becomes the new C5.\n*   The resulting substitution pattern is 1, 2, 4, 5. The base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This analysis eliminates options A and C, which have a `2,2,4,5-` substitution pattern that would result from an attack at C1. The choice is between B and D.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n*   The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon that is attacked (C6) and **retention of configuration** at the other stereocenters (C1, C3, C4).\n*   Let's trace the configuration of each stereocenter from the starting material, (1R,3R,4R,6S), to the product:\n    *   **New C1 (from original C1):** The configuration is retained. It was **R**, so it remains **1R**.\n    *   **New C2 (from original C6):** The configuration is inverted. It was **S**, so it becomes **2R**.\n    *   **New C4 (from original C4):** The configuration is retained. It was **R**, so it remains **4R**.\n    *   **New C5 (from original C3):** The configuration is retained. It was **R**, so it remains **5R**.\n*   Combining these, the full stereochemical descriptor for the product is **(1R, 2R, 4R, 5R)**.\n\n**5.

It provides a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n\n2.  **Determine the Regioselectivity (Where the attack happens):**\n    *   The problem states a key rule: \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\" This is the standard outcome for organocuprates reacting with epoxides (an Sₙ2-type reaction).\n    *   The two carbons of the epoxide are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 has a methyl group attached, making it a quaternary carbon (more hindered).\n    *   C6 has only a hydrogen atom attached (besides the ring carbons), making it a tertiary carbon (less hindered).\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Product's Constitution (Connectivity):**\n    *   The attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen remains attached to C1 and is protonated during workup to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups: the original ones at C1, C3, and C4, and a new one at C6.\n    *   For IUPAC naming, the carbon with the -OH group is numbered as C1.

Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. There are methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4. The stereochemistry at these four chiral centers is specified.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. This reagent acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (CH₃⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The question provides the key rules for this reaction with organocuprates.\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Where the Nucleophile Attacks)**\n*   The problem states that \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n*   The epoxide ring involves carbons C1 and C6.\n*   Carbon C1 has a methyl group attached, making it a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   Carbon C6 is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n*   Comparing the quaternary C1 and the tertiary C6, **C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon**.\n*   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group from Me₂CuLi will attack C6.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Constitution (Which atoms are connected)**\n*   The attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1.\n*   After an aqueous workup (an implicit step in these reactions), the oxygen is protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol. It has the original methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4, and a new methyl group at C6.\n*   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) is numbered C1. This is the original C1.\n*   The ring is then numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. The new methyl group is on the adjacent carbon (the original C6), which becomes C2. The original C4 becomes the new C4, and the original C3 becomes the new C5.\n*   The product has methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This analysis eliminates options C and D, which are named `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`. These would result from an attack at the more hindered C1, which is incorrect.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n*   The problem states that \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\" This is characteristic of an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   The stereocenters that are not part of the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) will retain their original configuration.\n*   Let's trace the configuration of each stereocenter:\n    *   **C1 → New C1:** The configuration is retained. It was **R**, so it remains **1R**.\n    *   **C6 → New C2:** This is the site of attack, so its configuration is inverted.

Final Conclusion**\n*   Combining the constitutional name and the stereochemistry, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product.\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction**\nThe reaction is between a substituted epoxide, (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, and an organocuprate reagent, Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate). This is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The key principles, as stated in the prompt, are:\n*   **Regioselectivity**: The nucleophile (methyl group, Me⁻) attacks the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide.\n*   **Stereoselectivity**: The attack is an Sₙ2 reaction, which proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material**\n*   **Structure**: The name `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane` describes a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across the C1-C6 bond.\n*   **Substituents**: There are methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Epoxide Carbons**: The two carbons of the epoxide are C1 and C6.\n*   **Steric Hindrance**:\n    *   C1 has a methyl group attached, making it a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n    *   C6 has only a hydrogen atom attached, making it a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n    *   Comparing the quaternary C1 and the tertiary C6, **C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon**.\n\n**3. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\nBased on the principle of attacking the less hindered carbon, the methyl nucleophile from Me₂CuLi will attack **C6**. This attack breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen remains attached to C1 and is protonated during workup to form an alcohol (-OH).\n\n**4. Determine the Product's Constitution and IUPAC Name**\n*   The attack at C6 places a new methyl group on that carbon. The -OH group forms at C1.\n*   The resulting product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.\n*   For IUPAC naming, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as C1. This corresponds to the original C1.\n*   To give the substituents the lowest possible numbers (locants), we number the ring counter-clockwise. The original C6 (now with a new methyl group) becomes C2. The original C4 becomes C4, and the original C3 becomes C5.\n*   The methyl groups are at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   Therefore, the base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This immediately eliminates options A and D, which have the base name `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` (implying attack at C1).\n\n**5. Determine the Product's Stereochemistry**\n*   The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the attacked center (C6) and retention of configuration at the other centers (C1, C3, C4).\n*   Let's trace the stereochemistry from the starting material: **(1R, 3R, 4R, 6S)**.\n*   **At C1**: The configuration is retained. It was **R**, so it remains **R** in the product (new C1).\n*   **At C6**: The configuration is inverted. It was **S**, so it becomes **R** in the product (new C2).\n*   **At C4**: The configuration is retained. It was **R**, so it remains **R** in the product (new C4).\n*   **At C3**: The configuration is retained. It was **R**, so it remains **R** in the product (new C5).\n*   Combining these, the full stereochemical descriptor for the product is **(1R, 2R, 4R, 5R)**.\n\n**6. Final Conclusion**\nThe final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product for the given reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. This provides a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The problem describes the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate. The provided rules are:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack occurs with inversion of configuration at the attacked carbon (an Sₙ2 mechanism).\n\n**2. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6.\n*   **C1** is substituted with a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **C6** is substituted with a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n*   Comparing the quaternary C1 and the tertiary C6, **C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon**.\n*   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group from Me₂CuLi will attack C6.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Constitution**\n\n*   The attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring. The oxygen remains attached to C1 and becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group after workup.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.\n*   According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) is numbered C1. This corresponds to the original C1.\n*   The ring is numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. The new methyl group is on the adjacent carbon (the original C6), which becomes C2. The other methyl groups are at positions 4 and 5.\n*   The product's base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This immediately eliminates options B and D, which have a `2,2,4,5-tetramethyl...` substitution pattern that would result from an attack at the more hindered C1.\n\n**4. Determine the Product's Stereochemistry**\n\nWe need to determine the configuration (R or S) of the four stereocenters in the product (C1, C2, C4, C5).\n\n*   **Unaffected Centers:** The stereocenters not directly involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4 of the starting material) retain their absolute spatial arrangement.\n    *   The configuration at the original C1 remains **R**. In the product, this is **1R**.\n    *   The configuration at the original C4 remains **R**. In the product, this is **4R**.\n    *   The configuration at the original C3 remains **R**. In the product, this becomes C5, so it is **5R**.\n\n*   **Inverted Center:** The reaction occurs at C6 with inversion of configuration.\n    *   The starting configuration at C6 is **S**.\n    *   The Sₙ2 attack inverts the stereocenter. A detailed analysis confirms that the inversion of the (6S) center results in a **(2R)** center in the product. The simple mnemonic (S → R) holds true in this case.\n\n**5. Assemble the Final Product Name**\n\n*   **Constitution:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   **Stereochemistry:** (1R, 2R, 4R, 5R)\n*   **Full Name:** (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\n**6.

This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The prompt correctly states the rules for this reaction: the nucleophile attacks the less hindered carbon, and the attack proceeds with inversion of configuration (an Sₙ2-type mechanism).\n\n**2. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n*   The epoxide ring is formed by carbons C1 and C6.\n*   Carbon C1 is substituted with a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   Carbon C6 is substituted with a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n*   Comparing the steric hindrance of a quaternary carbon versus a tertiary carbon, **C6 is the less hindered position**.\n*   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack C6.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Constitution**\n*   The attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and, after an acidic workup (implicit in these reactions), becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.\n*   To name the product according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated C1. The adjacent carbon that was attacked (the original C6) becomes C2. The other methyl groups are on the original C3 and C4, which become C5 and C4 in the new numbering scheme.\n*   The product's base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This constitutional analysis eliminates options B and D, which are named `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`. These would result from an attack at the more hindered C1, which is incorrect.\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n*   The reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon that is attacked (C6).\n*   The stereocenters that are not directly involved in the bond-breaking/forming step (C1, C3, C4) **retain their original configuration**.\n*   Let's trace the stereochemistry from the starting material: (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S).\n    *   **Configuration at C1:** Retained. It was **R**, so it remains **1R** in the product.\n    *   **Configuration at C6 (new C2):** Inverted. It was **S**, so it becomes **2R** in the product.\n    *   **Configuration at C4 (new C4):** Retained. It was **R**, so it remains **4R** in the product.\n    *   **Configuration at C3 (new C5):** Retained. It was **R**, so it remains **5R** in the product.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n*   Combining the constitutional name and the stereochemical descriptors, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Mechanism**\n\n*   **Substrate:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across the C1-C6 bond.\n*   **Reagent:** Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which provides a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The prompt correctly states the two key rules for this reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity:** The nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity:** The attack proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which causes an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.\n\n**2. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6.\n*   **C1** is substituted with a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   **C6** is substituted with a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n*   Comparing the quaternary C1 and the tertiary C6, **C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon**. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack C6.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereochemical Outcome**\n\nThis is the most critical and subtle part of the problem.\n\n*   The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at C6. The starting configuration at C6 is **(S)**.\n*   A common mistake is to assume that an (S) center automatically inverts to an (R) center. This is only true if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents do not change their relative order. In this case, the leaving group (the epoxide oxygen, priority #1) is replaced by an incoming methyl group (which will have a lower priority). This change requires a careful 3D analysis rather than a simple letter-swap.\n*   **3D Analysis:**\n    1.  Let's establish the 3D structure of the starting material. To satisfy the given stereochemistry (1R, 3R, 4R, 6S), a consistent model places the epoxide on the α-face (pointing \"down\") and the methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4 on the β-face (pointing \"up\"). The hydrogen at C6 is also on the β-face.\n    2.  The C6-O bond is on the α-face (\"down\"). The Sₙ2 attack must occur from the opposite side, which is the β-face (\"up\").\n    3.  The incoming methyl group attacks from the β-face. The inversion at C6 pushes the original β-hydrogen to the α-face (\"down\").\n    4.  Now, let's assign the configuration to the product's C2 center (which was the original C6). It has a new methyl group on the β-face (\"up\") and a hydrogen on the α-face (\"down\").\n    5.  The CIP priorities for the groups attached to this carbon are: C1(-OH) > C3(-CH₂) > Methyl > Hydrogen.\n    6.  With the lowest priority group (Hydrogen) pointing away from the viewer (α-face, \"down\"), we trace the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3: C1 → C3 → Methyl. This path is counter-clockwise.\n    7.  A counter-clockwise path with the lowest priority group in the back corresponds to an **(S)** configuration.\n*   Therefore, the inversion of the (6S) center results in a **(2S)** configuration in the product.\n\n**4. Assemble the Final Product**\n\n*   **Product Skeleton:** The attack at C6 produces a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   **C1:** The configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n    *   **C2 (from C6):** The configuration inverts from (S) to **(S)** (as determined by the 3D analysis).\n    *   **C4 (from C4):** The configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n    *   **C5 (from C3):** The configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n*   The full name of the product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n**5.

Analysis of Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source for a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The prompt specifies the key rules for this reaction with organocuprates.\n\n**2. Regioselectivity: Determining the Site of Attack**\n*   The first crucial point is to identify where the nucleophile will attack. The rule states that organocuprates attack the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide ring.\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide are C1 and C6.\n    *   **C1** is bonded to a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon (more hindered).\n    *   **C6** is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon (less hindered).\n*   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile will attack **C6**.\n*   This attack opens the ring, placing a new methyl group on the original C6 and forming a hydroxyl (-OH) group on the original C1 after workup.\n*   The resulting product is a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This constitutional structure immediately eliminates options B and D, which are named as `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol` and would result from an attack on the more hindered C1.\n\n**3. Stereochemistry: Determining the 3D Arrangement**\n*   The second crucial point is the stereochemical outcome. The reaction proceeds via an **Sₙ2 mechanism**, which results in an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon being attacked.\n*   **Unaffected Centers:** The stereocenters not involved in the reaction (C1, C3, and C4) retain their absolute configurations. In the re-numbered product, these will be **1R**, **4R**, and **5R** (from the original 3R).\n*   **Inversion at the Reaction Center:** The attack occurs at C6, which has an initial configuration of **(S)**. The Sₙ2 attack causes a geometric inversion at this center.\n*   **The Critical Point - Assigning the New Label:** We must carefully determine the R/S label for the new stereocenter (C2 in the product) after the geometric inversion. A simple assumption that \"S inverts to R\" can be misleading if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change.\n    *   A detailed 3D analysis of the product shows that the geometric inversion of the (6S) center results in a new center with an **(S)** configuration. The priorities of the groups attached to this carbon (C1(OH) > C5(CH2) > Methyl > H) and their new spatial arrangement after inversion lead to an (S) designation.\n\n**4. Final Product Assembly**\n*   **Constitution:** 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   C1: **R** (retained)\n    *   C2: **S** (from inversion of 6S)\n    *   C4: **R** (retained)\n    *   C5: **R** (retained from original 3R)\n*   The full name of the final product is **(1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis name and stereochemistry exactly match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product.\n\n**1.

There are methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source for a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The prompt specifies the rules for this reaction: the nucleophile attacks the less hindered carbon, and the attack causes an inversion of stereochemistry at that carbon. This is characteristic of an Sₙ2 reaction.\n\n**2. Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6.\n*   Carbon C1 has a methyl group attached, making it a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   Carbon C6 is bonded to a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n*   Comparing the quaternary C1 and the tertiary C6, **C6 is the less sterically hindered carbon**.\n*   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack C6.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Connectivity and IUPAC Name**\n*   The attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and is protonated during workup to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups: the original ones at C1, C3, and C4, and a new one at C6.\n*   For IUPAC naming, the carbon with the -OH group is assigned the lowest number, so the original C1 becomes the new C1. To give the other substituents the lowest possible numbers, the ring is numbered such that the original C6 becomes the new C2.\n*   The methyl groups are therefore located at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n*   The base name of the product is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This immediately eliminates options B and D, which have a different substitution pattern (2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol) that would result from an attack at the more hindered C1.\n\n**4.

It was **(S)** and becomes **(2R)**.\n    *   **New C4 (from original C4):** The configuration is retained. It was **(R)** and remains **(4R)**.\n    *   **New C5 (from original C3):** The configuration is retained.

This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4. The stereochemistry at each chiral center is explicitly given.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent. It acts as a source of a soft nucleophile, the methyl anion (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide. The problem provides the key rules for this reaction with organocuprates.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n*   The first rule given is that the nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered carbon** of the epoxide ring.\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide are C1 and C6.\n*   C1 is substituted with a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon (bonded to O, C2, C6, and a methyl group).\n*   C6 is substituted with a hydrogen atom, making it a tertiary carbon (bonded to O, C1, C5, and a hydrogen).\n*   Comparing a quaternary carbon to a tertiary carbon, **C6 is the less hindered site**.\n*   Therefore, the methyl nucleophile from Me₂CuLi will attack carbon C6.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Product's Constitution (Connectivity)**\n*   The attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and, after an aqueous workup (an implicit step in these reactions), becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol derivative with four methyl groups.\n*   For IUPAC naming, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) is numbered C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the starting material.\n*   To give the substituents the lowest possible numbers (locants), the ring is numbered such that the adjacent carbon where the new methyl group was added (original C6) becomes C2.\n*   The original methyl groups at C3 and C4 become substituents at C5 and C4, respectively, in the new numbering scheme.\n*   Therefore, the product has methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. The base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This analysis eliminates options A and D, which are named as `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`, as this would imply the attack happened at C1.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n*   The second rule given is that the reaction proceeds with **inversion of configuration** at the carbon to which the nucleophile is added. This is characteristic of an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   The stereocenters that are not directly involved in the bond-breaking/bond-forming step retain their original configuration.\n*   Let's trace the configuration of each stereocenter:\n    *   **New C1 (from original C1):** This center is not attacked. Its configuration is retained. It was **(R)**, so it remains **(1R)**.\n    *   **New C2 (from original C6):** This is the site of nucleophilic attack. Its configuration is inverted. It was **(S)**, so it becomes **(2R)**.\n    *   **New C4 (from original C4):** This center is not attacked. Its configuration is retained. It was **(R)**, so it remains **(4R)**.\n    *   **New C5 (from original C3):** This center is not attacked. Its configuration is retained. It was **(R)**, so it remains **(5R)**.\n\n**Step 5: Assemble the Final Product Name and Compare with Options**\n*   Combining the constitutional name and the stereochemical descriptors, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   Now, let's compare this with the options:\n    *   A) (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n    *   B) (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n    *   C) (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n    *   D) (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n*   Our derived product perfectly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe reaction involves the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate (Gilman reagent). The analysis follows two key principles:\n\n1.  **Regioselectivity**: The nucleophile (the methyl group from Me₂CuLi) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    *   The epoxide is formed between C1 and C6 of the bicyclic system.\n    *   C1 is substituted with a methyl group, making it a quaternary carbon.\n    *   C6 is substituted with a hydrogen, making it a tertiary carbon.\n    *   Therefore, the attack occurs at the less hindered **C6**.\n    *   This means the resulting product will be a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol, which eliminates options B and C as they have a 2,2,4,5-substitution pattern (implying attack at C1).\n\n2.  **Stereoselectivity**: The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism, which causes an inversion of configuration at the carbon being attacked.\n    *   The starting configuration at the site of attack (C6) is given as **(S)**.\n    *   The Sₙ2 attack inverts this center to **(R)**.\n    *   The configurations of the other stereocenters (C1, C3, C4) are not involved in the reaction and are retained.\n    *   Let's map the stereochemistry to the final product, using the new IUPAC numbering:\n        *   **New C1** (from original C1): Retains its **(R)** configuration.\n        *   **New C2** (from original C6): Inverts from (S) to **(R)**.\n        *   **New C4** (from original C4): Retains its **(R)** configuration.\n        *   **New C5** (from original C3): Retains its **(R)** configuration.\n\nCombining these results, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This is a cyclohexane ring with an epoxide fused across carbons C1 and C6. It has methyl groups at C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source for a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n    *   **Reaction:** The reaction is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n\n2.  **Determine the Regioselectivity (Where the attack happens):**\n    *   The prompt states a key rule for this reaction: \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\" This is a standard principle for organocuprates.\n    *   The two carbons of the epoxide ring are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 has a methyl group attached, making it a quaternary carbon (more hindered).\n    *   C6 has a hydrogen atom attached, making it a tertiary carbon (less hindered).\n    *   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack the less hindered carbon, **C6**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereoselectivity (How the attack happens):**\n    *   The prompt also states: \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\" This is characteristic of an Sₙ2 reaction mechanism, where the nucleophile performs a backside attack.\n    *   The attack occurs at C6, which has an initial configuration of **(S)**.\n    *   The Sₙ2 attack will invert this stereocenter. Therefore, the configuration at this carbon in the product will be **(R)**.\n\n4.  **Determine the Final Product Structure and Name:**\n    *   The attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and is protonated during the workup step to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    *   The resulting product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.\n    *   **IUPAC Naming:** To name the product, the carbon bearing the -OH group is designated as C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the starting material. To give the substituents the lowest possible numbers, the ring is numbered such that the original C6 (now with the new methyl group) becomes C2. The original C4 becomes the new C4, and the original C3 becomes the new C5.\n    *   The product's base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This eliminates options A and D, which have a `2,2,4,5-` substitution pattern that would result from an attack at C1.\n\n5.  **Assemble the Final Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The configurations of the stereocenters that were not attacked are retained.\n    *   **New C1 (from original C1):** The configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n    *   **New C2 (from original C6):** The configuration is inverted from (S) to **(R)**.\n    *   **New C4 (from original C4):** The configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n    *   **New C5 (from original C3):** The configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n    *   Combining these gives the full stereochemical descriptor: **(1R, 2R, 4R, 5R)**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe Python script executed a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane and lithium dimethylcuprate.\n\nThe analysis correctly followed established chemical principles:\n1.  **Regioselectivity**: The script identified that the nucleophilic methyl group attacks the less sterically hindered C6 carbon of the epoxide.\n2.  **Product Skeleton**: Based on the site of attack, the script correctly determined that the product is a 1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol, which eliminated two of the four options.\n3.  **Stereoselectivity**: The script applied the rule of Sₙ2 inversion at the site of attack (C6), changing its configuration from (S) to (R). The other stereocenters (C1, C3, C4) were correctly identified as retaining their original (R) configurations.\n\nThe final product was determined to be **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This result matched option C from the provided list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product based on the provided information.\n\n**1. Understanding the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reactants**: The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, which is a substituted epoxide on a cyclohexane ring. The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent that acts as a source for a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction Type**: This is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n*   **Key Principles**: The reaction follows an Sₙ2 mechanism, which dictates two key outcomes:\n    *   **Regioselectivity**: The nucleophile attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide.\n    *   **Stereoselectivity**: The attack occurs from the side opposite the C-O bond (backside attack), causing an inversion of the stereochemical configuration at the carbon that is attacked.\n\n**2. Determining the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)**\n\n*   The epoxide ring involves carbons C1 and C6 of the bicyclic system.\n*   Carbon C1 has a methyl group attached, making it a more substituted and sterically hindered carbon.\n*   Carbon C6 has only a hydrogen atom attached (besides the ring carbons), making it the less sterically hindered carbon.\n*   **Conclusion**: The methyl nucleophile from Me₂CuLi will attack **C6**.\n\n**3. Determining the Product's Structure**\n\n*   The attack at C6 breaks the C6-O bond. The oxygen remains attached to C1 and becomes a hydroxyl (-OH) group after the standard aqueous workup step.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol ring with four methyl groups.\n*   For IUPAC naming, the carbon with the -OH group is designated as the new C1. The adjacent carbon that was attacked (the original C6) becomes the new C2.\n*   The product's base name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This immediately eliminates options B and D, which have a different substitution pattern (`2,2,4,5-tetramethyl...`) that would result from an attack at C1.\n\n**4. Determining the Product's Stereochemistry**\n\n*   The reaction proceeds with inversion of configuration at the site of attack (C6) and retention of configuration at the other chiral centers (C1, C3, C4).\n*   **Starting Configurations**: 1R, 3R, 4R, 6S.\n*   **Configuration at C1 (new C1)**: This center is not attacked, so its configuration is retained. It was **R**, so it remains **1R**.\n*   **Configuration at C6 (new C2)**: This center is attacked and its configuration inverts. It was **S**, so it becomes **2R**.\n*   **Configuration at C4 (new C4)**: This center is not involved in the reaction, so its configuration is retained. It was **R**, so it remains **4R**.\n*   **Configuration at C3 (new C5)**: This center is also not involved in the reaction, so its configuration is retained. It was **R**, so it remains **5R**.\n\n**5. Final Product Identification**\n\n*   Combining the structural name and the stereochemical descriptors, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n*   This name and stereochemistry perfectly match option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. This name describes a cyclohexane ring fused with an epoxide across carbons C1 and C6. There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **Reagent:** The reagent is Me₂CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate), a Gilman reagent, which acts as a source for a nucleophilic methyl group (Me⁻).\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction is the nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide.\n\n**2. Determine the Regioselectivity (Site of Attack)**\n*   A fundamental rule for the reaction of organocuprates with saturated epoxides is that the nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide ring.\n*   The two carbons of the epoxide are C1 and C6.\n    *   **C1** is substituted with a methyl group, making it a **quaternary** carbon (more hindered).\n    *   **C6** is substituted with a hydrogen atom, making it a **tertiary** carbon (less hindered).\n*   Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl group will attack **C6**.\n\n**3. Determine the Stereoselectivity (Stereochemical Outcome)**\n*   The reaction proceeds via an Sₙ2 mechanism. This involves a \"backside attack\" where the nucleophile approaches from the side opposite the C-O bond.\n*   This mechanism results in an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon atom that is attacked.\n*   The initial configuration at the site of attack, C6, is given as **(S)**. Due to the inversion, the configuration at this carbon in the product will become **(R)**.\n*   The stereocenters that are not directly attacked (C1, C3, and C4) retain their original configurations. They remain **(R)**, **(R)**, and **(R)**, respectively.\n\n**4. Determine the Product's Structure and IUPAC Name**\n*   The attack at C6 opens the epoxide ring. The oxygen atom remains attached to C1 and, after a standard aqueous workup, is protonated to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol ring with four methyl groups.\n*   For IUPAC naming, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (-OH) is assigned the lowest number, so the original C1 becomes the **new C1**.\n*   To give the substituents the lowest possible locants, the ring is numbered such that the original C6 becomes the **new C2**. The original C4 becomes the **new C4**, and the original C3 becomes the **new C5**.\n*   The resulting product has a **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol** skeleton. This structural name eliminates options A and B.\n\n**5. Assemble the Final Stereochemistry**\n*   **New C1** (from original C1): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n*   **New C2** (from original C6): Configuration is inverted from (S) to **(R)**.\n*   **New C4** (from original C4): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n*   **New C5** (from original C3): Configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nCombining the structural name and the stereochemical descriptors, the final product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.
