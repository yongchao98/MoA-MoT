Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.\nIndicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.\n\nA) 17\nB) 15\nC) 13\nD) 19\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Gaseous Products and Their Quantities:**\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** The weight did not change, indicating no acidic gases (like CO₂) were formed.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The weight increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase is from the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n        *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   The most plausible reaction at 200°C involves the decomposition of a salt to nitrous oxide (N₂O), which then reacts with copper: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. This means 0.05 mol of N₂O was present in the gas mixture, and this reaction also produced 0.05 mol of N₂.\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** 2.24 L of gas at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP) remained.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        *   This final gas is N₂. It is composed of any N₂ from the initial decomposition plus the N₂ formed in Tube №3.\n        *   Therefore, N₂ from the initial decomposition = Total N₂ (Gas C) - N₂ from N₂O reaction = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n2.  **Identify the Initial Gas Mixture and Verify Mass:**\n    *   The initial decomposition produced: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂.\n    *   Let's check the total mass:\n        *   Mass H₂O = 0.20 mol * 18.0 g/mol = 3.60 g\n        *   Mass N₂O = 0.05 mol * 44.0 g/mol = 2.20 g\n        *   Mass N₂ = 0.05 mol * 28.0 g/mol = 1.40 g\n        *   Total Mass = 3.60 + 2.20 + 1.40 = 7.20 g. This matches the initial mass of the salts, confirming our product analysis is correct.\n\n3.  **Deduce the Identity of Salts A and B:**\n    *   The products (H₂O, N₂O, N₂) point towards the decomposition of ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n    *   The standard decomposition reactions are:\n        *   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n        *   NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   The problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let's assume it contains 'n' moles of each salt.\n        *   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂, we get 'n' moles of N₂.\n        *   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃, we get 'n' moles of N₂O.\n    *   Our analysis showed the decomposition produced 0.05 mol of N₂ and 0.05 mol of N₂O. This means n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The total water produced should be 2n (from NH₄NO₂) + 2n (from NH₄NO₃) = 4n.\n    *   Checking with n = 0.05 mol: Total H₂O = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. This matches our calculation.\n    *   Therefore, the salts are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    *   The final step is to count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Total number of atoms** = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the careful points needed to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n**1. Quantify the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe first step is to use the experimental data to determine the identity and molar amounts of the gases produced by the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution detects acidic gases. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂, or NO₂) were formed. This is a crucial constraint.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The weight increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase is from the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining Gas):** 2.24 liters of an inert gas remained at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   Molar volume of a gas at STP = 22.4 L/mol.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Identify the Gaseous Products**\n\nWe need to identify the specific molecules that correspond to the quantities calculated above.\n\n*   **Identity of Gas C:** We can determine the identity of Gas C by using the law of conservation of mass. The total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g).\n    *   The mass of the oxidizing gas that passed through Tube №3 is not just the 0.80 g of oxygen; it includes the other atoms in that gas molecule.\n    *   Let's try a different approach: determine the elemental composition of the entire 7.20 g sample.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.20 mol H₂O × (2 mol H / 1 mol H₂O) × 1.0 g/mol H ≈ 0.4 g.\n    *   Mass of O = (0.20 mol H₂O × 16.0 g/mol O) + 0.80 g (from Tube 3) = 3.2 g + 0.8 g = 4.0 g.\n    *   The remaining mass must be nitrogen, as carbon and sulfur are ruled out.\n    *   Mass of N = 7.20 g - 0.4 g (H) - 4.0 g (O) = 2.8 g.\n    *   This 2.8 g of nitrogen makes up Gas C and was also part of the oxidizing gas.\n    *   Let's check the molar mass of Gas C: Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(oxidizing gas). This path is complicated.\n    *   The simplest path is to assume Gas C is N₂. Molar mass of N₂ is 28 g/mol. Mass of 0.10 mol N₂ = 0.10 mol * 28 g/mol = 2.8 g. This matches the mass of nitrogen we calculated for the entire system. Therefore, **Gas C is N₂**.\n\n*   **Identity of the Oxidizing Gas:** The gas reacted with hot copper, supplying 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms. It cannot be an acidic gas. The most plausible candidate from the decomposition of nitrogen-based salts is nitrous oxide (N₂O).\n    *   The reaction is: **N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO**.\n    *   This reaction shows that 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of O atoms. Therefore, the amount of N₂O must have been **0.05 mol**.\n    *   This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂.\n\n**3. Determine the Initial Gas Mixture Composition**\n\nThe gas mixture *before* analysis consisted of:\n*   **H₂O:** 0.20 mol (absorbed in Tube 1).\n*   **N₂O:** 0.05 mol (reacted in Tube 3).\n*   **N₂:** The final 0.10 mol of N₂ (Gas C) is the sum of N₂ produced initially and the N₂ produced from the N₂O reaction.\n    *   Initial N₂ = Total N₂ - N₂ from N₂O reduction = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\nSo, the decomposition of the salts yielded: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂.\n\n**4. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe products (H₂O, N₂O, N₂) strongly suggest the decomposition of ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n*   **Reaction 1:** NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Reaction 2:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let's assume it contained 'x' moles of each salt.\n*   From 'x' moles of NH₄NO₃, we get 'x' moles of N₂O and '2x' moles of H₂O.\n*   From 'x' moles of NH₄NO₂, we get 'x' moles of N₂ and '2x' moles of H₂O.\n\nComparing this to our results:\n*   Moles of N₂O = x = 0.05 mol.\n*   Moles of N₂ = x = 0.05 mol.\n*   Total Moles of H₂O = 2x + 2x = 4x = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol.\n\nThe value **x = 0.05 mol** is consistent for all products. The salts are indeed NH₄NO₃ and NH₄NO₂.\n\n**5. Verify the Initial Mass**\n\nLet's check if 0.05 mol of each salt adds up to 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.0 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.0 g/mol.\n*   Total Mass = (0.05 mol × 80.0 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 64.0 g/mol) = 4.00 g + 3.20 g = **7.20 g**.\nThe mass matches perfectly.\n\n**6. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Gaseous Products and Their Quantities**\n\nThe problem describes the decomposition of a salt mixture into gases, which are then analyzed by passing them through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂) were formed.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The weight increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of CuO. This means the copper reacted with an oxidizing gas, and the mass increase is from the oxygen atoms.\n    *   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The gas that supplied the oxygen must be an oxygen-containing gas that is not water (removed in tube 1) and not acidic (no reaction in tube 2). A common decomposition product of nitrogen salts at 200°C is nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction is N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. This reaction shows that 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of oxygen atoms. Therefore, the initial gas mixture contained **0.05 mol of N₂O**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** 2.24 L of gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This final gas is inert to all previous reagents. This is likely nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   Crucially, the reaction in Tube №3 (N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO) produces N₂. The amount of N₂ produced is equal to the moles of N₂O that reacted, which is 0.05 mol.\n    *   The final 0.10 mol of N₂ (Gas C) is the sum of the N₂ produced in Tube №3 and any N₂ that was in the initial gas mixture.\n    *   Total N₂ = Initial N₂ + N₂ from N₂O reduction\n    *   0.10 mol = Initial N₂ + 0.05 mol\n    *   Therefore, the initial gas mixture contained **0.05 mol of N₂**.\n\n**Summary of Initial Gas Mixture:**\nThe decomposition of the salts produced:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.05 mol N₂O\n*   0.05 mol N₂\n\n**2. Verify Mass Conservation**\nLet's check if the total mass of these products equals the initial 7.20 g.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 0.20 mol × 18.0 g/mol = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of N₂O = 0.05 mol × 44.0 g/mol = 2.20 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = 0.05 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 1.40 g\n*   Total Mass = 3.60 g + 2.20 g + 1.40 g = 7.20 g.\nThe mass is conserved, confirming our analysis of the products is correct.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\nWe need to find two equimolar salts that decompose to produce 0.05 mol N₂, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.20 mol H₂O. The products suggest the salts are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids.\nLet's examine the standard decomposition reactions at ~200°C:\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nIf we have an equimolar mixture of 'n' moles of each salt:\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂, we get: `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃, we get: `n` moles of N₂O and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n*   Total products: `n` mol N₂, `n` mol N₂O, and `4n` mol H₂O.\n\nComparing this to our experimental results (0.05 mol N₂, 0.05 mol N₂O, 0.20 mol H₂O), we can see that `n = 0.05` mol. The hypothesis is a perfect fit. The salts are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Gaseous Products and Their Molar Quantities**\n\nThe problem describes the decomposition of a salt mixture into gases, which are then analyzed by passing them through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution tests for acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with an oxidizing gas. The weight increase of 0.80 g is the mass of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted to form CuO.\n    *   Atomic mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   The gas providing the oxygen must be an oxygen-containing gas that is not water (removed in tube 1) and not acidic (no reaction in tube 2). The most likely candidate from the decomposition of nitrogen salts at 200°C is nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction is: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO.\n    *   This reaction shows that 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of oxygen atoms. Therefore, the initial gas mixture contained **0.05 mol of N₂O**.\n    *   **Crucial Point:** This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂ gas.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining Gas):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   This final gas is inert to all reagents. It is composed of any inert gas from the initial decomposition plus any inert gas formed in the tubes. The only inert gas in this system is nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   Total N₂ collected = N₂ (from initial decomposition) + N₂ (from N₂O reduction in tube 3).\n    *   0.10 mol = N₂ (from initial decomposition) + 0.05 mol.\n    *   Therefore, the initial decomposition produced **0.05 mol of N₂**.\n\n**Summary of Initial Decomposition Products:**\nThe heating of the salt mixture produced:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.05 mol N₂\n*   0.05 mol N₂O\n\n**2. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe products (H₂O, N₂, N₂O) indicate the original salts contained Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. The problem states it's an equimolar mixture of two salts. Let's consider the thermal decomposition of common ammonium salts.\n\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** Decomposes via NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** Decomposes at ~200°C via NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the mixture contained 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂ and 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃.\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂, we expect **n moles of N₂** and **2n moles of H₂O**.\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃, we expect **n moles of N₂O** and **2n moles of H₂O**.\n\nTotal expected products:\n*   N₂: n moles\n*   N₂O: n moles\n*   H₂O: 2n + 2n = 4n moles\n\nComparing with our experimental results:\n*   From N₂: n = 0.05 mol.\n*   From N₂O: n = 0.05 mol.\n*   From H₂O: 4n = 0.20 mol → n = 0.05 mol.\n\nThe value n = 0.05 mol is consistent for all products. This confirms the salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**3. Verify the Initial Mass**\n\nLet's check if 0.05 mol of each salt adds up to the given 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol.\n*   Total Mass = (0.05 mol × 64.04 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80.04 g/mol)\n*   Total Mass = 3.202 g + 4.002 g = 7.204 g. This matches the initial mass.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms + 4 Hydrogen (H) atoms + 2 Oxygen (O) atoms = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms + 4 Hydrogen (H) atoms + 3 Oxygen (O) atoms = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Gaseous Products and Their Quantities**\n\nThe problem describes the complete decomposition of a 7.20 g salt mixture into gases. These gases are then analyzed by passing them through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, and the tube's weight increased by 0.80 g. This increase is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   There are two common interpretations for the oxidizing gas:\n        *   **Interpretation A (N₂O):** The decomposition of ammonium nitrate at 200°C produces nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction with copper is N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. Here, 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of oxygen atoms.\n            *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n            *   This implies **0.05 mol of N₂O** was present.\n        *   **Interpretation B (O₂):** The decomposition produced molecular oxygen (O₂). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n            *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = **0.025 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Initial Gas Mixture Composition**\n\nLet's use the simpler Interpretation B (products are H₂O, O₂, N₂) and verify it with mass conservation.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of Gas C = Total Initial Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n*   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28 g/mol.\n*   A gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol that is inert in this setup is nitrogen (N₂).\n*   This interpretation is self-consistent. The initial gas mixture was **0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂**.\n\n(Note: Interpretation A also leads to the same final salts, but the logic is slightly more complex as Gas C would be a mix of initially produced N₂ and N₂ from the reduction of N₂O).\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe products (N₂, O₂, H₂O) indicate the original salts contained N, H, and O. The most likely candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. Let's test the hypothesis that the salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\nWe need decomposition reactions that produce N₂, O₂, and H₂O.\n*   **NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)**\n*   **2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let's assume it contains `n` moles of each salt.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂: produces `n` mol N₂ and `2n` mol H₂O.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃: produces `n` mol N₂, `0.5n` mol O₂, and `2n` mol H₂O.\n\n**Total moles of products from the mixture:**\n*   Total N₂ = `n` + `n` = `2n`\n*   Total O₂ = `0.5n`\n*   Total H₂O = `2n` + `2n` = `4n`\n\nNow, we match these with our experimental results:\n*   From O₂: `0.5n` = 0.025 mol  => **`n` = 0.05 mol**\n*   Let's check this `n` value with the other products:\n    *   Total N₂ = `2n` = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol.

Identify the Gaseous Products and Their Molar Quantities**\n\nThe problem describes the decomposition of a salt mixture into gases, which are then analyzed by passing them through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂) were formed.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, meaning the gas provided oxygen atoms. The weight increase of 0.80 g is the mass of these oxygen atoms.\n    *   Atomic mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The most likely oxidizing gas produced from the decomposition of a nitrogen-containing salt at 200°C is nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction is N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. This reaction shows that 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of oxygen atoms. Therefore, the amount of N₂O in the gas mixture was 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas is inert to all previous reagents. The reaction in Tube №3 (N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO) produced 0.05 mol of N₂. The final gas C is this N₂ plus any N₂ produced in the initial decomposition.\n    *   Total N₂ (Gas C) = N₂ (initial) + N₂ (from N₂O reduction)\n    *   0.10 mol = N₂ (initial) + 0.05 mol\n    *   Therefore, the initial decomposition produced 0.05 mol of N₂.\n\n**Summary of Initial Decomposition Products:**\nThe decomposition of the salt mixture yielded:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.05 mol N₂O\n*   0.05 mol N₂\n\n**2. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe products (H₂O, N₂O, N₂) indicate the original salts contained N, H, and O. The most common salts that produce these specific gases upon heating are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite Decomposition:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate Decomposition (at ~200°C):** NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let's assume it contained 'n' moles of each salt.\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂, we expect 'n' moles of N₂ and '2n' moles of H₂O.\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃, we expect 'n' moles of N₂O and '2n' moles of H₂O.\n\nComparing this with our calculated products:\n*   Moles of N₂ = n = 0.05 mol.\n*   Moles of N₂O = n = 0.05 mol.\n*   Total moles of H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n. Let's check: 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol.\n\nThe results match perfectly. The mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**3. Verify the Initial Mass**\n\nLet's confirm that the mass of 0.05 mol of each salt adds up to the given 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol) = 3.202 g + 4.002 g = 7.204 g.\nThis matches the initial mass.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = **9 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Gaseous Products and Their Molar Quantities**\n\nThe problem provides data from a series of analytical steps that allow us to identify the products of the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass of H₂O absorbed = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases.\n    *   The weight did not change, meaning **no acidic gases** (like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂) were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** This tube reacts with an oxidizing gas. The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms forming CuO. There are two plausible interpretations for the oxidizing gas, both of which lead to the same final answer.\n\n    *   **Interpretation A (The gas is O₂):** The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase is the mass of the O₂ gas.\n        *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n        *   Molar mass of O₂ ≈ 32.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = **0.025 mol**.\n\n    *   **Interpretation B (The gas is N₂O):** This is also a common decomposition product of ammonium salts. The reaction is N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. The mass increase is due to the single oxygen atom from each N₂O molecule.\n        *   Mass of O atoms = 0.80 g.\n        *   Atomic mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   This implies that **0.05 mol of N₂O** reacted. This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining Gas):** This is an inert gas collected at the end.\n    *   Volume at STP = 2.24 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Full Composition of the Initial Gas Mixture**\n\nLet's use the law of conservation of mass to identify Gas C. The total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n*   Using Interpretation A (O₂ was a product):\n    *   Mass of products = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C)\n    *   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C)\n    *   Mass(Gas C) = 2.80 g.\n    *   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28 g/mol. This corresponds to **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n    *   So, the products are: **0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂**.\n\n*   Using Interpretation B (N₂O was a product):\n    *   The final 0.10 mol of Gas C (N₂) is composed of N₂ from the initial decomposition plus the 0.05 mol of N₂ created from the N₂O reaction.\n    *   Initial N₂ = Total N₂ - N₂ from N₂O = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   So, the products are: **0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂**.\n    *   Let's check the mass: (0.20 * 18) + (0.05 * 44) + (0.05 * 28) = 3.60 + 2.20 + 1.40 = 7.20 g. This is also consistent.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe salts contain N, H, and O. The most likely candidates are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂). Let's check if their decomposition matches the products from both interpretations for an equimolar mixture of 'n' moles each.\n\n*   **Decomposition Reactions:**\n    *   `NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n    *   `NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)` (Matches Interpretation B)\n    *   `2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)` (Matches Interpretation A)\n\n*   **Test against Interpretation A (O₂ product):**\n    *   Total products from `n` moles of each salt: (n+n) N₂ + 0.5n O₂ + (2n+2n) H₂O = 2n N₂ + 0.5n O₂ + 4n H₂O.\n    *   Our results: 0.10 mol N₂, 0.025 mol O₂, 0.20 mol H₂O.\n    *   Solving for n: `0.5n = 0.025` → `n=0.05`. This gives `2n=0.10` and `4n=0.20`. It's a perfect match.\n\n*   **Test against Interpretation B (N₂O product):**\n    *   Total products from `n` moles of each salt: n N₂ + n N₂O + (2n+2n) H₂O = n N₂ + n N₂O + 4n H₂O.\n    *   Our results: 0.05 mol N₂, 0.05 mol N₂O, 0.20 mol H₂O.\n    *   Solving for n: `n=0.05`. This gives `4n=0.20`. It's also a perfect match.\n\nBoth valid interpretations lead to the same conclusion: the salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 2 Oxygen (O) = **8 atoms**\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 3 Oxygen (O) = **9 atoms**\n\n*   **Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided answers to determine the correct solution.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Problem and Products**\n\nThe core of the problem is to identify two salts, A and B, by analyzing their gaseous decomposition products. All competent candidate answers correctly follow these initial steps:\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂):** Absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to **0.20 mol of H₂O**.\n    *   Calculation: 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂):** No weight change indicates the absence of acidic gases like CO₂.\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** 2.24 L at STP corresponds to **0.10 mol of an inert gas**, which is correctly identified as **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** The 0.80 g mass increase is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper.\n\n### **2. Two Valid Reasoning Paths**\n\nThe candidate answers present two different, but equally valid, interpretations of the reaction in Tube №3 and the overall decomposition. Both paths lead to the same conclusion.\n\n**Path A: The \"N₂O Decomposition\" Model** (Used by Answers 1, 7, 8, 12)\nThis is the more chemically accurate model for the decomposition of ammonium nitrate at 200°C.\n*   **Decomposition:**\n    *   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    *   NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The gas reacting with copper in Tube №3 is nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction is `N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO`.\n    *   The 0.80 g increase (0.05 mol of O atoms) means **0.05 mol of N₂O** was produced.\n    *   The final 0.10 mol of N₂ (Gas C) is the sum of N₂ from NH₄NO₂ decomposition and N₂ from the N₂O reduction. This means the initial decomposition produced **0.05 mol of N₂** and **0.05 mol of N₂O**.\n*   **Conclusion:** An equimolar mixture of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ produces exactly these amounts of gases and 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n\n**Path B: The \"O₂ Decomposition\" Model** (Used by most other answers)\nThis model assumes a different decomposition pathway that directly produces the gases identified in the analysis.\n*   **Decomposition:**\n    *   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    *   2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The gas reacting with copper in Tube №3 is oxygen (O₂). The reaction is `2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO`.\n    *   The 0.80 g increase corresponds to **0.025 mol of O₂**.\n    *   The final gas C is **0.10 mol of N₂**.\n*   **Conclusion:** An equimolar mixture of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ produces exactly 0.10 mol N₂, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.20 mol H₂O.\n\n### **3. Synthesis and Final Calculation**\n\nBoth logical paths converge on the same conclusion: the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\nThe final step is to count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt:\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n### **4. Final Decision**\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the candidate answers correctly deduce the answer to be 17 through sound chemical reasoning. The provided options are A) 17, B) 19, C) 15, D) 13. Therefore, the correct choice is A.\n\nMany of the candidate answers show a discrepancy between their correct reasoning (which leads to 17) and the final letter they output. However, the analytical work itself is consistent and points unambiguously to 17.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1.

Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This rules out salts containing carbonate or other anions that would produce acidic gases.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** The problem states CuO is formed, meaning the gas passing through contained oxygen atoms that oxidized the copper. The weight increase of 0.80 g is the mass of these oxygen atoms.\n    *   Atomic Mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   There are two plausible interpretations for the gas that supplied the oxygen, both of which lead to the same final answer:\n        *   **Interpretation A:** The gas is molecular oxygen (O₂). Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n        *   **Interpretation B:** The gas is nitrous oxide (N₂O), which reacts via N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. In this case, 0.05 mol of N₂O would supply 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After the reactions, 2.24 L of an inert gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Identify the Salts Using Stoichiometry and Mass Conservation**\n\nLet's use Interpretation A, which is more direct. The products are 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol of an inert gas (Gas C).\n\n*   **Verify Mass Conservation:**\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = Initial Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28 g/mol.\n    *   A gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol that is inert in this context is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nThe decomposition products are definitively 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂.

There are two common interpretations, both leading to the same final answer:\n    *   **Interpretation A (Simpler):** The gas is molecular oxygen (O₂).\n        *   Molar Mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Interpretation B:** The gas is nitrous oxide (N₂O), which reacts via N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. In this case, the 0.80 g of oxygen (0.05 mol of O atoms) would come from 0.05 mol of N₂O. This path is also valid and leads to the same conclusion. We will proceed with Interpretation A for clarity.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining Gas):** After the reactions, 2.24 L of an inert gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Verify Mass Conservation and Identify Gas C**\n\nThe total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g).\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n\nNow, we can determine the molar mass of Gas C:\n*   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   An inert gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nSo, the decomposition produced: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe products (N₂, O₂, H₂O) indicate the original salts contained Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. Since they are salts, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing anions. The most common candidates are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the equimolar mixture consists of these two salts. We need to use decomposition reactions that produce the observed gases.\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate:** 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let's assume it contains 'n' moles of each salt.\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂: produces **n** moles of N₂ and **2n** moles of H₂O.\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃ (using the 2:2:1:4 ratio): produces **n** moles of N₂, **0.5n** moles of O₂, and **2n** moles of H₂O.\n\nTotal moles of products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = n + n = **2n**\n*   Total O₂ = **0.5n**\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = **4n**\n\nNow, we match these expressions with the quantities we calculated in Step 1:\n*   From O₂: 0.5n = 0.025 mol  => **n = 0.05 mol**\n*   Let's check this value with the other products:\n    *   Total N₂ = 2n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol. (This matches our calculation for Gas C).\n    *   Total H₂O = 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. (This matches our calculation from Tube №1).\n\nThe value n = 0.05 mol is consistent for all products, confirming the salts are NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = **9 atoms**.\n\nThe total number of atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit:\nTotal Atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Gaseous Products and Their Molar Quantities**\n\nThe problem describes the complete decomposition of a salt mixture into gases, which are then analyzed.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution detects acidic gases. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂) were formed.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases by removing oxygen. The problem states CuO is formed, and the tube's weight increased by 0.80 g. This mass increase is due to the oxygen atoms that reacted.\n    *   This means 0.80 g of oxygen was present in the gas mixture that entered tube 3. This could be in the form of O₂ or another oxygen-containing gas like N₂O.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to all previous reagents.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture**\n\nWe can determine the total moles of each element (N, H, O) in the original 7.20 g sample by using the law of conservation of mass. A robust method is to identify all final products and sum their masses.\n\n*   Let's test the hypothesis that the products of the initial decomposition were H₂O, O₂, and N₂.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g (from tube 1).\n*   The mass increase in tube 3 (0.80 g) is the mass of the O₂ gas that reacted (2Cu + O₂ -> 2CuO). So, Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g. Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n*   The remaining gas C is N₂. Moles of N₂ = 0.10 mol. Mass of N₂ = 0.10 mol * 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Let's check the total mass: Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(N₂) = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n*   This matches the initial mass perfectly. Therefore, the initial decomposition produced **0.20 mol H₂O**, **0.025 mol O₂**, and **0.10 mol N₂**.\n\nNow, let's find the total moles of each element in the mixture:\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** 2 × Moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** (1 × Moles of H₂O) + (2 × Moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\nThe molar ratio of elements in the entire mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. To get an integer ratio, multiply by 20: **N₄ : H₈ : O₅**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states we have an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. The combined formula for one unit of A and one unit of B is N₄H₈O₅. Since the salts contain N, H, and O, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n\n*   Let's try to split N₄H₈O₅ into two plausible salt formulas.\n*   The 8 hydrogen atoms suggest two ammonium ions (NH₄⁺), which together have the formula N₂H₈.\n*   Subtracting this from the total gives the formula for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = N₂O₅.\n*   We need to split N₂O₅ into two common nitrogen oxyanions. The most common are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n*   (NO₃⁻) + (NO₂⁻) = N₂O₅. This is a perfect match.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 3 Oxygen (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 2 Oxygen (O) = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B)**\n    *   Total = 9 + 8 = **17 atoms**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identify and Quantify the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe problem describes the complete decomposition of a 7.20 g salt mixture into gases, which are then analyzed.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution detects acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** The weight increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of CuO. This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   This implies that an oxidizing gas containing 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms passed through the tube. There are two common interpretations for this, both of which lead to the same final answer:\n        *   **Interpretation A:** The gas is nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction is N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. This means **0.05 mol of N₂O** was present. This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂.\n        *   **Interpretation B:** The gas is molecular oxygen (O₂). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. This means **0.025 mol of O₂** (which contains 0.05 mol of O atoms) was present.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** 2.24 liters of an inert gas remained at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Deduce the Initial Gas Mixture Composition**\n\nWe can use the two interpretations from the previous step to determine the initial mix of gases produced by the decomposition.\n\n*   **Following Interpretation A (N₂O was the oxidizing gas):**\n    *   The final 0.10 mol of N₂ (Gas C) is composed of N₂ produced from the N₂O reaction (0.05 mol) and any N₂ produced in the initial decomposition.\n    *   Initial N₂ = Total N₂ - N₂ from N₂O = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Therefore, the decomposition produced: **0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂**.\n\n*   **Following Interpretation B (O₂ was the oxidizing gas):**\n    *   The final 0.10 mol of N₂ (Gas C) is simply the N₂ that was produced in the initial decomposition and passed through all tubes unreacted.\n    *   Therefore, the decomposition produced: **0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂**.\n\nA quick check of the total mass for both interpretations confirms they are correct:\n*   Mass A = (0.20 * 18) + (0.05 * 44) + (0.05 * 28) = 3.6 + 2.2 + 1.4 = 7.20 g.\n*   Mass B = (0.20 * 18) + (0.025 * 32) + (0.10 * 28) = 3.6 + 0.8 + 2.8 = 7.20 g.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe products (containing N, H, and O) and the fact that the initial substances are salts strongly suggest they are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. The mixture is equimolar. Let's test the most likely candidates, ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃), against both interpretations.\n\n*   **Testing against Interpretation A's products (0.05 mol N₂, 0.05 mol N₂O, 0.2 mol H₂O):**\n    *   Decomposition of NH₄NO₂: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   Decomposition of NH₄NO₃ (at 200°C): NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   An equimolar mixture of `n` moles of each would produce `n` mol N₂, `n` mol N₂O, and `4n` mol H₂O. This 1:1:4 ratio perfectly matches the products if `n = 0.05` mol.\n\n*   **Testing against Interpretation B's products (0.10 mol N₂, 0.025 mol O₂, 0.2 mol H₂O):**\n    *   Decomposition of NH₄NO₂: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   Alternative decomposition of NH₄NO₃: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n    *   An equimolar mixture of `n` moles of each would produce `2n` mol N₂, `0.5n` mol O₂, and `4n` mol H₂O. This 4:1:8 ratio perfectly matches the products if `n = 0.05` mol.\n\nBoth logical paths correctly identify the salts as **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe analysis of the candidate answers concluded that the two salts in the equimolar mixture are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nThe Python script was executed to verify the final calculation. The code successfully parsed the chemical formulas and performed the atom count:\n*   Salt A (NH₄NO₂) contains 8 atoms.\n*   Salt B (NH₄NO₃) contains 9 atoms.\n\nThe total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt is the sum of these two values, which is 8 + 9 = 17. This result corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Gaseous Products and Their Molar Quantities**\n\nThe problem provides data from passing the decomposition gases through a series of analytical tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution detects acidic gases. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases (like CO₂) were formed.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** The problem states CuO was formed, and the tube's weight increased by 0.80 g. This increase is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper. There are two common interpretations of the oxidizing gas, but both lead to the same final answer.\n    *   **Interpretation A (Gas is O₂):** The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of 0.80 g is from oxygen gas.\n        *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = **0.025 mol**.\n    *   **Interpretation B (Gas is N₂O):** The reaction is Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂. The mass increase of 0.80 g is from oxygen atoms.\n        *   Atomic mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since one mole of N₂O contains one mole of O atoms, this means **0.05 mol of N₂O** reacted. This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** 2.24 L of an inert gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Verify Mass Conservation and Identify Gas C**\n\nLet's check if the mass of the products equals the initial mass of 7.20 g.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of Gas C = Initial Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n*   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol that is inert in this context is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nSo, the decomposition produced **0.20 mol H₂O**, **0.025 mol O₂**, and **0.10 mol N₂**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe products (N₂, O₂, H₂O) indicate the original salts contained Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. The most plausible candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids, specifically ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the equimolar mixture contains `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ and `n` moles of NH₄NO₃. We need decomposition reactions that yield N₂, O₂, and H₂O.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** `NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** `2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)`\n\nNow, let's calculate the total moles of products from `n` moles of each salt:\n*   **Total N₂:** `n` (from A) + `n` (from B) = `2n`\n*   **Total O₂:** `0.5n` (from B)\n*   **Total H₂O:** `2n` (from A) + `2n` (from B) = `4n`\n\nWe can solve for `n` using our experimental product quantities:\n*   From O₂: `0.5n` = 0.025 mol  => **`n` = 0.05 mol**\n*   From N₂: `2n` = 0.10 mol    => **`n` = 0.05 mol**\n*   From H₂O: `4n` = 0.20 mol   => **`n` = 0.05 mol**\n\nThe value `n = 0.05` is consistent across all products. This confirms the salts are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 2 Oxygen (O) = **8 atoms**\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 3 Oxygen (O) = **9 atoms**\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 19\nB) 13\nC) 15\nD) 17\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate solutions.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Experimental Data**\n\nThe core of the problem is to identify the gaseous products and their quantities. All sound analyses follow this initial step.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** The weight did not change, indicating no acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂) were formed.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** The weight increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase is from the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** 2.24 L of an inert gas were collected at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   Molar Volume at STP = 22.4 L/mol.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### **2. Identification of the Gaseous Products**\n\nThere are two valid interpretations of the reaction in Tube №3, both of which lead to the same final answer.\n\n**Interpretation A (More Chemically Plausible):**\nThe gas reacting with hot copper is nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction is: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO.\n*   This reaction shows that 0.05 mol of O atoms came from **0.05 mol of N₂O**.\n*   This reaction also produced 0.05 mol of N₂.\n*   The final Gas C (0.10 mol) is the sum of N₂ from this reaction and any N₂ from the initial decomposition.\n*   Therefore, N₂ from initial decomposition = 0.10 mol (total) - 0.05 mol (from N₂O) = **0.05 mol**.\n*   **Initial Gas Mixture:** 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂.\n\n**Interpretation B (Mathematically Consistent):**\nThe gas reacting with hot copper is molecular oxygen (O₂). The reaction is: O₂ + 2Cu → 2CuO.\n*   0.80 g of oxygen corresponds to 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = **0.025 mol of O₂**.\n*   The inert Gas C is identified as **0.10 mol of N₂** by calculating its mass (7.20g - 3.60g - 0.80g = 2.80g) and molar mass (2.80g / 0.1mol = 28 g/mol).\n*   **Initial Gas Mixture:** 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂.\n\n### **3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nBoth interpretations point to the same two salts. The products contain only N, H, and O, suggesting ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n\n*   **Using Interpretation A's products (N₂, N₂O, H₂O):**\n    *   The decomposition reactions that produce this mixture are:\n        *   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n        *   NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   For an equimolar mixture of 'n' moles each, we expect n moles of N₂, n moles of N₂O, and 4n moles of H₂O.\n    *   Our calculated products (0.05 mol N₂, 0.05 mol N₂O, 0.20 mol H₂O) perfectly match this for **n = 0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Using Interpretation B's products (N₂, O₂, H₂O):**\n    *   The decomposition reactions that produce this mixture are:\n        *   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n        *   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n    *   For an equimolar mixture of 'n' moles each, we expect 2n moles of N₂, 0.5n moles of O₂, and 4n moles of H₂O.\n    *   Our calculated products (0.10 mol N₂, 0.025 mol O₂, 0.20 mol H₂O) perfectly match this for **n = 0.05 mol**.\n\nBoth paths correctly identify the mixture as **0.05 mol of ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n### **4. Verification of Mass**\n\nLet's confirm the total mass is 7.20 g.\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ ≈ 64.0 g/mol.\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ ≈ 80.0 g/mol.\n*   Total Mass = (0.05 mol * 64.0 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80.0 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = **7.20 g**.\nThe mass is correct.\n\n### **5. Final Calculation: Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 2 Oxygen (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 3 Oxygen (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D. A review of the candidate answers shows that while many contain correct reasoning, they often select the wrong final letter. The consistent result from all valid derivations is 17.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** The weight did not change, indicating no acidic gases (like CO₂) were formed.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The weight increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase is from the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n        *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   The most plausible reaction at 200°C involves the decomposition of a salt to nitrous oxide (N₂O), which then reacts with copper: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. This means 0.05 mol of N₂O was present in the gas mixture, and this reaction also produced 0.05 mol of N₂.\n    *   **Remaining Gas C:** 2.24 L of gas at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP) remained.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        *   This final gas is N₂. It is composed of any N₂ from the initial decomposition plus the N₂ formed in Tube №3.\n        *   Therefore, N₂ from the initial decomposition = Total N₂ (Gas C) - N₂ from N₂O reaction = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol.\n\n2.  **Identify the Initial Gas Mixture and Verify Mass:**\n    *   The initial decomposition produced: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂.\n    *   Let's check the total mass:\n        *   Mass H₂O = 0.20 mol * 18.0 g/mol = 3.60 g\n        *   Mass N₂O = 0.05 mol * 44.0 g/mol = 2.20 g\n        *   Mass N₂ = 0.05 mol * 28.0 g/mol = 1.40 g\n        *   Total Mass = 3.60 + 2.20 + 1.40 = 7.20 g. This matches the initial mass of the salts, confirming our product analysis is correct.\n\n3.  **Deduce the Identity of Salts A and B:**\n    *   The products (H₂O, N₂O, N₂) point towards the decomposition of ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n    *   The standard decomposition reactions are:\n        *   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n        *   NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   The problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let's assume it contains 'n' moles of each salt.\n        *   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂, we get 'n' moles of N₂.\n        *   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃, we get 'n' moles of N₂O.\n    *   Our analysis showed the decomposition produced 0.05 mol of N₂ and 0.05 mol of N₂O. This means n = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The total water produced should be 2n (from NH₄NO₂) + 2n (from NH₄NO₃) = 4n.\n    *   Checking with n = 0.05 mol: Total H₂O = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. This matches our calculation.\n    *   Therefore, the salts are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Atoms:**\n    *   The final step is to count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n    *   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n    *   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n    *   **Total number of atoms** = 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the careful points needed to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n**1. Quantify the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe first step is to use the experimental data to determine the identity and molar amounts of the gases produced by the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution detects acidic gases. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂, or NO₂) were formed. This is a crucial constraint.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The weight increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase is from the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining Gas):** 2.24 liters of an inert gas remained at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   Molar volume of a gas at STP = 22.4 L/mol.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Identify the Gaseous Products**\n\nWe need to identify the specific molecules that correspond to the quantities calculated above.\n\n*   **Identity of Gas C:** We can determine the identity of Gas C by using the law of conservation of mass. The total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g).\n    *   The mass of the oxidizing gas that passed through Tube №3 is not just the 0.80 g of oxygen; it includes the other atoms in that gas molecule.\n    *   Let's try a different approach: determine the elemental composition of the entire 7.20 g sample.\n    *   Mass of H = 0.20 mol H₂O × (2 mol H / 1 mol H₂O) × 1.0 g/mol H ≈ 0.4 g.\n    *   Mass of O = (0.20 mol H₂O × 16.0 g/mol O) + 0.80 g (from Tube 3) = 3.2 g + 0.8 g = 4.0 g.\n    *   The remaining mass must be nitrogen, as carbon and sulfur are ruled out.\n    *   Mass of N = 7.20 g - 0.4 g (H) - 4.0 g (O) = 2.8 g.\n    *   This 2.8 g of nitrogen makes up Gas C and was also part of the oxidizing gas.\n    *   Let's check the molar mass of Gas C: Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(oxidizing gas). This path is complicated.\n    *   The simplest path is to assume Gas C is N₂. Molar mass of N₂ is 28 g/mol. Mass of 0.10 mol N₂ = 0.10 mol * 28 g/mol = 2.8 g. This matches the mass of nitrogen we calculated for the entire system. Therefore, **Gas C is N₂**.\n\n*   **Identity of the Oxidizing Gas:** The gas reacted with hot copper, supplying 0.05 mol of oxygen atoms. It cannot be an acidic gas. The most plausible candidate from the decomposition of nitrogen-based salts is nitrous oxide (N₂O).\n    *   The reaction is: **N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO**.\n    *   This reaction shows that 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of O atoms. Therefore, the amount of N₂O must have been **0.05 mol**.\n    *   This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂.\n\n**3. Determine the Initial Gas Mixture Composition**\n\nThe gas mixture *before* analysis consisted of:\n*   **H₂O:** 0.20 mol (absorbed in Tube 1).\n*   **N₂O:** 0.05 mol (reacted in Tube 3).\n*   **N₂:** The final 0.10 mol of N₂ (Gas C) is the sum of N₂ produced initially and the N₂ produced from the N₂O reaction.\n    *   Initial N₂ = Total N₂ - N₂ from N₂O reduction = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\nSo, the decomposition of the salts yielded: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂.\n\n**4. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe products (H₂O, N₂O, N₂) strongly suggest the decomposition of ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂).\n*   **Reaction 1:** NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Reaction 2:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let's assume it contained 'x' moles of each salt.\n*   From 'x' moles of NH₄NO₃, we get 'x' moles of N₂O and '2x' moles of H₂O.\n*   From 'x' moles of NH₄NO₂, we get 'x' moles of N₂ and '2x' moles of H₂O.\n\nComparing this to our results:\n*   Moles of N₂O = x = 0.05 mol.\n*   Moles of N₂ = x = 0.05 mol.\n*   Total Moles of H₂O = 2x + 2x = 4x = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol.\n\nThe value **x = 0.05 mol** is consistent for all products. The salts are indeed NH₄NO₃ and NH₄NO₂.\n\n**5. Verify the Initial Mass**\n\nLet's check if 0.05 mol of each salt adds up to 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.0 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.0 g/mol.\n*   Total Mass = (0.05 mol × 80.0 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 64.0 g/mol) = 4.00 g + 3.20 g = **7.20 g**.\nThe mass matches perfectly.\n\n**6. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in one formula unit of salt A and one formula unit of salt B.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = 9 + 8 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Gaseous Products and Their Quantities**\n\nThe problem describes the decomposition of a salt mixture into gases, which are then analyzed by passing them through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂) were formed.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** The weight increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of CuO. This means the copper reacted with an oxidizing gas, and the mass increase is from the oxygen atoms.\n    *   Atomic mass of Oxygen (O) ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The gas that supplied the oxygen must be an oxygen-containing gas that is not water (removed in tube 1) and not acidic (no reaction in tube 2). A common decomposition product of nitrogen salts at 200°C is nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction is N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. This reaction shows that 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of oxygen atoms. Therefore, the initial gas mixture contained **0.05 mol of N₂O**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** 2.24 L of gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This final gas is inert to all previous reagents. This is likely nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   Crucially, the reaction in Tube №3 (N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO) produces N₂. The amount of N₂ produced is equal to the moles of N₂O that reacted, which is 0.05 mol.\n    *   The final 0.10 mol of N₂ (Gas C) is the sum of the N₂ produced in Tube №3 and any N₂ that was in the initial gas mixture.\n    *   Total N₂ = Initial N₂ + N₂ from N₂O reduction\n    *   0.10 mol = Initial N₂ + 0.05 mol\n    *   Therefore, the initial gas mixture contained **0.05 mol of N₂**.\n\n**Summary of Initial Gas Mixture:**\nThe decomposition of the salts produced:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.05 mol N₂O\n*   0.05 mol N₂\n\n**2. Verify Mass Conservation**\nLet's check if the total mass of these products equals the initial 7.20 g.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 0.20 mol × 18.0 g/mol = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of N₂O = 0.05 mol × 44.0 g/mol = 2.20 g\n*   Mass of N₂ = 0.05 mol × 28.0 g/mol = 1.40 g\n*   Total Mass = 3.60 g + 2.20 g + 1.40 g = 7.20 g.\nThe mass is conserved, confirming our analysis of the products is correct.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\nWe need to find two equimolar salts that decompose to produce 0.05 mol N₂, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.20 mol H₂O. The products suggest the salts are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids.\nLet's examine the standard decomposition reactions at ~200°C:\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nIf we have an equimolar mixture of 'n' moles of each salt:\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂, we get: `n` moles of N₂ and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃, we get: `n` moles of N₂O and `2n` moles of H₂O.\n*   Total products: `n` mol N₂, `n` mol N₂O, and `4n` mol H₂O.\n\nComparing this to our experimental results (0.05 mol N₂, 0.05 mol N₂O, 0.20 mol H₂O), we can see that `n = 0.05` mol. The hypothesis is a perfect fit. The salts are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Gaseous Products and Their Molar Quantities**\n\nThe problem describes the decomposition of a salt mixture into gases, which are then analyzed by passing them through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution tests for acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with an oxidizing gas. The weight increase of 0.80 g is the mass of oxygen atoms (O) that reacted to form CuO.\n    *   Atomic mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   The gas providing the oxygen must be an oxygen-containing gas that is not water (removed in tube 1) and not acidic (no reaction in tube 2). The most likely candidate from the decomposition of nitrogen salts at 200°C is nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction is: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO.\n    *   This reaction shows that 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of oxygen atoms. Therefore, the initial gas mixture contained **0.05 mol of N₂O**.\n    *   **Crucial Point:** This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂ gas.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining Gas):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of gas C remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n    *   This final gas is inert to all reagents. It is composed of any inert gas from the initial decomposition plus any inert gas formed in the tubes. The only inert gas in this system is nitrogen (N₂).\n    *   Total N₂ collected = N₂ (from initial decomposition) + N₂ (from N₂O reduction in tube 3).\n    *   0.10 mol = N₂ (from initial decomposition) + 0.05 mol.\n    *   Therefore, the initial decomposition produced **0.05 mol of N₂**.\n\n**Summary of Initial Decomposition Products:**\nThe heating of the salt mixture produced:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.05 mol N₂\n*   0.05 mol N₂O\n\n**2. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe products (H₂O, N₂, N₂O) indicate the original salts contained Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. The problem states it's an equimolar mixture of two salts. Let's consider the thermal decomposition of common ammonium salts.\n\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** Decomposes via NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** Decomposes at ~200°C via NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the mixture contained 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂ and 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃.\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂, we expect **n moles of N₂** and **2n moles of H₂O**.\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃, we expect **n moles of N₂O** and **2n moles of H₂O**.\n\nTotal expected products:\n*   N₂: n moles\n*   N₂O: n moles\n*   H₂O: 2n + 2n = 4n moles\n\nComparing with our experimental results:\n*   From N₂: n = 0.05 mol.\n*   From N₂O: n = 0.05 mol.\n*   From H₂O: 4n = 0.20 mol → n = 0.05 mol.\n\nThe value n = 0.05 mol is consistent for all products. This confirms the salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**3. Verify the Initial Mass**\n\nLet's check if 0.05 mol of each salt adds up to the given 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol.\n*   Total Mass = (0.05 mol × 64.04 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80.04 g/mol)\n*   Total Mass = 3.202 g + 4.002 g = 7.204 g. This matches the initial mass.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms + 4 Hydrogen (H) atoms + 2 Oxygen (O) atoms = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) atoms + 4 Hydrogen (H) atoms + 3 Oxygen (O) atoms = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Gaseous Products and Their Quantities**\n\nThe problem describes the complete decomposition of a 7.20 g salt mixture into gases. These gases are then analyzed by passing them through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of the water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, and the tube's weight increased by 0.80 g. This increase is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   There are two common interpretations for the oxidizing gas:\n        *   **Interpretation A (N₂O):** The decomposition of ammonium nitrate at 200°C produces nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction with copper is N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. Here, 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of oxygen atoms.\n            *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n            *   This implies **0.05 mol of N₂O** was present.\n        *   **Interpretation B (O₂):** The decomposition produced molecular oxygen (O₂). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO.\n            *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = **0.025 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Initial Gas Mixture Composition**\n\nLet's use the simpler Interpretation B (products are H₂O, O₂, N₂) and verify it with mass conservation.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of Gas C = Total Initial Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n*   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28 g/mol.\n*   A gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol that is inert in this setup is nitrogen (N₂).\n*   This interpretation is self-consistent. The initial gas mixture was **0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂**.\n\n(Note: Interpretation A also leads to the same final salts, but the logic is slightly more complex as Gas C would be a mix of initially produced N₂ and N₂ from the reduction of N₂O).\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe products (N₂, O₂, H₂O) indicate the original salts contained N, H, and O. The most likely candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. Let's test the hypothesis that the salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\nWe need decomposition reactions that produce N₂, O₂, and H₂O.\n*   **NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)**\n*   **2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)**\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let's assume it contains `n` moles of each salt.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂: produces `n` mol N₂ and `2n` mol H₂O.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃: produces `n` mol N₂, `0.5n` mol O₂, and `2n` mol H₂O.\n\n**Total moles of products from the mixture:**\n*   Total N₂ = `n` + `n` = `2n`\n*   Total O₂ = `0.5n`\n*   Total H₂O = `2n` + `2n` = `4n`\n\nNow, we match these with our experimental results:\n*   From O₂: `0.5n` = 0.025 mol  => **`n` = 0.05 mol**\n*   Let's check this `n` value with the other products:\n    *   Total N₂ = `2n` = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol. (This matches our result for Gas C).\n    *   Total H₂O = `4n` = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. (This matches our result from Tube №1).\n\nThe hypothesis is correct. The mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Salt A (e.g., NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (e.g., NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Identify the Gaseous Products and Their Molar Quantities**\n\nThe problem describes the decomposition of a salt mixture into gases, which are then analyzed by passing them through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution absorbs acidic gases. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂) were formed.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, meaning the gas provided oxygen atoms. The weight increase of 0.80 g is the mass of these oxygen atoms.\n    *   Atomic mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   The most likely oxidizing gas produced from the decomposition of a nitrogen-containing salt at 200°C is nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction is N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. This reaction shows that 1 mole of N₂O provides 1 mole of oxygen atoms. Therefore, the amount of N₂O in the gas mixture was 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   This gas is inert to all previous reagents. The reaction in Tube №3 (N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO) produced 0.05 mol of N₂. The final gas C is this N₂ plus any N₂ produced in the initial decomposition.\n    *   Total N₂ (Gas C) = N₂ (initial) + N₂ (from N₂O reduction)\n    *   0.10 mol = N₂ (initial) + 0.05 mol\n    *   Therefore, the initial decomposition produced 0.05 mol of N₂.\n\n**Summary of Initial Decomposition Products:**\nThe decomposition of the salt mixture yielded:\n*   0.20 mol H₂O\n*   0.05 mol N₂O\n*   0.05 mol N₂\n\n**2. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe products (H₂O, N₂O, N₂) indicate the original salts contained N, H, and O. The most common salts that produce these specific gases upon heating are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite Decomposition:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate Decomposition (at ~200°C):** NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let's assume it contained 'n' moles of each salt.\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂, we expect 'n' moles of N₂ and '2n' moles of H₂O.\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃, we expect 'n' moles of N₂O and '2n' moles of H₂O.\n\nComparing this with our calculated products:\n*   Moles of N₂ = n = 0.05 mol.\n*   Moles of N₂O = n = 0.05 mol.\n*   Total moles of H₂O = 2n + 2n = 4n. Let's check: 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol.\n\nThe results match perfectly. The mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**3. Verify the Initial Mass**\n\nLet's confirm that the mass of 0.05 mol of each salt adds up to the given 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ = 64.04 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ = 80.04 g/mol.\n*   Total mass = (0.05 mol * 64.04 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80.04 g/mol) = 3.202 g + 4.002 g = 7.204 g.\nThis matches the initial mass.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = **9 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Gaseous Products and Their Molar Quantities**\n\nThe problem provides data from a series of analytical steps that allow us to identify the products of the decomposition.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   Mass of H₂O absorbed = 3.60 g.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This tube absorbs acidic gases.\n    *   The weight did not change, meaning **no acidic gases** (like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂) were produced.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** This tube reacts with an oxidizing gas. The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to oxygen atoms forming CuO. There are two plausible interpretations for the oxidizing gas, both of which lead to the same final answer.\n\n    *   **Interpretation A (The gas is O₂):** The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase is the mass of the O₂ gas.\n        *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n        *   Molar mass of O₂ ≈ 32.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = **0.025 mol**.\n\n    *   **Interpretation B (The gas is N₂O):** This is also a common decomposition product of ammonium salts. The reaction is N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. The mass increase is due to the single oxygen atom from each N₂O molecule.\n        *   Mass of O atoms = 0.80 g.\n        *   Atomic mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   This implies that **0.05 mol of N₂O** reacted. This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining Gas):** This is an inert gas collected at the end.\n    *   Volume at STP = 2.24 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Determine the Full Composition of the Initial Gas Mixture**\n\nLet's use the law of conservation of mass to identify Gas C. The total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of 7.20 g.\n\n*   Using Interpretation A (O₂ was a product):\n    *   Mass of products = Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(Gas C)\n    *   7.20 g = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + Mass(Gas C)\n    *   Mass(Gas C) = 2.80 g.\n    *   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28 g/mol. This corresponds to **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n    *   So, the products are: **0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂**.\n\n*   Using Interpretation B (N₂O was a product):\n    *   The final 0.10 mol of Gas C (N₂) is composed of N₂ from the initial decomposition plus the 0.05 mol of N₂ created from the N₂O reaction.\n    *   Initial N₂ = Total N₂ - N₂ from N₂O = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   So, the products are: **0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂**.\n    *   Let's check the mass: (0.20 * 18) + (0.05 * 44) + (0.05 * 28) = 3.60 + 2.20 + 1.40 = 7.20 g. This is also consistent.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe salts contain N, H, and O. The most likely candidates are ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂). Let's check if their decomposition matches the products from both interpretations for an equimolar mixture of 'n' moles each.\n\n*   **Decomposition Reactions:**\n    *   `NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n    *   `NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)` (Matches Interpretation B)\n    *   `2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)` (Matches Interpretation A)\n\n*   **Test against Interpretation A (O₂ product):**\n    *   Total products from `n` moles of each salt: (n+n) N₂ + 0.5n O₂ + (2n+2n) H₂O = 2n N₂ + 0.5n O₂ + 4n H₂O.\n    *   Our results: 0.10 mol N₂, 0.025 mol O₂, 0.20 mol H₂O.\n    *   Solving for n: `0.5n = 0.025` → `n=0.05`. This gives `2n=0.10` and `4n=0.20`. It's a perfect match.\n\n*   **Test against Interpretation B (N₂O product):**\n    *   Total products from `n` moles of each salt: n N₂ + n N₂O + (2n+2n) H₂O = n N₂ + n N₂O + 4n H₂O.\n    *   Our results: 0.05 mol N₂, 0.05 mol N₂O, 0.20 mol H₂O.\n    *   Solving for n: `n=0.05`. This gives `4n=0.20`. It's also a perfect match.\n\nBoth valid interpretations lead to the same conclusion: the salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 2 Oxygen (O) = **8 atoms**\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 3 Oxygen (O) = **9 atoms**\n\n*   **Total number of atoms = 8 + 9 = 17**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided answers to determine the correct solution.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Problem and Products**\n\nThe core of the problem is to identify two salts, A and B, by analyzing their gaseous decomposition products. All competent candidate answers correctly follow these initial steps:\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Mg(ClO₄)₂):** Absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to **0.20 mol of H₂O**.\n    *   Calculation: 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂):** No weight change indicates the absence of acidic gases like CO₂.\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** 2.24 L at STP corresponds to **0.10 mol of an inert gas**, which is correctly identified as **Nitrogen (N₂)**.\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** The 0.80 g mass increase is due to oxygen atoms binding to the copper.\n\n### **2. Two Valid Reasoning Paths**\n\nThe candidate answers present two different, but equally valid, interpretations of the reaction in Tube №3 and the overall decomposition. Both paths lead to the same conclusion.\n\n**Path A: The \"N₂O Decomposition\" Model** (Used by Answers 1, 7, 8, 12)\nThis is the more chemically accurate model for the decomposition of ammonium nitrate at 200°C.\n*   **Decomposition:**\n    *   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    *   NH₄NO₃ → N₂O + 2H₂O\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The gas reacting with copper in Tube №3 is nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction is `N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO`.\n    *   The 0.80 g increase (0.05 mol of O atoms) means **0.05 mol of N₂O** was produced.\n    *   The final 0.10 mol of N₂ (Gas C) is the sum of N₂ from NH₄NO₂ decomposition and N₂ from the N₂O reduction. This means the initial decomposition produced **0.05 mol of N₂** and **0.05 mol of N₂O**.\n*   **Conclusion:** An equimolar mixture of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ produces exactly these amounts of gases and 0.20 mol of H₂O.\n\n**Path B: The \"O₂ Decomposition\" Model** (Used by most other answers)\nThis model assumes a different decomposition pathway that directly produces the gases identified in the analysis.\n*   **Decomposition:**\n    *   NH₄NO₂ → N₂ + 2H₂O\n    *   2NH₄NO₃ → 2N₂ + O₂ + 4H₂O\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The gas reacting with copper in Tube №3 is oxygen (O₂). The reaction is `2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO`.\n    *   The 0.80 g increase corresponds to **0.025 mol of O₂**.\n    *   The final gas C is **0.10 mol of N₂**.\n*   **Conclusion:** An equimolar mixture of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃ produces exactly 0.10 mol N₂, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.20 mol H₂O.\n\n### **3. Synthesis and Final Calculation**\n\nBoth logical paths converge on the same conclusion: the two salts are **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\nThe final step is to count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt:\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\n### **4. Final Decision**\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the candidate answers correctly deduce the answer to be 17 through sound chemical reasoning. The provided options are A) 17, B) 19, C) 15, D) 13. Therefore, the correct choice is A.\n\nMany of the candidate answers show a discrepancy between their correct reasoning (which leads to 17) and the final letter they output. However, the analytical work itself is consistent and points unambiguously to 17.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**1.

Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed. This rules out salts containing carbonate or other anions that would produce acidic gases.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** The problem states CuO is formed, meaning the gas passing through contained oxygen atoms that oxidized the copper.

Identify the Salts Using Stoichiometry and Mass Conservation**\n\nLet's use Interpretation A, which is more direct. The products are 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol of an inert gas (Gas C).\n\n*   **Verify Mass Conservation:**\n    *   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g.\n    *   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g.\n    *   Mass of Gas C = Initial Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n    *   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28 g/mol.\n    *   A gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol that is inert in this context is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nThe decomposition products are definitively 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂.

The most common salts that produce these specific gases upon heating are ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrite.\n\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃):** The decomposition at ~200°C is NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂):** The decomposition is NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let's assume it contained 'x' moles of each salt.\n*   From 'x' moles of NH₄NO₃, we get 'x' moles of N₂O and '2x' moles of H₂O.\n*   From 'x' moles of NH₄NO₂, we get 'x' moles of N₂ and '2x' moles of H₂O.\n\nComparing this with our calculated products:\n*   Moles of N₂O = x = 0.05 mol.\n*   Moles of N₂ = x = 0.05 mol.\n*   Total Moles of H₂O = 2x + 2x = 4x. Using x=0.05, we get 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol.\n\nThe value x = 0.05 mol is consistent for all products. This confirms the salts are NH₄NO₃ and NH₄NO₂.\n\n**4. Verify the Initial Mass**\n\nLet's check if 0.05 mol of each salt adds up to 7.20 g.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₃ ≈ 80.0 g/mol.\n*   Molar mass of NH₄NO₂ ≈ 64.0 g/mol.\n*   Total Mass = (0.05 mol * 80.0 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 64.0 g/mol) = 4.00 g + 3.20 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the given initial mass, confirming our identification is correct.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = 9 atoms.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = 8 atoms.\n\nTotal number of atoms = 9 + 8 = 17.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identify and Quantify the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe problem describes the complete decomposition of a 7.20 g salt mixture into gases. These gases are analyzed by passing them through a series of tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution detects acidic gases. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂) were formed.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases. The problem states CuO is formed, meaning the gas contained oxygen. The weight increase of 0.80 g is the mass of oxygen that reacted. There are two common interpretations, both leading to the same final answer:\n    *   **Interpretation A (Simpler):** The gas is molecular oxygen (O₂).\n        *   Molar Mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Interpretation B:** The gas is nitrous oxide (N₂O), which reacts via N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. In this case, the 0.80 g of oxygen (0.05 mol of O atoms) would come from 0.05 mol of N₂O. This path is also valid and leads to the same conclusion. We will proceed with Interpretation A for clarity.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining Gas):** After the reactions, 2.24 L of an inert gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Verify Mass Conservation and Identify Gas C**\n\nThe total mass of the products must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g).\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of Gas C = Total Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n\nNow, we can determine the molar mass of Gas C:\n*   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   An inert gas with a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nSo, the decomposition produced: 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe products (N₂, O₂, H₂O) indicate the original salts contained Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. Since they are salts, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen-containing anions. The most common candidates are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the equimolar mixture consists of these two salts. We need to use decomposition reactions that produce the observed gases.\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate:** 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nThe problem states the mixture is equimolar. Let's assume it contains 'n' moles of each salt.\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₂: produces **n** moles of N₂ and **2n** moles of H₂O.\n*   From 'n' moles of NH₄NO₃ (using the 2:2:1:4 ratio): produces **n** moles of N₂, **0.5n** moles of O₂, and **2n** moles of H₂O.\n\nTotal moles of products from the mixture:\n*   Total N₂ = n + n = **2n**\n*   Total O₂ = **0.5n**\n*   Total H₂O = 2n + 2n = **4n**\n\nNow, we match these expressions with the quantities we calculated in Step 1:\n*   From O₂: 0.5n = 0.025 mol  => **n = 0.05 mol**\n*   Let's check this value with the other products:\n    *   Total N₂ = 2n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol. (This matches our calculation for Gas C).\n    *   Total H₂O = 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. (This matches our calculation from Tube №1).\n\nThe value n = 0.05 mol is consistent for all products, confirming the salts are NH₄NO₂ and NH₄NO₃.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 2 Oxygen atoms = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen atoms + 4 Hydrogen atoms + 3 Oxygen atoms = **9 atoms**.\n\nThe total number of atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit:\nTotal Atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Gaseous Products and Their Molar Quantities**\n\nThe problem describes the complete decomposition of a salt mixture into gases, which are then analyzed.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution detects acidic gases. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂) were formed.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing gases by removing oxygen. The problem states CuO is formed, and the tube's weight increased by 0.80 g. This mass increase is due to the oxygen atoms that reacted.\n    *   This means 0.80 g of oxygen was present in the gas mixture that entered tube 3. This could be in the form of O₂ or another oxygen-containing gas like N₂O.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After all reactions, 2.24 L of a gas remains at standard temperature and pressure (STP). This gas is inert to all previous reagents.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n\n**2. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Original Mixture**\n\nWe can determine the total moles of each element (N, H, O) in the original 7.20 g sample by using the law of conservation of mass. A robust method is to identify all final products and sum their masses.\n\n*   Let's test the hypothesis that the products of the initial decomposition were H₂O, O₂, and N₂.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g (from tube 1).\n*   The mass increase in tube 3 (0.80 g) is the mass of the O₂ gas that reacted (2Cu + O₂ -> 2CuO). So, Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g. Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n*   The remaining gas C is N₂. Moles of N₂ = 0.10 mol. Mass of N₂ = 0.10 mol * 28.0 g/mol = 2.80 g.\n*   Let's check the total mass: Mass(H₂O) + Mass(O₂) + Mass(N₂) = 3.60 g + 0.80 g + 2.80 g = 7.20 g.\n*   This matches the initial mass perfectly. Therefore, the initial decomposition produced **0.20 mol H₂O**, **0.025 mol O₂**, and **0.10 mol N₂**.\n\nNow, let's find the total moles of each element in the mixture:\n*   **Moles of Hydrogen (H):** 2 × Moles of H₂O = 2 × 0.20 mol = 0.40 mol.\n*   **Moles of Nitrogen (N):** 2 × Moles of N₂ = 2 × 0.10 mol = 0.20 mol.\n*   **Moles of Oxygen (O):** (1 × Moles of H₂O) + (2 × Moles of O₂) = (1 × 0.20) + (2 × 0.025) = 0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25 mol.\n\nThe molar ratio of elements in the entire mixture is N : H : O = 0.20 : 0.40 : 0.25. To get an integer ratio, multiply by 20: **N₄ : H₈ : O₅**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe problem states we have an equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B. The combined formula for one unit of A and one unit of B is N₄H₈O₅. Since the salts contain N, H, and O, they are likely ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n\n*   Let's try to split N₄H₈O₅ into two plausible salt formulas.\n*   The 8 hydrogen atoms suggest two ammonium ions (NH₄⁺), which together have the formula N₂H₈.\n*   Subtracting this from the total gives the formula for the two anions: N₄H₈O₅ - N₂H₈ = N₂O₅.\n*   We need to split N₂O₅ into two common nitrogen oxyanions. The most common are nitrate (NO₃⁻) and nitrite (NO₂⁻).\n*   (NO₃⁻) + (NO₂⁻) = N₂O₅. This is a perfect match.\n\nTherefore, the two salts are:\n*   **Salt A: Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**\n*   **Salt B: Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂)**\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of all atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt A (NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 3 Oxygen (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\n*   **Atoms in Salt B (NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 2 Oxygen (O) = **8 atoms**.\n\n*   **Total number of atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B)**\n    *   Total = 9 + 8 = **17 atoms**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identify and Quantify the Gaseous Products**\n\nThe problem describes the complete decomposition of a 7.20 g salt mixture into gases, which are then analyzed.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution detects acidic gases (like CO₂). Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases were formed.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** The weight increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of CuO. This mass increase corresponds to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n    *   This implies that an oxidizing gas containing 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms passed through the tube. There are two common interpretations for this, both of which lead to the same final answer:\n        *   **Interpretation A:** The gas is nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction is N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. This means **0.05 mol of N₂O** was present. This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂.\n        *   **Interpretation B:** The gas is molecular oxygen (O₂). The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. This means **0.025 mol of O₂** (which contains 0.05 mol of O atoms) was present.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** 2.24 liters of an inert gas remained at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Deduce the Initial Gas Mixture Composition**\n\nWe can use the two interpretations from the previous step to determine the initial mix of gases produced by the decomposition.\n\n*   **Following Interpretation A (N₂O was the oxidizing gas):**\n    *   The final 0.10 mol of N₂ (Gas C) is composed of N₂ produced from the N₂O reaction (0.05 mol) and any N₂ produced in the initial decomposition.\n    *   Initial N₂ = Total N₂ - N₂ from N₂O = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   Therefore, the decomposition produced: **0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂**.\n\n*   **Following Interpretation B (O₂ was the oxidizing gas):**\n    *   The final 0.10 mol of N₂ (Gas C) is simply the N₂ that was produced in the initial decomposition and passed through all tubes unreacted.\n    *   Therefore, the decomposition produced: **0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂**.\n\nA quick check of the total mass for both interpretations confirms they are correct:\n*   Mass A = (0.20 * 18) + (0.05 * 44) + (0.05 * 28) = 3.6 + 2.2 + 1.4 = 7.20 g.\n*   Mass B = (0.20 * 18) + (0.025 * 32) + (0.10 * 28) = 3.6 + 0.8 + 2.8 = 7.20 g.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe products (containing N, H, and O) and the fact that the initial substances are salts strongly suggest they are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions. The mixture is equimolar. Let's test the most likely candidates, ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃), against both interpretations.\n\n*   **Testing against Interpretation A's products (0.05 mol N₂, 0.05 mol N₂O, 0.2 mol H₂O):**\n    *   Decomposition of NH₄NO₂: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   Decomposition of NH₄NO₃ (at 200°C): NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   An equimolar mixture of `n` moles of each would produce `n` mol N₂, `n` mol N₂O, and `4n` mol H₂O. This 1:1:4 ratio perfectly matches the products if `n = 0.05` mol.\n\n*   **Testing against Interpretation B's products (0.10 mol N₂, 0.025 mol O₂, 0.2 mol H₂O):**\n    *   Decomposition of NH₄NO₂: NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   Alternative decomposition of NH₄NO₃: 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n    *   An equimolar mixture of `n` moles of each would produce `2n` mol N₂, `0.5n` mol O₂, and `4n` mol H₂O. This 4:1:8 ratio perfectly matches the products if `n = 0.05` mol.\n\nBoth logical paths correctly identify the salts as **Ammonium Nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 2 Oxygen = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** 2 Nitrogen + 4 Hydrogen + 3 Oxygen = **9 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThe analysis of the candidate answers concluded that the two salts in the equimolar mixture are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nThe Python script was executed to verify the final calculation. The code successfully parsed the chemical formulas and performed the atom count:\n*   Salt A (NH₄NO₂) contains 8 atoms.\n*   Salt B (NH₄NO₃) contains 9 atoms.\n\nThe total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt is the sum of these two values, which is 8 + 9 = 17. This result corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 16:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Identify the Gaseous Products and Their Molar Quantities**\n\nThe problem provides data from passing the decomposition gases through a series of analytical tubes.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This solution detects acidic gases. Since its weight did not change, no acidic gases (like CO₂) were formed.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** The problem states CuO was formed, and the tube's weight increased by 0.80 g. This increase is due to the mass of oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper. There are two common interpretations of the oxidizing gas, but both lead to the same final answer.\n    *   **Interpretation A (Gas is O₂):** The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. The mass increase of 0.80 g is from oxygen gas.\n        *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = **0.025 mol**.\n    *   **Interpretation B (Gas is N₂O):** The reaction is Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂. The mass increase of 0.80 g is from oxygen atoms.\n        *   Atomic mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n        *   Since one mole of N₂O contains one mole of O atoms, this means **0.05 mol of N₂O** reacted. This reaction also produces 0.05 mol of N₂.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** 2.24 L of an inert gas remains at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n**2. Verify Mass Conservation and Identify Gas C**\n\nLet's check if the mass of the products equals the initial mass of 7.20 g.\n*   Mass of H₂O = 3.60 g\n*   Mass of O₂ = 0.80 g\n*   Mass of Gas C = Initial Mass - Mass(H₂O) - Mass(O₂) = 7.20 g - 3.60 g - 0.80 g = 2.80 g.\n*   Molar Mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.10 mol = 28.0 g/mol.\n*   A gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol that is inert in this context is nitrogen (N₂).\n\nSo, the decomposition produced **0.20 mol H₂O**, **0.025 mol O₂**, and **0.10 mol N₂**.\n\n**3. Identify Salts A and B**\n\nThe products (N₂, O₂, H₂O) indicate the original salts contained Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen. The most plausible candidates are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids, specifically ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the equimolar mixture contains `n` moles of NH₄NO₂ and `n` moles of NH₄NO₃. We need decomposition reactions that yield N₂, O₂, and H₂O.\n\n*   **Salt A (NH₄NO₂):** `NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)`\n*   **Salt B (NH₄NO₃):** `2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)`\n\nNow, let's calculate the total moles of products from `n` moles of each salt:\n*   **Total N₂:** `n` (from A) + `n` (from B) = `2n`\n*   **Total O₂:** `0.5n` (from B)\n*   **Total H₂O:** `2n` (from A) + `2n` (from B) = `4n`\n\nWe can solve for `n` using our experimental product quantities:\n*   From O₂: `0.5n` = 0.025 mol  => **`n` = 0.05 mol**\n*   From N₂: `2n` = 0.10 mol    => **`n` = 0.05 mol**\n*   From H₂O: `4n` = 0.20 mol   => **`n` = 0.05 mol**\n\nThe value `n = 0.05` is consistent across all products. This confirms the salts are ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe final step is to count the total number of atoms in one formula unit of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 2 Oxygen (O) = **8 atoms**\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 3 Oxygen (O) = **9 atoms**\n\n*   **Total number of atoms** = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 19\nB) 13\nC) 15\nD) 17\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 17:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided candidate solutions.\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Experimental Data**\n\nThe core of the problem is to identify the gaseous products and their quantities. All sound analyses follow this initial step.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This tube absorbs water. The mass increase of 3.60 g is the mass of H₂O produced.\n    *   Molar Mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = **0.20 mol**.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** The weight did not change, indicating no acidic gases (like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂) were formed.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** The weight increased by 0.80 g due to the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This mass increase is from the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Atomic Mass of O ≈ 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Oxygen atoms = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = **0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas C:** 2.24 L of an inert gas were collected at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\n    *   Molar Volume at STP = 22.4 L/mol.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = **0.10 mol**.\n\n### **2. Identification of the Gaseous Products**\n\nThere are two valid interpretations of the reaction in Tube №3, both of which lead to the same final answer.\n\n**Interpretation A (More Chemically Plausible):**\nThe gas reacting with hot copper is nitrous oxide (N₂O). The reaction is: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO.\n*   This reaction shows that 0.05 mol of O atoms came from **0.05 mol of N₂O**.\n*   This reaction also produced 0.05 mol of N₂.\n*   The final Gas C (0.10 mol) is the sum of N₂ from this reaction and any N₂ from the initial decomposition.\n*   Therefore, N₂ from initial decomposition = 0.10 mol (total) - 0.05 mol (from N₂O) = **0.05 mol**.\n*   **Initial Gas Mixture:** 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.05 mol N₂O, and 0.05 mol N₂.\n\n**Interpretation B (Mathematically Consistent):**\nThe gas reacting with hot copper is molecular oxygen (O₂). The reaction is: O₂ + 2Cu → 2CuO.\n*   0.80 g of oxygen corresponds to 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = **0.025 mol of O₂**.\n*   The inert Gas C is identified as **0.10 mol of N₂** by calculating its mass (7.20g - 3.60g - 0.80g = 2.80g) and molar mass (2.80g / 0.1mol = 28 g/mol).\n*   **Initial Gas Mixture:** 0.20 mol H₂O, 0.025 mol O₂, and 0.10 mol N₂.\n\n### **3. Identification of Salts A and B**\n\nBoth interpretations point to the same two salts. The products contain only N, H, and O, suggesting ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyanions.\n\n*   **Using Interpretation A's products (N₂, N₂O, H₂O):**\n    *   The decomposition reactions that produce this mixture are:\n        *   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n        *   NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n    *   For an equimolar mixture of 'n' moles each, we expect n moles of N₂, n moles of N₂O, and 4n moles of H₂O.\n    *   Our calculated products (0.05 mol N₂, 0.05 mol N₂O, 0.20 mol H₂O) perfectly match this for **n = 0.05 mol**.\n\n*   **Using Interpretation B's products (N₂, O₂, H₂O):**\n    *   The decomposition reactions that produce this mixture are:\n        *   NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n        *   2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n    *   For an equimolar mixture of 'n' moles each, we expect 2n moles of N₂, 0.5n moles of O₂, and 4n moles of H₂O.\n    *   Our calculated products (0.10 mol N₂, 0.025 mol O₂, 0.20 mol H₂O) perfectly match this for **n = 0.05 mol**.\n\nBoth paths correctly identify the mixture as **0.05 mol of ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and 0.05 mol of ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)**.\n\n### **4. Verification of Mass**\n\nLet's confirm the total mass is 7.20 g.\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ ≈ 64.0 g/mol.\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ ≈ 80.0 g/mol.\n*   Total Mass = (0.05 mol * 64.0 g/mol) + (0.05 mol * 80.0 g/mol) = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = **7.20 g**.\nThe mass is correct.\n\n### **5. Final Calculation: Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in the chemical formulas of salts A and B.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite, NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 2 Oxygen (O) = **8 atoms**.\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate, NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   2 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 3 Oxygen (O) = **9 atoms**.\n\nTotal number of atoms = 8 + 9 = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D. A review of the candidate answers shows that while many contain correct reasoning, they often select the wrong final letter. The consistent result from all valid derivations is 17.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",
