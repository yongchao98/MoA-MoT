This is a random quantum process that follows an exponential distribution. The most crucial characteristic of this process is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of the atom decaying in a future time interval is completely independent of how long it has already existed without decaying.\n\n2.  **Apply the Memoryless Property:** The problem states that 50 minutes have already passed without the atom decaying. Due to the memoryless property, this information is irrelevant to the atom's future behavior. The question, \"What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?\" is equivalent to the simpler question, \"What is the probability a new atom of this type will decay within a 150-minute interval?\"\n\n3.  **Formulate the Mathematical Model:**\n    *   Let `S(t)` be the probability that the atom *survives* (does not decay) for a time `t`.

This is `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information:** We are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   `P(100) = 0.32`\n    *   This means the survival probability for 100 minutes is `S(100) = 1 - P(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n    *   From the formula, we have the key relationship: `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability:** We need to find the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval, which is `P(150)`.\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-150λ)`.\n    *   We can find the value of `e^(-150λ)` by using the relationship from Step 4 and the rules of exponents:\n        `e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n    *   Now, substitute the known value:\n        `e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    *   First, calculate the survival probability for 150 minutes: `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`.\n    *   Next, calculate the decay probability by subtracting the survival probability from 1:\n        `P(150) = 1 - S(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The calculated probability is 0.4393, which is 43.93%.

Ignoring it and attempting a more complex conditional probability calculation would be incorrect. The 50 minutes of survival time is extraneous information intended to test the understanding of this principle.\n*   **Decay vs. Survival:** It is essential to be precise when switching between decay probability `P(t)` and survival probability `S(t)`. The initial data is given as decay probability, which must be converted to survival probability to use the `e^(-λt)` formula directly. The final answer also requires converting the calculated survival probability back to a decay probability.\n*   **Exponent Manipulation:** The most elegant and accurate way to solve the problem is to manipulate the exponential terms (i.e., `e^(-150λ) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`) rather than explicitly calculating the numerical value of the decay constant `λ`, which would involve logarithms and could introduce rounding errors.\n*   **Accuracy:** The final numerical calculation must be performed with sufficient precision to confidently choose the correct option from the list, as 43.93% is clearly closest to 44%.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the final, correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle:** The problem describes the decay of a single radioactive atom. This process is governed by an exponential distribution, which has a key property: it is **memoryless**.

The most critical concept for this problem is that this process is **memoryless**. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of its past history. The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not make it \"older\" or more likely to decay.

The most important characteristic of this process is that it is **memoryless**.\n\n*   **Memoryless Property:** This means the probability of the atom decaying in a future time interval is completely independent of how long it has already existed. The atom does not \"age\" or get \"weaker\". Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is extraneous information designed to test the understanding of this principle. The problem is equivalent to asking: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay within a 150-minute interval?\"\n\n### Step 2: Set up the Mathematical Model\nThe probability of a radioactive atom surviving for a time `t` is described by the exponential decay law:\n*   `S(t) = e^(-λt)`\nWhere `S(t)` is the survival probability, `λ` (lambda) is the decay constant for this specific type of atom, and `t` is time.\n\nThe probability of the atom decaying within time `t`, let's call it `P(t)`, is the complement of the survival probability:\n*   `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n### Step 3: Use the Given Information to Find a Key Parameter\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n*   `P(100) = 0.32`\n\nUsing our formula, this means:\n*   `1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n\nFrom this, we can determine the survival probability for 100 minutes:\n*   `e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\nThis relationship gives us the value of the exponential term for `t=100`, which is all we need for the next step.

This is a quantum mechanical process that is fundamentally random and \"memoryless.\" The memoryless property is the most critical concept for this problem. It means that the probability of the atom decaying in any future time interval is completely independent of how long it has already existed without decaying. The atom does not \"age\" or become \"more likely\" to decay over time.\n\n2.  **Apply the Memoryless Property to the Problem:** The problem states that 50 minutes have passed without the atom decaying. Because of the memoryless property, this information is irrelevant to the atom's future behavior. The question, \"What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?\" is mathematically equivalent to the simpler question, \"What is the probability a new atom of this type will decay in a 150-minute interval?\"\n\n3.  **Set Up the Mathematical Model:** Radioactive decay follows an exponential law.\n    *   Let `S(t)` be the probability that the atom *survives* (does not decay) for a duration `t`. This is given by `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant specific to this type of atom.\n    *   Let `P(t)` be the probability that the atom *decays* within a duration `t`. This is `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n4.  **Use the Given Data to Find a Key Parameter:** We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   `P(100) = 0.32`\n    *   This implies that the probability of *survival* for 100 minutes is `S(100) = 1 - P(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n    *   From our model, we have the relationship: `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`. This gives us a handle on the decay characteristics without needing to explicitly calculate `λ`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability:** We need to find the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval, which is `P(150)`.\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n    *   We can find the value of `e^(-λ * 150)` by using the relationship from the previous step. Using the rules of exponents, we can write:\n        `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    *   Now, we substitute the value we found in Step 4:\n        `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    *   First, calculate the survival probability for 150 minutes: `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`.\n    *   Next, calculate the decay probability for 150 minutes: `P(150) = 1 - S(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`.\n\n7.  **Compare with the Options:** The calculated probability is `0.4393`, which is 43.93%.

Forgetting this principle would lead to an incorrect and overly complicated conditional probability calculation. The 50 minutes of survival time is extraneous information designed specifically to test the understanding of this concept.\n*   **Decay vs. Survival Probability:** It is crucial to distinguish between the probability of decay (`P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`) and the probability of survival (`S(t) = e^(-λt)`). The initial information is given as a decay probability, which must be converted to a survival probability to proceed with the exponent manipulation.\n*   **Exponent Manipulation:** The calculation is significantly simplified by manipulating the exponents (`e^(-150λ) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`) rather than explicitly calculating `λ` with logarithms, which could introduce intermediate rounding errors.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

This is `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information:** We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (0.32).\n    *   `P(100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n    *   From this, we can determine the probability of *survival* for 100 minutes:\n    *   `S(100) = e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability:** We need to find the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval, `P(150)`.\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n    *   We can find the value of `S(150)` by using the relationship we found in the previous step. Using the rules of exponents:\n    *   `S(150) = e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    *   Now, substitute the value for `S(100)`:\n    *   `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation:**\n    *   First, calculate the survival probability for 150 minutes: `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n    *   Next, calculate the decay probability for 150 minutes: `P(150) = 1 - S(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The calculated probability is approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%.

The 50 minutes of survival time is extraneous information intended to test the understanding of this principle. Any calculation that tries to incorporate the 50 minutes (e.g., by calculating a conditional probability in a complex way) is unnecessarily complicated and, if done incorrectly, will lead to the wrong answer.\n*   **Decay vs. Survival:** It is essential to distinguish between the probability of decay `P(t)` and the probability of survival `S(t)`. The initial information is given as a decay probability, which must be converted to a survival probability (`1 - 0.32 = 0.68`) to proceed with the exponent manipulation.\n*   **Exponent Manipulation:** The most elegant and accurate way to solve the problem is to use the relationship `S(150) = S(100)^1.5`. Explicitly solving for the decay constant `λ` using logarithms is possible but can introduce rounding errors if not handled carefully.\n*   **Matching the Final Answer:** The final calculated value is `~43.93%`. This must be correctly matched to the closest option, which is 44%. Several of the candidate answers performed the calculation correctly but failed at this final mapping step.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Core Principle: The Memoryless Property**\nThe most critical concept for this problem is that radioactive decay is a \"memoryless\" process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed without decaying. The atom does not \"age\" or get \"weaker\". Therefore, the fact that 50 minutes have already passed without decay is irrelevant information. The problem simplifies to: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay within a 150-minute interval?\"\n\n**2. Set up the Mathematical Model**\nThe probability of an atom surviving (not decaying) for a time `t` is given by the exponential decay formula:\n*   `S(t) = e^(-λt)`\nwhere `λ` (lambda) is the decay constant specific to the atom.\n\nThe probability of the atom decaying within time `t` is:\n*   `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n**3. Use the Given Information to Find a Key Value**\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n*   `P(100) = 0.32`\n*   `1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n\nFrom this, we can determine the probability of the atom *surviving* for 100 minutes:\n*   `S(100) = e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\nThis relationship is all we need; we don't have to calculate the exact value of `λ`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability for the New Time Interval**\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in a 150-minute interval, which is `P(150)`.\n*   `P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\nWe can find the value of `e^(-λ * 150)` by using the relationship we found in Step 3. Using the properties of exponents:\n*   `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n\nNow, substitute the value from Step 3:\n*   `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n**5. Perform the Final Calculation**\nLet's calculate the value of `(0.68)^1.5`:\n*   `(0.68)^1.5 = 0.68 * √0.68 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607`\n\nThis value, `0.5607`, is the probability of the atom *surviving* for 150 minutes, `S(150)`. The probability of it *decaying* in 150 minutes is:\n*   `P(150) = 1 - S(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n\n**6. Conclusion**\nThe calculated probability is `0.4393`, which is `43.93%`. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 52%\nB) 48%\nC) 44%\nD) 40%\n\nThe value `43.93%` is closest to `44%`.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The most common mistake would be to incorrectly use the 50-minute survival time. The memoryless property makes this information irrelevant.\n*   It is important to distinguish between the probability of decay `P(t)` and the probability of survival `S(t)`.\n*   Using the exponent rule `(x^a)^b = x^(ab)` simplifies the calculation and avoids having to find `λ` with logarithms, which can introduce rounding errors.\n\nAll candidate answers correctly identified the memoryless property and followed the same correct calculation path, arriving at a result of approximately 43.93%. This confirms that 44% is the correct choice.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown and the final decision.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Principle:** The problem describes the decay of a single atomic nucleus.
