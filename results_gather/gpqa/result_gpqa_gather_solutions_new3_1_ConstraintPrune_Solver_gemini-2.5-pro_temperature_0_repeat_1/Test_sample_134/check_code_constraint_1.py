def check_correctness_of_particle_decay():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the proposed answer for the kinematically allowed decays of boson X.

    The core physics principle is that for a decay X -> f + f_bar to be allowed,
    the mass of the boson (m_X) must be greater than or equal to the sum of the masses
    of the decay products (2 * m_f).
    Given m_X = 6 GeV, the condition simplifies to m_f <= 3 GeV.

    This function:
    1. Defines the fermion masses.
    2. Calculates the set of theoretically allowed decays based on the kinematic condition.
    3. Parses the proposed answer (Option B) to get the set of decays it claims are allowed.
    4. Compares the two sets and reports whether the answer is correct or lists the discrepancies.
