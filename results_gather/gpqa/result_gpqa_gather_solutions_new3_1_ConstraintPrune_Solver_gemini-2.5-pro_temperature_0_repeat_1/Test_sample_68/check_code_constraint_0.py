    # --- Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma) ---
    # The Lorentz factor relates the total energy to the rest mass energy.
    # E_total = gamma * m0 * c^2. In units of GeV, this simplifies to E_total = gamma * m0.
    gamma = E_total_GeV / m0_GeV

    # --- Step 2: Calculate the particle's momentum (p) ---
    # The relativistic energy-momentum relation is E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m0c^2)^2.
    # In units of GeV, this is (pc)^2 = E_total^2 - m0^2.
    pc_squared_GeV2 = E_total_GeV**2 - m0_GeV**2
    pc_GeV = math.sqrt(pc_squared_GeV2)

    # --- Step 3: Calculate the mean decay length (lambda) in the lab frame ---
    # The mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying.
    # A precise formula is lambda = (p/m0) * c * tau_0 = (pc / m0c^2) * c * tau_0.
    # Using values in GeV, this becomes (pc_GeV / m0_GeV) * c * tau_0_s.
    mean_decay_length_m = (pc_GeV / m0_GeV) * c * tau_0_s

    # --- Step 4: Calculate the required resolution ---
    # To "observe" a decay, the particle must travel a distance 'd' greater than the resolution 'L_res'.
    # The probability of a particle traveling a distance 'd' or more is P(d) = exp(-d / lambda).
    # We need P(d >= L_res) >= 0.30, which means exp(-L_res / lambda) >= 0.30.
    # Taking the natural log: -L_res / lambda >= ln(0.30).
    # Multiplying by -lambda reverses the inequality: L_res <= -lambda * ln(0.30).
    # The "minimum resolution needed" is interpreted as the least stringent requirement,
    # i.e., the largest possible resolution that still satisfies the condition.
    # This corresponds to the boundary condition:
    max_allowed_resolution_m = -mean_decay_length_m * math.log(prob_threshold)

    # --- Step 5: Verify the LLM's answer ---
    # The correct option must have a value less than or equal to the max_allowed_resolution.
    # Among the valid options, the best choice is the one with the largest value, as it
    # represents the least stringent (i.e., "minimum needed") resolution.

    # Find all options that satisfy the physical constraint
