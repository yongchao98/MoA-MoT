Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem based on the provided answers.

### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question
The question asks for the **key factor** that allows the conversion of a sequential algorithm into a parallel one. The context is very specific:
*   **Problem:** Solving higher-dimensional heat equations.
*   **Method:** Using higher-order finite difference approximations, which results in a large system of ODEs of the form `dU/dt = AU`.
*   **Core Calculation:** The solution involves the matrix exponential `exp(A)`, which is approximated by a "fractional approximation" (i.e., a rational function `R(A)`).
*   **Goal:** To perform "parallel splitting".

The question is not about what makes the algorithm accurate or stable in general, but specifically what mathematical trick enables the "splitting" for parallel execution.

### Step 2: Analyze the Computational Process
1.  **Sequential Method:** The sequential approach involves calculating `U_new ≈ R(A) * U_old`. If `R(z) = P(z)/Q(z)`, this means solving one large, complex linear system: `Q(A) * U_new = P(A) * U_old`. This is inherently sequential because the matrix `Q(A)` couples all the variables together.
2.  **Parallel Method:** To parallelize this, the single large task must be broken into multiple smaller, **independent** tasks. We need to find the mechanism that achieves this decomposition.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Options based on the Analysis

*   **B) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation:**
    This is a standard mathematical technique to rewrite a rational function `R(z)` as a sum of simpler terms:
    `R(z) = c₀ + Σ [cᵢ / (z - pᵢ)]`
    When applied to the matrix `A`, the calculation `R(A) * U_old` becomes:
    `U_new = c₀*U_old + Σ [cᵢ * (A - pᵢI)⁻¹ * U_old]`
    This means we need to solve for `xᵢ` in `(A - pᵢI)xᵢ = U_old` for each `i`. The crucial point is that each of these linear systems is **independent** of the others. They can be solved simultaneously on different processors. This technique directly "splits" the problem and is the very definition of the parallel algorithm in this context. This is a very strong candidate.

*   **A) Stability analysis:**
    Stability is a critical property that any numerical method (sequential or parallel) must possess to be useful. An unstable method will produce garbage results. However, stability analysis is a *check* on the validity of an algorithm; it is not the *mechanism* that creates the parallel structure. You first devise the parallel structure (using, for example, partial fractions) and then you perform a stability analysis to ensure it works. Therefore, it's a necessary condition for a *good* parallel algorithm, but not the factor that *converts* it to a parallel one.

*   **D) Complex roots of fractional approximation:**
    The poles `pᵢ` in the partial fraction expansion can be real or complex. This is a property of the chosen rational function `R(z)`. While the nature of the roots affects the implementation details (e.g., requiring complex arithmetic), it does not change the fundamental principle of decomposition. The parallel structure exists because of the sum, regardless of whether the terms in the sum involve real or complex numbers. This is a detail, not the key enabling factor.

*   **C) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions:**
    Nonlocal boundary conditions describe the physics of the problem being solved. They typically make the matrix `A` more complex and introduce long-range dependencies. This makes parallelization *harder*, as it requires more communication between processors. It is an obstacle to parallelism, not an enabler.

### Step 4: Synthesize and Conclude
The conversion from a single, large sequential task to multiple, independent parallel tasks is achieved by the algebraic decomposition of the rational operator `R(A)`. The mathematical tool that performs this decomposition is the partial fraction expansion. Therefore, the "linear partial fraction of the fractional approximation" is the direct and fundamental factor that enables the conversion. The vast majority of the provided agent answers support this reasoning, even when their final letter choice is inconsistent.

Final check of the logic:
*   **Constraint:** The factor must enable the conversion from sequential to parallel.
*   **Pass/Fail per constraint:**
    *   A) Stability analysis: Fails. It validates the algorithm, but doesn't create its parallel structure.
    *   B) Linear partial fraction: Passes. It directly decomposes the sequential operator into a sum of independent operators, which is the definition of the parallel algorithm.
    *   C) Nonlocal boundary conditions: Fails. It is a feature of the problem that hinders, not helps, parallelization.
    *   D) Complex roots: Fails. It is a detail of the implementation, not the core principle of parallelization.

The conclusion is robust.
