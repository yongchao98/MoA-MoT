def check_electrodynamics_potentials():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the selected option for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.

    The function defines the correct physical formulas for the scalar (V) and vector (A)
    potentials of a moving point charge using symbolic mathematics. It then defines
    each of the given options (A, B, C, D) symbolically and compares them against the
    correct formulas.

    The key physical principles checked are:
    1. The potential must depend on the retarded position and velocity, not just the
       static distance 'r'. This is captured by the denominator term (dc - d.v).
    2. The sign in the denominator must be negative for retarded (causal) potentials.
    3. The vector potential A must be a vector quantity.
