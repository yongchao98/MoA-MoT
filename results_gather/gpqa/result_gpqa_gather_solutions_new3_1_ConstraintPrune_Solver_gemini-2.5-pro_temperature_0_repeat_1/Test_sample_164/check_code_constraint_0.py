Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct statement.

**Step 1: Deconstruct the Core Chemical Problem**
The task is to create a polyethylene polymer with "regular branches" using only ethylene as the reactant. This requires a tandem catalysis process within a dual-catalyst system:
1.  **Oligomerization Catalyst:** This is the "second catalyst system" to be added. Its function is to perform the "essential additional reaction step," which is to selectively convert some of the ethylene into a specific short-chain alpha-olefin (e.g., trimerizing three ethylene molecules into one 1-hexene molecule). High selectivity is key to getting "regular" branches.
2.  **Polymerization Catalyst:** This is the original catalyst. It must copolymerize the remaining ethylene with the *in-situ* generated alpha-olefin, incorporating it as a branch of a regular length (e.g., incorporating 1-hexene creates a butyl branch).

**Step 2: Evaluate Each Statement**

*   **Statement A: "One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators."**
    *   **Analysis:** Group VIa (or Group 6) contains Chromium (Cr). The state-of-the-art industrial technology for the highly selective trimerization of ethylene to 1-hexene is based on chromium catalysts. These catalysts require co-catalysts, or "specific activators," to function.
    *   **Verdict:** This statement is factually correct and describes the fundamental chemistry of the most successful solution to the problem.

*   **Statement B: "Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive."**
    *   **Analysis:** Catalysts based on noble metals like palladium can produce branched polyethylene from ethylene via a "chain-walking" mechanism. However, this process typically creates a variety of branch types and lengths (e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl), which does not fit the description of "regular branches."
    *   **Verdict:** While the statement is generally true about noble metal catalysts, it is misleading in the context of producing *regular* branches, which implies a comonomer incorporation mechanism, not chain-walking.

*   **Statement C: "Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step."**
    *   **Analysis:** The "essential additional reaction step" is the oligomerization of ethylene. The chromium-based catalysts described in the analysis of statement A are almost universally activated by aluminum-based compounds, such as methylaluminoxane (MAO) or trialkylaluminums. Far from not working, they are essential.
    *   **Verdict:** This statement is factually incorrect.

*   **Statement D: "Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US."**
    *   **Analysis:** The core technologies—selective ethylene oligomerization and polyethylene production—are indeed implemented on an industrial scale in the US by companies like Chevron Phillips and Sasol. However, the term "combined systems" is ambiguous. It could imply a single reactor where both reactions occur simultaneously. While this is a subject of intense research, the dominant industrial practice often involves separate reactors for oligomerization and polymerization.
    *   **Verdict:** This statement is factually correct in a broad sense, but its accuracy hinges on a potentially ambiguous interpretation of "combined systems."

**Step 3: Select the Best Answer**
We have identified one statement that is definitively false (C) and one that is misleading in context (B). We are left with two correct statements, A and D. In a single-choice question, we must select the best option.

*   Statement A is a direct, unambiguous statement about the fundamental chemistry required. It describes the specific type of catalyst that enables the key transformation.
*   Statement D is a statement about industrial practice that is true but contains ambiguity. The industrial reality is complex (e.g., dual-reactor vs. single-reactor systems), making the general claim about "combined systems" less precise than the chemical fact in statement A.

Therefore, statement A is the most robustly and fundamentally correct answer. It provides the key piece of chemical information that solves the scientist's problem, and it is not subject to the ambiguity present in statement D.
