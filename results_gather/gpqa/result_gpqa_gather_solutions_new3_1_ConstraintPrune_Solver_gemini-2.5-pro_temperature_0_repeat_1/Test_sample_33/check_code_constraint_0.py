    # --- Step 1: Derive the correct products based on chemical principles ---

    # Reaction A: 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol
    # Principle 1 (Carbocation Stability): The carbocation at C4 is tertiary and benzylic, making it more stable than the tertiary carbocation at C3.
    # Principle 2 (Migratory Aptitude): The groups on C3 are methyl and ethyl. Ethyl has a higher migratory aptitude than methyl.
    # Derived Product A:
    correct_product_A = "3-ethyl-3-phenylpentan-2-one"

    # Reaction B: 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylpentane-2,3-diol
    # Principle 1 (Carbocation Stability): The carbocation at C3 is stabilized by a 4-hydroxyphenyl group (strong electron-donating), making it more stable than the carbocation at C2 (stabilized by a simple phenyl group).
    # Principle 2 (Migratory Aptitude): The groups on C2 are methyl and phenyl. Phenyl has a much higher migratory aptitude than methyl.
    # Derived Product B:
    correct_product_B = "3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylpentan-2-one"

    # Reaction C: 1,1,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethane-1,2-diol
    # Principle 1 (Carbocation Stability): The carbocation at C1 is stabilized by two electron-donating 4-methoxyphenyl groups, making it more stable than the carbocation at C2 (stabilized by one 4-methoxyphenyl and one phenyl group).
    # Principle 2 (Migratory Aptitude): The groups on C2 are 4-methoxyphenyl and phenyl. The 4-methoxyphenyl group has a higher migratory aptitude due to its electron-donating nature.
    # Derived Product C:
    correct_product_C = "2,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylethan-1-one"
