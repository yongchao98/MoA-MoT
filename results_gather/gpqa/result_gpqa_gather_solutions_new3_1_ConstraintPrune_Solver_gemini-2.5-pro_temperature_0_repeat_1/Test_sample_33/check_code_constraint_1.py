def check_pinacol_rearrangement():

    This function checks the correctness of the products for three Pinacol rearrangement reactions

    It simulates the two key steps of the reaction:
    1. Formation of the most stable carbocation.
    2. 1,2-shift of the group with the highest migratory aptitude.

    It then compares the predicted product structure with the one described in option D.
