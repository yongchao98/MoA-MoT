    Checks the derivation for the number of stars per unit parallax.

    The derivation follows these steps:
    1. The number of stars dN in a thin shell of radius d and thickness dd is
       dN = rho * dV = rho * (4 * pi * d**2) * dd.
       So, the number per unit distance, dN/dd, is proportional to d**2.
    2. Distance d is inversely proportional to parallax plx: d = 1/plx.
    3. The chain rule is used to find dN/d(plx):
       dN/d(plx) = (dN/dd) * (dd/d(plx)).
    4. We substitute d=1/plx into dN/dd and multiply by the derivative dd/d(plx).
