    # --- Physics Calculation ---
    # The derivation from conservation of energy and momentum leads to the formula for cos(theta),
    # where theta is the angle of one photon with the horizontal axis.
    #
    # 1. Conservation of Energy:
    #    E_initial = (gamma_e + gamma_p) * m * c^2
    #    E_final = 2 * E_photon
    #    => E_photon = (gamma_e + gamma_p) / 2 * m * c^2
    #
    # 2. Conservation of Momentum (x-direction):
    #    P_initial_x = (sqrt(gamma_e^2 - 1) - sqrt(gamma_p^2 - 1)) * m * c
    #    P_final_x = 2 * p_photon * cos(theta) = 2 * (E_photon / c) * cos(theta)
    #
    # 3. Equating and simplifying gives:
    #    cos(theta) = (sqrt(gamma_e^2 - 1) - sqrt(gamma_p^2 - 1)) / (gamma_e + gamma_p)
