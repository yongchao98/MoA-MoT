Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.

**1. Deconstruct the Question**
The core of the question is to identify the molecular mechanism that makes the symptoms of Klinefelter's syndrome (47,XXY) less severe than those of Down's syndrome (Trisomy 21). This means we are not looking for the cause of the syndromes (which is nondisjunction during meiosis), but rather for a process that happens *after* fertilization to manage the extra chromosome.

**2. Analyze the Biological Difference Between the Syndromes**
*   **Klinefelter's Syndrome:** An extra **sex chromosome** (X).
*   **Down's Syndrome:** An extra **autosome** (chromosome 21).
The fundamental difference in how the body handles these two types of extra chromosomes is the key to the answer.

**3. Identify the Relevant Biological Principle**
In mammals, there is a natural process called **X-chromosome inactivation (XCI)**, or Lyonization. This mechanism ensures that males (XY) and females (XX) have a similar "dose" of X-chromosome genes. In every cell of an individual with more than one X chromosome (like XX females or XXY males), all but one X chromosome are epigenetically silenced and condensed into a structure called a Barr body.

*   In an individual with Klinefelter's syndrome (XXY), one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated. This largely normalizes the gene dosage, making it similar to a typical XY male. This is why the phenotype is less severe.
*   In an individual with Down's syndrome (Trisomy 21), there is no equivalent mechanism to inactivate an entire autosome. All three copies of chromosome 21 remain active, leading to a significant overexpression of genes, which causes a more severe phenotype.

**4. Evaluate the Options Based on the Molecular Mechanism of XCI**
X-chromosome inactivation is an epigenetic process that occurs early in embryonic development (post-zygote). It involves several molecular steps to silence the chromosome. We need to find the option that describes one of these steps.

*   **A) chiasmata resolution by separase in diakinesis:** This is a step in meiosis. An error here can *cause* aneuploidy but does not explain the difference in severity *after* fertilization. This is incorrect.
*   **B) progression of the polymerase alpha in the morula/blastocyst:** This relates to DNA replication, a general process required for all cell division. It is not the specific mechanism for silencing an extra chromosome. This is incorrect.
*   **C) attachment of spindle to kinetochores in the metaphase I:** Like option A, this is a step in meiosis where errors can *cause* aneuploidy. It does not explain the subsequent phenotypic differences. This is incorrect.
*   **D) chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases in the post-zygote:** This is a key molecular event in X-chromosome inactivation. Histone methyltransferases are enzymes that add methyl groups to histone proteins, a critical modification that leads to chromatin condensation and gene silencing. This process occurs "post-zygote" (in the early embryo), which is the correct timing for XCI. This option perfectly describes the mechanism responsible for mitigating the effects of the extra X chromosome in Klinefelter's syndrome.

**Conclusion**
The analysis of the candidate answers shows a strong consensus in reasoning: the milder phenotype of Klinefelter's syndrome is due to X-chromosome inactivation. The molecular basis for this is epigenetic silencing, for which chromatin methylation is a cornerstone. Option D is the only choice that accurately describes this process.
