def check_correctness():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the final answer based on the physics principles described in the question.

    The problem asks to compare the transit probabilities of two planets.
    - Transit probability (p_tr) is proportional to R_s / a, where R_s is the star's radius and 'a' is the semi-major axis.
    - From Kepler's Third Law, a is proportional to (M_s * P^2)^(1/3), where M_s is the star's mass and P is the orbital period.

    Given information:
    - R_s1 = R_s2
    - M_s1 = 2 * M_s2
    - P1 = P2 / 3  => P2 = 3 * P1

    The ratio of probabilities is:
    p1 / p2 = (R_s1 / a1) / (R_s2 / a2)
    Since R_s1 = R_s2, this simplifies to:
    p1 / p2 = a2 / a1

    The ratio of semi-major axes is:
    a2 / a1 = [ (M_s2 * P2^2) / (M_s1 * P1^2) ]^(1/3)
    a2 / a1 = [ (M_s2 * (3*P1)^2) / ((2*M_s2) * P1^2) ]^(1/3)
    a2 / a1 = [ (9 * M_s2 * P1^2) / (2 * M_s2 * P1^2) ]^(1/3)
    a2 / a1 = (9 / 2)^(1/3) = 4.5^(1/3)
