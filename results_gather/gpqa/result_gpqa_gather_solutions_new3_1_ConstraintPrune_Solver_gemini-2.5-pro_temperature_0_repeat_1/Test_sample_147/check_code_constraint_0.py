    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer to the chemistry puzzle.
    It verifies the logical and mathematical steps of the proposed "Gold (Au) Hypothesis".
    The steps checked are:
    1. The mass percentage calculation for the proposed compound A2 (AuF₅).
    2. The identification of A4 as AuF₂ based on the described reaction.
    3. The calculation of the molecular weight of A4 (AuF₂).
    4. The verification that this molecular weight falls into the chosen answer range (A: 220-240).
