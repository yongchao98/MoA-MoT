def check_biology_riddle_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the biology riddle.

    The riddle describes the secretory pathway for a protein:
    1.  Meeting: A Signal Recognition Particle (SRP, a ribonucleoprotein) meets a
        nascent protein chain on a ribosome. This occurs in the CYTOSOL.
    2.  Journey: The SRP guides the complex to the Rough ER ("somewhat rough"),
        where the protein is glycosylated ("needs some sugar").
    3.  Destination: The protein enters the secretory pathway, with a primary
        final destination being secretion from the cell into the EXTRACELLULAR SPACE.

    Therefore, the correct path is "cytosol to the extracellular space".
