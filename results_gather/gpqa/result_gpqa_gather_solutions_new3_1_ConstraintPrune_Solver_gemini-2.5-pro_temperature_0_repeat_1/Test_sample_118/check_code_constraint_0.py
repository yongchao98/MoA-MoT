    # --- Analysis and Constraint Derivation ---

    # Constraint 1: Number of Methyl Groups
    # The starting material is "5-bromo-3a,4a-dimethyldecahydro...". The prefix "dimethyl" indicates 2 methyl groups.
    # The reaction sequence is:
    # 1. + H2O -> Alcohol (no change in methyls)
    # 2. + PDC -> Ketone (no change in methyls)
    # 3. + H2CPPh3 (Wittig) -> Alkene (adds a =CH2 group, not a methyl group)
    # 4. + TsOH (Acid) -> Rearranged Alkene. The acid protonates the =CH2 group to form a -C(+)-CH3 group.
    # This sequence adds exactly one methyl group to the molecule.
    # Therefore, the expected final methyl count = 2 (original) + 1 (new) = 3.
    
    def get_methyl_count(name):
        name = name.lower()
        if "dimethyl" in name: return 2
        if "trimethyl" in name: return 3
        if "tetramethyl" in name: return 4
        return 0

    # Constraint 2: Skeletal Rearrangement
    # The starting material contains a "cyclobuta" ring, which is highly strained.
    # The final step (TsOH) involves forming a carbocation adjacent to this strained ring.
    # There is a strong thermodynamic driving force for a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement
    # to expand the 4-membered ring into a more stable 5-membered ring, relieving strain.
    # Therefore, the final product should have a rearranged skeleton, and the "cyclobuta"
    # part of the name should be gone, replaced by a more stable system like "pentalene" (fused 5-membered rings).
    
    def has_rearranged_skeleton(name):
        name = name.lower()
        # A rearranged product should NOT contain the original strained 'cyclobuta' ring.
        # A plausible rearranged product would be a 'pentalene' derivative.
        if "pentalene" in name and "cyclobuta" not in name:
            return True
        # If it still has 'cyclobuta', it has not undergone the expected rearrangement.
