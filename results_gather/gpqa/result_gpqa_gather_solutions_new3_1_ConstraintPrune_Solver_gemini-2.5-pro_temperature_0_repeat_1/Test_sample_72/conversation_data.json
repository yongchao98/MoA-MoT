Relative Speed (v_rel)**\n\nTo find the relative speed between the two astronauts, we use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. Let the velocities of the two astronauts be v1 = 0.6c and v2 = 0.5c. The formula for the relative velocity (v_rel) is:\n\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c²)\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\nv_rel ≈ 0.1428c\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n**2.

Let the velocities of the two astronauts be v₁ = 0.6c and v₂ = 0.5c in the same direction. The relative velocity (v_rel) of the second astronaut with respect to the first is given by:\n\nv_rel = (v₁ - v₂) / (1 - (v₁ * v₂) / c²)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c²)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\n**v_rel ≈ 0.14c**\n\n### Total Energy\n\nThe total relativistic energy of a particle is given by the formula E = γmc², where γ (the Lorentz factor) is 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).

I'll start by finding the formula for the relativistic relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction.\n\nSkeptic: While finding the formula for relative speed is a good first step, we also need the formula for the total relativistic energy of a system of particles. Is the total energy simply the sum of the individual relativistic energies, or are there other factors to consider? We should look for both formulas to be efficient. Also, we need to be careful about the signs in the velocity-addition formula, as both astronauts are moving in the same direction.\n\nDecide: I will search for the formulas for both relativistic relative velocity and the total energy of a system of particles. This will ensure accuracy for both parts of the problem.Proposer: The search results confirm the necessary formulas. For two objects moving in the same direction with velocities u and v, the relative velocity is given by `v_rel = (v - u) / (1 - uv/c^2)`. The total relativistic energy of a system of non-interacting particles is the sum of their individual relativistic energies. The relativistic energy for a single particle is `E = γmc^2`, where `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`. I will now proceed with the calculations.\n\nSkeptic: The formulas seem correct. However, the calculation of `γ` (the Lorentz factor) and the subsequent energy calculations can be prone to arithmetic errors. It's crucial to perform these calculations carefully for each astronaut and then sum them. A small mistake in any of these steps will lead to an incorrect final answer.\n\nDecide: I have the correct and verified formulas.

The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts (E_total = E₁ + E₂).\n\n**For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):**\n*   γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.36) = 1 / √0.64 = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n*   E₁ = γ₁ * (2m) * c² = 1.25 * 2mc² = 2.5 mc²\n\n**For the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):**\n*   γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.25) = 1 / √0.75 ≈ 1 / 0.866 ≈ 1.1547\n*   E₂ = γ₂ * (3m) * c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3mc² ≈ 3.464 mc²\n\n**Total Energy:**\n*   E_total = E₁ + E₂ = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc² = 5.964 mc²\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately 0.14c and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc².

Calculation of the Relative Speed (v_rel)\n\nTo find the relative speed between the two astronauts, we use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. Let the velocities of the two astronauts be v1 = 0.6c and v2 = 0.5c.\n\nThe formula for relative velocity is:\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n`v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)`\n`v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7`\n`v_rel ≈ 0.1428c`\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Total Energy (E)\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is given by the formula E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor. The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts (E_total = E1 + E2).\n\nThe Lorentz factor (γ) is calculated as:\n`γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n**For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):**\n\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ1):\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n*   Next, calculate the energy (E1):\n    `E1 = γ1 * (2m) * c² = 1.25 * 2mc² = 2.5 mc²`\n\n**For the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):**\n\n*   First, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ2):\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547`\n*   Next, calculate the energy (E2):\n    `E2 = γ2 * (3m) * c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3mc² ≈ 3.464 mc²`\n\n**Total Energy of the System:**\n\n*   Finally, add the energies of the two astronauts:\n    `E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc² = 5.964 mc²`\n\nSo, the total energy of the system is approximately **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing our calculated values with the given options:\n*   Relative speed (v_rel) ≈ 0.14c\n*   Total energy (E) ≈ 5.96 mc²\n\nThese results match option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nThe code execution was successful.\n\n**Constraint 1: Relative Velocity**\n- The calculated relativistic relative velocity is `v_rel ≈ 0.1429c`.\n- Options A (`0.1c`) and B (`1.1c`) fail this constraint.\n- Options C and D, with `v_rel = 0.14c`, pass this constraint, as `0.14c` is the rounded value of the calculation.\n- **Candidates remaining: C, D**\n\n**Constraint 2: Total Energy**\n- The calculated total energy is `E_total ≈ 5.964 mc^2`.\n- Candidate C (`E = 5.00 mc^2`) fails this constraint.\n- Candidate D (`E = 5.96 mc^2`) passes this constraint, matching the calculated value when rounded.\n- **Final Candidate: D**\n\nBoth constraints are satisfied by option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe process has successfully and repeatedly verified the answer through deterministic calculation. The calculated values for relative speed (`v_rel ≈ 0.1429c`) and total energy (`E ≈ 5.9641 mc²`) consistently match the values provided in Option A (`v_rel = 0.14c`, `E = 5.96 mc²`) within a reasonable tolerance for rounding. The checker has confirmed the output is correct.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nProposer: The problem requires us to calculate the relative speed and the total energy of a system of two astronauts with given masses and relativistic speeds. I'll start by finding the formula for the relativistic relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction.\n\nSkeptic: While finding the formula for relative speed is a good first step, we also need the formula for the total relativistic energy of a system of particles. Is the total energy simply the sum of the individual relativistic energies, or are there other factors to consider? We should look for both formulas to be efficient. Also, we need to be careful about the signs in the velocity-addition formula, as both astronauts are moving in the same direction.\n\nDecide: I will search for the formulas for both relativistic relative velocity and the total energy of a system of particles. This will ensure accuracy for both parts of the problem.Proposer: The search results confirm the necessary formulas. For two objects moving in the same direction with velocities u and v, the relative velocity is given by `v_rel = (v - u) / (1 - uv/c^2)`. The total relativistic energy of a system of non-interacting particles is the sum of their individual relativistic energies. The relativistic energy for a single particle is `E = γmc^2`, where `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)`. I will now proceed with the calculations.\n\nSkeptic: The formulas seem correct. However, the calculation of `γ` (the Lorentz factor) and the subsequent energy calculations can be prone to arithmetic errors. It's crucial to perform these calculations carefully for each astronaut and then sum them. A small mistake in any of these steps will lead to an incorrect final answer.\n\nDecide: I have the correct and verified formulas. The next logical step is to substitute the given values into these formulas and calculate the relative speed and total energy. I will perform the calculations in a step-by-step manner to minimize the risk of errors.Proposer: I have all the necessary information and formulas. I will now perform the final calculations for both the relative speed and the total energy to determine the correct option.\n\n**1.
