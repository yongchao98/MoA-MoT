def check_answer():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the final answer based on the physics of mean free path.

    The function analyzes the two scenarios:
    1. λ1: Mean free path (MFP) of gas molecules colliding with each other.
    2. λ2: MFP of high-energy electrons colliding with gas molecules.

    It compares them based on the standard formulas and the physical nature of the collisions.

    # The final answer provided by the LLM to be checked.
    final_answer = "A"
    
    # --- Step 1: Define the formulas for Mean Free Path (MFP) ---
    # General formula: λ = 1 / (n * σ)
    # For λ1 (gas-gas collision), kinetic theory includes a √2 factor to account for the relative motion of all molecules.
    # λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)
    # For λ2 (electron-gas collision), the high-energy electrons are much faster than the gas molecules,
    # so the molecules are considered stationary targets. The √2 factor does not apply.
    # λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_eg)

    # --- Step 2: Establish the ratio of λ2 to λ1 ---
    # λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_eg)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gg)]
    # λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gg) / (n * σ_eg)
    # λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)
    # This mathematical relationship is a key constraint.
    
    # --- Step 3: Compare the collision cross-sections (σ_gg vs σ_eg) ---
    # This is the most critical physical constraint.
    # σ_gg: The kinetic cross-section for two neutral molecules colliding. This is related to the physical size of the molecules.
    # σ_eg: The scattering cross-section for a very high-energy (1000 kV = 1 MeV) electron.
    # At such high energies, the electron is highly penetrating, and the atom appears as mostly empty space.
    # A significant scattering event is a low-probability event, requiring a close encounter with the nucleus.
    # Therefore, the effective target area for the electron is much smaller than the physical area for two molecules.
    # Physical conclusion: σ_gg > σ_eg
    
    sigma_gg_over_sigma_eg_is_greater_than_1 = True

    # --- Step 4: Combine the constraints to find the final relationship ---
    # We have λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gg / σ_eg)
    # Since σ_gg / σ_eg > 1, it follows that:
    # λ2 / λ1 > √2
    # √2 is approximately 1.414.
    # So, the derived physical conclusion is: λ2 > 1.414 * λ1
    
    derived_conclusion = "lambda2 > 1.414 * lambda1"

        "D": "λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1"
    }

    # Check if the final answer is consistent with the derived conclusion.
    # The derived conclusion is λ2 > 1.414 * λ1.
    # Let's check the condition for the proposed answer 'A': λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1.
    # Since 1.414 is indeed greater than or equal to 1.22, our derived conclusion satisfies the condition in option A.
    
    is_A_correct = (1.414 >= 1.22)
    
    # Let's check the other options for completeness.
    # B (λ2 < λ1) is false because λ2/λ1 > 1.414.
    # C (λ2 = λ1) is false.
    # D (λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1) is false because λ2/λ1 > 1.414, so it cannot be less than 1.22.
