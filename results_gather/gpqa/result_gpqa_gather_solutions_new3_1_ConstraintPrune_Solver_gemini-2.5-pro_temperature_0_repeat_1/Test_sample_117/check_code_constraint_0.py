    # --- Problem Definition ---
    # Question: What is the major outcome of the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine?
    # The provided answer from the LLM to be checked.
    llm_answer_text = "<<<C>>>"

    # --- Chemical Analysis ---
    # 1. Identify Reactant and Reagent
    # Reactant: 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. This is an enol functional group.
    # Key features of an enol: A C=C double bond with an -OH group on one of the carbons.
    # In this case, the double bond is between C1 and C2, with the -OH on C1.
    # Reagent: Bromine (Br2), an electrophile.

    # 2. Determine the Major Reaction Pathway
    # The reaction of an enol with a halogen (like Br2) is a classic alpha-halogenation.
    # This pathway involves the enol's double bond acting as a nucleophile to attack the bromine.
    # The reaction is driven by the formation of the thermodynamically stable keto tautomer.
    # While electrophilic addition (forming a dibromo-alcohol) is possible for a generic alkene,
    # for an enol, the alpha-substitution pathway is the major one.

    # 3. Predict the Product Structure
    # - The alpha-carbon (the carbon of the double bond NOT bearing the -OH group) is C2.
    # - The nucleophilic attack occurs at C2, so a bromine atom attaches to C2.
    # - The enol group at C1 rearranges to a ketone (a carbonyl group, C=O).
    # - The 4,4-dimethyl groups are spectators and remain unchanged.
    # - Therefore, the predicted major product is: 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.

    # --- Verification ---
    # 4. Map the Predicted Product to the Given Options

        "C": "2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone",           # Correct: Alpha-halogenation product
        "D": "4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone"            # Incorrect: Bromination at wrong position
