    # Moles of KH2PO4 gives moles of H2PO4-

    conc_h2po4 = moles_h2po4 / volume_L
    conc_hpo4 = moles_hpo4 / volume_L

    # Step 4: Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] using the Ka2 equilibrium
    # The primary buffer equilibrium is: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻
    # Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]
    # Rearranging gives: [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])
    conc_h_plus = ka2 * (conc_h2po4 / conc_hpo4)

    # Step 5: Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO₄³⁻] using the Ka3 equilibrium
    # The third dissociation is: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻
    # Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]
    # Rearranging gives: [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])
    calculated_conc_po4 = ka3 * (conc_hpo4 / conc_h_plus)
