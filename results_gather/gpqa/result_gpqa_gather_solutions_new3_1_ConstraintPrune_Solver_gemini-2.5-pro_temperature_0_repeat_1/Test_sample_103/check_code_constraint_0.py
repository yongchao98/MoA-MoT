    """
    Checks the correctness of the provided answer for the exoplanet orbital period ratio question.

    The function follows these steps:
    1.  Defines the given parameters from the question.
    2.  Calculates the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K) from the wavelength shifts (Δλ).
    3.  Uses the physical relationship K ∝ P^(-1/3) to derive the formula for the period ratio P₂/P₁.
    4.  Calculates the expected numerical value for P₂/P₁.
    5.  Compares the calculated value to the given options to find the correct choice.
    6.  Checks if the provided answer matches the calculated correct choice.

    # The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is directly proportional to the observed wavelength shift (Δλ).

    k_ratio = delta_lambda_1 / delta_lambda_2

    # The formula for K is K = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * [m_p * sin(i) / M_star^(2/3)].
    # The problem states M_star₁ = M_star₂, m_p₁ ≈ m_p₂, and we assume sin(i₁) ≈ sin(i₂).
    # This simplifies the relationship to K ∝ P^(-1/3).

    # From this proportionality, we can write the ratio:
    # K₁ / K₂ = (P₁)^(-1/3) / (P₂)^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)
