Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.

**1. Deconstruct the Experimental Scenario**
*   **Organism:** *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (yeast).
*   **Cellular State:** The yeast is forming a "shmoo". This is a critical piece of information. Shmoo formation is a response to mating pheromones, which causes the cell to **arrest its cell cycle in the G1 phase**.
*   **Primary Activity:** During this G1 arrest, the cell's resources are redirected. It stops preparing for cell division and instead initiates a massive **transcriptional program** to express genes needed for mating and cell fusion.
*   **Inhibited Activity:** The G1 arrest actively **prevents the cell from entering the S phase**, which is when DNA replication occurs.
*   **Experimental Goal:** The experiment aims to recover the proteome (the set of proteins) associated with **active chromatin**. Active chromatin is defined by regions of the genome undergoing active transcription.

**2. Evaluate Each Protein Complex in this Specific Context**

*   **D) Nucleosome histone complex:** Nucleosomes are the fundamental building blocks of all chromatin, both active and inactive. They are the most abundant proteins associated with DNA. Any experiment that recovers chromatin will recover a very large amount of this complex. Therefore, it will be highly observed.

*   **B) Pre-initiation complex (PIC) & C) Enhancer protein complex:** These two complexes are the core machinery of gene transcription. The PIC assembles at promoters to start transcription, and enhancer complexes bind to DNA to activate and regulate this process. Since the shmoo response is characterized by a massive wave of active transcription, these complexes will be abundant on the active chromatin and are precisely what the experiment is designed to find. Therefore, they will be highly observed.

*   **A) Pre-replication complex (pre-RC):** This complex assembles at origins of replication during the G1 phase. Its function is to "license" the DNA, preparing it for replication in the S phase.
    *   **Point 1:** The cell is indeed in G1, the correct phase for pre-RC assembly. So, these complexes are physically present on the chromatin.
    *   **Point 2 (Crucial):** The cell is **arrested** in G1 and the process the pre-RC prepares for—DNA replication—is **inhibited**.
    *   **Point 3:** The experiment targets *active chromatin*, which in this context means *transcriptionally active*. The pre-RC's function is related to replication, not transcription.

**3. Synthesize and Conclude**

The experiment is designed to capture the proteins driving the cell's current, dominant activity: transcription. The pre-initiation and enhancer complexes are central to this activity and will be abundant. Nucleosomes are the ubiquitous structural component and will also be abundant. The pre-replication complex, while present on the DNA, is associated with a different cellular process (replication) that is currently inhibited. Therefore, compared to the machinery driving the highly active transcriptional program, the pre-replication complex will be the **least observed** in a sample enriched for the proteome of active chromatin.
