def check_chemistry_problem():
    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer to the chemistry problem.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3 and the stoichiometric moles of H+ needed for the reaction.
    2. For each option (A, B, C, D), assume the given volume and pH are correct.
    3. Calculate the total moles of H+ added based on the given volume.
    4. Subtract the moles of H+ used for the reaction to find the excess moles of H+.
    5. Calculate the concentration of this excess H+ in the final 100 cmÂ³ volume.
    6. Calculate the pH that would result from this excess H+ concentration.
    7. Compare this calculated pH with the pH given in the option.
    8. The correct option is the one where the calculated pH and given pH match.
