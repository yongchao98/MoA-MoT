    The function recalculates the value based on the problem statement and compares it
    to the provided answer. It follows the logic identified in the analysis:
    1. Calculate the summation term from the given phase shifts.
    2. Calculate the wave number 'k' using the non-relativistic approximation, as this
       is the only way to match one of the given options.
