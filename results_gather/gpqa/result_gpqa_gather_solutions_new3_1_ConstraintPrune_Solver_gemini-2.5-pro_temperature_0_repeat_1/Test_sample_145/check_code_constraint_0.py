This is a classic stereochemistry problem involving a Diels-Alder reaction. To determine the major product, we must analyze the constraints imposed by stereochemical rules.

### Step-by-Step Analysis of Constraints

**1. Constraint: Reaction Type and Basic Stereochemistry**
*   The reaction is a [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition between 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene (diene) and maleic anhydride (dienophile).
*   The product is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.
*   Maleic anhydride is a *cis*-dienophile, which means the fusion to the anhydride ring will be *cis*. All four options correctly reflect this (`3a` and `7a` have the same R/S descriptor pattern relative to the ring system), so this does not prune any candidates.

**2. Constraint: Endo vs. Exo Selectivity**
*   The **Alder-Endo Rule** states that for kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reactions, the *endo* product is favored due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the diene and the dienophile's electron-withdrawing groups.
*   The *endo* adduct corresponds to the stereochemistry `(3aR,4S,7R,7aS)` (or its enantiomer).
*   The *exo* adduct corresponds to the stereochemistry `(3aR,4R,7S,7aS)` (or its enantiomer).
*   While exceptions exist, the endo rule is generally strong for the cyclopentadiene/maleic anhydride system. The small fluorine substituent is not expected to reverse this preference.
*   **Pruning:** We can eliminate the *exo* products, which are options C and D.
*   **Candidates remaining:** A, B.

**3. Constraint: Facial Selectivity (Syn vs. Anti Attack)**
*   This is the most critical constraint. The dienophile can attack the diene from the same face as the fluorine substituent (*syn*-attack) or the opposite face (*anti*-attack).
*   A simple steric argument would favor *anti*-attack to avoid the fluorine atom.
*   However, for 5-substituted cyclopentadienes with small, electronegative substituents (like F, Cl, OMe), a well-established electronic effect overrides sterics. Negative hyperconjugation between the diene's highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the C-F Ïƒ* anti-bonding orbital stabilizes the transition state for **syn-facial attack**.
*   Therefore, the major pathway is *syn*-attack.
*   **Product Structure:** A *syn*-facial attack combined with an *endo* approach results in the ***anti*** **product**. In this structure, the fluorine atom and the anhydride ring are on opposite sides of the bicyclic system.

**4. Constraint: Nomenclature (Mapping Structure to Name)**
*   We have determined the major product is the ***endo, anti*** isomer. Now we must match this to either option A (`8s`) or option B (`8r`).
*   The descriptors `8s` and `8r` refer to the stereochemistry at the C8 bridge carbon where the fluorine is attached.
*   In the *endo, anti* product, the fluorine atom is on the opposite side of the anhydride ring. This places it on the same side as the C5-C6 double bond.
*   In the standard nomenclature for these systems, a substituent on the bridge that is on the same side as the double bond (*syn* to the double bond) is assigned the descriptor **'s'**. A substituent on the side opposite the double bond (*anti* to the double bond) is assigned 'r'.
*   Since our fluorine is *syn* to the double bond, its descriptor is `8s`.

### Final Decision

1.  The product must be **endo** -> Eliminates C, D.
2.  The reaction proceeds via **syn-facial attack**, yielding the **anti-product**.
3.  The *anti*-product has the fluorine *syn* to the double bond, which corresponds to the **`8s`** descriptor.

Combining these constraints, the major product must be the *endo* isomer with the `8s` configuration.

*   **Candidate A:** (3aR,4S,7R,7aS,**8s**)-... -> This is the *endo, anti* isomer.
*   **Candidate B:** (3aR,4S,7R,7aS,**8r**)-... -> This is the *endo, syn* isomer.

The analysis points conclusively to option A.

---
**Constraint Checklist:**
*   **Constraint 1 (Endo/Exo):** Product is *endo*. Candidates {A, B}. Pass.
*   **Constraint 2 (Facial Selectivity):** Attack is *syn*-facial. Leads to *anti*-product. Pass.
*   **Constraint 3 (Nomenclature):** The *anti*-product has an `8s` descriptor. Candidate {A}. Pass.

Final candidate is A.
