    # --- Problem Definition ---
    # Question: How many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are there on product 4?

    # The answer to be checked is the one provided in the final user prompt.

    # --- Step 1: Deduce the Final Product Structure ---
    # This section logically follows the reaction pathway.
    
    # Step 1.1: Cyclohexanone + Bromine -> Product 1
    # Reaction: Alpha-bromination of a ketone.
    product_1 = "2-bromocyclohexanone"

    # Step 1.2: Product 1 + NaOH, heat -> Product 2
    # Reaction: Favorskii rearrangement of an alpha-halo ketone. This involves
    # ring contraction from a 6-membered ring to a 5-membered ring carboxylic acid.
    # This pathway is confirmed by the next step (reaction with SOCl2), which is
    # specific to carboxylic acids.
    product_2 = "cyclopentanecarboxylic acid"

    # Step 1.3: Product 2 + SOCl2/pyridine -> Product 3
    # Reaction: Standard conversion of a carboxylic acid to an acyl chloride.
    product_3 = "cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride"

    # Step 1.4: Product 3 + Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride -> Product 4
    # Reaction: Selective reduction of an acyl chloride to an aldehyde using a
    # mild, sterically hindered reducing agent.
    final_product = "cyclopentanecarbaldehyde"

    # --- Step 2: Analyze the Final Product for Distinct Hydrogens ---
    # This section analyzes the symmetry of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.
    
    # The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the aldehyde group and C1.
    # This makes C2 equivalent to C5, and C3 equivalent to C4.

    # 1. The aldehyde proton (-CHO) is unique.

    # 2. The proton on C1 (the ring carbon attached to the aldehyde) is unique.

    # 3. The protons on C2 and C5. The two protons on each carbon are diastereotopic
    #    (not equivalent) because they are adjacent to a prochiral center (C1).
    #    This gives 2 distinct types for these 4 protons.
    c2_c5_h_types = 2
    
    # 4. The protons on C3 and C4. Similarly, the protons on each of these carbons
    #    are diastereotopic, giving another 2 distinct types for these 4 protons.
