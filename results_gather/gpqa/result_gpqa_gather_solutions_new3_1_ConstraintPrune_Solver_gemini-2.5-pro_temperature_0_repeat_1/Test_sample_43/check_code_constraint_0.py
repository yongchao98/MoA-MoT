    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer to the cell biology question.

    # The question asks to identify the experiment that will NOT help.
    # We define each experiment and its validity based on established biological principles.
    # Principle 1: Mitochondria do NOT take up glucose. They take up pyruvate (from glycolysis in the cytoplasm).
    # Principle 2: Glucose uptake is a process that occurs at the cell's plasma membrane.
    # Principle 3: Valid measures of mitochondrial function include membrane potential, ATP production, and metabolic byproducts (like heat or ROS).
