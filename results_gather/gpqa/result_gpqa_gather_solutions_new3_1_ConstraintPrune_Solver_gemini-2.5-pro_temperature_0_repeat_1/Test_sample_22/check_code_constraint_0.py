    # --- Analysis of Reaction Mechanism ---
    
    # Step 1: Protonation of the Alkene
    # The reaction starts with the electrophilic addition of H+ from HBr to the alkene double bond.
    # According to Markovnikov's rule, the proton adds to the terminal carbon (CH2) to form
    # the more stable secondary carbocation on the adjacent carbon (C3).
    # Intermediate_1 = "Secondary carbocation: Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-C+H-CH3"
    
    # Step 2: Competing Intramolecular Pathways
    # The carbocation can now react via two competing pathways. Intramolecular cyclization
    # to form stable 5- or 6-membered rings is highly favored over intermolecular attack by Br-.

    # Pathway A: Direct Cyclization (6-membered ring formation)
    # The electron-rich benzene ring attacks the secondary carbocation at the ortho position.
    # This intramolecular Friedel-Crafts alkylation forms a 6-membered heterocyclic ring.
    predicted_product_1 = "3,3,4-trimethylchromane"

    # Pathway B: Rearrangement then Cyclization (5-membered ring formation)
    # The secondary carbocation can undergo a 1,2-methyl shift from the adjacent quaternary carbon (C2)
    # to form a more stable tertiary carbocation.
    # Intermediate_2 = "Tertiary carbocation: Ph-O-CH2-C+(CH3)-CH(CH3)2"
    # The benzene ring then attacks this more stable tertiary carbocation at the ortho position,
    # forming a 5-membered heterocyclic ring.
