    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer for ranking nucleophiles.

    The question asks to rank the following nucleophiles from most reactive to poorest reactive
    in an aqueous (polar protic) solution:
    1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
    2. Hydroxide
    3. Propionate
    4. Methanol
    5. Ethanethiolate

    The correct ranking based on chemical principles is:
    5 (Ethanethiolate) > 2 (Hydroxide) > 1 (4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate) > 3 (Propionate) > 4 (Methanol)
    This corresponds to the sequence [5, 2, 1, 3, 4].
