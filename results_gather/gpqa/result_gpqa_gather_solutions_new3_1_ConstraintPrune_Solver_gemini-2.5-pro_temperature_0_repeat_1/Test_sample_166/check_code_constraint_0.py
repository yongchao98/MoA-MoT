def check_correctness_of_schrodinger_cat_nG():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the calculated non-Gaussianity (nG)
    for a specific Schrödinger cat state.

    The calculation follows these steps:
    1. The non-Gaussianity measure `del_b = S(tau) - S(rho)`.
    2. For a pure state `rho`, its entropy `S(rho)` is 0. So, `del_b = S(tau)`.
    3. `tau` is a reference Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as `rho`.
    4. For the given parameters (phi=-pi/4, alpha=0.5), the state is an "odd cat state".
       Its first moment `<a>` is 0.
       Its second moments are `<a^2> = alpha^2` and `<n> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`.
    5. The entropy `S(tau)` is calculated from the symplectic eigenvalue `nu`, where
       `nu = sqrt((<n> + 1/2)^2 - |<a^2>|^2)`.
    6. The entropy formula is `S(tau) = (nu+0.5)ln(nu+0.5) - (nu-0.5)ln(nu-0.5)`.
    7. The final calculated value is compared against the provided answer.
