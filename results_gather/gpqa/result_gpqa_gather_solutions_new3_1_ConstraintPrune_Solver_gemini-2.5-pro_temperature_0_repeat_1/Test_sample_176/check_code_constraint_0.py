    # 1. The luminosity ratio L1/L2 is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
    # L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4

    # 2. The temperature ratio T1/T2 is found using Wien's Law and the Doppler effect.
    # Wien's Law: T is proportional to 1/lambda_emitted, so T1/T2 = lambda_emitted_2 / lambda_emitted_1
    # Doppler Effect: The observed wavelengths are equal (lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2).
    # For Star 1 (v=0): lambda_obs_1 = lambda_emitted_1
    # For Star 2 (v>0): lambda_obs_2 = lambda_emitted_2 * (1 + v2/c)
    # Therefore: lambda_emitted_1 = lambda_emitted_2 * (1 + v2/c)
    # This gives the ratio: lambda_emitted_2 / lambda_emitted_1 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)

    # 3. So, the temperature ratio is:
    # T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)
    temp_ratio = 1 / (1 + v2_kms / c_kms)

    # 4. Substitute everything back into the luminosity ratio formula:
    # L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4
    calculated_luminosity_ratio = (radius_ratio**2) * (temp_ratio**4)
