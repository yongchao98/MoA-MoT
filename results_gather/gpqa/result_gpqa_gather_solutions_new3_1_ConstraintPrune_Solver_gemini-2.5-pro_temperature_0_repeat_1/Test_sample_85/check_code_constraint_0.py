    This problem requires determining the stereochemistry of two starting materials, A and B, based on the stereochemistry of the products formed after reacting with two different reducing agents. The solution hinges on two key concepts: the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents and the stereochemical outcome of the reactions.

    ### Step-by-step Analysis

    **1. Analyze the Structures and Stereochemistry**

    *   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`). It has a single chiral center at carbon-3, the carbon atom bonded to the ethyl group.
    *   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered lactone (cyclic ester). The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4).
    *   **Careful Point 1 (Stereochemical Retention):** The reactions involve the reduction of a carbonyl group and a subsequent intramolecular cyclization (lactonization). Neither of these steps affects the bonds at the chiral center. Therefore, the stereochemical configuration (R/S) of the starting material is retained in the product.
        *   An (R)-configured starting material will yield an (R)-configured product.
        *   An (S)-configured starting material will yield an (S)-configured product.

    **2. Analyze Reaction A**

    *   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one
    *   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride).
    *   **Careful Point 2 (Chemoselectivity of LiBH₄):** LiBH₄ is a well-known reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to form a carboxylate salt, which is resistant to reduction by LiBH₄.
    *   **Mechanism:**
        1.  LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol.
        2.  The carboxylic acid group remains unchanged.
        3.  The intermediate is `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.
        4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the lactone.
    *   **Conclusion for A:** Since the reaction produces the **(R)**-lactone and the stereochemistry is retained (Careful Point 1), the starting material **A** must have the **(R)** configuration.

    **3. Analyze Reaction B**

    *   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one
    *   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane).
    *   **Careful Point 3 (Chemoselectivity of BH₃):** Borane is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while leaving esters largely unaffected under the same conditions.
    *   **Mechanism:**
        1.  BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol.
        2.  The isobutyl ester group remains unchanged.
        3.  The intermediate is `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`.
        4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification (the new alcohol attacks the ester) to form the lactone.
    *   **Conclusion for B:** Since the reaction produces the **(S)**-lactone and the stereochemistry is retained (Careful Point 1), the starting material **B** must have the **(S)** configuration.

    **4. Final Conclusion**

    *   Starting material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.
    *   Starting material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.

    This combination corresponds to option D.
