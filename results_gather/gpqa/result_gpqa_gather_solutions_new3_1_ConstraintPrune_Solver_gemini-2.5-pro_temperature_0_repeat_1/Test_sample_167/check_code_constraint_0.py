def check_answer_correctness():
    """
    This function checks the correctness of the final answer for the genomics question.

    The question asks for the issues that are the "most common" and "difficult-to-spot"
    sources of erroneous results. A "difficult-to-spot" error is one that does not
    cause an obvious crash but instead produces a "silent failure" (plausible but
    incorrect results).

    The function encodes the consensus from expert knowledge (as summarized in the
    provided LLM answers) for each of the four issues.
