    This function checks the correctness of the LLM's answer by recalculating the ratio of silicon atoms.
    
    The problem involves these key steps:
    1. Understand the notation: [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY)_star - log10(nX/nY)_sun
    2. Use the property: [A/C] = [A/B] + [B/C]
    3. Calculate [Si/H] for Star 1.
    4. Calculate [Si/H] for Star 2.
    5. Calculate the final ratio from the difference in [Si/H] values.
