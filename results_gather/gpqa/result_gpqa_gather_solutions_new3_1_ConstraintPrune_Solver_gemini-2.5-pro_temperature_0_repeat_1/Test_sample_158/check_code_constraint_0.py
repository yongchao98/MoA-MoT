    """
    This function checks the correctness of the provided answer by performing the physical calculation from scratch.
    It follows these steps:
    1.  Identifies the spectral feature as the Lyman-alpha (Lyα) line, which is the standard interpretation.
    2.  Calculates the redshift (z) based on the observed and rest wavelengths.
    3.  Calculates the comoving distance using the provided ΛCDM cosmological parameters by numerically integrating the Friedmann equation.
    4.  Compares the calculated distance to the given options to find the closest match.
    5.  Verifies if this closest match corresponds to the provided answer.
