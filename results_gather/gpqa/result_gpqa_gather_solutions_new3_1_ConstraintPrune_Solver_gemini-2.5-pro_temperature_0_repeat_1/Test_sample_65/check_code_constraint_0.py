def check_smeft_answer_correctness(answer_letter):
    """
    Checks the correctness of an answer to the SMEFT symmetry question.

    The function encodes the fundamental principles of SMEFT construction:
    1. Lorentz Symmetry (1): Required. Foundational to relativistic QFT.
    2. Poincare Symmetry (2): Required. The full spacetime symmetry group of special relativity.
    3. CP Symmetry (3): NOT required. The SM violates it, and SMEFT can have new sources of violation.
    4. CPT Symmetry (4): Required. A consequence of the CPT theorem for local, Lorentz-invariant QFTs.

    Args:
        answer_letter (str): The letter of the proposed answer ('A', 'B', 'C', or 'D').

    Returns:
        str: "Correct" if the answer is correct, otherwise a string explaining the error.
