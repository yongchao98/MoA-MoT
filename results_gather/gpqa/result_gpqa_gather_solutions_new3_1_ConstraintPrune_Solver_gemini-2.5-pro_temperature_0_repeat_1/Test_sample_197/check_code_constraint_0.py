    # The question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)2].

    # --- Calculation ---
    # The formula for the mole fraction (alpha) of the [Co(SCN)2] complex is:
    # alpha_2 = (beta2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + beta1*[SCN-]^1 + beta2*[SCN-]^2 + beta3*[SCN-]^3 + beta4*[SCN-]^4)
    # The percentage is alpha_2 * 100.
    # The total cobalt concentration is not needed for this calculation as the free ligand concentration is given
    # (or can be approximated as the total ligand concentration since it's in large excess).

    # Calculate the numerator term for the [Co(SCN)2] species
    numerator = beta2 * (SCN_conc ** 2)
