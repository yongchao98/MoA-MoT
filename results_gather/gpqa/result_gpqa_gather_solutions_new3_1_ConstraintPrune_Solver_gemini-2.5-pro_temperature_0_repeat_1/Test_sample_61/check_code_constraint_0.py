    Checks the correctness of the provided answer for the multi-step synthesis question.

    The function simulates the chemical reaction for each option step-by-step
    to determine if it leads to the target product class. The target,
    1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, is the self-aldol
    adduct of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Therefore, a valid synthesis must first
    produce cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and then use a base to catalyze the aldol reaction.
