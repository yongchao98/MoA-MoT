    Checks the correctness of the answer for the Pinacol rearrangement question.

    1. Chemical Validity: Some options contain chemically impossible names.
    2. Conservation of Mass: A Pinacol rearrangement is a dehydration, so the
       starting material's formula must be equal to the product's formula plus H2O.
