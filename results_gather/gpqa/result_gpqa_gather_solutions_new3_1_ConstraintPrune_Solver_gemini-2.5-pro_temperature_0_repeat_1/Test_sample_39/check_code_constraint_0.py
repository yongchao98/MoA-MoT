    # Criterion 1: The phrase "on top of each other" is a strong visual metaphor.
    # This points to a technique where results are visualized spatially, like spots on a plate.
    # This strongly favors chromatography (TLC) over distillation.
    # Criterion 2: The primary principle of separation in standard lab chromatography is polarity.
    # Criterion 3: A failed separation ("Not well") in chromatography occurs when compounds have similar polarities.

    # Based on these criteria, Option A is the most direct and accurate explanation.
    # Option D (boiling points) is incorrect because the terminology doesn't fit distillation.
    # Option B (optical rotation) is incorrect because it's not the principle of separation.
    # Option C (interactions) is too general; polarity is the specific, resulting property that causes the issue.
