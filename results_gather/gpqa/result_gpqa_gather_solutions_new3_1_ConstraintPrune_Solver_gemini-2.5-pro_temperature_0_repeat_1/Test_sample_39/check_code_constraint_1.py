The phrase 'on top of each other' is a common visual metaphor used by organic chemists to describe the result of a failed chromatographic separation (e.g., on a TLC plate). This failure is caused by compounds having very similar polarities, which makes them travel at the same rate through the chromatography medium.",
        'B': "This is incorrect. Similar optical rotation is a property of chiral compounds and is not the principle behind common separation techniques like standard TLC or column chromatography. The phrase does not refer to a polarimetry measurement.",
        'C': "This is incorrect. While non-covalent interactions are the fundamental basis for polarity, 'similar polarities' is the direct and practical reason for the failed separation. The answer is too general and less precise than option A.",
        'D': "This is incorrect. Similar boiling points would be a problem for separation by distillation. The jargon for a failed distillation is different (e.g., 'they co-distill'). The phrase 'on top of each other' is strongly associated with the visual output of chromatography."
