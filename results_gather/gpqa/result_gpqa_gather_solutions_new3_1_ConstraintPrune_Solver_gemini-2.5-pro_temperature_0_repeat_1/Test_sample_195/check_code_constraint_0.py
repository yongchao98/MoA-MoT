    This function programmatically verifies the derivation for the maximum speed
    of a relativistic harmonic oscillator.

    It performs three main checks:
    1. Derivation: It symbolically solves the energy conservation equation.
    2. Comparison: It compares the derived solution to the provided options.
    3. Sanity Check: It verifies that the correct relativistic formula reduces
       to the correct classical formula in the non-relativistic limit (c -> infinity).
