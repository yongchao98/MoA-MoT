    Checks the correctness of the answer to the electrostatics problem.

    The core physical principle is electrostatic shielding: the electric field
    outside the conductor depends only on the total charge induced on the outer
    surface and the distance from the conductor's center (L). It must be
    independent of the internal geometry (s, l, theta).

    The code verifies if the chosen answer adheres to this principle and matches
    the formula derived from Gauss's Law for a spherical charge distribution.
