    """
    Checks the correctness of the answer for the redshift question.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. The Lyman-alpha line (1216 Å) is in the UV and must be redshifted to be seen from the ground.
    2. The "optical window" for ground-based telescopes starts where the atmosphere becomes transparent,
       practically around 3500 Å. This is the atmospheric cutoff.
    3. The "lower limit" on redshift corresponds to the smallest redshift value (from the options)
       that shifts the 1216 Å line to a wavelength >= 3500 Å.
    4. The code calculates the observed wavelength for each option and finds the true lower limit.
    5. It then compares this with the provided answer.
