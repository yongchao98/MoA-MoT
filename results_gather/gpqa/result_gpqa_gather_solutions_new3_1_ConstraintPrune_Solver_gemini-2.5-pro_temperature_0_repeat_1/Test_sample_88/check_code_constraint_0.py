This problem requires a step-by-step deduction of a three-step reaction sequence, culminating in the analysis of an NMR spectrum. The problem contains contradictory information, which requires careful evaluation to determine the most plausible chemical pathway.

**Step 1: Analyze the overall reaction sequence and identify key constraints.**

*   **Reaction 1:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane + excess KOH, 240°C → Product 1.
    *   The IR data (1720 cm⁻¹) for Product 1 indicates it is a ketone.
    *   The ¹H NMR data (total 14H) suggests the formula is C₁₀H₁₄O, a saturated ketone.
*   **Reaction 2:** Product 1 + Al(O-i-Pr)₃, heat → Product 2.
    *   This is a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which converts a ketone to an alcohol.
*   **Reaction 3:** Product 2 + O₃; then DMS → Product 3.
    *   This is a reductive ozonolysis, a reaction that specifically cleaves carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C).

**Step 2: Resolve the central contradiction.**

There is a major contradiction: The ozonolysis in Step 3 proves that Product 2 must contain a C=C double bond. Since Product 2 is formed from Product 1, Product 1 must also have been unsaturated. However, the ¹H NMR integration given for Product 1 (14H) corresponds to a saturated C₁₀H₁₄O formula.

In such puzzle-like problems, one must decide which piece of information is the most reliable clue and which is likely a red herring or error. The ozonolysis reaction is a very specific and defining transformation. It is the strongest constraint. Therefore, we must assume that Product 2 is an alkene, and the ¹H NMR data for Product 1 is misleading.

**Step 3: Determine the nature of Product 3 and the proton of interest.**

*   The question asks for the coupling pattern of the **most deshielded hydrogen atom** in Product 3 (excluding exchangeable -OH protons).
*   Ozonolysis can produce ketones (from R₂C=) or aldehydes (from RHC=).
*   Aldehyde protons (-CHO) have a chemical shift of δ ≈ 9-10 ppm. This is significantly more deshielded than any other non-exchangeable proton, such as those on carbons bearing alcohols (H-C-OH, δ ≈ 3.5-4.5 ppm) or those on bridgehead carbons (δ ≈ 2.5-3.5 ppm).
*   Therefore, if Product 3 contains an aldehyde group, the aldehyde proton is the one we must analyze. The complex splitting patterns offered as answers (e.g., doublet of triplets) are much more likely for a proton in a constrained ring system than for other types of protons. This strongly suggests an aldehyde is formed.
*   For an aldehyde to be formed, the precursor alkene (Product 2) must have at least one hydrogen on its double bond (i.e., be of the form RHC=CR'R'' or RHC=CHR').

**Step 4: Deduce the reaction pathway that forms an aldehyde.**

1.  **Product 1:** To get an alkene of the type RHC=CHR' in Product 2, a plausible structure for Product 1 is an α,β-unsaturated ketone (an enone). A plausible candidate formed from rearrangement of the adamantane skeleton is **protoadamant-4-en-2-one**.
2.  **Product 2:** The MPV reduction of the ketone in Product 1 would yield the corresponding allylic alcohol, **protoadamant-4-en-2-ol**. This molecule contains the required internal double bond (RHC=CHR').
3.  **Product 3:** Ozonolysis of Product 2 cleaves the C4=C5 double bond. Since both C4 and C5 bear one hydrogen atom, the product is a **dialdehyde**. The overall structure is a bicyclic dialdehyde with an alcohol group, for example, **bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-2-ol-3,7-dicarbaldehyde**.

**Step 5: Analyze the coupling pattern of the aldehyde proton in Product 3.**

*   We focus on one of the aldehyde protons (-CHO), which is the most deshielded non-exchangeable proton. Let's analyze the aldehyde proton attached to C3.
*   **Vicinal Coupling (³J):** The aldehyde proton is coupled to the single proton on the adjacent carbon, H3. According to the n+1 rule, this coupling to one proton (n=1) splits the signal into a **doublet**.
*   **Long-Range Coupling (⁴J):** In rigid cyclic systems like this, coupling over four bonds is often observed, especially through a "W-shaped" pathway. The aldehyde proton on C3 is in a W-arrangement with the two protons on C4. Coupling to these two equivalent protons (n=2) will split the signal into a **triplet**.
*   **Combined Pattern:** The signal is first split into a doublet by H3, and each line of that doublet is further split into a triplet by the two H4 protons. The resulting pattern is a **doublet of triplets**.

This analysis provides a chemically consistent pathway that resolves the contradictions in the problem statement and leads directly to one of the provided answers.
