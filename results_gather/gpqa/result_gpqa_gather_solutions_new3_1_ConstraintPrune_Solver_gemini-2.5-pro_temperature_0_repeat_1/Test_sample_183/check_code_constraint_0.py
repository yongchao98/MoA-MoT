    # Option A Analysis
    # Sequence: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...
    # Key check: Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline.
    # Step i) makes nitrobenzene. Step ii) makes aniline. Step iii) is FC-alkylation.
    # This fails because the Lewis acid (AlCl3) complexes with the basic amine, deactivating the ring.

    # Option B Analysis
    # Sequence: ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...
    # Key check: Stability of diazonium salt intermediate.

    # Option D Analysis
    # Sequence: ... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...
    # Key check: Reagent-substrate match for diazotization.
    # The product after step iii is a sulfonic acid derivative of a nitro-compound. It has no amine group.

    # Sequence: i) tBuCl/AlCl3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) Fe/HCl; iv) HNO3/H2SO4; v) NaNO2/HCl; vi) H3O+; vii) NaOH/EtBr
    # This sequence is chemically plausible, step-by-step.
    # i) Alkylation -> t-butylbenzene.
    # ii) Nitration -> o-nitro-t-butylbenzene (minor, but possible product).
    # iii) Reduction -> 2-t-butylaniline.
    # iv) Nitration of anilinium ion -> 2-t-butyl-3-nitroaniline (plausible directing effects).
    # v) Diazotization -> Diazonium salt.
    # vi) Hydrolysis -> Phenol.
    # vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis -> Final Product.
    # All steps are valid transformations.

It is the only option without a fatal chemical flaw."
