    Checks the correctness of the final answer for the physics problem.

    The problem asks for the minimum energy of a system of 13 identical charges.
    - 1 charge at the center of a sphere.
    - 12 charges on the surface of the sphere.
    - Charge q = 2e
    - Radius R = 2 m

    The minimum energy configuration for the 12 sphere charges is an icosahedron.
    The total energy U_total = U_interaction + U_sphere.
    U_total = (12 * k * q^2 / R) + (E_12 * k * q^2 / R) = (12 + E_12) * (k * q^2 / R)
    where E_12 is the dimensionless energy constant for the icosahedron.
