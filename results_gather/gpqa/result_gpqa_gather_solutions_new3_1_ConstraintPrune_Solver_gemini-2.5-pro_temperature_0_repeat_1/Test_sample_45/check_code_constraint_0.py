    # The product is 3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. We analyze the stereoisomers
    # based on the pairings of the racemic (R) and (S) starting materials.

    # 1. Pairing of (R) + (R)
    # This forms (3R, 6R)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene. This is a chiral molecule.
    # The new double bond can be E or Z, creating two distinct diastereomers.
    products_from_RR = 2  # (E)-(3R,6R) and (Z)-(3R,6R)

    # 2. Pairing of (S) + (S)
    # This forms (3S, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.
    # These are the enantiomers of the (R,R) products. Since enantiomers are
    # distinct compounds, this adds two more products.
    products_from_SS = 2  # (E)-(3S,6S) and (Z)-(3S,6S)

    # 3. Pairing of (R) + (S)
    # This forms (3R, 6S)-3,6-dimethyloct-4-ene.
    # We must analyze the E and Z isomers of this configuration.

    # - The (Z)-(3R,6S) isomer is chiral (it has a C2 axis but no improper axis).

    #   This constitutes a pair of distinct enantiomeric products.
