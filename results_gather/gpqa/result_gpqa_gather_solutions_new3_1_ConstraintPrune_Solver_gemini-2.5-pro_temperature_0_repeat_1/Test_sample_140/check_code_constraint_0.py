    # --- Step 1: Simulate the formation of benzyne intermediates ---
    # The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d.
    # The strong base NaNH2 can abstract a proton from an ortho position.
    # Ortho positions are C2 (with Deuterium) and C6 (with Hydrogen).
    # Since the question asks for all *possible* products, both pathways must be considered,
    # even if one is kinetically favored (the Kinetic Isotope Effect makes H-abstraction faster).

    # Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C6 -> leads to 3-deuterobenzyne.
    # Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C2 -> leads to non-deuterated benzyne.
    # This results in two distinct benzyne intermediates.

    # --- Step 2: Simulate the nucleophilic addition to each intermediate ---
    # The nucleophile is the amide anion (NH2-).
    # We use a set to store the unique product names to avoid duplicates.
    products = set()

    # Products from the 3-deuterobenzyne intermediate (from Pathway A):
    # The triple bond is between C1 and C6. The deuterium is at C2.
    # 1. Attack at C1: NH2 group at C1, D at C2. Product: 2-deuteroaniline.
    products.add("2-deuteroaniline")
    # 2. Attack at C6: NH2 group at C6, D at C2. Renumbering the ring to place NH2 at C1,
    #    the deuterium is at C3. Product: 3-deuteroaniline.
    products.add("3-deuteroaniline")

    # Products from the non-deuterated benzyne intermediate (from Pathway B):
    # The triple bond is between C1 and C2. There is no deuterium.
    # 3. Attack at either C1 or C2 results in the same product: aniline.
    products.add("aniline")
