    # Step 1: Determine the final product structure

    # to form a stable 6-membered ring.

    # An alternative, but less likely product, would be from an intermolecular reaction.
    # The problem's setup strongly implies the cyclization.
    
    # Step 2: Analyze the symmetry of the expected product
    # The product has a cyclohexane ring with -CN and -COOEt on C1.
    # A plane of symmetry passes through C1, C4, and the substituents.
    # Therefore, the molecule is ACHIRAL.
