This is a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction, which causes the alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid. The reagents facilitate the bromination at the carbon atom adjacent to the carboxyl group.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH)\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\nProduct 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid. This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction, where the carboxylic acid is converted into an ethyl ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3)\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\nProduct 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in a substitution reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3)\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\nProduct 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane.\n*   Sodium hydride, a strong base, removes a proton from the carbon atom situated between the nitrile and the ester group, which is acidic. This creates a carbanion.\n*   This carbanion then acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an alkylation reaction.\n*   Because excess sodium hydride is used, the remaining acidic proton on the now-substituted alpha-carbon is also removed, creating a second carbanion.\n*   This carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular nucleophilic attack, displacing the second bromine atom and forming a six-membered ring.\n*   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate, we must analyze its molecular symmetry. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C1 and C4 carbons of the cyclohexane ring and the two substituents on C1 (the cyano and ethyl carboxylate groups). This symmetry makes pairs of protons chemically equivalent.\n\nAssuming rapid chair-flipping of the cyclohexane ring at room temperature, which averages the axial and equatorial positions, we can identify the following distinct sets of hydrogen atoms:\n1.  **The ethyl group (-OCH2CH3):**\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH2-) are chemically equivalent. They will produce one signal.\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH3) are chemically equivalent. They will produce a second signal.\n2.  **The cyclohexane ring:**\n    *   The four protons on C2 and C6 are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. They will produce a third signal.\n    *   The four protons on C3 and C5 are also equivalent to each other for the same reason. They will produce a fourth signal.\n    *   The two protons on C4 are unique and equivalent to each other. They will produce a fifth signal.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 5 chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe step-by-step synthesis leads to the final product, 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane. To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in its 1H NMR spectrum, we must analyze the chemical equivalence of the protons in the molecule.\n\n**Reaction Pathway:**\n\n1.  **Product 1:** Acetic acid undergoes alpha-bromination. The combination of bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride, while not the standard Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky reaction, can achieve this transformation. Pyridine acts as a base, and acetic anhydride can form a more reactive intermediate. The product is bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n2.  **Product 2:** Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) is esterified with ethanol using an acid catalyst (sulfuric acid). This is a classic Fischer esterification, yielding ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n3.  **Product 3:** Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) reacts with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an SN2 reaction to form ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n4.  **Product 4:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) has acidic protons on the carbon between the cyano and ester groups. In the presence of excess sodium hydride (a strong base), this carbon is deprotonated. The resulting carbanion attacks one end of 1,5-dibromopentane. The excess base then removes the remaining acidic proton, and the newly formed carbanion performs an intramolecular cyclization, displacing the second bromine atom to form a stable six-membered ring. The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane):**\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals, which requires careful consideration of the molecule's symmetry and stereochemistry.\n\n*   **Chirality and Symmetry:** The central carbon of the cyclohexane ring (C1) is attached to four different groups: a cyano group (-CN), an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃), and two different paths around the ring (C2 and C6). This makes C1 a chiral center. Due to this chirality and the two different substituents on C1, the molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent due to free rotation and will produce **one signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene (-OCH₂-) group are adjacent to a chiral center (C1). This makes them diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent. Therefore, they will produce **two distinct signals**.\n    *   Total signals from the ethyl group: 1 + 2 = 3.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   At room temperature, cyclohexane and its simple derivatives undergo rapid chair-flipping. This conformational change averages the chemical environments of the axial and equatorial protons on each carbon.\n    *   Because the molecule lacks any symmetry, the five methylene (CH₂) groups of the ring (at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6) are all chemically distinct from one another.\n    *   Due to the rapid chair-flipping, the two protons on each of these carbons become equivalent on the NMR timescale.\n    *   This results in **five distinct signals** for the ring protons, one for each of the five non-equivalent CH₂ groups.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\n\nAdding the signals from the ethyl group and the cyclohexane ring:\n3 (from ethyl group) + 5 (from ring) = 8 distinct hydrogen signals.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the structure of the final product, followed by an analysis of its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O).\n*   **Reaction:** This is an α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid, a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Acetic acid is brominated at the α-carbon.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a sequence involving two alkylations on the same carbon, leading to cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH, a strong base, removes an acidic α-proton from ethyl cyanoacetate, forming a stabilized carbanion (enolate). The α-protons are acidic due to the two adjacent electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The enolate attacks one end of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The resulting product still has one acidic α-proton. Since NaH is in excess, this proton is also removed.\n        NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + NaH → [NC-C((CH2)5Br)-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    4.  **Intramolecular Alkylation (Cyclization):** The newly formed carbanion attacks the other end of the carbon chain, displacing the second bromide ion. This intramolecular SN2 reaction forms a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.\n\n**Structure of Product 4:**\nThe structure is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH2CH3) group attached to the same carbon atom (C1).\n\n      EtOOC   CN\n           \\ /\n            C (C1)\n           / \\\n      H2C---CH2 (C2, C6)\n      |     |\n      H2C---CH2 (C3, C5)\n       \\   /\n        CH2 (C4)\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the chemical equivalence of the protons in the molecule, considering symmetry and conformational dynamics (rapid chair-flipping at room temperature).\n\n1.  **Symmetry:** The molecule is achiral. Due to rapid rotation around single bonds and rapid chair-flipping, the molecule has a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group. This plane relates the left and right sides of the ring:\n    *   C2 is equivalent to C6.\n    *   C3 is equivalent to C5.\n\n2.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH2CH3):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH3) group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene (-OCH2-) group are rendered equivalent (enantiotopic) by the molecular plane of symmetry. They are isochronous in a standard NMR experiment. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n3.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The two primary chair conformers are:\n        *   Conformer A: -COOEt group equatorial, -CN group axial.\n        *   Conformer B: -COOEt group axial, -CN group equatorial.\n    *   The ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOEt) is sterically bulkier than the cyano group (-CN). Therefore, Conformer A is more stable than Conformer B, and their populations in the equilibrium are unequal (pA > pB).\n    *   **Geminal Protons:** For a substituted cyclohexane, geminal protons (the two protons on the same CH2 group) are diastereotopic. They only become equivalent through rapid chair-flipping if the two interconverting chair forms have equal energy (pA = pB). Since pA ≠ pB in our case, the time-averaging does not make the geminal protons equivalent. Therefore, the axial (ax) and equatorial (eq) protons on each carbon will have distinct chemical shifts.\n\nLet's count the signals from the ring based on this:\n*   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The plane of symmetry makes H-2ax equivalent to H-6ax, and H-2eq equivalent to H-6eq. However, H-2ax and H-2eq are not equivalent. This results in two distinct signals: one for the (H-2ax, H-6ax) pair and one for the (H-2eq, H-6eq) pair. This gives **2 signals**.\n*   **Protons on C3 and C5:** Similarly, H-3ax is equivalent to H-5ax, and H-3eq is equivalent to H-5eq. But H-3ax and H-3eq are not equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n*   **Protons on C4:** C4 lies on the plane of symmetry. The two protons, H-4ax and H-4eq, are diastereotopic and not interconverted by the symmetry operation. They are not made equivalent by the unequal chair-flipping. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\n*   From the ethyl group: 1 (CH3) + 1 (CH2) = 2 signals\n*   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = 6 signals\n*   **Total = 2 + 6 = 8 distinct hydrogen signals.**\n\nThe eight signals are:\n1.  -CH3 (ethyl)\n2.  -OCH2- (ethyl)\n3.  H-2ax / H-6ax\n4.  H-2eq / H-6eq\n5.  H-3ax / H-5ax\n6.  H-3eq / H-5eq\n7.  H-4ax\n8.  H-4eq\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis and the determination of the number of signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents performs an alpha-halogenation of the carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid (the CH3 group) is brominated.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid group of bromoacetic acid reacts with ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** The cyanide ion (CN-) is a good nucleophile. It will displace the bromide ion from the alpha-carbon via an SN2 reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a two-step alkylation process leading to cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH, a strong base, removes a proton from the carbon alpha to both the cyano and ester groups, which is highly acidic. This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion: [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻.\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion. This forms NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br.\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation and Cyclization:** Since excess NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining alpha-hydrogen. The resulting carbanion then performs an intramolecular SN2 attack on the other end of the carbon chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 5: 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n*   **Structure:** Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3), attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry:**\n    *   Because the two substituents on C1 are different, the molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or rotational axis (other than the trivial C1 axis). The molecule is chiral, with C1 being the stereocenter.\n*   **Chemically Distinct Hydrogens:** In a chiral molecule with no symmetry, all protons that are not interchangeable by rapid bond rotation (like in a methyl group) are chemically distinct.\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   The five CH2 groups of the ring (at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6) are all in different chemical environments because there is no plane of symmetry.\n        *   Within each CH2 group, the two protons (one axial and one equatorial in the chair conformation) are diastereotopic because they are on a ring with a stereocenter. They are not interchangeable and are chemically distinct.\n        *   Therefore, there are 5 distinct CH2 groups, each contributing 2 distinct proton signals.\n        *   Number of signals from the ring = 5 × 2 = 10 signals.\n    *   **Ethoxycarbonyl Group (-COOCH2CH3) Protons:**\n        *   **-CH3 group:** The three protons of the terminal methyl group are equivalent due to fast rotation around the C-C bond. This gives 1 signal.\n        *   **-CH2- group:** The two protons of the methylene group are technically diastereotopic because they are in a chiral molecule. Rigorously, they should give two distinct signals. However, in the context of typical spectroscopy problems, the effect of a chiral center that is several bonds away is often considered negligible, and these protons are treated as chemically equivalent. If we follow this common simplification, they give 1 signal.\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Based on the most rigorous chemical principles, the count would be 10 (ring) + 2 (ethyl CH2) + 1 (ethyl CH3) = 13. This is not an option.\n    *   Applying the common simplification that the diastereotopic protons of the ethyl group are not resolved:\n        *   Signals from the ring = 10\n        *   Signals from the ethyl group = 1 (for -CH2-) + 1 (for -CH3-) = 2\n        *   Total signals = 10 + 2 = 12.\n\nThis count matches one of the provided options.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n-   Ring protons: 10 distinct signals (5 CH2 groups, each with 2 diastereotopic protons).\n-   Ethyl group protons: 2 distinct signals (1 for the CH2 group, 1 for the CH3 group, applying the common simplification).\n-   Total = 10 + 2 = 12.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nMy reasoning process has led me to a consistent conclusion despite the erratic behavior of the computational tool. Let's summarize the steps and the final conclusion.\n\n**Step-by-Step Chemical Synthesis:**\n\n1.  **Acetic Acid + Br2, Pyridine, Acetic Anhydride:** This is an alpha-bromination reaction, yielding **Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH)**.\n2.  **Product 1 + Ethanol, H2SO4:** This is a Fischer esterification, yielding **Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3)**.\n3.  **Product 2 + NaCN:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2), where cyanide replaces bromide, yielding **Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3)**.\n4.  **Product 3 + excess NaH + 1,5-dibromopentane:** This is a double alkylation reaction. The active methylene protons of ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic (pKa ~11) and are deprotonated by the strong base sodium hydride (NaH). Two equivalents of the resulting enolate react with one equivalent of 1,5-dibromopentane at both ends. This forms the final product, **diethyl 2,8-dicyanononane-1,9-dioate**.\n\n**Structure of Final Product (4):**\n\n```\n      CN         CN\n      |          |\nEtOOC-CH-(CH2)5-CH-COOEt\n```\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4:**\n\nThe key to determining the number of signals is to analyze the symmetry of the molecule. The product has two chiral centers (at C2 and C8), so it exists as diastereomers. We can analyze the meso form, which has a plane of symmetry, to simplify the counting.\n\n*   **Structure with labels for analysis:**\n    `EtOOC-CH(a)-(CH2(b)-CH2(c)-CH2(d)-CH2(c')-CH2(b'))-CH(a')-COOEt'`\n*   **Symmetry:** The meso form has a plane of symmetry passing through the central `CH2(d)` group. This makes the left and right halves of the molecule chemically equivalent.\n*   **Counting the Signals:**\n    1.  **Ethyl Groups (-OCH2CH3):** The two ethyl groups are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry.\n        *   The `-CH3` protons are equivalent to each other. **(1 signal)**\n        *   The `-OCH2-` protons are adjacent to a chiral center (`a`), making them diastereotopic (chemically non-equivalent). **(2 signals)**\n    2.  **Alpha-Protons (-CH(CN)-):** The two alpha-protons (`H-a` and `H-a'`) are equivalent by symmetry. **(1 signal)**\n    3.  **Pentyl Chain Protons (-(CH2)5-):**\n        *   The `CH2(b)` and `CH2(b')` groups are equivalent. The two protons within each group are diastereotopic. **(2 signals)**\n        *   The `CH2(c)` and `CH2(c')` groups are equivalent. The two protons within each group are diastereotopic. **(2 signals)**\n        *   The central `CH2(d)` group lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two protons are diastereotopic. **(2 signals)**\n\n*   **Total Count:**\n    *   From ethyl groups: 1 + 2 = 3 signals\n    *   From alpha-protons: 1 signal\n    *   From pentyl chain: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals\n    *   **Total = 3 + 1 + 6 = 10 signals**\n\nThe analysis of the chiral (R,R or S,S) diastereomer, which has a C2 axis of symmetry, also yields 10 signals.\n\nThe computational tool provided inconsistent and incorrect outputs (20, 22), likely due to limitations in analyzing the symmetry of this complex, flexible molecule. The fundamental analysis based on chemical principles is more reliable and consistently points to 10 distinct signals.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.

The C1 carbon is bonded to four different groups: -CN, -COOCH2CH3, and the two different pathways around the cyclohexane ring. This makes C1 a chiral center.\n    # 2. A chiral molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.\n    # 3. The cyclohexane ring contains five methylene (CH2) groups at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6.\n    # 4. Due to the lack of symmetry, all five of these CH2 groups are chemically non-equivalent.\n    # 5. Within each of these five non-equivalent CH2 groups, the two protons are diastereotopic, meaning they are also chemically distinct from each other.\n    # 6.

Nucleophilic substitution with NaCN gives ethyl cyanoacetate (Product 3).\n    4.  Reaction with NaH and 1,5-dibromopentane causes a double alkylation of the alpha-carbon. The alpha-carbon and the 5-carbon chain of the dibromopentane form a 6-membered ring. The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane (Product 4).\n\n    To determine the number of ¹H NMR signals for 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane:\n    *   The carbon atom at position 1 (C1) is attached to four different groups (-CN, -COOEt, and the two different paths around the ring), making it a chiral center.\n    *   The presence of this chiral center means the molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n    *   The cyclohexane ring has five methylene (CH₂) groups. Since there is no symmetry, all five are chemically distinct.\n    *   Within each of these five CH₂ groups, the two protons are diastereotopic and thus are also chemically distinct. This gives 5 × 2 = 10 signals from the ring protons.\n    *   The ethyl group (-OCH₂CH₃) provides two additional signals: one for the methylene protons and one for the methyl protons.\n    *   The total number of distinct hydrogen signals is 10 (from the ring) + 2 (from the ethyl group) = 12.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of hydrogen signals in the final product's ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n### Reaction Sequence Analysis\n\n1.  **Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n    *   Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is treated with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride. This is a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction, which causes the alpha-halogenation of the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Product 1** is α-bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n    *   Product 1 (BrCH₂COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a Fischer esterification reaction.\n    *   **Product 2** is ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n    *   Product 2 (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   **Product 3** is ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n    *   Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br). This is an intramolecular cyclization reaction known as the Thorpe-Ziegler reaction.\n    *   First, NaH removes an acidic proton from the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate.\n    *   The resulting carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion.\n    *   Since excess NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining acidic proton on the α-carbon of the newly formed intermediate.\n    *   This second carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 attack on the other end of the pentane chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Product 4** is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n### ¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4\n\nThe final product is **ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**. To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethyl carboxylate group (-COOCH₂CH₃) attached to the same carbon atom (C1).\n\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, its two substituents, and the opposite carbon, C4. This symmetry makes the two halves of the ring chemically equivalent.\n\nLet's count the chemically distinct sets of hydrogens:\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-O-**CH₂**-CH₃) are equivalent to each other but distinct from all other protons. This gives **one signal**.\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-O-CH₂-**CH₃**) are equivalent to each other. This gives a second, distinct **signal**.\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring:**\n    *   Due to the plane of symmetry, the protons on C2 are equivalent to the protons on C6, and the protons on C3 are equivalent to those on C5.\n    *   On any given carbon of the cyclohexane ring (that is not C1), the two attached protons (one axial, one equatorial in the chair conformation) are diastereotopic. This means they are in different chemical environments and are not equivalent.\n    *   **C2 and C6 Protons:** There are four protons in total. The two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent to each other. This results in **two distinct signals**.\n    *   **C3 and C5 Protons:** Similarly, the four protons on these carbons give rise to **two distinct signals** (one for the two axial protons, one for the two equatorial protons).\n    *   **C4 Protons:** The two protons on C4 are also diastereotopic and not equivalent to any other protons in the molecule. This gives another **two distinct signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nAdding them all up:\n*   2 signals from the ethyl group.\n*   6 signals from the cyclohexane ring (2 from C2/C6, 2 from C3/C5, and 2 from C4).\n\nTotal = 2 + 6 = **8 distinct hydrogen signals**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe search results confirm the plausibility of the reaction sequence. Specifically, the reaction of ethyl cyanoacetate with dihaloalkanes to form cycloalkane derivatives is documented. The analysis of 1H NMR spectra of substituted cyclohexanes is also a well-established field, confirming that geminal protons on a ring are often diastereotopic and that symmetry dictates the number of signals. My initial analysis of the final product's symmetry and the resulting number of NMR signals appears to be correct. No information found contradicts my step-by-step deduction. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Product 1:** Acetic acid is treated with bromine and a catalyst (pyridine).

This is a classic Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid is converted to an ester.\n    *   **Reactant:** Br-CH₂-COOH\n    *   **Reaction:** Fischer Esterification with ethanol\n    *   **Product 2:** Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃ (Ethyl bromoacetate)\n\n3.  **Product 3:** Ethyl bromoacetate is treated with sodium cyanide. This is a nucleophilic substitution (Sₙ2) reaction, where the cyanide ion displaces the bromide ion.\n    *   **Reactant:** Br-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃\n    *   **Reaction:** Sₙ2 with NaCN\n    *   **Product 3:** NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃ (Ethyl cyanoacetate)\n\n4.  **Product 4:** Ethyl cyanoacetate is treated with excess sodium hydride (a strong base) and 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    *   First, the acidic α-hydrogen of ethyl cyanoacetate is removed by NaH to form an enolate.\n    *   This enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the brominated carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   Since excess NaH is used, the second (and now only) α-hydrogen is also removed, creating a new enolate.\n    *   This second enolate undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain to displace the second bromine and form a stable six-membered ring.\n    *   **Reactant:** NC-CH₂-COOCH₂CH₃\n    *   **Reaction:** Double alkylation followed by intramolecular cyclization.\n    *   **Product 4:** 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n### ¹H NMR Analysis of Product 4:\n\nThe final product is a cyclohexane ring substituted at the C1 position with both a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₂CH₃) group. To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n          CN\n          |\n       /--C--\\\n      |  |    |\n    H₂C  COOCH₂CH₃\n      |       |\n    H₂C     CH₂\n      \\       /\n       CH₂-CH₂\n    ```\n\n*   **Symmetry:** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the C1 and C4 carbons of the ring, as well as the cyano and ester substituents. This symmetry makes the protons on one side of the ring (C2, C3) equivalent to the protons on the other side (C6, C5).\n\n*   **Counting the Signals:**\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):** The two methylene (-CH₂-) protons are equivalent to each other, and the three methyl (-CH₃) protons are equivalent to each other. These two groups are in different chemical environments. This gives **2 signals**.\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   **C2 and C6:** These positions are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. On each carbon, the two protons (axial and equatorial) are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. The axial proton on C2 is equivalent to the axial on C6, and the equatorial on C2 is equivalent to the equatorial on C6. This results in **2 signals** from these four protons.\n        *   **C3 and C5:** Similar to the C2/C6 positions, these are equivalent. The axial and equatorial protons are distinct from each other and from the C2/C6 protons. This gives another **2 signals**.\n        *   **C4:** This position lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two protons (axial and equatorial) are diastereotopic and not equivalent to each other or any other protons. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Signals:** Adding them up: 2 (from ethyl group) + 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = **8 distinct signals**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe search results confirm the feasibility of the reaction sequence. Specifically, the reaction of ethyl cyanoacetate with 1,5-dibromopentane is a known method for synthesizing ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.

The resulting carbanion undergoes a nucleophilic attack on one end of 1,5-dibromopentane. A second deprotonation by excess NaH is followed by an intramolecular cyclization to form the 6-membered ring of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\nThe final structure is confirmed. The counting of signals based on chemical equivalence and symmetry is correct. There are 2 signals from the ethyl group and 3 signals from the cyclohexane ring protons, for a total of 5 signals.\n\nFinal Answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis and the determination of the number of signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Reaction Sequence\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Starting Material:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O) with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is designed to achieve the alpha-halogenation of the carboxylic acid. The reaction replaces a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group (the alpha-carbon) with a bromine atom. This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid.\n    *   Structure: Br-CH2-COOH\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid, BrCH2COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) with heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with the alcohol in the presence of a strong acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate.\n    *   Structure: Br-CH2-C(=O)-O-CH2-CH3\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction.

This intramolecular SN2 reaction forms a stable six-membered ring.\n*   **Final Product 4:** 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n    *   Structure: A cyclohexane ring with a -CN group and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n### Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the chemical equivalence of all hydrogen atoms in the molecule 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n1.  **Symmetry of the Molecule:**\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is attached to a cyano group (-CN), an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOC2H5), and two different ring carbons (C2 and C6).\n    *   The ethoxycarbonyl group is asymmetric. Because of this, the molecule as a whole lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion, making it a chiral molecule.\n    *   The lack of symmetry means that ring carbons C2 and C6 are not chemically equivalent, C3 and C5 are not chemically equivalent, and C4 is unique.\n\n2.  **Dynamic Effects (Chair Flip):**\n    *   At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-to-chair interconversion. This process is fast on the NMR timescale.\n    *   This rapid flipping averages the chemical environments of the axial and equatorial protons on any single carbon atom. So, the two protons on C2 will give a single, time-averaged signal. The same applies to C3, C4, C5, and C6.\n\n3.  **Counting the Distinct Signals:**\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   Because C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6 are all in chemically distinct environments, each CH2 group will produce a unique signal.\n        *   Signal 1: 2 protons on C2 (time-averaged).\n        *   Signal 2: 2 protons on C3 (time-averaged).\n        *   Signal 3: 2 protons on C4 (time-averaged).\n        *   Signal 4: 2 protons on C5 (time-averaged, distinct from C3).\n        *   Signal 5: 2 protons on C6 (time-averaged, distinct from C2).\n        *   This gives a total of **5 distinct signals** from the ring protons.\n\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-O-CH2-CH3) Protons:**\n        *   The ethyl group is attached to a stereocenter (C1), placing it in a chiral environment.\n        *   **Methylene Protons (-O-CH2-):** Because these two protons are in a chiral molecule, they are diastereotopic. This means they are in chemically different environments and are non-equivalent. They will produce **2 distinct signals**.\n        *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation around the C-C bond. They will produce **1 distinct signal**.\n        *   This gives a total of 2 + 1 = **3 distinct signals** from the ethyl group.\n\n4.  **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Total Signals = (Signals from ring) + (Signals from ethyl group)\n    *   Total Signals = 5 + 3 = 8\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of 1H NMR signals for the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\nAcetic acid is treated with bromine (Br₂) and pyridine/acetic anhydride.

Sodium hydride, a strong base, deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is positioned between the electron-withdrawing cyano and ester groups.\n2.  The resulting carbanion (enolate) is a strong nucleophile.\n3.  The reaction involves a double alkylation of two ethyl cyanoacetate molecules by one molecule of 1,5-dibromopentane. The use of excess reagents and the setup suggest an intermolecular reaction is more likely intended for this problem, connecting two ethyl cyanoacetate units with the five-carbon chain. The intramolecular cyclization, while often efficient, would lead to a product with 6 distinct signals, which is not an option.\n*   The reaction is: 2 NCCH₂COOEt + Br(CH₂)₅Br + 2 NaH → (EtOOC)(NC)CH-(CH₂)₅-CH(CN)(COOEt) + 2 NaBr\n*   **Product 4:** Diethyl 2,8-dicyanodecanedioate\n\n**Analysis of 1H NMR Signals for Product 4**\n\nThe product, diethyl 2,8-dicyanodecanedioate, has two chiral centers at C2 and C8. This means it will exist as a mixture of diastereomers: a meso compound ((2R,8S)) and a pair of enantiomers ((2R,8R) and (2S,8S)). For the purpose of determining the number of signals for \"the\" product, we can analyze either diastereomer, as they often lead to the same number of signals in introductory problems. Let's analyze the meso form, which possesses a plane of symmetry (Cs), and the enantiomeric pair, which possesses a C2 axis of symmetry.\n\nLet's assume a common simplification for such problems: diastereotopic protons that are far from a chiral center may not be resolved and can be counted as a single signal. The protons of the -OCH₂- group in the ethyl ester fall into this category.\n\n**Analysis of either diastereomer (meso or d/l-pair) with the simplification:**\n\n1.  **Ethyl -CH₃ protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry (either Cs or C2). The three protons of each methyl group are equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n2.  **Ethyl -OCH₂- protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Assuming the two diastereotopic protons on each methylene are not resolved, they give a single signal. This gives **1 signal**.\n3.  **-CH(CN)- protons:** The two protons on the chiral centers (C2 and C8) are equivalent due to symmetry. This gives **1 signal**.\n4.  **Pentamethylene Bridge -(CH₂)₅-:** The bridge is symmetrical. Let's label the carbons from the outside in: -(CH₂)a-(CH₂)b-(CH₂)c-(CH₂)b'-(CH₂)a'-.\n    *   The two -(CH₂)a- groups are equivalent by symmetry. The two protons on one of these carbons are diastereotopic (adjacent to a chiral center) and are non-equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   The two -(CH₂)b- groups are equivalent by symmetry. The two protons on one of these carbons are also diastereotopic and non-equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   The central -(CH₂)c- group lies on the element of symmetry (the C2 axis passes through it, or the Cs plane bisects it). The two protons on this carbon are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nAdding them up: 1 (ethyl CH₃) + 1 (ethyl CH₂) + 1 (CHCN) + 2 (CH₂a) + 2 (CH₂b) + 1 (CH₂c) = **8 signals**.\n\nThis number matches one of the given options. While a more rigorous analysis could yield 9 signals for each diastereomer (by counting the ethyl -OCH₂- protons as two distinct signals), the presence of 8 as an option strongly suggests that the simplified analysis is intended.\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe user has confirmed that the previous analysis was correct.

The resulting anion undergoes a double alkylation with 1,5-dibromopentane. The second alkylation is an intramolecular cyclization, which is highly favored for forming a 6-membered ring.

The two protons of the methylene (-OCH₂-) group are adjacent to a stereocenter (C1) and are technically diastereotopic. However, in the context of multiple-choice questions, they are often treated as equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n        *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:** Due to the plane of symmetry and the fixed substitution pattern, we analyze the pairs of carbons.\n            3.  **C2 & C6:** These positions are equivalent. The axial and equatorial protons at these positions are distinct from each other. So, H-2ax is equivalent to H-6ax, and H-2eq is equivalent to H-6eq. **(2 signals)**\n            4.  **C3 & C5:** These positions are equivalent. Similar to the C2/C6 protons, the axial and equatorial protons are distinct. **(2 signals)**\n            5.  **C4:** This position is unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. Its axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic and thus distinct. **(2 signals)**\n    *   **Total Signals:** 1 (ethyl-CH₃) + 1 (ethyl-CH₂) + 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = **8 signals**.\n\nThis count matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nProposer's path seems the most logical. The reaction sequence is standard for forming a substituted cyclohexane ring. The ambiguity lies in counting the 1H NMR signals, which depends on assumptions about conformational mobility (ring flipping) and the definition of a \"signal\" (whether to count diastereotopic protons separately).\n\nLet's break down the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Reaction Analysis:**\n    *   **Step 1:** Acetic acid + Br2/Pyridine/Acetic Anhydride → Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH). This is an α-bromination reaction.\n    *   **Step 2:** Bromoacetic acid + Ethanol/H₂SO₄ → Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃). This is a standard Fischer esterification.\n    *   **Step 3:** Ethyl bromoacetate + NaCN → Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃). This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) where cyanide displaces bromide.\n    *   **Step 4:** Ethyl cyanoacetate + excess NaH + 1,5-dibromopentane → Final Product (4).\n        *   Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, forming an enolate.\n        *   This enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        *   The use of *excess* NaH ensures that the α-carbon of this new intermediate is also deprotonated.\n        *   This second enolate then undergoes an *intramolecular* SN2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain to displace the second bromide and form a stable six-membered ring.\n        *   The final product (4) is **Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n2.  **Structure and Symmetry of Product 4:**\n    *   The product has a cyclohexane ring. Attached to one carbon (C1) are a cyano group (-CN) and an ethyl carboxylate group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. This means the NMR spectrum will reflect a time-averaged structure.\n    *   This time-averaged structure possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group.\n    *   This symmetry makes pairs of carbons and their associated hydrogens chemically equivalent:\n        *   The protons on C2 are equivalent to the protons on C6.\n        *   The protons on C3 are equivalent to the protons on C5.\n        *   C4 and its protons are unique.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Signal Counting:**\n    Based on this symmetry, we can identify the distinct sets of hydrogen atoms:\n    *   **Signal 1:** The three protons of the ethyl group's methyl (-CH₃).\n    *   **Signal 2:** The two protons of the ethyl group's methylene (-OCH₂-).\n    *   **Signal 3:** The four protons on the C2 and C6 positions of the ring. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent as a set.\n    *   **Signal 4:** The four protons on the C3 and C5 positions of the ring. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent as a set.\n    *   **Signal 5:** The two protons on the C4 position of the ring.\n\nThis analysis leads to a total of **5 distinct hydrogen signals**. While the protons within each CH₂ group on the ring are technically diastereotopic and could have different chemical shifts, in the context of this type of problem, it is common to count each symmetrically distinct group of protons as one signal. This interpretation aligns with one of the given options. The more rigorous count of 7 signals (counting diastereotopic protons separately) is not an option, nor are the counts for alternative products or conformations.\n\nTherefore, the number of observable distinct hydrogen signals is 5.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Final Product (4)\n\nThe reaction sequence is the most critical part of the problem. Let's trace the transformations.\n\n1.  **Acetic acid → Product 1:** The reaction of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) with bromine (Br₂), pyridine, and acetic anhydride is an α-bromination (a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky type reaction). This replaces a hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group with a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Product 1 → Product 2:** Product 1 is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a standard Fischer esterification.\n    *   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Product 2 → Product 3:** Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) is a strong nucleophile that displaces the bromide ion in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Product 3 → Product 4:** This is the key step. Ethyl cyanoacetate is an \"active methylene\" compound, meaning the protons on the central carbon (-CH₂-) are acidic. It reacts with excess sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, and 1,5-dibromopentane.\n    *   NaH removes a proton from the active methylene carbon to form a carbanion (enolate).\n    *   This carbanion attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion.\n    *   Because *excess* NaH is used, the second proton on the now-substituted α-carbon is also removed.\n    *   The resulting carbanion performs an *intramolecular* attack on the other end of the carbon chain, displacing the second bromide. This cyclization is highly favored as it forms a stable six-membered ring. This is known as a Thorpe-Ziegler reaction.\n    *   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\nSome candidate answers incorrectly proposed an intermolecular reaction forming a long chain. However, intramolecular cyclization to form a 6-membered ring is the standard and expected outcome for this reaction.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Symmetry of Product 4\n\nThe structure of Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\nTo count the number of distinct ¹H NMR signals, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\n*   **Chirality:** The molecule is **achiral**. The carbon at C1 is attached to -CN, -COOEt, C2, and C6. Since the path from C1 around the ring through C2 is identical to the path through C6 (-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-), C1 is not a stereocenter.\n*   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group. This plane makes the two halves of the ring equivalent.\n    *   C2 is equivalent to C6.\n    *   C3 is equivalent to C5.\n\n### Step 3: Count the Distinct Hydrogen Signals\n\nWe count the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n\n1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH₃) are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH₂-) are related by the plane of symmetry, making them enantiotopic. In a standard NMR experiment (using an achiral solvent), they are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   *Total from ethyl group = 2 signals.*\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:** This is the most nuanced part. On a substituted ring, the two protons on a single methylene (CH₂) group (geminal protons) are typically **diastereotopic**, meaning they are in different chemical environments and are not equivalent.\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C6:** These two carbons are equivalent by symmetry. However, the axial proton on C2 (H-2ax) and the equatorial proton on C2 (H-2eq) are diastereotopic. The plane of symmetry makes H-2ax equivalent to H-6ax, and H-2eq equivalent to H-6eq. Therefore, these four protons give rise to **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C5:** The same logic applies. These carbons are equivalent by symmetry, but the geminal protons are diastereotopic. This results in **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   **Protons on C4:** This carbon lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two geminal protons (H-4ax and H-4eq) are not related by the plane and are diastereotopic. They are chemically distinct. This gives **2 distinct signals**.\n    *   *Total from ring = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals.*\n\n### Final Tally\n\n*   Signals from ethyl group: 2\n*   Signals from cyclohexane ring: 6\n*   **Total distinct signals = 2 + 6 = 8**\n\nThis analysis aligns with the reasoning in candidate answers 3, 7, and 14, which correctly identify the product, its symmetry, and the consequences for the NMR spectrum. Answers proposing 5 signals oversimplify the problem by ignoring the non-equivalence of diastereotopic protons. Answers proposing 12 signals incorrectly assume the molecule is chiral.\n\nThe correct number of distinct hydrogen signals is 8.\n\n<<<D>>>"

This is a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction, which causes the alpha-halogenation of a carboxylic acid.

This creates a carbanion.\n*   This carbanion then acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the bromine-bearing carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane in an alkylation reaction.\n*   Because excess sodium hydride is used, the remaining acidic proton on the now-substituted alpha-carbon is also removed, creating a second carbanion.\n*   This carbanion then undergoes an intramolecular nucleophilic attack, displacing the second bromine atom and forming a six-membered ring.\n*   **Final Product 4:** Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate, we must analyze its molecular symmetry. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C1 and C4 carbons of the cyclohexane ring and the two substituents on C1 (the cyano and ethyl carboxylate groups). This symmetry makes pairs of protons chemically equivalent.\n\nAssuming rapid chair-flipping of the cyclohexane ring at room temperature, which averages the axial and equatorial positions, we can identify the following distinct sets of hydrogen atoms:\n1.  **The ethyl group (-OCH2CH3):**\n    *   The two protons of the methylene group (-OCH2-) are chemically equivalent. They will produce one signal.\n    *   The three protons of the methyl group (-CH3) are chemically equivalent. They will produce a second signal.\n2.  **The cyclohexane ring:**\n    *   The four protons on C2 and C6 are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry.

They will produce a fourth signal.\n    *   The two protons on C4 are unique and equivalent to each other. They will produce a fifth signal.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 5 chemically distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe step-by-step synthesis leads to the final product, 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane. To determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals in its 1H NMR spectrum, we must analyze the chemical equivalence of the protons in the molecule.\n\n**Reaction Pathway:**\n\n1.  **Product 1:** Acetic acid undergoes alpha-bromination. The combination of bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride, while not the standard Hell-Vollhard-Zelinsky reaction, can achieve this transformation. Pyridine acts as a base, and acetic anhydride can form a more reactive intermediate. The product is bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n2.  **Product 2:** Product 1 (bromoacetic acid) is esterified with ethanol using an acid catalyst (sulfuric acid). This is a classic Fischer esterification, yielding ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n3.  **Product 3:** Product 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) reacts with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an SN2 reaction to form ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n4.  **Product 4:** Product 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) has acidic protons on the carbon between the cyano and ester groups. In the presence of excess sodium hydride (a strong base), this carbon is deprotonated. The resulting carbanion attacks one end of 1,5-dibromopentane. The excess base then removes the remaining acidic proton, and the newly formed carbanion performs an intramolecular cyclization, displacing the second bromine atom to form a stable six-membered ring. The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4 (1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane):**\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals, which requires careful consideration of the molecule's symmetry and stereochemistry.\n\n*   **Chirality and Symmetry:** The central carbon of the cyclohexane ring (C1) is attached to four different groups: a cyano group (-CN), an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃), and two different paths around the ring (C2 and C6). This makes C1 a chiral center. Due to this chirality and the two different substituents on C1, the molecule has no plane of symmetry.\n\n*   **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent due to free rotation and will produce **one signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene (-OCH₂-) group are adjacent to a chiral center (C1). This makes them diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent. Therefore, they will produce **two distinct signals**.\n    *   Total signals from the ethyl group: 1 + 2 = 3.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   At room temperature, cyclohexane and its simple derivatives undergo rapid chair-flipping. This conformational change averages the chemical environments of the axial and equatorial protons on each carbon.\n    *   Because the molecule lacks any symmetry, the five methylene (CH₂) groups of the ring (at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6) are all chemically distinct from one another.\n    *   Due to the rapid chair-flipping, the two protons on each of these carbons become equivalent on the NMR timescale.\n    *   This results in **five distinct signals** for the ring protons, one for each of the five non-equivalent CH₂ groups.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\n\nAdding the signals from the ethyl group and the cyclohexane ring:\n3 (from ethyl group) + 5 (from ring) = 8 distinct hydrogen signals.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the structure of the final product, followed by an analysis of its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O).\n*   **Reaction:** This is an α-halogenation of a carboxylic acid, a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. Acetic acid is brominated at the α-carbon.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification, where the carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) and sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-) displaces the bromide ion.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess sodium hydride (NaH), and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a sequence involving two alkylations on the same carbon, leading to cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH, a strong base, removes an acidic α-proton from ethyl cyanoacetate, forming a stabilized carbanion (enolate). The α-protons are acidic due to the two adjacent electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt).\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The enolate attacks one end of 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻ + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + Br⁻\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** The resulting product still has one acidic α-proton. Since NaH is in excess, this proton is also removed.\n        NC-CH((CH2)5Br)-COOEt + NaH → [NC-C((CH2)5Br)-COOEt]⁻ Na⁺ + H₂\n    4.  **Intramolecular Alkylation (Cyclization):** The newly formed carbanion attacks the other end of the carbon chain, displacing the second bromide ion. This intramolecular SN2 reaction forms a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate.\n\n**Structure of Product 4:**\nThe structure is a cyclohexane ring with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH2CH3) group attached to the same carbon atom (C1).\n\n      EtOOC   CN\n           \\ /\n            C (C1)\n           / \\\n      H2C---CH2 (C2, C6)\n      |     |\n      H2C---CH2 (C3, C5)\n       \\   /\n        CH2 (C4)\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the chemical equivalence of the protons in the molecule, considering symmetry and conformational dynamics (rapid chair-flipping at room temperature).\n\n1.  **Symmetry:** The molecule is achiral. Due to rapid rotation around single bonds and rapid chair-flipping, the molecule has a time-averaged plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group. This plane relates the left and right sides of the ring:\n    *   C2 is equivalent to C6.\n    *   C3 is equivalent to C5.\n\n2.  **Ethyl Group (-COOCH2CH3):**\n    *   The three protons of the methyl (-CH3) group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   The two protons of the methylene (-OCH2-) group are rendered equivalent (enantiotopic) by the molecular plane of symmetry. They are isochronous in a standard NMR experiment. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n3.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n    *   The cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-chair interconversion. The two primary chair conformers are:\n        *   Conformer A: -COOEt group equatorial, -CN group axial.\n        *   Conformer B: -COOEt group axial, -CN group equatorial.\n    *   The ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOEt) is sterically bulkier than the cyano group (-CN). Therefore, Conformer A is more stable than Conformer B, and their populations in the equilibrium are unequal (pA > pB).\n    *   **Geminal Protons:** For a substituted cyclohexane, geminal protons (the two protons on the same CH2 group) are diastereotopic. They only become equivalent through rapid chair-flipping if the two interconverting chair forms have equal energy (pA = pB). Since pA ≠ pB in our case, the time-averaging does not make the geminal protons equivalent. Therefore, the axial (ax) and equatorial (eq) protons on each carbon will have distinct chemical shifts.\n\nLet's count the signals from the ring based on this:\n*   **Protons on C2 and C6:** The plane of symmetry makes H-2ax equivalent to H-6ax, and H-2eq equivalent to H-6eq. However, H-2ax and H-2eq are not equivalent. This results in two distinct signals: one for the (H-2ax, H-6ax) pair and one for the (H-2eq, H-6eq) pair. This gives **2 signals**.\n*   **Protons on C3 and C5:** Similarly, H-3ax is equivalent to H-5ax, and H-3eq is equivalent to H-5eq. But H-3ax and H-3eq are not equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n*   **Protons on C4:** C4 lies on the plane of symmetry. The two protons, H-4ax and H-4eq, are diastereotopic and not interconverted by the symmetry operation. They are not made equivalent by the unequal chair-flipping. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\n*   From the ethyl group: 1 (CH3) + 1 (CH2) = 2 signals\n*   From the cyclohexane ring: 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = 6 signals\n*   **Total = 2 + 6 = 8 distinct hydrogen signals.**\n\nThe eight signals are:\n1.  -CH3 (ethyl)\n2.  -OCH2- (ethyl)\n3.  H-2ax / H-6ax\n4.  H-2eq / H-6eq\n5.  H-3ax / H-5ax\n6.  H-3eq / H-5eq\n7.  H-4ax\n8.  H-4eq\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the multi-step synthesis and the determination of the number of signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n*   **Reaction:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating.\n*   **Analysis:** This set of reagents performs an alpha-halogenation of the carboxylic acid, similar to the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) reaction. The alpha-carbon of acetic acid (the CH3 group) is brominated.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (Br-CH2-COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and a small amount of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic Fischer esterification reaction. The carboxylic acid group of bromoacetic acid reacts with ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form an ester.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Analysis:** The cyanide ion (CN-) is a good nucleophile. It will displace the bromide ion from the alpha-carbon via an SN2 reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH2-CO-O-CH2-CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Reaction:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a two-step alkylation process leading to cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH, a strong base, removes a proton from the carbon alpha to both the cyano and ester groups, which is highly acidic. This forms a resonance-stabilized carbanion: [NC-CH-COOEt]⁻.\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The carbanion acts as a nucleophile and attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion. This forms NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br.\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation and Cyclization:** Since excess NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining alpha-hydrogen. The resulting carbanion then performs an intramolecular SN2 attack on the other end of the carbon chain, displacing the second bromide ion and forming a six-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n**Step 5: 1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n*   **Structure:** Product 4 is a cyclohexane ring with two different substituents, a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3), attached to the same carbon (C1).\n*   **Symmetry:**\n    *   Because the two substituents on C1 are different, the molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or rotational axis (other than the trivial C1 axis). The molecule is chiral, with C1 being the stereocenter.\n*   **Chemically Distinct Hydrogens:** In a chiral molecule with no symmetry, all protons that are not interchangeable by rapid bond rotation (like in a methyl group) are chemically distinct.\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   The five CH2 groups of the ring (at positions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6) are all in different chemical environments because there is no plane of symmetry.\n        *   Within each CH2 group, the two protons (one axial and one equatorial in the chair conformation) are diastereotopic because they are on a ring with a stereocenter. They are not interchangeable and are chemically distinct.\n        *   Therefore, there are 5 distinct CH2 groups, each contributing 2 distinct proton signals.\n        *   Number of signals from the ring = 5 × 2 = 10 signals.\n    *   **Ethoxycarbonyl Group (-COOCH2CH3) Protons:**\n        *   **-CH3 group:** The three protons of the terminal methyl group are equivalent due to fast rotation around the C-C bond. This gives 1 signal.\n        *   **-CH2- group:** The two protons of the methylene group are technically diastereotopic because they are in a chiral molecule. Rigorously, they should give two distinct signals. However, in the context of typical spectroscopy problems, the effect of a chiral center that is several bonds away is often considered negligible, and these protons are treated as chemically equivalent. If we follow this common simplification, they give 1 signal.\n*   **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Based on the most rigorous chemical principles, the count would be 10 (ring) + 2 (ethyl CH2) + 1 (ethyl CH3) = 13. This is not an option.\n    *   Applying the common simplification that the diastereotopic protons of the ethyl group are not resolved:\n        *   Signals from the ring = 10\n        *   Signals from the ethyl group = 1 (for -CH2-) + 1 (for -CH3-) = 2\n        *   Total signals = 10 + 2 = 12.\n\nThis count matches one of the provided options.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n-   Ring protons: 10 distinct signals (5 CH2 groups, each with 2 diastereotopic protons).\n-   Ethyl group protons: 2 distinct signals (1 for the CH2 group, 1 for the CH3 group, applying the common simplification).\n-   Total = 10 + 2 = 12.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nMy reasoning process has led me to a consistent conclusion despite the erratic behavior of the computational tool. Let's summarize the steps and the final conclusion.\n\n**Step-by-Step Chemical Synthesis:**\n\n1.  **Acetic Acid + Br2, Pyridine, Acetic Anhydride:** This is an alpha-bromination reaction, yielding **Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH)**.\n2.  **Product 1 + Ethanol, H2SO4:** This is a Fischer esterification, yielding **Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3)**.\n3.  **Product 2 + NaCN:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2), where cyanide replaces bromide, yielding **Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3)**.\n4.  **Product 3 + excess NaH + 1,5-dibromopentane:** This is a double alkylation reaction. The active methylene protons of ethyl cyanoacetate are acidic (pKa ~11) and are deprotonated by the strong base sodium hydride (NaH). Two equivalents of the resulting enolate react with one equivalent of 1,5-dibromopentane at both ends.

The product has two chiral centers (at C2 and C8), so it exists as diastereomers. We can analyze the meso form, which has a plane of symmetry, to simplify the counting.\n\n*   **Structure with labels for analysis:**\n    `EtOOC-CH(a)-(CH2(b)-CH2(c)-CH2(d)-CH2(c')-CH2(b'))-CH(a')-COOEt'`\n*   **Symmetry:** The meso form has a plane of symmetry passing through the central `CH2(d)` group. This makes the left and right halves of the molecule chemically equivalent.\n*   **Counting the Signals:**\n    1.  **Ethyl Groups (-OCH2CH3):** The two ethyl groups are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry.\n        *   The `-CH3` protons are equivalent to each other. **(1 signal)**\n        *   The `-OCH2-` protons are adjacent to a chiral center (`a`), making them diastereotopic (chemically non-equivalent). **(2 signals)**\n    2.  **Alpha-Protons (-CH(CN)-):** The two alpha-protons (`H-a` and `H-a'`) are equivalent by symmetry. **(1 signal)**\n    3.  **Pentyl Chain Protons (-(CH2)5-):**\n        *   The `CH2(b)` and `CH2(b')` groups are equivalent. The two protons within each group are diastereotopic. **(2 signals)**\n        *   The `CH2(c)` and `CH2(c')` groups are equivalent. The two protons within each group are diastereotopic. **(2 signals)**\n        *   The central `CH2(d)` group lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two protons are diastereotopic. **(2 signals)**\n\n*   **Total Count:**\n    *   From ethyl groups: 1 + 2 = 3 signals\n    *   From alpha-protons: 1 signal\n    *   From pentyl chain: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 signals\n    *   **Total = 3 + 1 + 6 = 10 signals**\n\nThe analysis of the chiral (R,R or S,S) diastereomer, which has a C2 axis of symmetry, also yields 10 signals.\n\nThe computational tool provided inconsistent and incorrect outputs (20, 22), likely due to limitations in analyzing the symmetry of this complex, flexible molecule. The fundamental analysis based on chemical principles is more reliable and consistently points to 10 distinct signals.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\n*   **Plan:**\n    1.

This is a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction, which causes the alpha-halogenation of the carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Product 1** is α-bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n    *   Product 1 (BrCH₂COOH) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a Fischer esterification reaction.\n    *   **Product 2** is ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n    *   Product 2 (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN).

This means they are in different chemical environments and are not equivalent.\n    *   **C2 and C6 Protons:** There are four protons in total. The two axial protons (one on C2, one on C6) are equivalent to each other, and the two equatorial protons are equivalent to each other.

This symmetry makes the protons on one side of the ring (C2, C3) equivalent to the protons on the other side (C6, C5).\n\n*   **Counting the Signals:**\n    1.  **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):** The two methylene (-CH₂-) protons are equivalent to each other, and the three methyl (-CH₃) protons are equivalent to each other. These two groups are in different chemical environments. This gives **2 signals**.\n    2.  **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   **C2 and C6:** These positions are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. On each carbon, the two protons (axial and equatorial) are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct. The axial proton on C2 is equivalent to the axial on C6, and the equatorial on C2 is equivalent to the equatorial on C6. This results in **2 signals** from these four protons.\n        *   **C3 and C5:** Similar to the C2/C6 positions, these are equivalent. The axial and equatorial protons are distinct from each other and from the C2/C6 protons. This gives another **2 signals**.\n        *   **C4:** This position lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two protons (axial and equatorial) are diastereotopic and not equivalent to each other or any other protons. This gives **2 signals**.\n\n*   **Total Signals:** Adding them up: 2 (from ethyl group) + 2 (from C2/C6) + 2 (from C3/C5) + 2 (from C4) = **8 distinct signals**.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThe search results confirm the feasibility of the reaction sequence.

The cyanide ion (CN-), a good nucleophile, attacks the primary carbon bearing the bromine atom, which is a good leaving group.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate.\n    *   Structure: NC-CH2-C(=O)-O-CH2-CH3\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n*   **Starting Material:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate).\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a sequence involving deprotonation and alkylation, leading to cyclization.\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** NaH is a strong base that removes one of the acidic alpha-hydrogens from the carbon between the nitrile (-CN) and ester (-COOEt) groups, forming a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n        NC-CH2-COOEt + NaH → Na+[NC-CH-COOEt]- + H2\n    2.  **First Alkylation:** The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic carbons of 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromide ion.\n        [NC-CH-COOEt]- + Br-(CH2)5-Br → NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + Br-\n    3.  **Second Deprotonation:** Since excess NaH is used, it deprotonates the remaining, still acidic, alpha-hydrogen on the newly formed intermediate.\n        NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br + NaH → Na+[NC-C(-)(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br] + H2\n    4.  **Intramolecular Alkylation (Cyclization):** The carbanion on the alpha-carbon attacks the carbon at the other end of the pentyl chain, displacing the second bromide ion. This intramolecular SN2 reaction forms a stable six-membered ring.\n*   **Final Product 4:** 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n    *   Structure: A cyclohexane ring with a -CN group and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH2CH3) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n\n### Analysis of the 1H NMR Spectrum of Product 4\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the chemical equivalence of all hydrogen atoms in the molecule 1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane.\n\n1.  **Symmetry of the Molecule:**\n    *   The carbon atom C1 is attached to a cyano group (-CN), an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOC2H5), and two different ring carbons (C2 and C6).\n    *   The ethoxycarbonyl group is asymmetric. Because of this, the molecule as a whole lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion, making it a chiral molecule.\n    *   The lack of symmetry means that ring carbons C2 and C6 are not chemically equivalent, C3 and C5 are not chemically equivalent, and C4 is unique.\n\n2.  **Dynamic Effects (Chair Flip):**\n    *   At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-to-chair interconversion. This process is fast on the NMR timescale.\n    *   This rapid flipping averages the chemical environments of the axial and equatorial protons on any single carbon atom. So, the two protons on C2 will give a single, time-averaged signal. The same applies to C3, C4, C5, and C6.\n\n3.  **Counting the Distinct Signals:**\n\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   Because C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6 are all in chemically distinct environments, each CH2 group will produce a unique signal.\n        *   Signal 1: 2 protons on C2 (time-averaged).\n        *   Signal 2: 2 protons on C3 (time-averaged).\n        *   Signal 3: 2 protons on C4 (time-averaged).\n        *   Signal 4: 2 protons on C5 (time-averaged, distinct from C3).\n        *   Signal 5: 2 protons on C6 (time-averaged, distinct from C2).\n        *   This gives a total of **5 distinct signals** from the ring protons.\n\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-O-CH2-CH3) Protons:**\n        *   The ethyl group is attached to a stereocenter (C1), placing it in a chiral environment.\n        *   **Methylene Protons (-O-CH2-):** Because these two protons are in a chiral molecule, they are diastereotopic. This means they are in chemically different environments and are non-equivalent. They will produce **2 distinct signals**.\n        *   **Methyl Protons (-CH3):** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation around the C-C bond. They will produce **1 distinct signal**.\n        *   This gives a total of 2 + 1 = **3 distinct signals** from the ethyl group.\n\n4.  **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Total Signals = (Signals from ring) + (Signals from ethyl group)\n    *   Total Signals = 5 + 3 = 8\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the determination of the number of 1H NMR signals for the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\nAcetic acid is treated with bromine (Br₂) and pyridine/acetic anhydride. This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction, which causes the alpha-bromination of the carboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH)\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\nProduct 1 (bromoacetic acid) is heated with ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a Fischer esterification reaction.\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\nProduct 2 (ethyl bromoacetate) is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN⁻) acts as a nucleophile and displaces the bromide ion in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃)\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\nProduct 3 (ethyl cyanoacetate) is treated with excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH₂)₅-Br).\n1.  Sodium hydride, a strong base, deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, which is positioned between the electron-withdrawing cyano and ester groups.\n2.  The resulting carbanion (enolate) is a strong nucleophile.\n3.  The reaction involves a double alkylation of two ethyl cyanoacetate molecules by one molecule of 1,5-dibromopentane. The use of excess reagents and the setup suggest an intermolecular reaction is more likely intended for this problem, connecting two ethyl cyanoacetate units with the five-carbon chain. The intramolecular cyclization, while often efficient, would lead to a product with 6 distinct signals, which is not an option.\n*   The reaction is: 2 NCCH₂COOEt + Br(CH₂)₅Br + 2 NaH → (EtOOC)(NC)CH-(CH₂)₅-CH(CN)(COOEt) + 2 NaBr\n*   **Product 4:** Diethyl 2,8-dicyanodecanedioate\n\n**Analysis of 1H NMR Signals for Product 4**\n\nThe product, diethyl 2,8-dicyanodecanedioate, has two chiral centers at C2 and C8. This means it will exist as a mixture of diastereomers: a meso compound ((2R,8S)) and a pair of enantiomers ((2R,8R) and (2S,8S)). For the purpose of determining the number of signals for \"the\" product, we can analyze either diastereomer, as they often lead to the same number of signals in introductory problems. Let's analyze the meso form, which possesses a plane of symmetry (Cs), and the enantiomeric pair, which possesses a C2 axis of symmetry.\n\nLet's assume a common simplification for such problems: diastereotopic protons that are far from a chiral center may not be resolved and can be counted as a single signal. The protons of the -OCH₂- group in the ethyl ester fall into this category.\n\n**Analysis of either diastereomer (meso or d/l-pair) with the simplification:**\n\n1.  **Ethyl -CH₃ protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry (either Cs or C2). The three protons of each methyl group are equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n2.  **Ethyl -OCH₂- protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. Assuming the two diastereotopic protons on each methylene are not resolved, they give a single signal. This gives **1 signal**.\n3.  **-CH(CN)- protons:** The two protons on the chiral centers (C2 and C8) are equivalent due to symmetry. This gives **1 signal**.\n4.  **Pentamethylene Bridge -(CH₂)₅-:** The bridge is symmetrical. Let's label the carbons from the outside in: -(CH₂)a-(CH₂)b-(CH₂)c-(CH₂)b'-(CH₂)a'-.\n    *   The two -(CH₂)a- groups are equivalent by symmetry. The two protons on one of these carbons are diastereotopic (adjacent to a chiral center) and are non-equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   The two -(CH₂)b- groups are equivalent by symmetry. The two protons on one of these carbons are also diastereotopic and non-equivalent. This gives **2 signals**.\n    *   The central -(CH₂)c- group lies on the element of symmetry (the C2 axis passes through it, or the Cs plane bisects it). The two protons on this carbon are chemically equivalent. This gives **1 signal**.\n\n**Total Number of Signals:**\nAdding them up: 1 (ethyl CH₃) + 1 (ethyl CH₂) + 1 (CHCN) + 2 (CH₂a) + 2 (CH₂b) + 1 (CH₂c) = **8 signals**.\n\nThis number matches one of the given options. While a more rigorous analysis could yield 9 signals for each diastereomer (by counting the ethyl -OCH₂- protons as two distinct signals), the presence of 8 as an option strongly suggests that the simplified analysis is intended.\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThe user has confirmed that the previous analysis was correct. The reasoning is sound and has been verified.\n\n**Summary of the Derivation:**\n\n1.  **Reaction Sequence Analysis:**\n    *   **Step 1:** Acetic acid undergoes α-bromination to form bromoacetic acid (Br-CH₂-COOH).\n    *   **Step 2:** Bromoacetic acid is esterified with ethanol to form ethyl bromoacetate (Br-CH₂-COOEt).\n    *   **Step 3:** Ethyl bromoacetate reacts with sodium cyanide in an Sₙ2 reaction to form ethyl cyanoacetate (NC-CH₂-COOEt).\n    *   **Step 4:** Ethyl cyanoacetate, an active methylene compound, is deprotonated by excess sodium hydride. The resulting anion undergoes a double alkylation with 1,5-dibromopentane. The second alkylation is an intramolecular cyclization, which is highly favored for forming a 6-membered ring. The final product (4) is **1-cyano-1-ethoxycarbonylcyclohexane**.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4:**\n    *   **Structure:** A cyclohexane ring with a cyano group (-CN) and an ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃) attached to the same carbon (C1).\n    *   **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through C1, C4, and the substituents on C1. This makes the two halves of the ring (C2/C3 and C6/C5) chemically equivalent.\n    *   **Signal Counting:**\n        *   **Ethyl Group (-OCH₂CH₃):**\n            1.  The three protons of the methyl (-CH₃) group are equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n            2.  The two protons of the methylene (-OCH₂-) group are adjacent to a stereocenter (C1) and are technically diastereotopic. However, in the context of multiple-choice questions, they are often treated as equivalent. **(1 signal)**\n        *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:** Due to the plane of symmetry and the fixed substitution pattern, we analyze the pairs of carbons.\n            3.  **C2 & C6:** These positions are equivalent. The axial and equatorial protons at these positions are distinct from each other. So, H-2ax is equivalent to H-6ax, and H-2eq is equivalent to H-6eq. **(2 signals)**\n            4.  **C3 & C5:** These positions are equivalent. Similar to the C2/C6 protons, the axial and equatorial protons are distinct. **(2 signals)**\n            5.  **C4:** This position is unique and lies on the plane of symmetry. Its axial and equatorial protons are diastereotopic and thus distinct. **(2 signals)**\n    *   **Total Signals:** 1 (ethyl-CH₃) + 1 (ethyl-CH₂) + 2 (C2/C6) + 2 (C3/C5) + 2 (C4) = **8 signals**.\n\nThis count matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nProposer's path seems the most logical. The reaction sequence is standard for forming a substituted cyclohexane ring. The ambiguity lies in counting the 1H NMR signals, which depends on assumptions about conformational mobility (ring flipping) and the definition of a \"signal\" (whether to count diastereotopic protons separately).\n\nLet's break down the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Reaction Analysis:**\n    *   **Step 1:** Acetic acid + Br2/Pyridine/Acetic Anhydride → Bromoacetic acid (BrCH₂COOH). This is an α-bromination reaction.\n    *   **Step 2:** Bromoacetic acid + Ethanol/H₂SO₄ → Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH₂COOCH₂CH₃). This is a standard Fischer esterification.\n    *   **Step 3:** Ethyl bromoacetate + NaCN → Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH₂COOCH₂CH₃). This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) where cyanide displaces bromide.\n    *   **Step 4:** Ethyl cyanoacetate + excess NaH + 1,5-dibromopentane → Final Product (4).\n        *   Sodium hydride (NaH), a strong base, deprotonates the acidic α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate, forming an enolate.\n        *   This enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks one end of the 1,5-dibromopentane.\n        *   The use of *excess* NaH ensures that the α-carbon of this new intermediate is also deprotonated.\n        *   This second enolate then undergoes an *intramolecular* SN2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentane chain to displace the second bromide and form a stable six-membered ring.\n        *   The final product (4) is **Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n2.  **Structure and Symmetry of Product 4:**\n    *   The product has a cyclohexane ring. Attached to one carbon (C1) are a cyano group (-CN) and an ethyl carboxylate group (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n    *   At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. This means the NMR spectrum will reflect a time-averaged structure.\n    *   This time-averaged structure possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through C1, C4, the cyano group, and the ester group.\n    *   This symmetry makes pairs of carbons and their associated hydrogens chemically equivalent:\n        *   The protons on C2 are equivalent to the protons on C6.\n        *   The protons on C3 are equivalent to the protons on C5.\n        *   C4 and its protons are unique.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Signal Counting:**\n    Based on this symmetry, we can identify the distinct sets of hydrogen atoms:\n    *   **Signal 1:** The three protons of the ethyl group's methyl (-CH₃).\n    *   **Signal 2:** The two protons of the ethyl group's methylene (-OCH₂-).\n    *   **Signal 3:** The four protons on the C2 and C6 positions of the ring. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent as a set.\n    *   **Signal 4:** The four protons on the C3 and C5 positions of the ring. Due to symmetry, they are equivalent as a set.\n    *   **Signal 5:** The two protons on the C4 position of the ring.\n\nThis analysis leads to a total of **5 distinct hydrogen signals**. While the protons within each CH₂ group on the ring are technically diastereotopic and could have different chemical shifts, in the context of this type of problem, it is common to count each symmetrically distinct group of protons as one signal. This interpretation aligns with one of the given options. The more rigorous count of 7 signals (counting diastereotopic protons separately) is not an option, nor are the counts for alternative products or conformations.\n\nTherefore, the number of observable distinct hydrogen signals is 5.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
