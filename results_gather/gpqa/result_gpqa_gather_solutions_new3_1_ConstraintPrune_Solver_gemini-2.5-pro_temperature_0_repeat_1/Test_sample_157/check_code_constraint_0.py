def check_answer_correctness(llm_answer: str):
    """
    Checks the correctness of the LLM's answer based on the principles of molecular genetics
    outlined in the question.

    The function encodes the following logic:
    1.  A "dominant-negative" mutation is a type of "loss-of-function" mutation, not "gain-of-function".
    2.  A "dominant" mutation, by definition, results in a mutant phenotype, not a "wild-type phenotype".
    3.  For a dominant-negative effect to occur in a protein that must dimerize, the mutant protein
        *must* be able to interact (dimerize) with the wild-type protein to interfere with it.
        Therefore, a complete "loss of protein dimerization" would prevent the dominant-negative effect.
    4.  The most accurate description of the dominant-negative effect is that the mutant protein causes a
        "loss-of-function of the wild-type allele".
    5.  A common and plausible molecular mechanism for this is that the non-functional wild-type/mutant
        heterodimer is targeted for "protein degradation".

    Args:
        llm_answer (str): The final answer provided by the LLM, in the format "<<<X>>>".

    Returns:
