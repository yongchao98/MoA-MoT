    # Step 1: Calculate the ratio of orbital distances (a3/a1).
    # The relationship between equilibrium temperature (T) and orbital distance (a) is T ∝ 1/√a.
    # This implies that the ratio of orbital distances is a_j/a_i = (T_i/T_j)².
    # We can chain the ratios: a3/a1 = (a3/a2) * (a2/a1) = (T2/T3)² * (T1/T2)².
    
    a2_div_a1 = t1_div_t2 ** 2

    # Step 2: Calculate the ratio of orbital periods (P3/P1).
    # Kepler's Third Law states that P² ∝ a³, which means P ∝ a^(3/2).
    # Therefore, the ratio of orbital periods is P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2).
