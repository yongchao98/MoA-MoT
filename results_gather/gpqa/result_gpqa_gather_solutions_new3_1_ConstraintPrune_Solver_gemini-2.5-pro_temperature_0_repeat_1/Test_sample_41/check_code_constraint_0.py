    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, modeling the task as a series of constraints to prune the search space and arrive at the correct solution.

    **Constraint 1: Identify the core physical principles and prune irrelevant information.**
    The question asks for a ratio of orbital periods (P3/P1) based on ratios of equilibrium temperatures.
    *   **Relevant Principles**:
        1.  The relationship between a planet's equilibrium temperature (T_eq) and its orbital distance (semi-major axis, `a`).
        2.  Kepler's Third Law, which relates a planet's orbital period (P) to its orbital distance (`a`).
    *   **Pruning**:
        *   The planet masses (M1/M2, M2/M3) are irrelevant. Kepler's Third Law in its standard form (`P² ∝ a³`) assumes planetary mass is negligible compared to the star's mass.
        *   The specific albedo value (0.3) is irrelevant. The key information is that the albedo is *equal* for all three planets, meaning it cancels out when calculating temperature ratios.
        *   The discovery method (TTV) is background context and has no bearing on the calculation.
    *   **Pass/Fail**: All candidate answers that provided reasoning correctly identified the relevant principles and ignored the extraneous information. **PASS**.

    **Constraint 2: Establish the mathematical relationship between Temperature and Orbital Distance.**
    For planets orbiting the same star with the same albedo, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance:
    `T_eq ∝ 1/√a`
    This can be rearranged to find the ratio of orbital distances from the ratio of temperatures:
    `a_j / a_i = (T_eq_i / T_eq_j)²`
    *   **Pass/Fail**: All reasoning-based candidates correctly established this relationship. **PASS**.

    **Constraint 3: Establish the mathematical relationship between Orbital Period and Orbital Distance.**
    Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance:
    `P² ∝ a³`
    This means the ratio of periods is related to the ratio of distances as:
    `P_j / P_i = (a_j / a_i)^(3/2)`
    *   **Pass/Fail**: All reasoning-based candidates correctly established this relationship. **PASS**.

    **Constraint 4: Execute the calculation.**
    The calculation proceeds in two main steps:
    1.  Find the overall ratio of orbital distances `a3/a1`.
    2.  Use that ratio to find the final ratio of periods `P3/P1`.

    ```python
    # Constraint 4: Execute the calculation based on the derived physical laws.

    # Given ratios
    T1_div_T2 = 1.4
    T2_div_T3 = 2.3

    # Step 1: Calculate the ratio of orbital distances (a3/a1)
    # a2/a1 = (T1/T2)^2
    a2_div_a1 = T1_div_T2**2
    # a3/a2 = (T2/T3)^2
    a3_div_a2 = T2_div_T3**2
    # a3/a1 = (a3/a2) * (a2/a1)
    a3_div_a1 = a3_div_a2 * a2_div_a1

    print(f"Candidate a3/a1 ratio: {a3_div_a1:.4f}")
    # The expected value is 1.4^2 * 2.3^2 = 1.96 * 5.29 = 10.3684
    constraint_4a_passed = abs(a3_div_a1 - 10.3684) < 1e-9
    print(f"Constraint 4a (Distance Ratio Calculation): {'PASS' if constraint_4a_passed else 'FAIL'}")


    # Step 2: Calculate the ratio of orbital periods (P3/P1)
    # P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2)
    P3_div_P1 = a3_div_a1**(3/2)

    print(f"\nCandidate P3/P1 ratio: {P3_div_P1:.4f}")
    # The expected value is ~33.4
    constraint_4b_passed = abs(P3_div_P1 - 33.386) < 0.01
    print(f"Constraint 4b (Period Ratio Calculation): {'PASS' if constraint_4b_passed else 'FAIL'}")

    # Final check against options
    options = {'A': 10.4, 'B': 33.4, 'C': 3.2, 'D': 4.4}
    final_choice = None
    for key, value in options.items():
        if abs(P3_div_P1 - value) < 0.1:
            final_choice = key
            break

    print(f"\nFinal calculated value ~{P3_div_P1:.1f} matches option {final_choice}.")
    constraint_5_passed = (final_choice == 'B')
    print(f"Constraint 5 (Final Answer Mapping): {'PASS' if constraint_5_passed else 'FAIL'}")

    ```

    **Analysis of Candidates and Final Decision**

    The calculation consistently yields a numerical result of approximately **33.4**. A review of the candidate answers shows that while most correctly performed the calculation, there was significant confusion in mapping this numerical result to the correct lettered option (A, B, C, or D).

    Based on the original problem's options:
    A) ~ 10.4
    B) ~ 33.4
    C) ~ 3.2
    D) ~ 4.4

    The calculated value of ~33.4 corresponds directly to option B. The majority of candidate answers failed at this final mapping step. Answers 6 and 11 correctly performed the calculation and selected the correct option.
