Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Parent Structure:** Acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern, where all three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nThe order in which the groups are added is critical. We must consider the directing effects of the substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option Step-by-Step**\n\nLet's analyze the reaction sequence proposed in each option, starting from benzene.\n\n**A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   **Step i:** Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene.\n*   **Step ii:** Reduction of nitrobenzene gives aniline.\n*   **Step iii:** Friedel-Crafts acylation of aniline. This reaction **fails**. The basic amino group (-NH2) of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents the desired acylation. This sequence is not viable.\n\n**B) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   **Step i:** Bromination of benzene gives bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Step ii:** Nitration of bromobenzene gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-bromonitrobenzene. This establishes a 1,2- or 1,4-substitution pattern, which cannot lead to the desired 1,3,5-product.\n*   **Step iii:** Friedel-Crafts acylation of bromonitrobenzene. This reaction **fails**. The ring is strongly deactivated by both the bromo and nitro groups, preventing acylation. This sequence is not viable.\n\n**C) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ...**\n*   **Step i: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This is an excellent first step as it installs a *meta*-director.\n*   **Step ii: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n*   **Step iii: Nitration.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3).\n    *   The -COCH3 group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   Although the directing effects conflict, the reaction favors substitution at position 5. The intermediates for substitution at positions 2, 4, and 6 would place a destabilizing positive charge on the carbon atom attached to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group. The intermediate for substitution at position 5 avoids this, making it the most stable pathway. This step successfully yields the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The first three steps of this sequence provide a valid, high-yield synthesis. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous and likely an error in the question's formulation, but the core synthetic pathway is correct.\n\n**D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...**\n*   **Steps i-iv:** This sequence (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) converts benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, and finally back to benzene. This is a pointless cycle and an incorrect synthetic route.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy analyzing each option, we can see that sequences A, B, and D contain fatal chemical flaws (reactions that fail or are nonsensical). Only sequence C describes a chemically sound and logical pathway to synthesize the target molecule in its first three steps.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, we must carefully analyze the target molecule and the directing effects of its substituents at each step of the synthesis.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\n*   **Name:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are in a 1,3,5-relationship, meaning they are all *meta* to each other.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects\n\nThe order in which substituents are added to the benzene ring is critical. The directing effects of the groups involved are:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### 3. Evaluation of the Reaction Sequences\n\nA successful synthesis will introduce the groups in an order that uses their directing effects to achieve the desired 1,3,5-pattern. We must also consider reactions that are not feasible under certain conditions.\n\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (e.g., CH₃COCl/AlCl₃):** This reaction fails on strongly deactivated rings (such as nitrobenzene) and on rings containing an amino group (-NH₂) because the Lewis acid catalyst reacts with the basic nitrogen atom.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**A) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n1.  **i) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This is an excellent first step, as the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, which helps establish the 1,3,5-pattern.\n2.  **ii) Bromination:** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n3.  **iii) Nitration:** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions (2, 4, 6), the position meta to both deactivating groups (C5) is the most favorable site for electrophilic attack. This step successfully yields the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Conclusion:** The first three steps of this sequence provide a chemically sound and logical route to the desired product. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous and likely an error in the question's formulation, but they do not invalidate the correctness of the initial synthesis.\n\n**B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n*   This sequence begins by converting benzene to nitrobenzene (i), then to aniline (ii), then to a diazonium salt (iii), and finally back to benzene (iv) via deamination. This is a pointless cycle that does not lead to the product.\n\n**C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n*   This sequence forms aniline in the first two steps. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst, deactivating the ring.\n\n**D) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n*   This sequence starts with bromination, followed by nitration, which would primarily yield 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. This establishes an incorrect 1,4-substitution pattern. Furthermore, step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this product, which fails because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter a thorough analysis, Option A is the only one that contains a viable synthetic pathway. The first three steps—acylation, followed by bromination, followed by nitration—correctly utilize the directing effects of the substituents to construct the target molecule. The other options contain chemically unfeasible steps or are nonsensical.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule**: The goal is to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This molecule has three substituents on a benzene ring: an acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1, a bromo group (-Br) at position 3, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 5. The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern, where all groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n2.  **Review Directing Effects**: The order of reactions is critical. We must consider the directing effects of each substituent:\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3)**: Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br)**: Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO2)**: Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Option Systematically**: We will analyze each proposed sequence to see if it is chemically sound and leads to the correct product.\n    *   **Option A**: `i) Br2/FeBr3 ...` This starts with bromination, creating bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. The next step, nitration, would yield a mixture of 1,2- and 1,4-substituted products, not the required 1,3-pattern. Furthermore, the third step, a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a deactivated bromonitrobenzene ring, would fail. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **Option B**: `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n        *   Step i: Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene yields acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director, which is an excellent starting point for a 1,3,5-pattern.\n        *   Step ii: Bromination of acetophenone. The *meta*-directing acetyl group guides the bromine to the C3 position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n        *   Step iii: Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. Although the bromo group directs elsewhere (C2, C4, C6), the position at C5 is electronically favored, leading to the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one as the major product. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous, but the core synthesis in the first three steps is correct and viable.\n    *   **Option C**: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...` The first four steps convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, and finally back to benzene. This is a nonsensical and inefficient loop. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **Option D**: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...` This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction fails because the basic amino group of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring and preventing acylation. This option is incorrect.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: After analyzing all options, the sequence described in the first three steps of Option B is the only chemically plausible and efficient route to the target molecule.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze the target molecule and the directing effects of its substituents.\n# Target: 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n# Substituents: -COCH3 (meta-director), -Br (ortho,para-director), -NO2 (meta-director).\n# The substitution pattern is 1,3,5.\n\n# Step 2: Evaluate each option based on chemical principles.\n\n# Option A: Starts with bromination.

All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nThe order in which substituents are added to the benzene ring is critical. The directing effect of the group(s) already on the ring determines the position of the next incoming group.\n\n*   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl group):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (Bromo group):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO₂ (Nitro group):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be planned carefully. A common strategy is to introduce a *meta*-director first to guide subsequent substitutions.\n\n*   **Sequence A: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; v) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; vi) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; vii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄**\n    *   Steps i through iv (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) constitute a pointless cycle that starts with benzene and ends with benzene. This sequence is illogical.\n\n*   **Sequence B: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   Step i (Bromination) produces bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Step ii (Nitration) would yield a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. This establishes a 1,2 or 1,4-pattern, which cannot lead to the desired 1,3,5-product.\n    *   Furthermore, Step iii (Friedel-Crafts Acylation) would fail because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Sequence C: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   Step i (Nitration) and Step ii (Reduction) correctly produce aniline.\n    *   Step iii attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents acylation. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Sequence D: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    *   **Step i: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This is an excellent first step, as the acetyl group is a **meta-director**.\n    *   **Step ii: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone correctly guides the incoming bromine to the C3 position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone. This establishes the required 1,3-relationship.\n    *   **Step iii: Nitration.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The -COCH₃ group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. The -Br group directs to C2, C4, and C6. In this case of conflicting directors, substitution at C5 is strongly favored because substitution at the other positions would create a highly unstable reaction intermediate (a carbocation adjacent to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group). Therefore, this step successfully yields the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe first three steps of sequence D represent a valid, high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. The other sequences (A, B, C) contain chemically unfeasible steps or incorrect regiochemistry. The additional steps (iv-vii) listed in option D are superfluous and likely an error in the question's formulation, but the core synthetic route is correct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Parent Structure:** Acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH₃).\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5. This means all three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects\n\nThe order in which the substituents are added is critical. We must consider their directing effects in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### 3. Evaluation of Reaction Limitations\n\n*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation (CH₃COCl/AlCl₃):** This reaction does not work on strongly deactivated rings (e.g., those with a -NO₂ group) or on rings with an amino group (-NH₂) because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic nitrogen atom.\n\n### 4. Step-by-Step Evaluation of Each Option\n\nLet's analyze the reaction sequence for each option as provided in the prompt.\n\n**A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n*   Step i: Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene.\n*   Step ii: Reduction of nitrobenzene gives aniline (-NH₂).\n*   Step iii: This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation attempted on aniline. This reaction **fails** because the basic amino group reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst, deactivating the ring. This sequence is not viable.\n\n**B) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n*   **Step i: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This is an excellent first step, as the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, which is needed for the 1,3,5-pattern.\n*   **Step ii: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n*   **Step iii: Nitration.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The -COCH₃ group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. Although the -Br group directs to other positions (2, 4, 6), the position meta to the acetyl group (C5) is favored, leading to the desired product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Conclusion:** The first three steps of this sequence constitute a valid and logical synthesis of the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous, but the core pathway is correct.\n\n**C) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n*   Step i: Bromination of benzene gives bromobenzene. The -Br group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   Step ii: Nitration of bromobenzene gives mainly p-bromonitrobenzene. This establishes a 1,4-pattern, which is incorrect.\n*   Step iii: A Friedel-Crafts acylation is attempted on p-bromonitrobenzene. This reaction **fails** because the ring is strongly deactivated by both the bromo and nitro groups. This sequence is not viable.\n\n**D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n*   Steps i through iv (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) constitute a sequence that converts benzene to nitrobenzene and then back to benzene. This is a nonsensical and pointless loop. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter analyzing all options, only sequence B provides a chemically sound pathway to the target molecule.

This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...**\n    *   This sequence converts benzene to nitrobenzene (i), then to aniline (ii), then to a diazonium salt (iii), and finally back to benzene (iv) via deamination.

Option C is the only sequence whose initial steps provide a chemically sound and logical route to the desired product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful step-by-step analysis of electrophilic aromatic substitution is required.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Parent Structure:** Acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH₃).\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  Acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position C1.\n    2.  Bromo group (-Br) at position C3.\n    3.  Nitro group (-NO₂) at position C5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are in a 1,3,5-relationship, meaning they are all *meta* to each other.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects\n\nThe order in which the substituents are added is critical, as existing groups on the ring direct the position of new groups.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### 3. Evaluation of Possible Synthetic Routes\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be planned logically.\n\n*   **Starting with Bromination or Nitration:**\n    *   If we start with bromination, the bromo group (an *o,p*-director) would lead to 1,2- or 1,4-disubstituted products in the next step, which is not the required 1,3-pattern.\n    *   If we start with nitration, the resulting nitrobenzene is too strongly deactivated for a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation to occur.\n    *   Therefore, the synthesis must begin with Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n\n*   **Starting with Friedel-Crafts Acylation:**\n    1.  **Step 1: Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone.** This correctly installs the acetyl group, which is a *meta*-director and will guide the next substitution.\n    2.  **Step 2: Bromination of Acetophenone.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the C3 position, correctly forming **3-bromoacetophenone**. This establishes the crucial 1,3-relationship.\n    3.  **Step 3: Nitration of 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3).\n        *   The -COCH₃ group directs the incoming nitro group to C5.\n        *   The -Br group directs to C2, C4, and C6.\n        *   Although the directing effects are in conflict, both groups are deactivating. The positions ortho to the acetyl group (C2, C6) are highly deactivated. The position C5 is *meta* to both deactivating groups and is the most favorable site for substitution. This reaction yields the target molecule, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**, as the major product.\n\n### 4. Conclusion on the Reaction Sequence\n\nThe only viable, high-yield pathway among the possibilities is the sequence:\n**i) Friedel-Crafts Acylation → ii) Bromination → iii) Nitration**\n\n### 5. Evaluation of the Options\n\nThe provided options are long and include superfluous steps, but we must identify the one that contains the correct core synthesis.\n\n*   **Sequence starting with `i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄`:** This matches the correct pathway identified above. The first three steps produce the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are nonsensical but do not invalidate the correctness of the initial synthesis.\n*   **Sequence starting with `i) Br₂/FeBr₃`:** This is incorrect as it leads to the wrong isomers.\n*   **Sequence starting with `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄`:** This is incorrect because the subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation would either fail (on nitrobenzene) or be attempted on aniline, where it is also unfeasible.\n*   **Sequence involving a loop back to benzene:** This is illogical and inefficient.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option must be the one that begins with the sequence of acylation, followed by bromination, and then nitration. Reviewing the candidate answers, despite the confusion in labeling, the majority of well-reasoned analyses identify this correct sequence and conclude it is the only viable option. The most frequent and well-supported conclusion among the provided answers is that this sequence corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reactions for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n*   **Name:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are in a 1,3,5-relationship. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\nThe order in which substituents are added to the benzene ring is critical. The directing effects of the groups involved in the synthesis are:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence\n\nThe goal is to find a sequence that uses these directing effects to place the groups in the correct 1,3,5-positions.\n\n**A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n1.  The first step is bromination, forming bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n2.  The second step, nitration, would yield a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. This establishes a 1,2 or 1,4-pattern, which cannot lead to the desired 1,3,5-product.\n3.  Furthermore, the third step, a Friedel-Crafts acylation, would fail because the ring is strongly deactivated by both a bromo and a nitro group.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n1.  The first step is nitration to form nitrobenzene, followed by reduction to aniline.\n2.  The third step is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents acylation.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n1.  The first four steps involve nitration, reduction to an amine, diazotization, and finally deamination (removal of the amino group).\n2.  This sequence starts with benzene and, after four steps, returns to benzene. It is a nonsensical and inefficient pathway.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**D) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation to form acetophenone. This is an excellent first step, as the acetyl group is a **meta-director**.\n2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone. This establishes the required 1,3-relationship between the first two groups.\n3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The -COCH₃ group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. While the -Br group directs to other positions (2, 4, 6), the position meta to both deactivating groups (C5) is the favored site for substitution. This step successfully yields the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Conclusion:** The first three steps of this sequence provide a chemically sound and logical route to the desired product. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous and likely an error in the question's formulation, but the core synthesis is correct.\n\n### Final Decision\nBy systematically analyzing each option, sequence D is the only one that contains a viable synthetic pathway. The other options contain steps that are chemically impossible under the given conditions or are logically flawed.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful step-by-step analysis of each proposed route is required.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n*   **Name:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are in a 1,3,5-relationship, meaning they are all *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\nThe order in which substituents are added is critical because existing groups on the ring direct new groups to specific positions during electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's analyze each proposed reaction sequence based on established chemical principles.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; v) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; vi) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; vii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄**\n    This sequence is illogical. The first four steps (nitration, reduction to aniline, diazotization, and deamination with H₃PO₂) convert benzene to nitrobenzene and then back to benzene. This is a pointless cycle and an incorrect synthetic route.\n\n*   **B) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence starts with bromination, creating bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. The subsequent nitration (step ii) would yield a mixture of 2-bromonitrobenzene and 4-bromonitrobenzene. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this product. Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on strongly deactivated rings, such as those containing a nitro group. Therefore, this sequence is not viable.\n\n*   **C) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence begins by forming nitrobenzene (i) and then reducing it to aniline (ii). Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents acylation.

This correctly installs the acetyl group, which is a *meta*-director, setting up the correct regiochemistry for subsequent steps.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the C3 position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to the C5 position. Although the bromo group directs elsewhere, the position meta to both deactivating groups (C5) is the favored site of substitution. This step successfully yields the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThe subsequent steps (iv-vii) in option D are superfluous, as the target molecule has already been synthesized. However, the question asks for a sequence that *would lead to* the synthesis, and the first three steps of this option represent the only valid pathway among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe goal is to synthesize **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern. All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze Substituent Directing Effects**\nThe order of reactions is critical and is governed by the directing effects of the substituents in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS):\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Strategize the Synthesis**\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the most logical approach is to first install a *meta*-directing group. This will guide the second substituent to the correct position.\n*   **Step 1: Install a meta-director.** Of the three groups, the acetyl group is a meta-director that can be added to an active benzene ring via Friedel-Crafts acylation. Starting with nitration would create nitrobenzene, which is too deactivated for a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation. Starting with bromination would install an *ortho, para*-director, leading to the wrong isomers. Therefore, the first step must be **Friedel-Crafts acylation**.\n    *   Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone.\n\n*   **Step 2: Add the second substituent.** The acetyl group on acetophenone is a *meta*-director. Adding bromine next will place it at the 3-position.\n    *   Acetophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃ → 3-Bromoacetophenone. This correctly establishes the 1,3-relationship.\n\n*   **Step 3: Add the final substituent.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). We need to add the nitro group.\n    *   The -COCH₃ group directs the incoming -NO₂ group to position 5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   In cases of conflicting directors, the position that is least deactivated and sterically accessible is favored. Both groups are deactivating. The position at C5 is *meta* to both groups and is the most favorable site for substitution. This step successfully yields the target molecule, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Given Options**\nBased on the analysis, the correct synthetic pathway is: **i) Acylation → ii) Bromination → iii) Nitration**. Now we match this to the given options.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂...**: This sequence starts with nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination, which converts benzene back to benzene. This is a pointless loop. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃...**: This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction fails because the basic amino group reacts with the AlCl₃ catalyst, deactivating the ring. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄...**: This sequence follows the exact pathway determined to be correct: Acylation → Bromination → Nitration. The first three steps produce the desired product in high yield. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous and do not contribute to the synthesis, but the initial sequence is the only valid one among the choices. **Correct.**\n\n*   **D) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃...**: This sequence starts with bromination, installing an *ortho, para*-director. This leads to the wrong isomers in the next step. Furthermore, the Friedel-Crafts acylation in step (iii) would fail on the strongly deactivated bromonitrobenzene ring. **Incorrect.**\n\n<<<C>>>"

Evaluation of the Reaction Sequences\n\nA successful synthesis will introduce the groups in an order that uses their directing effects to achieve the desired 1,3,5-pattern.

This establishes an incorrect 1,4-substitution pattern. Furthermore, step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this product, which fails because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter a thorough analysis, Option A is the only one that contains a viable synthetic pathway. The first three steps—acylation, followed by bromination, followed by nitration—correctly utilize the directing effects of the substituents to construct the target molecule. The other options contain chemically unfeasible steps or are nonsensical.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule**: The goal is to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This molecule has three substituents on a benzene ring: an acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1, a bromo group (-Br) at position 3, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 5. The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern, where all groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n2.  **Review Directing Effects**: The order of reactions is critical. We must consider the directing effects of each substituent:\n    *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3)**: Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n    *   **Bromo group (-Br)**: Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   **Nitro group (-NO2)**: Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Option Systematically**: We will analyze each proposed sequence to see if it is chemically sound and leads to the correct product.\n    *   **Option A**: `i) Br2/FeBr3 ...` This starts with bromination, creating bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. The next step, nitration, would yield a mixture of 1,2- and 1,4-substituted products, not the required 1,3-pattern. Furthermore, the third step, a Friedel-Crafts acylation on a deactivated bromonitrobenzene ring, would fail. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **Option B**: `i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n        *   Step i: Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene yields acetophenone. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director, which is an excellent starting point for a 1,3,5-pattern.\n        *   Step ii: Bromination of acetophenone. The *meta*-directing acetyl group guides the bromine to the C3 position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n        *   Step iii: Nitration of 3-bromoacetophenone. The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH3 at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. Although the bromo group directs elsewhere (C2, C4, C6), the position at C5 is electronically favored, leading to the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one as the major product. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous, but the core synthesis in the first three steps is correct and viable.\n    *   **Option C**: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2...` The first four steps convert benzene to nitrobenzene, then to aniline, and finally back to benzene. This is a nonsensical and inefficient loop. This option is incorrect.\n    *   **Option D**: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...` This sequence attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline (the product of steps i and ii). This reaction fails because the basic amino group of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), deactivating the ring and preventing acylation. This option is incorrect.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: After analyzing all options, the sequence described in the first three steps of Option B is the only chemically plausible and efficient route to the target molecule.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Analyze the target molecule and the directing effects of its substituents.\n# Target: 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n# Substituents: -COCH3 (meta-director), -Br (ortho,para-director), -NO2 (meta-director).\n# The substitution pattern is 1,3,5.\n\n# Step 2: Evaluate each option based on chemical principles.\n\n# Option A: Starts with bromination.

Step i: Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene.\n    2.  Step ii: Reduction of nitrobenzene gives aniline.\n    3.  Step iii: Friedel-Crafts acylation of aniline. This reaction **fails**. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group (-NH2) of aniline, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents the desired acylation. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n    1.  Step i: Bromination of benzene gives bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n    2.  Step ii: Nitration of bromobenzene gives a mixture of *ortho*- and *para*-bromonitrobenzene. This does not establish the required 1,3-relationship for the final product.\n    3.  Step iii: Friedel-Crafts acylation of bromonitrobenzene. This reaction **fails**. The ring is strongly deactivated by two deactivating groups (-Br and -NO2), which prevents Friedel-Crafts reactions.

The -COCH3 group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. Although the directing effects are in conflict, the position meta to the stronger deactivating group (-COCH3) and meta to the weaker deactivating group (-Br) is the favored site for substitution. Therefore, nitration occurs predominantly at position 5, yielding the target molecule, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n    4.  The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are nonsensical as the target molecule has already been formed. However, the initial three steps constitute a valid and high-yield synthesis.

This means all three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\nThe order in which substituents are added to the benzene ring is crucial because existing groups direct new groups to specific positions during electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n*   **-COCH₃ (acetyl):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **-Br (bromo):** Deactivating but an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **-NO₂ (nitro):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n\n**3.

Steps (i) through (iv) involve nitration, reduction to an amine, diazotization, and finally deamination (removal of the amino group). This sequence starts with benzene and ends with benzene, making it a pointless and inefficient route. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    1.  Step (i) forms bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n    2.  Step (ii) nitrates bromobenzene, yielding mainly p-bromonitrobenzene.\n    3.  Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on p-bromonitrobenzene. The ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group, which prevents the Friedel-Crafts reaction from occurring. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    1.  **Step (i) Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This is an excellent first step as it introduces a *meta*-directing acetyl group.\n    2.  **Step (ii) Bromination:** The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone.\n    3.  **Step (iii) Nitration:** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The -COCH₃ group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. Although the -Br group directs to other positions (2, 4, 6), the position meta to both deactivating groups (C5) is the most favorable site for substitution. This step successfully yields the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThe subsequent steps (iv-vii) listed in the option are superfluous and chemically nonsensical, as the target molecule has already been synthesized. However, the initial three steps constitute a valid and high-yield pathway.

Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\n*   **Name:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The key feature is the 1,3,5-substitution pattern, where all substituents are *meta* to each other.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects\n\nThe order in which the groups are added is critical and is governed by their directing effects in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### 3. Evaluation of the Reaction Sequences\n\nA high-yield synthesis requires that the directing effects of the substituents guide the incoming groups to the correct positions. Let's evaluate each option:\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence is not viable. Step (i) forms nitrobenzene, and step (ii) reduces it to aniline. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents acylation.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    This sequence is illogical. The first four steps (nitration, reduction, diazotization, and deamination) serve only to convert benzene into nitrobenzene and then back into benzene. This is a pointless cycle and not a synthetic route to the target molecule.\n\n*   **C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    This sequence represents the most chemically sound pathway:\n    1.  **Step i (Acylation):** Benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation to form acetophenone. This is an excellent first step as it places a *meta*-directing acetyl group on the ring.\n    2.  **Step ii (Bromination):** The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the C3 position, correctly forming 3-bromoacetophenone. This establishes the required 1,3-relationship.\n    3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃) at C1 and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br) at C3. The acetyl group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. Although the bromo group directs to other positions (C2, C4, C6), substitution at C5 is favored, leading to the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one as the major product.\n    The first three steps constitute a valid, high-yield synthesis. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous and likely an error in the question's formulation, as the target molecule has already been formed.\n\n*   **D) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence is not viable. Step (i) forms bromobenzene, which has an *ortho, para*-directing bromo group. Step (ii) would yield a mixture of o- and p-bromonitrobenzene. Step (iii) attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this product. The ring is strongly deactivated by both the bromo and nitro groups, which causes the Friedel-Crafts reaction to fail or give extremely low yields.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the only sequence that provides a chemically logical and high-yield route to the target molecule is Option C. It correctly utilizes the directing effects of the substituents by first installing a meta-director, which then guides the subsequent substitutions to achieve the desired 1,3,5-pattern.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reactions.\n\n**1.

All three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n**2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nThe order in which substituents are added to the benzene ring is critical. The directing effect of the group(s) already on the ring determines the position of the next incoming group.\n\n*   **-COCH₃ (Acetyl group):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **-Br (Bromo group):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **-NO₂ (Nitro group):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be planned carefully. A common strategy is to introduce a *meta*-director first to guide subsequent substitutions.\n\n*   **Sequence A: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; v) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; vi) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; vii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄**\n    *   Steps i through iv (nitration, reduction, diazotization, deamination) constitute a pointless cycle that starts with benzene and ends with benzene. This sequence is illogical.\n\n*   **Sequence B: i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   Step i (Bromination) produces bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   Step ii (Nitration) would yield a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. This establishes a 1,2 or 1,4-pattern, which cannot lead to the desired 1,3,5-product.\n    *   Furthermore, Step iii (Friedel-Crafts Acylation) would fail because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Sequence C: i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    *   Step i (Nitration) and Step ii (Reduction) correctly produce aniline.\n    *   Step iii attempts a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents acylation. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Sequence D: i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    *   **Step i: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This is an excellent first step, as the acetyl group is a **meta-director**.\n    *   **Step ii: Bromination.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group on acetophenone correctly guides the incoming bromine to the C3 position, forming 3-bromoacetophenone. This establishes the required 1,3-relationship.\n    *   **Step iii: Nitration.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The -COCH₃ group directs the incoming nitro group to C5. The -Br group directs to C2, C4, and C6. In this case of conflicting directors, substitution at C5 is strongly favored because substitution at the other positions would create a highly unstable reaction intermediate (a carbocation adjacent to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group). Therefore, this step successfully yields the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe first three steps of sequence D represent a valid, high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. The other sequences (A, B, C) contain chemically unfeasible steps or incorrect regiochemistry. The additional steps (iv-vii) listed in option D are superfluous and likely an error in the question's formulation, but the core synthetic route is correct.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### 1.

In this case of conflicting directors, the position meta to the acetyl group (C5) is the major product. This is a valid synthesis. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are nonsensical for this synthesis but do not invalidate the correctness of the initial three steps.\n*   **Verdict:** This sequence is chemically sound and leads to the desired product.\n\n**B) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl iv) H3PO2; ...**\n*   This sequence involves nitration (i), reduction (ii), diazotization (iii), and deamination (iv).

Final Conclusion\nOnly option A presents a chemically viable route to the target molecule. The first three steps (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration) correctly utilize the directing effects of the substituents to build the 1,3,5-substituted product. The other options contain fundamental flaws, such as reactions that are known to fail or sequences that are chemically illogical.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Parent Structure:** Acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH₃).\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5. This means all three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\nThe order in which substituents are added to the benzene ring is crucial. The directing effects of the groups involved are:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Option\nA successful synthesis must introduce the groups in an order that respects these directing effects to achieve the 1,3,5-pattern.\n\n*   **A) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    1.  The first step is bromination, which adds an *ortho, para*-director (-Br).\n    2.  The second step, nitration, would yield a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. This 1,2- or 1,4-pattern cannot lead to the desired 1,3,5-product.\n    3.  Furthermore, the third step, a Friedel-Crafts acylation, would fail on the strongly deactivated bromonitrobenzene ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    1.  The first step is nitration to form nitrobenzene.\n    2.  The second step is the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline.\n    3.  The third step is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on aniline. This reaction fails because the basic amino group (-NH₂) reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n    1.  **Acylation:** Benzene is converted to acetophenone. This is an excellent first step, as the acetyl group is a **meta-director**.\n    2.  **Bromination:** The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming **3-bromoacetophenone**. This establishes the required 1,3-relationship.\n    3.  **Nitration:** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The -COCH₃ directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. The -Br directs to positions 2, 4, and 6. In this case of conflicting directors, the position that is least deactivated and sterically accessible is favored. The position C5 is *meta* to the strong deactivator (-COCH₃) and is the major product. This step successfully yields the target molecule, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The first three steps of this sequence provide a valid, high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous and likely an error in the question's formulation, but the core synthesis is correct.\n\n*   **D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n    1.  This sequence involves nitration (i), reduction to aniline (ii), diazotization (iii), and then deamination (iv), which removes the amino group. This series of reactions starts with benzene and ends with benzene, making it a pointless and illogical pathway.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This sequence is incorrect.\n\n### Final Decision\nBy analyzing the reaction pathways, only Option C provides a chemically sound and logical route to the target molecule. The other options contain steps that are either chemically impossible under the given conditions or are nonsensical.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\n*   **Name:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The groups are at positions 1, 3, and 5. This is a *meta* relationship between all substituents.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Directing Effects of Substituents\nThe order in which the groups are added is crucial because existing groups on the ring direct new groups to specific positions during electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence\nThe goal is to find a sequence that correctly places the three groups in the 1,3,5-pattern in high yield. A good strategy for this pattern is to introduce a *meta*-director first.\n\n**A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n1.  **Nitration:** Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n2.  **Reduction:** Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n3.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This step attempts to acylate aniline. The reaction **fails** because the basic amino group (-NH₂) of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃), forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring and prevents the desired acylation. This sequence is not viable.\n\n**B) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n1.  **Bromination:** Benzene → Bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n2.  **Nitration:** Bromobenzene is nitrated, yielding mainly *p*-bromonitrobenzene (1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene). This establishes a 1,4-substitution pattern, which is incorrect for the desired 1,3,5-product.\n3.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** This step attempts to acylate 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. The reaction **fails** because the ring is strongly deactivated by both the bromo and nitro groups. This sequence is not viable.\n\n**C) i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ...**\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Benzene → Acetophenone. This is an excellent first step, as the acetyl group is a **meta-director**.\n2.  **Bromination:** The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the 3-position, correctly forming **3-bromoacetophenone**. This establishes the required 1,3-relationship.\n3.  **Nitration:** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3).\n    *   The -COCH₃ group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5.\n    *   The -Br group directs to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n    *   Although the directing effects are in conflict, the position meta to the acetyl group (C5) is the most favorable site for substitution. The positions ortho to the acetyl group (C2, C6) are highly deactivated. Therefore, nitration occurs predominantly at C5, yielding the target molecule, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n4.  The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous and nonsensical, as the target molecule has already been synthesized. However, the initial three steps constitute a valid and high-yield synthesis.\n\n**D) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; ...**\n1.  **Nitration:** Benzene → Nitrobenzene.\n2.  **Reduction:** Nitrobenzene → Aniline.\n3.  **Diazotization:** Aniline → Benzenediazonium salt.\n4.  **Deamination:** Benzenediazonium salt + H₃PO₂ → Benzene.\nThis sequence of reactions starts with benzene and ends with benzene. It is a pointless and illogical pathway.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy analyzing each option, we can see that options A, B, and D contain chemically unfeasible steps or are nonsensical. Option C is the only sequence whose initial steps provide a chemically sound and logical route to the desired product.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful step-by-step analysis of electrophilic aromatic substitution is required.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**.\n*   **Parent Structure:** Acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH₃).\n*   **Substituents:**\n    1.  Acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position C1.\n    2.  Bromo group (-Br) at position C3.\n    3.  Nitro group (-NO₂) at position C5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are in a 1,3,5-relationship, meaning they are all *meta* to each other.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects\n\nThe order in which the substituents are added is critical, as existing groups on the ring direct the position of new groups.\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH₃):** Deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating but an **ortho, para-director**.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO₂):** Strongly deactivating and a **meta-director**.\n\n### 3. Evaluation of Possible Synthetic Routes\n\nTo achieve the 1,3,5-pattern, the synthesis must be planned logically.\n\n*   **Starting with Bromination or Nitration:**\n    *   If we start with bromination, the bromo group (an *o,p*-director) would lead to 1,2- or 1,4-disubstituted products in the next step, which is not the required 1,3-pattern.\n    *   If we start with nitration, the resulting nitrobenzene is too strongly deactivated for a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation to occur.\n    *   Therefore, the synthesis must begin with Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n\n*   **Starting with Friedel-Crafts Acylation:**\n    1.  **Step 1: Benzene + CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ → Acetophenone.** This correctly installs the acetyl group, which is a *meta*-director and will guide the next substitution.\n    2.  **Step 2: Bromination of Acetophenone.** The *meta*-directing acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the C3 position, correctly forming **3-bromoacetophenone**. This establishes the crucial 1,3-relationship.\n    3.  **Step 3: Nitration of 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3).\n        *   The -COCH₃ group directs the incoming nitro group to C5.\n        *   The -Br group directs to C2, C4, and C6.\n        *   Although the directing effects are in conflict, both groups are deactivating. The positions ortho to the acetyl group (C2, C6) are highly deactivated. The position C5 is *meta* to both deactivating groups and is the most favorable site for substitution. This reaction yields the target molecule, **1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**, as the major product.\n\n### 4. Conclusion on the Reaction Sequence\n\nThe only viable, high-yield pathway among the possibilities is the sequence:\n**i) Friedel-Crafts Acylation → ii) Bromination → iii) Nitration**\n\n### 5. Evaluation of the Options\n\nThe provided options are long and include superfluous steps, but we must identify the one that contains the correct core synthesis.\n\n*   **Sequence starting with `i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ii) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄`:** This matches the correct pathway identified above. The first three steps produce the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are nonsensical but do not invalidate the correctness of the initial synthesis.\n*   **Sequence starting with `i) Br₂/FeBr₃`:** This is incorrect as it leads to the wrong isomers.\n*   **Sequence starting with `i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄`:** This is incorrect because the subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation would either fail (on nitrobenzene) or be attempted on aniline, where it is also unfeasible.\n*   **Sequence involving a loop back to benzene:** This is illogical and inefficient.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option must be the one that begins with the sequence of acylation, followed by bromination, and then nitration. Reviewing the candidate answers, despite the confusion in labeling, the majority of well-reasoned analyses identify this correct sequence and conclude it is the only viable option. The most frequent and well-supported conclusion among the provided answers is that this sequence corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reactions for the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene.\n\n### 1.

The first step is bromination, forming bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n2.  The second step, nitration, would yield a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene. This establishes a 1,2 or 1,4-pattern, which cannot lead to the desired 1,3,5-product.\n3.  Furthermore, the third step, a Friedel-Crafts acylation, would fail because the ring is strongly deactivated by both a bromo and a nitro group.\n*   **Conclusion:** This sequence is incorrect.\n\n**B) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n1.

This establishes the required 1,3-relationship between the first two groups.\n3.  **Step iii (Nitration):** The ring now has a *meta*-director (-COCH₃ at C1) and an *ortho, para*-director (-Br at C3). The -COCH₃ group directs the incoming nitro group to position 5. While the -Br group directs to other positions (2, 4, 6), the position meta to both deactivating groups (C5) is the favored site for substitution. This step successfully yields the target molecule, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Conclusion:** The first three steps of this sequence provide a chemically sound and logical route to the desired product. The subsequent steps (iv-vii) are superfluous and likely an error in the question's formulation, but the core synthesis is correct.\n\n### Final Decision\nBy systematically analyzing each option, sequence D is the only one that contains a viable synthetic pathway.

Analyze the Target Molecule**\n*   **Name:** 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a benzene ring with three substituents:\n    1.  An acetyl group (-COCH₃) at position 1.\n    2.  A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    3.  A nitro group (-NO₂) at position 5.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The substituents are in a 1,3,5-relationship, meaning they are all *meta* to each other.\n\n**2.

Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's analyze each proposed reaction sequence based on established chemical principles.\n\n*   **A) i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO₂/HCl iv) H₃PO₂; v) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; vi) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; vii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄**\n    This sequence is illogical. The first four steps (nitration, reduction to aniline, diazotization, and deamination with H₃PO₂) convert benzene to nitrobenzene and then back to benzene. This is a pointless cycle and an incorrect synthetic route.\n\n*   **B) i) Br₂/FeBr₃ ; ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄ ; iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃ ; ...**\n    This sequence starts with bromination, creating bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. The subsequent nitration (step ii) would yield a mixture of 2-bromonitrobenzene and 4-bromonitrobenzene. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts acylation on this product. Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on strongly deactivated rings, such as those containing a nitro group.
