Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope (M+2) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 158 has a relative intensity of 32%. The ratio of the M+ to M+2 peak is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1.\n*   **Careful Point:** This 3:1 isotopic ratio is a definitive signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom** (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl).\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom. All four options have the formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and are consistent with this data.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **Broad Peak (3500-2700 cm⁻¹):** This extremely broad absorption is a hallmark feature of the O-H bond stretch in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**.\n*   **Strong, Sharp Peak (1720 cm⁻¹):** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its position, combined with the broad O-H peak, confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Careful Point:** This combination of peaks allows us to eliminate structures that are not carboxylic acids.\n    *   B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde is an aldehyde and a phenol. Eliminated.\n    *   C) Phenyl chloroformate is an ester/acid chloride derivative and lacks the O-H group. Eliminated.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. We are left with options A (2-chlorobenzoic acid) and D (4-chlorobenzoic acid).\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid, confirming the IR analysis.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** This is the most decisive piece of information. The aromatic region shows only two signals, both of which are doublets, and each represents two protons.\n*   **Careful Point:** This simple pattern (two doublets, 2H each) is a classic signature for a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the molecule makes the two protons on one side of the ring chemically equivalent to the two on the other side, resulting in only two distinct signals that split each other into doublets.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule is a para-substituted benzoic acid.\n\n**4. Final Evaluation**\n*   We have narrowed the possibilities to 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is *ortho*-substituted (1,2-disubstituted). It lacks the necessary symmetry and would show a more complex NMR spectrum with four unique aromatic proton signals. This is inconsistent with the data.\n*   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted). This structure perfectly matches the observed NMR pattern of two doublets, as well as all other spectral data.\n\nThe correct structure is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. According to the options provided in the question, this corresponds to option D.\n\nA review of the candidate answers shows that while all of them correctly identify the structure as 4-chlorobenzoic acid through sound reasoning, many have errors in matching this conclusion to the correct letter from the original prompt's list. The chemical analysis is consistently correct, but the final letter choice is often wrong. Based on a correct analysis and matching to the provided options, the answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the correct structure.\n\n### **Analysis of the Spectral Data**\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   The M+2 peak at m/z = 158 has a relative intensity of 32%. The ratio of the M+ to M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, or 3:1.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This 3:1 isotopic pattern is a definitive signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom, due to the natural abundance of its isotopes (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl).\n    *   All four options have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂, which has a nominal mass of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope), so they are all consistent with the MS data.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   There is a very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This exceptionally broad signal is the hallmark of an O-H bond stretch within a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid dimer. It is much broader than a typical alcohol O-H peak.\n    *   There is a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. This is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch, and its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated to an aromatic ring.\n    *   The combination of these two specific peaks is conclusive evidence for a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group. This allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids:\n        *   B) Phenyl chloroformate (an ester/acid chloride) is eliminated.\n        *   D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde and a phenol) is eliminated.\n    *   This leaves us with the two isomers: A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid and C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   The signal at 11.0 ppm (s, 1H) is a singlet far downfield. This is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid, confirming the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   The aromatic region shows two signals: a doublet at 8.02 ppm (2H) and a doublet at 7.72 ppm (2H).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The splitting pattern and integration in the aromatic region are the key to distinguishing the final two isomers. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, indicates a high degree of symmetry. This is the classic pattern for a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted)** benzene ring.\n    *   Evaluating the remaining options based on this pattern:\n        *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is *para*-substituted. It has a plane of symmetry, making the two protons ortho to the carboxylic acid group equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the chlorine atom equivalent. This structure would produce exactly two doublets in the aromatic region, each for two protons. This is a perfect match.\n        *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is *ortho*-substituted. It has no such symmetry. All four aromatic protons are in unique chemical environments, which would result in a more complex spectrum with four distinct signals, not two simple doublets. This is inconsistent with the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe combined spectral evidence unequivocally identifies the unknown compound. The mass spectrum confirms a chlorinated compound with a molecular weight of 156. The IR spectrum confirms it is a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the carboxylic acid and, crucially, reveals the *para*-substitution pattern on the benzene ring. Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all these criteria.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the correct structure from the provided spectral data.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:** I will interpret the molecular ion peak (M+) to determine the molecular weight and the M+2 isotope peak to identify the presence of specific elements, in this case, chlorine.\n2.  **Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data:** I will identify the key functional groups present in the molecule by looking at the characteristic absorption peaks, such as the broad O-H stretch and the sharp C=O stretch.\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data:** I will use the chemical shifts, integration, and splitting patterns of the signals to determine the types of protons and their connectivity, paying close attention to the aromatic region to deduce the substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n4.  **Synthesize the Findings and Evaluate Options:** I will combine the conclusions from all three spectroscopic techniques to build a complete picture of the molecule's structure.

Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** The peak at m/z = 158 has a relative intensity of 32%. The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1.\n*   **Careful Point:** This 3:1 M+/M+2 ratio is a definitive isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom** (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl ≈ 75% and ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom. All four options have the formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and are consistent with this data.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a highly characteristic, very broad absorption. It is the hallmark of an O-H stretch in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a C=O (carbonyl) stretch.

This eliminates option C (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde) and option D (Phenyl chloroformate). We are left with the two isomers: 4-chlorobenzoic acid and 2-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (>10 ppm) is characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**. The integration (1H) and multiplicity (singlet) confirm this assignment.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region. The key information is the pattern: two doublets, each integrating to two protons.\n*   **Careful Point:** This simple pattern indicates a high degree of symmetry. It is the classic signature of a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**.

Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** A second peak is observed at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32%. The ratio of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1.\n*   **Careful Point:** This 3:1 ratio for the M+ and M+2 peaks is a classic isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom**, due to the natural abundance of its isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%).\n*   **Conclusion:** The unknown compound has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom. All four options have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂, which is consistent with this data.\n\n### **2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very distinctive feature. An extremely broad absorption in this region is the hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The significant broadening is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of a C=O double bond stretch. The position is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Careful Point:** The combination of the very broad O-H stretch and the C=O stretch is definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group. This allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This rules out:\n    *   B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde and a phenol)\n    *   D) Phenyl chloroformate (an acid chloride/ester derivative)\n    *   We are left with options A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid and C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n### **3. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**. The integration for one proton (1H) and its appearance as a singlet (s) confirm this assignment. This is consistent with both remaining options.\n*   **Aromatic Region Signals: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** The pattern in the aromatic region is the key to distinguishing between the remaining isomers.\n*   **Careful Point:** The spectrum shows two doublets, each integrating to two protons. This simple pattern indicates a high degree of symmetry. It is a classic signature for a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The symmetry makes the two protons ortho to one substituent chemically equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent also equivalent. They split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule has a para-substituted benzene ring. Let's evaluate the final two options:\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para*-substituted molecule. Its structure perfectly predicts the observed NMR pattern of two doublets, each for two protons.\n    *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted molecule. It lacks the necessary symmetry. All four of its aromatic protons are in unique chemical environments, which would lead to a much more complex spectrum with four distinct signals, not two simple doublets.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe spectral data collectively and unequivocally identify the unknown compound as **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. The MS confirms the molecular formula and the presence of chlorine. The IR confirms the carboxylic acid functional group. The ¹H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid proton and, crucially, the *para*-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data, the correct structure for the unidentified compound is determined.\n\n### **Analysis of Spectral Data**\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS)**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z = 156 establishes the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n*   A second peak (M+2) is present at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32%.\n*   **Careful Point:** The intensity ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1. This specific isotopic signature is definitive proof that the molecule contains **one chlorine atom**, due to the natural abundance of its isotopes (³⁵Cl ≈ 75%, ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n*   All four options have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂, which is consistent with the MS data.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy**\n*   The spectrum shows a very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹.\n*   A strong, sharp peak is present at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Careful Point:** The combination of an extremely broad O-H stretch (3500-2700 cm⁻¹) and a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch (1720 cm⁻¹) is the unmistakable hallmark of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n*   This finding allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids:\n    *   A) Phenyl chloroformate (an acid chloride/ester) is eliminated.\n    *   B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde and a phenol) is eliminated.\n*   This leaves us with two possibilities: C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid and D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy**\n*   A singlet (s) is observed at 11.0 ppm, integrating to one proton (1H). This highly deshielded signal confirms the presence of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid, consistent with the IR data.\n*   Two signals appear in the aromatic region: a doublet (d) at 8.02 ppm for two protons (2H) and another doublet (d) at 7.72 ppm for two protons (2H).\n*   **Careful Point:** The pattern in the aromatic region is the key to identifying the specific isomer. The presence of only two signals, each representing two protons, indicates a high degree of molecular symmetry. This specific pattern of two doublets is a classic signature for a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**.\n\n### **Evaluation of Final Candidates**\n\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is *ortho*-substituted (1,2-disubstituted). It lacks the necessary symmetry to produce the simple NMR spectrum observed. All four of its aromatic protons are in unique chemical environments and would result in a more complex spectrum with four distinct signals, not two doublets. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n*   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted). This structure possesses the required symmetry. The two protons ortho to the carboxylic acid group are equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the chlorine atom are also equivalent. This leads to exactly two signals in the aromatic region, each splitting the other into a doublet. This perfectly matches the observed NMR data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe combined spectral evidence—the mass and chlorine isotope pattern from MS, the definitive carboxylic acid signature from IR, and the para-substitution pattern from ¹H NMR—unequivocally identifies the unknown compound as 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n*   The peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) has a relative intensity of 32%. The ratio of the M+ to M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, or about 3:1.\n*   **Careful Point 1**: This 3:1 isotopic ratio is a definitive signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom, due to the natural abundance of its isotopes (³⁵Cl ≈ 75%, ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n*   **Conclusion**: The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom. All four options are isomers with the formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and are consistent with this data.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   There is a very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹.\n*   There is a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Careful Point 2**: The combination of an extremely broad O-H stretch (3500-2700 cm⁻¹) and a carbonyl (C=O) stretch (~1720 cm⁻¹) is the classic fingerprint of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group.\n*   **Conclusion**: The compound is a carboxylic acid. This allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids:\n    *   B) Phenyl chloroformate (an ester/acid chloride) is eliminated.\n    *   C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde/phenol) is eliminated.\n    *   This leaves us with options A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid and D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data**\n*   The signal at **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)** is a singlet far downfield, which is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n*   The signals at **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)** are in the aromatic region.\n*   **Careful Point 3**: The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a hallmark of a symmetrical, para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two on the other, resulting in only two signals.\n*   **Conclusion**: The molecule is a para-substituted chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Evaluation**\n*   We must distinguish between the remaining options: A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid and D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid.\n*   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted). Its structure perfectly predicts the observed NMR spectrum: two doublets in the aromatic region, each for two protons.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is ortho-substituted (1,2-disubstituted). This structure lacks the necessary symmetry and would produce a more complex spectrum with four unique signals for the four aromatic protons.\n*   **Careful Point 4**: All three spectroscopic techniques converge on a single structure. The MS confirms a chlorinated compound of MW 156, the IR confirms it is a carboxylic acid, and the ¹H NMR confirms the para-substitution pattern. The only structure that fits all criteria is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. According to the options provided in the question, 4-chlorobenzoic acid is option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Analysis of the Spectral Data**\n\nThe problem requires identifying an unknown compound from four options using Mass Spectrometry (MS), Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy, and Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) data. The correct approach is to analyze each piece of data to deduce structural features and use a process of elimination.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n*   **Data:** A molecular ion peak (M⁺) at m/z = 156 and an M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32%.\n*   **Interpretation:** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Careful Point:** The key information is the M+2 peak. The intensity ratio of M⁺ to M+2 is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1. This specific isotopic pattern is a definitive signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom** (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl).\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom. All four options have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂, which is consistent with this data (MW for C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂ = 156).\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **Data:** A broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   The peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n    *   The peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an O-H stretch.\n*   **Careful Point:** The *extreme broadness* of the O-H peak is the crucial feature. This is the hallmark of the O-H stretch in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**, caused by extensive hydrogen bonding. A standard alcohol O-H peak is typically sharper.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group. This allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids:\n    *   A) Phenyl chloroformate (an ester/acid chloride) is eliminated.\n    *   D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde/phenol) is eliminated.\n    *   We are left with B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid and C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **Data:** 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 ppm (d, 2H).\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   The signal at 11.0 ppm is a singlet integrating to one proton.

Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   **Observation**: A molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z = 156 and an M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32%.\n*   **Interpretation**: The M+ peak indicates the molecular weight of the compound (using the most abundant isotopes) is 156 g/mol. The ratio of the M+ to M+2 peak is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1.\n*   **Careful Point**: This ~3:1 isotopic ratio is a definitive signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule, due to the natural abundance of its isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%).\n*   **Conclusion**: The unknown compound has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom. All four options have the formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and a molecular weight of ~156.5, making them all consistent with the MS data.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **Observation**: A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Interpretation**: The extremely broad peak is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid, broadened by extensive hydrogen bonding. The sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, with its position being consistent for a carboxylic acid conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Careful Point**: The combination of these two specific peaks is a hallmark of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group. This allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids.\n*   **Conclusion**: The compound is a carboxylic acid. This rules out:\n    *   A) Phenyl chloroformate (an ester/acid chloride, no O-H group).\n    *   D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde and a phenol; a phenolic O-H is not typically this broad).\n    This leaves B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid and C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid as the remaining possibilities.\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **Observation**: A singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H), a doublet at 8.02 ppm (2H), and a doublet at 7.72 ppm (2H).\n*   **Interpretation**:\n    *   The singlet at 11.0 ppm is in the characteristic region for a carboxylic acid proton, confirming the IR analysis.\n    *   The two signals in the aromatic region (8.02 and 7.72 ppm) provide the final clue. The pattern consists of two doublets, each integrating to two protons.\n*   **Careful Point**: This specific pattern of two doublets, each for 2H, indicates a high degree of symmetry. It is the classic signature of a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two on the other, resulting in only two signals.\n*   **Conclusion**: The molecule is a *para*-substituted chlorobenzoic acid.\n    *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is *para*-substituted and would produce this exact NMR pattern.\n    *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is *ortho*-substituted. It lacks the necessary symmetry and would show a more complex pattern with four unique signals for the four aromatic protons.\n\n**Final Decision**\nBy synthesizing the information from all three spectroscopic techniques, the unknown compound is unequivocally identified. The MS confirms a chlorinated compound with MW=156. The IR confirms it is a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid and, crucially, establishes the *para*-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.

Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** A significant peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32% (compared to 100% for the M+ peak) is observed. This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a definitive isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol and contains one chlorine atom. All four options are isomers with the formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and are consistent with this data.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a highly characteristic and unmistakable signal for the O-H bond stretch in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl group of a carboxylic acid, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule is a carboxylic acid. This allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids.\n    *   A) Phenyl chloroformate: This is an ester/acid chloride, not a carboxylic acid. **Eliminated.**\n    *   D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: This is an aldehyde and a phenol, not a carboxylic acid. **Eliminated.**\n*   **Remaining Candidates:** B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid and C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield is characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**. The integration (1H) and multiplicity (singlet) confirm this assignment. This is consistent with both remaining candidates.\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** This is the crucial data for determining the isomer.\n    *   The spectrum shows two signals, each a **doublet (d)**, and each integrating to **two protons (2H)**.\n    *   This simple pattern (two doublets of equal integration) is a classic signature for a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the molecule results in only two types of aromatic protons, which split each other into doublets.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule is a para-substituted benzoic acid.\n    *   B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: This is *ortho*-substituted. It lacks the necessary symmetry and would show four unique, more complex signals for the aromatic protons. **Eliminated.**\n    *   C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: This is *para*-substituted. Its structure perfectly predicts the observed NMR spectrum: a singlet for the acid proton and two doublets (each for 2H) for the aromatic protons. **This is the correct structure.**\n\n**Final Decision:**\nAll spectral data points unequivocally to 4-chlorobenzoic acid. According to the provided list of options, 4-chlorobenzoic acid is choice C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the information to arrive at the correct conclusion.\n\n**1.

This is the definitive isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom** (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl ≈ 75% and ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%). The molecular weight of the compound using the most common isotope (³⁵Cl) is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Careful Point:** All four options have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂. The nominal mass for the molecule with ³⁵Cl is 156, and with ³⁷Cl is 158. Therefore, the MS data confirms the molecular formula and the presence of one chlorine atom but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **Observation:** A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Interpretation:** The combination of these two peaks is a classic and unmistakable signature for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The extremely broad peak is the O-H stretch, which is significantly broadened by hydrogen bonding. The 1720 cm⁻¹ peak is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid conjugated to an aromatic ring.\n*   **Careful Point:** This finding is crucial as it eliminates options that are not carboxylic acids.\n    *   B) Phenyl chloroformate: This is an acid chloride/ester and lacks the O-H group. It is eliminated.\n    *   C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: This is an aldehyde and a phenol. It does not have the characteristic super-broad O-H of a carboxylic acid.

The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The symmetry of this substitution pattern means there are only two types of aromatic protons, and they split each other into doublets.\n*   **Careful Point:** This specific pattern allows for the definitive identification of the correct isomer.\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para*-substituted isomer. Its structure has the necessary symmetry to produce exactly the observed pattern of two doublets for the four aromatic protons. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted isomer. It lacks the necessary symmetry. All four of its aromatic protons are in unique chemical environments, which would lead to a much more complex spectrum (likely four distinct signals), not two simple doublets. This is a mismatch.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nThe combined spectral evidence unequivocally points to a single structure. The MS confirms a chlorinated compound with MW=156.

Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope (M+2) Peak:** The peak at m/z = 158 has a relative intensity of 32%. The ratio of the M+ to M+2 peak is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1.\n*   **Careful Point:** This 3:1 isotopic ratio is a definitive signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom** (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl).\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom.

Its position, combined with the broad O-H peak, confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Careful Point:** This combination of peaks allows us to eliminate structures that are not carboxylic acids.\n    *   B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde is an aldehyde and a phenol.

The aromatic region shows only two signals, both of which are doublets, and each represents two protons.\n*   **Careful Point:** This simple pattern (two doublets, 2H each) is a classic signature for a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the molecule makes the two protons on one side of the ring chemically equivalent to the two on the other side, resulting in only two distinct signals that split each other into doublets.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule is a para-substituted benzoic acid.\n\n**4. Final Evaluation**\n*   We have narrowed the possibilities to 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n*   **A) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is *ortho*-substituted (1,2-disubstituted). It lacks the necessary symmetry and would show a more complex NMR spectrum with four unique aromatic proton signals.

The chemical analysis is consistently correct, but the final letter choice is often wrong. Based on a correct analysis and matching to the provided options, the answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the correct structure.\n\n### **Analysis of the Spectral Data**\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n    *   The M+2 peak at m/z = 158 has a relative intensity of 32%. The ratio of the M+ to M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, or 3:1.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This 3:1 isotopic pattern is a definitive signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom, due to the natural abundance of its isotopes (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl).\n    *   All four options have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂, which has a nominal mass of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope), so they are all consistent with the MS data.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   There is a very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This exceptionally broad signal is the hallmark of an O-H bond stretch within a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid dimer. It is much broader than a typical alcohol O-H peak.\n    *   There is a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. This is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group stretch, and its position is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated to an aromatic ring.\n    *   The combination of these two specific peaks is conclusive evidence for a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group. This allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids:\n        *   B) Phenyl chloroformate (an ester/acid chloride) is eliminated.\n        *   D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde and a phenol) is eliminated.\n    *   This leaves us with the two isomers: A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid and C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n    *   The signal at 11.0 ppm (s, 1H) is a singlet far downfield. This is characteristic of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid, confirming the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   The aromatic region shows two signals: a doublet at 8.02 ppm (2H) and a doublet at 7.72 ppm (2H).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The splitting pattern and integration in the aromatic region are the key to distinguishing the final two isomers. The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, indicates a high degree of symmetry. This is the classic pattern for a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted)** benzene ring.\n    *   Evaluating the remaining options based on this pattern:\n        *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is *para*-substituted. It has a plane of symmetry, making the two protons ortho to the carboxylic acid group equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the chlorine atom equivalent. This structure would produce exactly two doublets in the aromatic region, each for two protons. This is a perfect match.\n        *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is *ortho*-substituted. It has no such symmetry. All four aromatic protons are in unique chemical environments, which would result in a more complex spectrum with four distinct signals, not two simple doublets. This is inconsistent with the data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe combined spectral evidence unequivocally identifies the unknown compound. The mass spectrum confirms a chlorinated compound with a molecular weight of 156. The IR spectrum confirms it is a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the carboxylic acid and, crucially, reveals the *para*-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.

All four options have the formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and are consistent with this data.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a highly characteristic, very broad absorption. It is the hallmark of an O-H stretch in a hydrogen-bonded **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This is a C=O (carbonyl) stretch.

This eliminates option C (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde) and option D (Phenyl chloroformate). We are left with the two isomers: 4-chlorobenzoic acid and 2-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (>10 ppm) is characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**. The integration (1H) and multiplicity (singlet) confirm this assignment.\n*   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region.

Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** A second peak is observed at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32%. The ratio of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1.\n*   **Careful Point:** This 3:1 ratio for the M+ and M+2 peaks is a classic isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom**, due to the natural abundance of its isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%).\n*   **Conclusion:** The unknown compound has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom. All four options have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂, which is consistent with this data.\n\n### **2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a very distinctive feature. An extremely broad absorption in this region is the hallmark of the O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The significant broadening is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This absorption is in the carbonyl region and is characteristic of a C=O double bond stretch. The position is consistent with a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Careful Point:** The combination of the very broad O-H stretch and the C=O stretch is definitive evidence for a carboxylic acid functional group. This allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound is a carboxylic acid. This rules out:\n    *   B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde and a phenol)\n    *   D) Phenyl chloroformate (an acid chloride/ester derivative)\n    *   We are left with options A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid and C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n### **3. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data**\n\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (typically >10 ppm) is characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**. The integration for one proton (1H) and its appearance as a singlet (s) confirm this assignment. This is consistent with both remaining options.\n*   **Aromatic Region Signals: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** The pattern in the aromatic region is the key to distinguishing between the remaining isomers.\n*   **Careful Point:** The spectrum shows two doublets, each integrating to two protons. This simple pattern indicates a high degree of symmetry. It is a classic signature for a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The symmetry makes the two protons ortho to one substituent chemically equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the other substituent also equivalent. They split each other, resulting in two doublets.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule has a para-substituted benzene ring. Let's evaluate the final two options:\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para*-substituted molecule. Its structure perfectly predicts the observed NMR pattern of two doublets, each for two protons.\n    *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted molecule. It lacks the necessary symmetry. All four of its aromatic protons are in unique chemical environments, which would lead to a much more complex spectrum with four distinct signals, not two simple doublets.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe spectral data collectively and unequivocally identify the unknown compound as **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. The MS confirms the molecular formula and the presence of chlorine. The IR confirms the carboxylic acid functional group. The ¹H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid proton and, crucially, the *para*-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data, the correct structure for the unidentified compound is determined.\n\n### **Analysis of Spectral Data**\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS)**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z = 156 establishes the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n*   A second peak (M+2) is present at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32%.\n*   **Careful Point:** The intensity ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1. This specific isotopic signature is definitive proof that the molecule contains **one chlorine atom**, due to the natural abundance of its isotopes (³⁵Cl ≈ 75%, ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n*   All four options have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂, which is consistent with the MS data.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy**\n*   The spectrum shows a very broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹.\n*   A strong, sharp peak is present at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Careful Point:** The combination of an extremely broad O-H stretch (3500-2700 cm⁻¹) and a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch (1720 cm⁻¹) is the unmistakable hallmark of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The broadness is due to extensive hydrogen bonding.\n*   This finding allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids:\n    *   A) Phenyl chloroformate (an acid chloride/ester) is eliminated.\n    *   B) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde and a phenol) is eliminated.\n*   This leaves us with two possibilities: C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid and D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy**\n*   A singlet (s) is observed at 11.0 ppm, integrating to one proton (1H). This highly deshielded signal confirms the presence of the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid, consistent with the IR data.\n*   Two signals appear in the aromatic region: a doublet (d) at 8.02 ppm for two protons (2H) and another doublet (d) at 7.72 ppm for two protons (2H).\n*   **Careful Point:** The pattern in the aromatic region is the key to identifying the specific isomer. The presence of only two signals, each representing two protons, indicates a high degree of molecular symmetry. This specific pattern of two doublets is a classic signature for a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**.\n\n### **Evaluation of Final Candidates**\n\n*   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is *ortho*-substituted (1,2-disubstituted). It lacks the necessary symmetry to produce the simple NMR spectrum observed. All four of its aromatic protons are in unique chemical environments and would result in a more complex spectrum with four distinct signals, not two doublets. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n*   **D) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This molecule is *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted). This structure possesses the required symmetry. The two protons ortho to the carboxylic acid group are equivalent, and the two protons ortho to the chlorine atom are also equivalent. This leads to exactly two signals in the aromatic region, each splitting the other into a doublet. This perfectly matches the observed NMR data.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe combined spectral evidence—the mass and chlorine isotope pattern from MS, the definitive carboxylic acid signature from IR, and the para-substitution pattern from ¹H NMR—unequivocally identifies the unknown compound as 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the spectral data to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n*   The peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) has a relative intensity of 32%. The ratio of the M+ to M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, or about 3:1.\n*   **Careful Point 1**: This 3:1 isotopic ratio is a definitive signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom, due to the natural abundance of its isotopes (³⁵Cl ≈ 75%, ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n*   **Conclusion**: The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 (for the ³⁵Cl isotope) and contains one chlorine atom.

Its structure perfectly predicts the observed NMR spectrum: two doublets in the aromatic region, each for two protons.\n*   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is ortho-substituted (1,2-disubstituted). This structure lacks the necessary symmetry and would produce a more complex spectrum with four unique signals for the four aromatic protons.\n*   **Careful Point 4**: All three spectroscopic techniques converge on a single structure.

The correct approach is to analyze each piece of data to deduce structural features and use a process of elimination.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n*   **Data:** A molecular ion peak (M⁺) at m/z = 156 and an M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32%.\n*   **Interpretation:** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound with the most abundant isotopes is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Careful Point:** The key information is the M+2 peak. The intensity ratio of M⁺ to M+2 is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1. This specific isotopic pattern is a definitive signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom** (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl).\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom. All four options have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂, which is consistent with this data (MW for C₇H₅³⁵ClO₂ = 156).\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **Data:** A broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   The peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n    *   The peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an O-H stretch.\n*   **Careful Point:** The *extreme broadness* of the O-H peak is the crucial feature. This is the hallmark of the O-H stretch in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**, caused by extensive hydrogen bonding. A standard alcohol O-H peak is typically sharper.\n*   **Conclusion:** The compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group. This allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids:\n    *   A) Phenyl chloroformate (an ester/acid chloride) is eliminated.\n    *   D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde/phenol) is eliminated.\n    *   We are left with B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid and C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **Data:** 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 ppm (d, 2H).\n*   **Interpretation:**\n    *   The signal at 11.0 ppm is a singlet integrating to one proton. A chemical shift this far downfield is definitive for the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**. This confirms the conclusion from the IR data.\n    *   The signals at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm are in the aromatic region.\n*   **Careful Point:** The pattern in the aromatic region is the key to distinguishing the final two isomers. We observe **two doublets, each integrating to two protons**. This simple, symmetric pattern is a classic signature for a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The molecule's symmetry makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two on the other, resulting in only two signals.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule is a para-substituted benzene ring.\n    *   C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid is *ortho*-substituted. It lacks the necessary symmetry and would show four unique, more complex signals in the aromatic region. It is eliminated.\n    *   B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid is *para*-substituted. This structure perfectly matches the observed NMR pattern of two doublets for the aromatic protons.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBy combining the evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques, the structure is unambiguously identified. The MS confirms a chlorinated compound with MW=156. The IR confirms it is a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid and, crucially, reveals the *para* substitution pattern on the benzene ring. Only 4-chlorobenzoic acid fits all these criteria.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the reasoning from the provided answers and highlighting the key decision points.\n\n**1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   **Observation**: A molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z = 156 and an M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32%.\n*   **Interpretation**: The M+ peak indicates the molecular weight of the compound (using the most abundant isotopes) is 156 g/mol. The ratio of the M+ to M+2 peak is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1.\n*   **Careful Point**: This ~3:1 isotopic ratio is a definitive signature for the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule, due to the natural abundance of its isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%).\n*   **Conclusion**: The unknown compound has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom. All four options have the formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and a molecular weight of ~156.5, making them all consistent with the MS data.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **Observation**: A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Interpretation**: The extremely broad peak is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid, broadened by extensive hydrogen bonding. The sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, with its position being consistent for a carboxylic acid conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Careful Point**: The combination of these two specific peaks is a hallmark of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group. This allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids.\n*   **Conclusion**: The compound is a carboxylic acid. This rules out:\n    *   A) Phenyl chloroformate (an ester/acid chloride, no O-H group).\n    *   D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (an aldehyde and a phenol; a phenolic O-H is not typically this broad).\n    This leaves B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid and C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid as the remaining possibilities.\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **Observation**: A singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H), a doublet at 8.02 ppm (2H), and a doublet at 7.72 ppm (2H).\n*   **Interpretation**:\n    *   The singlet at 11.0 ppm is in the characteristic region for a carboxylic acid proton, confirming the IR analysis.\n    *   The two signals in the aromatic region (8.02 and 7.72 ppm) provide the final clue. The pattern consists of two doublets, each integrating to two protons.\n*   **Careful Point**: This specific pattern of two doublets, each for 2H, indicates a high degree of symmetry. It is the classic signature of a *para*-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry makes the two protons on one side of the ring equivalent to the two on the other, resulting in only two signals.\n*   **Conclusion**: The molecule is a *para*-substituted chlorobenzoic acid.\n    *   **B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is *para*-substituted and would produce this exact NMR pattern.\n    *   **C) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is *ortho*-substituted. It lacks the necessary symmetry and would show a more complex pattern with four unique signals for the four aromatic protons.\n\n**Final Decision**\nBy synthesizing the information from all three spectroscopic techniques, the unknown compound is unequivocally identified. The MS confirms a chlorinated compound with MW=156. The IR confirms it is a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid and, crucially, establishes the *para*-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.

Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The peak at m/z = 156 indicates the molecular weight of the compound using the most abundant isotopes.\n*   **Isotope Peak (M+2):** A significant peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32% (compared to 100% for the M+ peak) is observed. This M+ to M+2 ratio of approximately 3:1 is a definitive isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 g/mol and contains one chlorine atom. All four options are isomers with the formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and are consistent with this data.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹:** This is a highly characteristic and unmistakable signal for the O-H bond stretch in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between molecules.\n*   **Strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. Its position is consistent with the carbonyl group of a carboxylic acid, particularly one conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule is a carboxylic acid. This allows us to eliminate options that are not carboxylic acids.\n    *   A) Phenyl chloroformate: This is an ester/acid chloride, not a carboxylic acid. **Eliminated.**\n    *   D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: This is an aldehyde and a phenol, not a carboxylic acid. **Eliminated.**\n*   **Remaining Candidates:** B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid and C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n**3. Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A signal this far downfield is characteristic of the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**. The integration (1H) and multiplicity (singlet) confirm this assignment. This is consistent with both remaining candidates.\n*   **Aromatic Region (8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm):** This is the crucial data for determining the isomer.\n    *   The spectrum shows two signals, each a **doublet (d)**, and each integrating to **two protons (2H)**.\n    *   This simple pattern (two doublets of equal integration) is a classic signature for a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The symmetry of the molecule results in only two types of aromatic protons, which split each other into doublets.\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule is a para-substituted benzoic acid.\n    *   B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: This is *ortho*-substituted. It lacks the necessary symmetry and would show four unique, more complex signals for the aromatic protons. **Eliminated.**\n    *   C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: This is *para*-substituted. Its structure perfectly predicts the observed NMR spectrum: a singlet for the acid proton and two doublets (each for 2H) for the aromatic protons. **This is the correct structure.**\n\n**Final Decision:**\nAll spectral data points unequivocally to 4-chlorobenzoic acid. According to the provided list of options, 4-chlorobenzoic acid is choice C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the information to arrive at the correct conclusion.\n\n**1. Analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   **Observation:** A molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z = 156 and an M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32%.\n*   **Interpretation:** The ratio of the M+ to M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, which simplifies to a 3:1 ratio. This is the definitive isotopic signature for a molecule containing **one chlorine atom** (due to the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl ≈ 75% and ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%). The molecular weight of the compound using the most common isotope (³⁵Cl) is 156 g/mol.\n*   **Careful Point:** All four options have the molecular formula C₇H₅ClO₂. The nominal mass for the molecule with ³⁵Cl is 156, and with ³⁷Cl is 158. Therefore, the MS data confirms the molecular formula and the presence of one chlorine atom but does not distinguish between the isomers.\n\n**2. Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Data**\n*   **Observation:** A very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ and a strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Interpretation:** The combination of these two peaks is a classic and unmistakable signature for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The extremely broad peak is the O-H stretch, which is significantly broadened by hydrogen bonding. The 1720 cm⁻¹ peak is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid conjugated to an aromatic ring.\n*   **Careful Point:** This finding is crucial as it eliminates options that are not carboxylic acids.\n    *   B) Phenyl chloroformate: This is an acid chloride/ester and lacks the O-H group. It is eliminated.\n    *   C) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: This is an aldehyde and a phenol. It does not have the characteristic super-broad O-H of a carboxylic acid. It is eliminated.\n*   **Conclusion:** The unknown compound must be either A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid or D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n**3.

The pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic sign of a **para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring**. The symmetry of this substitution pattern means there are only two types of aromatic protons, and they split each other into doublets.\n*   **Careful Point:** This specific pattern allows for the definitive identification of the correct isomer.\n    *   **A) 4-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is a *para*-substituted isomer. Its structure has the necessary symmetry to produce exactly the observed pattern of two doublets for the four aromatic protons. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid:** This is an *ortho*-substituted isomer. It lacks the necessary symmetry. All four of its aromatic protons are in unique chemical environments, which would lead to a much more complex spectrum (likely four distinct signals), not two simple doublets. This is a mismatch.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nThe combined spectral evidence unequivocally points to a single structure. The MS confirms a chlorinated compound with MW=156. The IR confirms a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR confirms the carboxylic acid and, crucially, establishes the *para*-substitution pattern. The only molecule that fits all these criteria is 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\nBased on the provided options:\nA) 4-chlorobenzoic acid\nB) Phenyl chloroformate\nC) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde\nD) 2-chlorobenzoic acid\n\nThe correct structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided spectral data and the candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**\n*   **Observation:** A molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z = 156 and an M+2 peak at m/z = 158 with a relative intensity of 32%.\n*   **Interpretation:** The ratio of the M+ to M+2 peak is approximately 100:32, or 3:1.

The ratio of the M+ peak to the M+2 peak is 100:32, which is approximately 3:1.\n*   **Careful Point:** This 3:1 isotopic ratio is a definitive signature for a molecule containing a single chlorine atom, due to the natural abundance of its isotopes (³⁵Cl ≈ 75%, ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n*   **Conclusion:** The molecule has a molecular weight of 156 and contains one chlorine atom.
