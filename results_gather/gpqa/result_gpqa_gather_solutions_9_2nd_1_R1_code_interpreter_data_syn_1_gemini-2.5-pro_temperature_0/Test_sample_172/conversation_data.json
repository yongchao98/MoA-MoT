Identify the Core Physics Principles**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE) given an uncertainty in position (Δx) for a particle moving at a certain velocity (v). This problem requires two key concepts from quantum mechanics:\n\n*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle (Position-Momentum):** This principle establishes a fundamental limit on the precision with which we can simultaneously know the position and momentum of a particle. The mathematical relation for the minimum uncertainty is:\n    Δx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n    where Δp is the uncertainty in momentum and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n\n*   **Energy-Momentum Uncertainty Relation:** The uncertainty in a particle's energy (ΔE) is related to the uncertainty in its momentum (Δp). This relationship is given by:\n    ΔE ≈ |dE/dp| ⋅ Δp\n    The term dE/dp represents the group velocity of the particle's wave packet, which is equal to the particle's speed, v. This holds true for both classical and relativistic particles. Therefore, the relation simplifies to:\n    ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp\n\n### **2. Formulate a Calculation Strategy**\n\nWe can combine the two principles above to create a direct formula for ΔE using the given information.\n\n1.  Start with the position-momentum uncertainty principle to find the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp):\n    Δp = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n\n2.  Substitute this expression for Δp into the energy-momentum uncertainty relation:\n    ΔE = v ⋅ (ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx))\n\nThis single formula allows us to calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy directly from the given values.\n\n### **3. Execute the Calculation**\n\nFirst, let's list the given values in SI units:\n*   Velocity, v = 2 × 10⁸ m/s\n*   Uncertainty in position, Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10⁻⁹ m = 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   Reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\nΔE = (2 × 10⁸ m/s) ⋅ (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 ⋅ 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)\nΔE = (1 × 10⁸ m/s) ⋅ (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)\nΔE = 1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nThe code execution confirms this result, yielding `1.055e-16 J`.\n\n### **4. Compare and Conclude**\n\nThe calculation yields a minimum uncertainty in energy of **ΔE ≈ 1.055 × 10⁻¹⁶ J**.\n\nNow, let's compare this result to the given options:\nA) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\nB) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\nC) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\nD) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\n\nThe calculated value, 1.055 × 10⁻¹⁶ J, is clearly on the order of magnitude of 10⁻¹⁶ J. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Core Physical Principles\nThe problem requires finding the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE) given the uncertainty in position (Δx). This involves two key principles:\n1.  **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle** for position and momentum.\n2.  The relationship between a particle's **energy and momentum**.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Position-Momentum Uncertainty Principle\nHeisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) along the same direction must be at least a certain value. For the minimum uncertainty, we use the equality:\nΔx ⋅ Δp = ħ / 2\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n\nWe can rearrange this to find the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp):\nΔp = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n\n### Step 3: Relate Momentum Uncertainty to Energy Uncertainty\nThe uncertainty in energy (ΔE) can be related to the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) using the following general relationship, which is valid for both classical and relativistic particles:\nΔE ≈ |dE/dp| ⋅ Δp\n\nThe term dE/dp represents the group velocity of the particle, which is equal to its speed, `v`. Therefore, the relationship simplifies to:\nΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp\n\n**Careful Point:** It is important to verify that this relationship holds even though the electron's speed (v = 2 × 10⁸ m/s) is relativistic (about 2/3 the speed of light). The relativistic energy-momentum equation is E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)². Differentiating with respect to p gives 2E(dE/dp) = 2pc², which simplifies to dE/dp = pc²/E. Using the relativistic definitions p = γm₀v and E = γm₀c², this becomes dE/dp = v. Thus, the relation ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp is correct.\n\n### Step 4: Combine Formulas and Calculate\nBy substituting the expression for Δp from Step 2 into the equation from Step 3, we get a single formula for the minimum uncertainty in energy:\nΔE_min = v ⋅ (ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx))\n\nNow, we plug in the given values in SI units:\n*   v = 2 × 10⁸ m/s\n*   Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10⁻⁹ m = 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   ħ ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\nΔE_min = (2 × 10⁸ m/s) ⋅ (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 ⋅ 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)\n\nThe factor of 2 in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\nΔE_min = (10⁸) ⋅ (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴) / (10⁻¹⁰) J\nΔE_min = 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴⁺⁸⁺¹⁰ J\nΔE_min = 1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n### Step 5: Compare with Options and Conclude\nThe calculated minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately 1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J.

Estimate the uncertainty in time (Δt) from the uncertainty in position (Δx) and velocity (v).\n2.  Use the energy-time uncertainty principle (ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2) to find the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE).\n\n### Step 3: Execute the Calculation\n\n**Method A: Position-Momentum Approach**\n\n1.  The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for position and momentum states:\n    Δx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ/2\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s). For the *minimum* uncertainty, we use the equality:\n    Δp = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n\n2.  The relationship between the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) is given by ΔE ≈ |dE/dp| ⋅ Δp. The derivative dE/dp is the particle's group velocity, which is equal to its speed, v. This holds for both classical and relativistic cases. Therefore:\n    ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp\n\n3.  Combining these two equations gives a direct formula for ΔE:\n    ΔE = v ⋅ (ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx))\n\n4.  Now, we substitute the given values:\n    ΔE = (2 × 10⁸ m/s) ⋅ (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 × 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)\n\n    The factor of '2' in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n    ΔE = (10⁸ m/s) ⋅ (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)\n    ΔE = 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴⁺⁸⁺¹⁰ J\n    ΔE = 1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n### Step 4: Verification with Method B (Energy-Time Approach)\n\n1.  Estimate the uncertainty in time (Δt) as the time it takes for the electron to pass through the region of its position uncertainty:\n    Δt ≈ Δx / v = (1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m) / (2 × 10⁸ m/s) = 5 × 10⁻¹⁹ s\n\n2.  Use the energy-time uncertainty principle for minimum uncertainty:\n    ΔE = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δt)\n    ΔE = (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 ⋅ 5 × 10⁻¹⁹ s)\n    ΔE = (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (1 × 10⁻¹⁸ s)\n    ΔE = 1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n### Step 5: Compare with Options and Conclude\n\nThe calculated minimum uncertainty in energy is **ΔE ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J**.\n\nLet's compare this to the given options:\nA) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\nB) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\nC) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\nD) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\n\nThe calculated value is clearly on the order of 10⁻¹⁶ J.

Substituting this into the energy-momentum relation (ΔE = v ⋅ Δp):\n    ΔE_min = v ⋅ (ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx))\n\nThis formula directly uses all the information given in the problem.\n\n### **3. Execution of the Calculation**\n\nThere is a strong consensus on the numerical calculation. Let's verify it using the derived formula and the given values in SI units:\n\n*   **v** (velocity) = 2 × 10⁸ m/s\n*   **Δx** (position uncertainty) = 0.1 nm = 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   **ħ** (reduced Planck constant) ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\nPlugging these into the formula:\nΔE_min = (2 × 10⁸ m/s) ⋅ (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 ⋅ 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)\n\nThe factor of '2' in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\nΔE_min = (10⁸) ⋅ (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴) / (10⁻¹⁰) J\nΔE_min = 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴⁺⁸⁺¹⁰ J\nΔE_min = 1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nThe calculation consistently and correctly yields a value of approximately **1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J**.\n\n### **4. Careful Points and Analysis**\n\n*   **Minimum Uncertainty:** The question asks for the *minimum* uncertainty, which justifies using the equality (Δx ⋅ Δp = ħ/2) rather than the inequality.\n*   **Relativistic Speed:** The electron's speed (v = 2 × 10⁸ m/s) is about 2/3 the speed of light, making it relativistic. The relationship ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp is valid for both classical and relativistic cases because the derivative dE/dp equals the particle's group velocity (v).

Identify the Core Physics Principles**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE) given an uncertainty in position (Δx) for a particle moving at a certain velocity (v). This problem requires two key concepts from quantum mechanics:\n\n*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle (Position-Momentum):** This principle establishes a fundamental limit on the precision with which we can simultaneously know the position and momentum of a particle. The mathematical relation for the minimum uncertainty is:\n    Δx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n    where Δp is the uncertainty in momentum and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n\n*   **Energy-Momentum Uncertainty Relation:** The uncertainty in a particle's energy (ΔE) is related to the uncertainty in its momentum (Δp). This relationship is given by:\n    ΔE ≈ |dE/dp| ⋅ Δp\n    The term dE/dp represents the group velocity of the particle's wave packet, which is equal to the particle's speed, v. This holds true for both classical and relativistic particles. Therefore, the relation simplifies to:\n    ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp\n\n### **2. Formulate a Calculation Strategy**\n\nWe can combine the two principles above to create a direct formula for ΔE using the given information.\n\n1.  Start with the position-momentum uncertainty principle to find the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp):\n    Δp = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n\n2.  Substitute this expression for Δp into the energy-momentum uncertainty relation:\n    ΔE = v ⋅ (ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx))\n\nThis single formula allows us to calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy directly from the given values.\n\n### **3. Execute the Calculation**\n\nFirst, let's list the given values in SI units:\n*   Velocity, v = 2 × 10⁸ m/s\n*   Uncertainty in position, Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10⁻⁹ m = 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   Reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\nΔE = (2 × 10⁸ m/s) ⋅ (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 ⋅ 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)\nΔE = (1 × 10⁸ m/s) ⋅ (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)\nΔE = 1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\nThe code execution confirms this result, yielding `1.055e-16 J`.\n\n### **4.

Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Core Physical Principles\nThe problem requires finding the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE) given the uncertainty in position (Δx). This involves two key principles:\n1.  **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle** for position and momentum.\n2.  The relationship between a particle's **energy and momentum**.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Position-Momentum Uncertainty Principle\nHeisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) along the same direction must be at least a certain value. For the minimum uncertainty, we use the equality:\nΔx ⋅ Δp = ħ / 2\nwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n\nWe can rearrange this to find the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp):\nΔp = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n\n### Step 3: Relate Momentum Uncertainty to Energy Uncertainty\nThe uncertainty in energy (ΔE) can be related to the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) using the following general relationship, which is valid for both classical and relativistic particles:\nΔE ≈ |dE/dp| ⋅ Δp\n\nThe term dE/dp represents the group velocity of the particle, which is equal to its speed, `v`. Therefore, the relationship simplifies to:\nΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp\n\n**Careful Point:** It is important to verify that this relationship holds even though the electron's speed (v = 2 × 10⁸ m/s) is relativistic (about 2/3 the speed of light). The relativistic energy-momentum equation is E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)². Differentiating with respect to p gives 2E(dE/dp) = 2pc², which simplifies to dE/dp = pc²/E. Using the relativistic definitions p = γm₀v and E = γm₀c², this becomes dE/dp = v. Thus, the relation ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp is correct.\n\n### Step 4: Combine Formulas and Calculate\nBy substituting the expression for Δp from Step 2 into the equation from Step 3, we get a single formula for the minimum uncertainty in energy:\nΔE_min = v ⋅ (ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx))\n\nNow, we plug in the given values in SI units:\n*   v = 2 × 10⁸ m/s\n*   Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 × 10⁻⁹ m = 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   ħ ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\nΔE_min = (2 × 10⁸ m/s) ⋅ (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 ⋅ 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m)\n\nThe factor of 2 in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\nΔE_min = (10⁸) ⋅ (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴) / (10⁻¹⁰) J\nΔE_min = 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴⁺⁸⁺¹⁰ J\nΔE_min = 1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n### Step 5: Compare with Options and Conclude\nThe calculated minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately 1.054 × 10⁻¹⁶ J.

Use the energy-time uncertainty principle (ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ/2) to find the minimum uncertainty in energy (ΔE).\n\n### Step 3: Execute the Calculation\n\n**Method A: Position-Momentum Approach**\n\n1.  The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for position and momentum states:\n    Δx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ/2\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s). For the *minimum* uncertainty, we use the equality:\n    Δp = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n\n2.  The relationship between the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) is given by ΔE ≈ |dE/dp| ⋅ Δp. The derivative dE/dp is the particle's group velocity, which is equal to its speed, v. This holds for both classical and relativistic cases. Therefore:\n    ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp\n\n3.

For a particle with velocity v, the relationship between small changes in energy and momentum is given by:\n    ΔE ≈ v ⋅ Δp\n    This relation is valid for both classical and relativistic particles. Given the electron's speed (v = 2 x 10⁸ m/s) is two-thirds the speed of light, using this general relation is appropriate.\n\n### **2. Formulate the Calculation**\n\nTo find the *minimum* uncertainty, we use the equality from the Heisenberg principle:\nΔp = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for Δp into the energy-momentum uncertainty relation:\nΔE = v ⋅ (ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx))\n\nThis single formula allows us to calculate the minimum uncertainty in energy directly from the given values.\n\n### **3. Perform the Calculation**\n\nFirst, ensure all values are in SI units:\n*   Velocity (v) = 2 x 10⁸ m/s\n*   Uncertainty in position (Δx) = 0.1 nm = 0.1 x 10⁻⁹ m = 1 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   Reduced Planck constant (ħ) ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula:\n\nΔE = (2 x 10⁸ m/s) ⋅ [ (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 ⋅ 1 x 10⁻¹⁰ m) ]\n\nThe factor of '2' in the numerator and denominator cancels out, simplifying the calculation:\n\nΔE = (10⁸) ⋅ [ (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴) / (10⁻¹⁰) ] J\nΔE = 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ ⋅ 10⁸ ⋅ 10¹⁰ J\nΔE = 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴⁺¹⁸ J\nΔE = 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J\n\n### **4. Compare with Options and Conclude**\n\nThe calculated minimum uncertainty in energy is ΔE ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻¹⁶ J.\n\nNow, we compare this result to the given options:\nA) ~10⁻¹⁹ J\nB) ~10⁻¹⁸ J\nC) ~10⁻¹⁶ J\nD) ~10⁻¹⁷ J\n\nThe calculated value is clearly on the order of 10⁻¹⁶ J, which matches option C.
