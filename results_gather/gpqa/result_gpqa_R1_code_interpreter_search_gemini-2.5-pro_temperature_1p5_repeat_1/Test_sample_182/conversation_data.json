    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactant**\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the starting material: **2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.\n\n*   **cyclohex-3-ene**: A six-membered carbon ring with one double bond between carbons 3 and 4.\n*   **-carboxylic acid**: A -COOH group is attached. By convention, this is at position 1.\n*   **2-formyl**: An aldehyde group (-CHO) is attached to carbon 2.\n*   **5-vinyl**: A vinyl group (-CH=CH2) is attached to carbon 5.\n\nLet's visualize the structure and identify the sources of unsaturation. The Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is calculated as the sum of the number of rings and the number of pi (π) bonds in a molecule.\n\nFor the reactant:\n1.  **One ring** (the cyclohexene ring) contributes 1 to the IHD.\n2.  **One C=C double bond** within the ring contributes 1 to the IHD.\n3.  **One C=O double bond** in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contributes 1 to the IHD.\n4.  **One C=O double bond** in the formyl group (-CHO) contributes 1 to the IHD.\n5.  **One C=C double bond** in the vinyl group (-CH=CH2) contributes 1 to the IHD.\n\nSumming these up, the IHD of the reactant is 1 (ring) + 1 (C=C) + 1 (C=O) + 1 (C=O) + 1 (C=C) = **5**.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Reaction**\n\nThe reactant is treated with **red phosphorus (Red P) and an excess of HI (hydroiodic acid)**. This combination is a very powerful reducing agent in organic chemistry. Its key functions are:\n\n*   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) and carboxylic acids (-COOH) completely to the corresponding alkyl groups (-CH3).\n*   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   It does not typically break stable carbon-carbon single bonds, such as those in a cyclohexane ring.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Structure of the Product**\n\nThe reaction will reduce all the functional groups and double bonds in the starting molecule, leaving a fully saturated hydrocarbon skeleton.\n\n*   The **cyclohexene ring** will be reduced to a **cyclohexane ring** (the C=C becomes C-C).\n*   The **carboxylic acid group** at position 1 will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH3).\n*   The **formyl group** at position 2 will be reduced to a **methyl group** (-CH3).\n*   The **vinyl group** at position 5 will be reduced to an **ethyl group** (-CH2CH3).\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclohexane, which is a saturated molecule. It contains no double or triple bonds.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nNow, we calculate the IHD for the final product.\n\nUsing the definition IHD = (Number of rings) + (Number of π bonds):\n*   **Number of rings**: The product still contains the six-membered cyclohexane ring. So, the number of rings is 1.\n*   **Number of π bonds**: All the double bonds (C=C and C=O) from the reactant have been reduced to single bonds. The product is fully saturated. So, the number of π bonds is 0.\n\nTherefore, the IHD of the product = 1 (ring) + 0 (π bonds) = **1**.\n\n**Alternative Method: Using Molecular Formula**\n\n1.  **Reactant Formula:** Let's find the molecular formula of the reactant (C10H12O3) to determine the number of carbons.\n    *   Ring: C6\n    *   -COOH: C1\n    *   -CHO: C1\n    *   -CH=CH2: C2\n    *   Total Carbons = 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10.\n2.  **Product Formula:** The reaction removes all oxygens and adds hydrogens to saturate the molecule, but the number of carbons remains the same (C=10). The product is a substituted cyclohexane. The general formula for a monocyclic alkane (a cycloalkane) is CnH2n. For C=10, the formula is **C10H20**.\n3.  **IHD Calculation:** The formula for IHD is IHD = (2C + 2 - H)/2.\n    *   IHD = (2 * 10 + 2 - 20) / 2\n    *   IHD = (22 - 20) / 2\n    *   IHD = 2 / 2 = **1**.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\n<<<D>>>"
