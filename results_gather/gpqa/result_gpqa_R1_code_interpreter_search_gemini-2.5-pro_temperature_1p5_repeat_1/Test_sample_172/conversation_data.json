    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to solve the problem.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical principles:** The problem asks for the minimum uncertainty in energy ($\\Delta E$) given the uncertainty in position ($\\Delta x$) for an electron. This immediately points to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. There are two common forms of this principle:\n    *   Position-Momentum Uncertainty:  $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p_x \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n    *   Energy-Time Uncertainty: $\\Delta E \\cdot \\Delta t \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n\n    Where:\n    *   $\\Delta x$ is the uncertainty in position.\n    *   $\\Delta p_x$ is the uncertainty in momentum in the x-direction.\n    *   $\\Delta E$ is the uncertainty in energy.\n    *   $\\Delta t$ is the uncertainty in time.\n    *   $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi} \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s}$.\n\n2.  **Determine the best approach:** We are given $\\Delta x$ and the velocity $v$. We need to find $\\Delta E$. We can relate the uncertainty in energy to the uncertainty in momentum.\n\n3.  **Relate Energy (E) and Momentum (p):**\n    The energy of a particle is a function of its momentum. The uncertainty in energy ($\\Delta E$) can be related to the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$) by:\n    $\\Delta E = \\left| \\frac{dE}{dp} \\right| \\Delta p$\n\n    The derivative $\\frac{dE}{dp}$ represents the group velocity of the particle wave packet, which is equal to the particle's classical velocity, $v$.\n    *   For a non-relativistic particle, $E = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$, so $\\frac{dE}{dp} = \\frac{p}{m} = v$.\n    *   For a relativistic particle, $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$. Differentiating with respect to p gives $2E \\frac{dE}{dp} = 2pc^2$, so $\\frac{dE}{dp} = \\frac{pc^2}{E}$. Since for a relativistic particle $p = \\gamma m_0 v$ and $E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$, this simplifies to $\\frac{dE}{dp} = \\frac{(\\gamma m_0 v)c^2}{\\gamma m_0 c^2} = v$.\n\n    So, in both cases, the relation is:\n    $\\Delta E = v \\cdot \\Delta p$\n\n4.  **Calculate the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$):**\n    We use the position-momentum uncertainty principle for the minimum uncertainty:\n    $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n    Therefore, $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$.\n\n5.  **Combine the equations:**\n    Substitute the expression for $\\Delta p$ into the equation for $\\Delta E$:\n    $\\Delta E = v \\cdot \\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x} \\right) = \\frac{v \\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$\n\n6.  **Plug in the given values and constants:**\n    *   Velocity, $v = 2 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n    *   Uncertainty in position, $\\Delta x = 0.1 \\text{ nm} = 0.1 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m} = 10^{-10} \\text{ m}$\n    *   Reduced Planck's constant, $\\hbar \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the final value:**\n    Now, let's compute the value for $\\Delta E$. We can use a Python script for precise calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nv = 2 * 10**8  # speed of the electron in m/s\ndelta_x = 0.1 * 10**-9  # uncertainty in position in meters\nhbar = 1.054571817 * 10**-34  # reduced Planck constant in J·s\n\n# Heisenberg's uncertainty principle for minimum uncertainty\n# delta_x * delta_p >= hbar / 2\ndelta_p = hbar / (2 * delta_x)\n\n# The uncertainty in energy (delta_E) is related to the uncertainty in momentum (delta_p)\n# by the particle's velocity v: delta_E = v * delta_p\ndelta_E = v * delta_p\n\n# Print the result in scientific notation\nprint(f\"{delta_E:.3e} J\")\n```\n>>>\n1.055e-16 J\n\nThe result from the calculation is $1.055 \\times 10^{-16}$ J.\n\nThis value is approximately $10^{-16}$ J.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) ~10^(-17) J\nB) ~10^(-19) J\nC) ~10^(-18) J\nD) ~10^(-16) J\n\nOur calculated value of $1.055 \\times 10^{-16}$ J is closest to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>",
