    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the System and Energy Levels\n\n*   **Particles:** We have four identical spin-1/2 particles. Since they are identical and have half-integer spin, they are **fermions**.\n*   **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This means no two particles can occupy the exact same quantum state. In this system, a quantum state is defined by the energy level `n` and the spin projection `m_s` (spin-up or spin-down). Consequently, each energy level `n` can hold at most two particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n*   **Potential Well:** The particles are in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The single-particle energy eigenvalues are given by:\n    $E_n = \\frac{n^2 h^2}{8mL^2}$, where `n` is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n*   **Energy Unit E:** The problem defines a unit of energy $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$. We need to relate this to the standard energy formula.\n    Using $\\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi}$, we get $\\hbar^2 = \\frac{h^2}{4\\pi^2}$.\n    Substituting this into the definition of E:\n    $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 (\\frac{h^2}{4\\pi^2})}{2mL^2} = \\frac{h^2/4}{2mL^2} = \\frac{h^2}{8mL^2}$.\n    This is exactly the energy of the n=1 state. So, the single-particle energy levels can be conveniently written as:\n    $E_n = n^2 E$.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Ground State Energy (E_gs)\n\nThe ground state is the state with the lowest possible total energy. To achieve this, we fill the energy levels from the bottom up, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **n = 1 level:** Can hold two particles. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_1 = 2 \\times (1^2 E) = 2E$.\n*   **n = 2 level:** We still need to place two more particles. They go into the next lowest level, n=2. Their combined energy is $2 \\times E_2 = 2 \\times (2^2 E) = 2 \\times 4E = 8E$.\n\nAll four particles are now placed. The total ground state energy is the sum of the energies of all particles:\n$E_{gs} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E$.\n\n### 3. Calculate the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the next lowest total energy. We can find this by promoting one particle from the ground state configuration to the next available energy level, requiring the minimum amount of energy.\n\n*   **Ground state configuration:** Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=2.\n*   **Lowest energy excitation:** Promote one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n*   **New configuration:**\n    *   **n = 1 level:** Two particles. Energy = $2 \\times E_1 = 2E$.\n    *   **n = 2 level:** One particle. Energy = $1 \\times E_2 = 1 \\times (2^2 E) = 4E$.\n    *   **n = 3 level:** One particle. Energy = $1 \\times E_3 = 1 \\times (3^2 E) = 9E$.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n$E_{1st} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)\n\nThe second excited state has the third-lowest total energy. We need to find the next possible excitation from the ground state that has the lowest energy after the first excited state. Let's consider the possibilities:\n\n*   **Possibility A:** Promote one particle from n=2 to n=4.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4.\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_4) = 2E + 4E + (4^2 E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E$.\n\n*   **Possibility B:** Promote two particles from n=2 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 2 particles in n=1, 2 particles in n=3.\n    *   Energy = $(2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_3) = 2E + 2 \\times (3^2 E) = 2E + 18E = 20E$.\n\n*   **Possibility C:** Promote one particle from n=1 to n=3.\n    *   Configuration: 1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3.\n    *   Energy = $(1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3) = 1E + 2 \\times (2^2 E) + 9E = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$.\n\nComparing the energies of these excited states (22E, 20E, 18E) with the first excited state (15E), the next lowest energy is 18E.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the second excited state is:\n$E_{2nd} = 18E$.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe energies of the three lowest states are:\n*   Ground State: 10E\n*   First Excited State: 15E\n*   Second Excited State: 18E\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
