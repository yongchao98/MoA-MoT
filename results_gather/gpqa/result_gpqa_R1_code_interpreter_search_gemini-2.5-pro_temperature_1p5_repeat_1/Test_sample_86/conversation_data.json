    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the correct 1H NMR data.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Information:**\n    *   **\"di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring\"**: This indicates a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents, let's call them X and Y.\n    *   **\"8 carbon atoms in total\"**: The benzene ring itself contains 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, the two substituents (X and Y) must contain a total of 8 - 6 = 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... carbonyl group\"**: One of the substituents must contain a C=O group.\n    *   **\"FTIR spectrum ... aromatic-halogen bond\"**: One of the substituents is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I) directly attached to the aromatic ring. Let's say this is substituent X.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   Substituent X is a halogen (-X). It contains 0 carbon atoms.\n    *   Substituent Y must therefore contain both of the remaining 2 carbon atoms and the carbonyl group.\n    *   A functional group with 2 carbons and a carbonyl group is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   Therefore, the two substituents are a halogen (-X) and an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n\n3.  **Assemble the Final Structure:**\n    *   The compound is a haloacetophenone, with the general structure X-C6H4-COCH3. The total carbon count is 6 (ring) + 2 (acetyl) = 8. This matches all the given information.\n\n4.  **Analyze Potential Isomers and their Expected 1H NMR:**\n    *   The two substituents can be in the ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions.\n    *   **Ortho and Meta Isomers**: These isomers lack symmetry. They would show four distinct signals in the aromatic region (between ~7.0-8.0 ppm), each integrating to 1H, with complex splitting patterns (doublets, triplets, doublet of doublets, etc.).\n    *   **Para Isomer (1,4-disubstitution)**: This isomer has a plane of symmetry passing through the two substituents. This symmetry makes the two protons ortho to the acetyl group equivalent to each other, and the two protons ortho to the halogen group equivalent to each other.\n        *   This results in a simpler aromatic spectrum: two signals, each a doublet, and each integrating to 2H.\n        *   The acetyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing, so the protons ortho to it will be more deshielded (further downfield, higher ppm value).\n        *   The methyl group (-CH3) of the acetyl substituent is not adjacent to any protons, so it will appear as a singlet, integrating to 3H. Its chemical shift is typically around 2.5-2.6 ppm.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given 1H NMR Options:**\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: ... 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The peak at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), not a ketone. This contradicts our deduced structure of an acetophenone. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: ... 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Aromatic region**: 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). This is the classic A2B2 pattern for a para (1,4)-disubstituted benzene ring. It matches our predicted pattern for the para-isomer.\n        *   **Aliphatic region**: 2.3 (3H, s). This is a singlet integrating to 3 protons, which is exactly what we expect for the methyl group of the acetyl substituent.\n        *   While the chemical shift of 2.3 ppm is slightly lower than the typical ~2.6 ppm for an acetyl methyl, the overall pattern (two 2H doublets and one 3H singlet) is a perfect match for 4-haloacetophenone. The minor shift variation is acceptable. This option is a very strong candidate.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: ... 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.5 ppm). This cannot be the correct spectrum for an aromatic compound. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: ... 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This shows only a single proton in the aromatic region, which is inconsistent with a di-substituted benzene ring (which must have 4 aromatic protons). This option is incorrect.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the analysis, the structure must be a haloacetophenone. Only Option B provides a spectrum that matches the signal pattern (multiplicity and integration) expected for such a compound, specifically the para-isomer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
