    "This problem requires us to determine the minimum spatial resolution a detector needs to observe at least 30% of the decays of a moving particle $X^0$.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of the Problem**\n*   **Relativistic Time Dilation:** The particle $X^0$ is moving at a relativistic speed. Therefore, its lifetime in the laboratory frame ($\\tau$) will be longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) due to time dilation. The relationship is $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Exponential Decay:** The decay of particles follows an exponential law. The number of particles $N(t)$ that have not decayed after a time $t$ is given by $N(t) = N_0 e^{-t/\\tau}$, where $N_0$ is the initial number of particles. This can also be expressed in terms of the distance traveled, $x = vt$, as $N(x) = N_0 e^{-x/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda = v\\tau$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame.\n*   **Observation Condition:** A decay event is \"observed\" if the particle travels a distance $L$ from its creation point before decaying, and this distance $L$ is large enough to be resolved by the detector. If the detector has a spatial resolution of $R$, it can only resolve decay events where $L > R$.\n*   **Problem Statement:** We need to find the resolution $R$ such that at least 30% of the particles decay at a distance $L > R$. The fraction of particles that travel a distance greater than $R$ before decaying is given by $P(L>R) = \\frac{N(x>R)}{N_0} = e^{-R/\\lambda}$. We are given that this fraction must be at least 30% (or 0.3).\n\nSo, the condition we must satisfy is:\n$e^{-R/\\lambda} \\ge 0.3$\n\nTo find the required resolution value, we solve for the boundary condition:\n$e^{-R/\\lambda} = 0.3$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-R/\\lambda = \\ln(0.3)$\n$R = -\\lambda \\ln(0.3) = \\lambda \\ln(1/0.3)$\n\n**2. Calculation Steps**\n\n*   **Step i: Calculate the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$)**\n    The Lorentz factor is the ratio of the total energy ($E$) to the rest energy ($E_0 = m_0c^2$).\n    *   $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   $E_0 = m_X c^2 = 3.41$ GeV\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{E_0} = \\frac{27}{3.41}$\n\n*   **Step ii: Calculate the mean decay length ($\\lambda$)**\n    The mean decay length in the lab frame is $\\lambda = v\\tau$. We know $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$. The velocity $v$ is related to $\\gamma$ by $v = c\\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\n    Therefore, $\\lambda = v \\gamma \\tau_0 = (c\\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}) \\gamma \\tau_0 = c\\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n    *   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n    *   $c \\approx 2.998 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\n*   **Step iii: Calculate the required resolution ($R$)**\n    Using the formula derived above: $R = \\lambda \\ln(1/0.3)$.\n\nWe will use a Python script to perform these calculations accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_particle_decay_resolution():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum resolution needed to observe a certain percentage of particle decays.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given parameters\n    E_total_GeV = 27.0\n    m0_GeV_c2 = 3.41\n    proper_lifetime_s = 8e-16\n    observation_fraction = 0.30\n    \n    # Physical constants\n    c_m_per_s = 299792458\n    \n    # Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\n    gamma = E_total_GeV / m0_GeV_c2\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate the mean decay length (lambda) in the lab frame\n    # lambda = v * tau = v * gamma * tau0 = c * tau0 * sqrt(gamma^2 - 1)\n    try:\n        lambda_m = c_m_per_s * proper_lifetime_s * math.sqrt(gamma**2 - 1)\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Error: Calculation resulted in a value that is not a real number (likely gamma <= 1).\")\n        return\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the required resolution (R)\n    # The fraction of observed decays is exp(-R/lambda).

Let's compare this result with the given options:\n\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n\nThe calculated value $2.274 \\times 10^{-6}$ m is closest to option B, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. The slight difference is likely due to a minor variation in the constants used (e.g., if a slightly different mass or lifetime was assumed in the problem's source). However, the order of magnitude and the leading digits are consistent, making B the correct choice.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum spatial resolution ($R$) a detector must have to \"observe\" at least 30% of the decays of the $X^0$ particle. To observe a decay, the particle must travel a distance ($L$) from its creation point that is greater than the detector's resolution ($L > R$). The decay of particles is a random process that follows an exponential decay law.\n\n**2. Relativistic Effects**\n\nSince the particle is moving at a high energy (27 GeV) compared to its rest mass (3.41 GeV), we must account for relativistic effects, specifically time dilation.\n\n*   **Proper Lifetime ($\\tau_0$)**: This is the lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame. Given as $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s.\n*   **Lifetime in the Lab Frame ($\\tau$)**: An observer in the lab (the Bubble Chamber) sees the particle's internal clock running slower. This dilated lifetime is given by $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**3. Calculating the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\n\nThe Lorentz factor relates the particle's total energy ($E$) to its rest energy ($E_0 = m_0c^2$).\n\n*   Total Energy, $E = 27$ GeV\n*   Rest Mass Energy, $E_0 = 3.41$ GeV\n*   $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{E_0} = \\frac{27 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV}} \\approx 7.918$\n\n**4. Exponential Decay Law**\n\nThe fraction of particles that survive (do not decay) after traveling a distance $x$ in the lab frame is given by the survival function:\n$P(L > x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length in the lab frame.\n\nThe problem states that we want to observe at least 30% of the decays. This means the fraction of particles that travel a distance *greater than* the resolution $R$ must be at least 0.3.\nSo, we have the condition:\n$P(L > R) = e^{-R/\\lambda} \\ge 0.3$\n\nTo find the minimum resolution, we solve for the equality:\n$e^{-R/\\lambda} = 0.3$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$-R/\\lambda = \\ln(0.3)$\n$R = -\\lambda \\ln(0.3)$\n\n**5. Calculating the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\n\nThe mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels in the lab frame before decaying. It is given by $\\lambda = v \\tau$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity and $\\tau$ is its lifetime in the lab frame.\n\nA more direct way to calculate it using our known quantities is:\n$\\lambda = c \\cdot \\tau_0 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n*   $\\tau_0 = 8 \\times 10^{-16}$ s\n*   $\\gamma \\approx 7.918$\n*   $c \\approx 2.998 \\times 10^8$ m/s\n\nNow we can use a Python script to perform the calculation precisely.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_resolution():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum resolution required to observe a certain fraction of particle decays.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given parameters\n    E_total_GeV = 27.0\n    m0_GeV_c2 = 3.41\n    proper_lifetime_s = 8e-16\n    observation_fraction = 0.30\n\n    # Physical constants\n    c_m_per_s = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n    # 1.

Final Answer Selection**\n\nThe calculation yields a required resolution of $R \\approx 2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m.\n\nNow, let's compare this result to the given options:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n\nThe calculated value ($2.27 \\times 10^{-6}$ m) is extremely close in both magnitude and value to option B ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m). The minor difference (around 9%) is likely due to the use of slightly different physical constants or rounded values in the source of the question. Based on the calculation, option B is unequivocally the correct choice.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "This is a problem in relativistic kinematics and particle decay. Here's the step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the solution.\n\n**1. Identify the Goal**\nThe question asks for the minimum spatial resolution ($R$) needed by a detector to observe at least 30% of the particle decays. A decay is \"observed\" if the particle travels a distance $L$ greater than the resolution $R$ before it decays.\n\n**2. Relativistic Principles**\nThe $X^0$ particle is moving at a very high energy (27 GeV) compared to its rest mass energy (3.41 GeV). This means it's highly relativistic, and we must use principles of special relativity.\n\n*   **Time Dilation**: A particle's lifetime in the laboratory frame ($\\tau$) is longer than its proper lifetime ($\\tau_0$) due to its high speed. The relationship is $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**: This is the ratio of the particle's total energy ($E$) to its rest energy ($E_0 = m_0c^2$).\n    *   $E = 27$ GeV\n    *   $E_0 = 3.41$ GeV\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{E}{E_0} = \\frac{27}{3.41}$\n\n**3. Particle Decay Law**\nThe decay of unstable particles is a random process governed by an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle will survive (not decay) for a time $t$ in the lab frame is $P(t') = e^{-t/\\tau}$.\n\nWe can express this in terms of the distance traveled, $L = v \\cdot t$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity. The average distance a particle travels before decaying is called the mean decay length, $\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau$. The probability of a particle traveling a distance greater than $L$ before decaying is:\n$P(\\text{distance} > L) = e^{-L/\\lambda}$\n\n**4. Setting up the Equation**\nWe need to observe at least 30% of the decays. This means the fraction of particles that travel a distance *greater* than the resolution $R$ before decaying must be at least 0.30.\nSo, the condition is:\n$P(\\text{distance} > R) \\ge 0.30$\n$e^{-R/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\nTo find the minimum resolution, we solve for the boundary condition:\n$e^{-R/\\lambda} = 0.30$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$\\ln(e^{-R/\\lambda}) = \\ln(0.30)$\n$-\\frac{R}{\\lambda} = \\ln(0.30)$\n$R = -\\lambda \\cdot \\ln(0.30)$\n\n**5. Calculating the Mean Decay Length ($\\lambda$)**\nThe mean decay length in the lab frame is $\\lambda = v \\tau$. We know $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$.\nThe velocity $v$ is related to $\\gamma$ by $v = c\\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}$.\nTherefore, $\\lambda = v \\gamma \\tau_0 = (c\\sqrt{1 - 1/\\gamma^2}) \\gamma \\tau_0 = c \\tau_0 \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n\nNow we have all the pieces to calculate $R$. Let's use a Python script to perform the calculation with high precision.\n\n*   Calculate $\\gamma$.\n*   Use $\\gamma$ to calculate $\\lambda$.\n*   Use $\\lambda$ to calculate $R$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given physical parameters and constants\nE_total_GeV = 27.0\nm0_GeV_c2 = 3.41\nproper_lifetime_s = 8e-16\nobservation_fraction = 0.30\nc_m_per_s = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (gamma)\ngamma = E_total_GeV / m0_GeV_c2\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the mean decay length (lambda) in the lab frame\n# lambda = v * tau = v * gamma * tau0\n# A more direct formula is: lambda = c * tau0 * sqrt(gamma^2 - 1)\nmean_decay_length_m = c_m_per_s * proper_lifetime_s * math.sqrt(gamma**2 - 1)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the required resolution (R)\n# The probability of traveling further than R is P(L>R) = exp(-R/lambda).\n# We solve R for P(L>R) = 0.3, which gives R = -lambda * ln(0.3)\nresolution_m = -mean_decay_length_m * math.log(observation_fraction)\n\nprint(f\"{resolution_m}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\n2.2680110622885967e-06\n</execute_result>\n**6. Interpreting the Result**\n\nThe Python script calculates the minimum required resolution to be approximately $2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ meters.\n\nLet's compare this value to the options provided:\nA) $2.08 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\nB) $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\nC) $2.08 \\times 10^{-1}$ m\nD) $2.08 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n\nOur calculated result, $2.268 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is very close in value and has the same order of magnitude ($10^{-6}$) as option B. The slight difference between 2.27 and 2.08 is likely due to small variations in the given constants ($m_X$, $\\tau_0$) used when the problem was created. Option B is the only physically plausible answer.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics Principles**\n\nThe problem involves a high-energy particle ($X^0$) that decays. Since its total energy (27 GeV) is much larger than its rest mass energy (3.41 GeV), it travels at a speed very close to the speed of light. We need to apply the principles of special relativity.\n\n*   **Time Dilation:** The lifetime of the particle as measured in the laboratory's frame of reference (the Bubble Chamber) is longer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime, $\\tau_0$). This dilated lifetime, $\\tau$, is given by $\\tau = \\gamma \\tau_0$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$):** The Lorentz factor is the ratio of the particle's total energy ($E$) to its rest energy ($E_0 = m_0 c^2$).
