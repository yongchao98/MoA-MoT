    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct product:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Starting Material and Reagent\n\n*   **Starting Material**: (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane.\n    *   The core structure, `7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane`, is an epoxide fused to a cyclohexane ring (also known as cyclohexene oxide). The epoxide is across carbons C1 and C6 of the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   The fusion is necessarily `cis`, meaning the two C-O bonds of the epoxide are on the same face of the cyclohexane ring.\n    *   There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n    *   The stereochemistry is specified as `(1R,3R,4R,6S)`. This defines the absolute three-dimensional arrangement of all chiral centers.\n\n*   **Reagent**: Me₂CuLi (Lithium dimethylcuprate), known as a Gilman reagent.\n    *   This reagent is a source of a \"soft\" nucleophilic methyl anion (Me⁻).\n\n### 2. Understand the Reaction Mechanism\n\n*   The reaction is a nucleophilic ring-opening of an epoxide by an organocuprate.\n*   There are two key principles for this reaction:\n    1.  **Regioselectivity**: The nucleophile attacks the **less sterically hindered** carbon of the epoxide ring.\n    2.  **Stereoselectivity**: The attack occurs via an **Sₙ2-type mechanism**, meaning the nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the C-O bond (backside attack). This results in an **inversion of configuration** at the carbon that is attacked. The configuration of the other carbon of the epoxide is retained.\n\n### 3. Apply the Rules to the Reaction\n\n#### Step 3a: Determine the Site of Attack (Regioselectivity)\n\n*   The epoxide ring involves carbons C1 and C6. We must determine which is less hindered.\n    *   **C1** is bonded to:\n        1.  The epoxide oxygen (O).\n        2.  A methyl group (-CH₃).\n        3.  Carbon C2 of the ring.\n        4.  Carbon C6 of the ring.\n        This is a **quaternary** carbon center.\n    *   **C6** is bonded to:\n        1.  The epoxide oxygen (O).\n        2.  A hydrogen atom (-H). (The name `1,3,4-trimethyl` implies no methyl group at C6).\n        3.  Carbon C5 of the ring.\n        4.  Carbon C1 of the ring.\n        This is a **tertiary** carbon center.\n*   A tertiary carbon (C6) is significantly less sterically hindered than a quaternary carbon (C1).\n*   **Conclusion**: The nucleophilic methyl group from Me₂CuLi will attack **C6**. This will break the C6-O bond, and after an acidic workup (which is implied in these reactions), the oxygen at C1 will become a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   This outcome eliminates options A and B, which are named `2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol`. This naming would result from an attack at C1 (placing a second methyl group there) and the -OH group forming at C6.\n\n#### Step 3b: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product (Stereoselectivity)\n\n*   We need to track the stereochemistry of all chiral centers.\n*   **Attack at C6**: The attack is Sₙ2-like and causes inversion of configuration.\n    *   The starting configuration at C6 is given as **6S**.\n    *   After inversion, the configuration at C6 will become **R**.\n*   **Stereocenter at C1**: The nucleophile does not attack this carbon. The C1-O bond breaks, but the tetrahedral geometry of C1 is not inverted.\n    *   The starting configuration at C1 is given as **1R**.\n    *   This configuration is **retained**, so it remains **R** in the product.\n*   **Stereocenters at C3 and C4**: These carbons are not involved in the reaction.\n    *   Their configurations are **retained**. C3 remains **R**, and C4 remains **R**.\n\n### 4. Determine the IUPAC Name of the Product\n\n*   The product is a cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.\n*   **Numbering**: According to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the principal functional group (the -OH) gets the lowest possible number, so it is **C1**. The original C1 becomes the new C1.\n*   We then number the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible set of locants.\n    *   The product has methyl groups at the original positions C1, C3, C4, and a new methyl group at C6.\n    *   Let's number from the new C1 (old C1):\n        *   Path A (towards old C2): Me groups at C1, C3, C4, C6. Locant set: {1, 3, 4, 6}.\n        *   Path B (towards old C6): The old C6 is now C2. The old C4 is now C4. The old C3 is now C5. Me groups are at C1, C2, C4, C5. Locant set: {1, 2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Comparing the sets {1, 3, 4, 6} and {1, 2, 4, 5}, the latter is lower at the first point of difference (2 vs 3). So, we must use the numbering from Path B.\n    *   The product's name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This confirms that options C and D are the only possibilities.\n\n*   **Final Stereochemistry**: Now, let's map the stereochemical descriptors (R/S) to the new numbering scheme.\n    *   **New C1** (was old C1): Retained as **R** -> **1R**.\n    *   **New C2** (was old C6): Inverted from S to **R** -> **2R**.\n    *   **New C4** (was old C4): Retained as **R** -> **4R**.\n    *   **New C5** (was old C3): Retained as **R** -> **5R**.\n*   The full IUPAC name of the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThis name and stereochemistry perfectly match option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
