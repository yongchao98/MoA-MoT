These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three Michael addition reactions.\n\n### Reaction A:\n*   **Reactants:** dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate\n*   **Reagents:** NaOEt, EtOH (Sodium ethoxide in ethanol)\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** Sodium ethoxide is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of dimethyl malonate, which is acidic due to its position between two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. This creates a resonance-stabilized enolate ion, `⁻CH(COOMe)₂`.\n    2.  **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an α,β-unsaturated ester. The β-carbon (the carbon double-bonded to the one adjacent to the carbonyl group, and also attached to the p-tolyl group) is electrophilic. The structure is `p-tolyl-CH(β)=CH(α)-COOMe`.\n    3.  **Reaction:** The malonate enolate attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the acrylate. This is a 1,4-conjugate addition. A new carbon-carbon bond is formed. The resulting intermediate enolate is then protonated by the ethanol solvent.\n    4.  **Product Structure:** The new bond connects the central carbon of the malonate to the β-carbon of the acrylate. The final, neutral product is:\n        `p-tolyl-CH(CH(COOMe)₂) - CH₂ - COOMe`\n        which can also be written as:\n        `(MeOOC)₂CH - CH(p-tolyl) - CH₂ - COOMe`\n    5.  **Product Name (A):** To name this structure, we can consider the three-carbon chain connecting the ester groups as a propane backbone.\n        *   `C1`: The carbon from the malonate, having two methoxycarbonyl groups (`-COOMe`).\n        *   `C2`: The β-carbon from the acrylate, now bearing the `p-tolyl` group.\n        *   `C3`: The α-carbon from the acrylate, now a `CH₂` adjacent to a methoxycarbonyl group.\n        This naming leads to **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B:\n*   **Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile\n*   **Reagents:** MeOH, H₃O⁺\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  **Michael Donor (Nucleophile):** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are analogues of enolates and are nucleophilic at the α-carbon (C2 of the cyclohexene ring). This reaction is a specific type of Michael addition known as the Stork enamine synthesis.\n    2.  **Michael Acceptor (Electrophile):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (`CH₃-CH=CH-CN`, also known as crotononitrile) is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile. The β-carbon is the electrophilic center.\n    3.  **Reaction:** The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile. This forms a new C-C bond and an intermediate iminium ion. The subsequent addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) serves to hydrolyze this iminium ion back into a ketone.\n    4.  **Product Structure:** The starting ketone was cyclohexanone. A new substituent is added at its α-position (C2). The substituent comes from the but-2-enenitrile fragment `CH₃-CH-CH₂-CN`. The bond forms between C2 of the ring and the original β-carbon of the nitrile. The final structure is a cyclohexanone ring with a `-CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group at the C2 position.\n    5.  **Product Name (B):** This product can be named as a substituted butanenitrile. The butanenitrile chain is `C⁴H₃-C³H-C²H₂-C¹N`. The substituent at C3 is the `2-oxocyclohexyl` group. Therefore, the name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**. The alternative, `3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile`, represents the enol tautomer, which is generally not the major product under these (acidic workup) conditions.\n\n### Reaction C:\n*   **Reactants:** C + but-3-en-2-one\n*   **Reagents:** KOH, H₂O\n*   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n*   **Analysis:** This is a problem where we must deduce the starting material (C).\n    1.  **Analyze the knowns:** The product is formed from a Michael addition between reactant C and but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK). The reagent is a base (KOH).\n    2.  **Michael Acceptor:** But-3-en-2-one (`CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃`) is the Michael acceptor.\n    3.  **Michael Donor:** Reactant C must be the Michael donor. The base (KOH) will deprotonate it to form the nucleophile.\n    4.  **Retrosynthesis:** We can identify C by mentally reversing the Michael addition. The bond formed connects the nucleophile (from C) to the β-carbon of the acceptor (MVK).\n        *   Product: `2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione`. The `cyclohexane-1,3-dione` part is the core structure. The `-(3-oxobutyl)` group is `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃`.\n        *   This substituent is attached to C2 of the dione ring, the highly acidic carbon between the two carbonyls.\n        *   The added fragment `-CH₂-CH₂-CO-CH₃` came from the Michael acceptor `CH₂=CH-CO-CH₃` after the reaction.\n        *   Therefore, the Michael donor C must have been **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis of all three reactions:\n*   **A** = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate\n*   **B** = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile\n*   **C** = cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nThis combination corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
