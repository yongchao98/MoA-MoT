    "1.  **Understand the Problem:** The goal is to find the normalized eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator $\\vec{P}$ along a specific direction $\\vec{n}$, corresponding to a given eigenvalue.\n\n2.  **Define the Operator and its Components:**\n    The problem provides the components of the operator $\\vec{P}$:\n    *   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    These are the spin operators for a spin-1/2 particle, where $\\vec{P} = \\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$, and $\\vec{\\sigma}$ represents the Pauli matrices.\n\n3.  **Define the Direction Vector:**\n    The direction $\\vec{n}$ is an arbitrary unit vector lying in the x-z plane. In a 3D Cartesian coordinate system, a unit vector in the x-z plane can be parameterized by the angle $\\theta$ it makes with the z-axis.\n    The components of this unit vector are:\n    *   $n_x = \\sin\\theta$\n    *   $n_y = 0$\n    *   $n_z = \\cos\\theta$\n    So, $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n4.  **Construct the Operator along the Direction `n`:**\n    The operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    Substituting the components:\n    $P_n = \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\sin\\theta + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) (0) + \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right) \\cos\\theta$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\right]$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n5.  **Set up the Eigenvalue Equation:**\n    We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ that satisfies the eigenvalue equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$, where the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ is given as $+\\hbar/2$.\n    Let the eigenvector be represented by a column vector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The equation becomes:\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n6.  **Solve the Eigenvalue Equation:**\n    We can cancel the factor $\\hbar/2$ from both sides:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This matrix equation yields a system of two linear equations:\n    1) $a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta = a$\n    2) $a\\sin\\theta - b\\cos\\theta = b$\n\n    Let's solve for the relationship between `a` and `b` using the first equation:\n    $b\\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\n    Using trigonometric half-angle identities:\n    *   $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$\n    *   $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$\n\n    Substituting these into the expression for $b/a$:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\n    This means that $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$. So, the eigenvector has the form $\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ a \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    We can choose a convenient value for `a` to simplify the expression. Let $a = C\\cos(\\theta/2)$ for some normalization constant $C$.\n    Then $b = (C\\cos(\\theta/2)) \\tan(\\theta/2) = C\\sin(\\theta/2)$.\n    The eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n7.  **Normalize the Eigenvector:**\n    The eigenvector must be normalized, which means its norm (length) must be 1. The squared norm is given by $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$.\n    Using our derived eigenvector components:\n    $|C|^2 (\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\n    Using the fundamental trigonometric identity $\\cos^2(x) + \\sin^2(x) = 1$:\n    $|C|^2 (1) = 1 \\implies |C| = 1$.\n    We can choose the phase of C to be 0, so $C=1$.\n\n    The normalized eigenvector is therefore:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n8.  **Final Answer:**\n    The elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
