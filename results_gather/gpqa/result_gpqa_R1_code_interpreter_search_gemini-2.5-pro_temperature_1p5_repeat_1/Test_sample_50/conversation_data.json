    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the net potential energy of the system.\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem and Method of Images**\n\nWe have a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`). A grounded sphere has an electric potential of zero (V=0). The presence of the charge `q` induces an opposite charge on the surface of the sphere, resulting in an attractive force between the charge and the sphere.\n\nTo solve this problem, we use the **method of images**. This technique replaces the complex charge distribution on the sphere with a single, fictitious \"image charge\" `q'` placed inside the sphere. The electric field *outside* the sphere is then the superposition of the fields from the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'`. The magnitude and position of `q'` are chosen such that the boundary condition (V=0 on the sphere's surface) is satisfied.\n\n**2. Finding the Image Charge and its Position**\n\nFor a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R`, the image charge `q'` and its position `b` (distance from the center) are given by:\n\n*   Image charge magnitude: `q' = - (R/d) * q`\n*   Image charge position: `b = R^2 / d`\n\nThe image charge is located on the same line connecting the center and the original charge `q`.\n\n**3. Calculating the Potential Energy**\n\nThe potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. A common and reliable formula for the interaction energy of a charge with a system of conductors is:\n\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nwhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of charge `q` created by all *other* charges in the system. In this case, `V_induced` is the potential created by the induced charges on the surface of the sphere.\n\nAccording to the method of images, this potential `V_induced` is exactly the same as the potential created by the image charge `q'` at the position of the original charge `q`.\n\n**4. Calculating V_induced**\n\nThe potential `V_induced` at distance `d` from the center is the potential due to the image charge `q'` located at distance `b` from the center. The distance between the original charge `q` and the image charge `q'` is `d - b`.\n\n*   `V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for `q'` and `b`:\n\n*   `V_induced = k * (- (R/d) * q) / (d - R^2 / d)`\n\nLet's simplify the denominator:\n\n*   `d - R^2 / d = (d^2 - R^2) / d`\n\nSubstitute this back into the expression for `V_induced`:\n\n*   `V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n*   `V_induced = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n**5. Calculating the Final Potential Energy (U)**\n\nNow we substitute the expression for `V_induced` back into the energy formula `U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`:\n\n*   `U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n*   `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nThis is the net potential energy of the system. The energy is negative, which signifies that the force between the charge `q` and the grounded sphere is attractive.\n\n**6. Comparing with the Options**\n\nLet's compare our result with the given choices:\nA) U = - kq^2 d / (d^2 - R^2)\nB) U = - (1/2) kq^2 d / (d^2 + R^2)\nC) U = -(1/2) kq^2 R^2 / (d^2 - R^2)\nD) U = - (1/2) * k*q^2 R / (d^2 - R^2)\n\nOur derived expression `U = - (1/2) * k*q^2*R / (d^2-R^2)` matches option D exactly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
