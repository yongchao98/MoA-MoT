    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the synthesis and the structure of the final product to determine the number of signals in its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating, forming product 1.**\n*   **Starting material:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Br2, pyridine, acetic anhydride. This is a variation of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction, which causes bromination at the alpha-carbon of a carboxylic acid.\n*   **Product 1:** One hydrogen on the alpha-carbon (the methyl group) is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   Structure of Product 1: **Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH)**.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2.**\n*   **Starting material:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** Ethanol (CH3CH2OH), H2SO4 (acid catalyst). This is a standard Fischer esterification reaction.\n*   **Product 2:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is converted into an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).\n    *   Structure of Product 2: **Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3)**.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3.**\n*   **Starting material:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n*   **Reagent:** Sodium cyanide (NaCN). The cyanide ion (CN-) is a good nucleophile and will replace the bromine atom via an SN2 reaction.\n*   **Product 3:** The bromine atom is replaced by a cyano group (-CN).\n    *   Structure of Product 3: **Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3)**.\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 is then treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.**\n*   **Starting material:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3). This molecule has an \"active methylene\" group (-CH2-) flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (a cyano group and an ester group), making its protons acidic.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess Sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane (Br(CH2)5Br).\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  NaH, a strong base, deprotonates the active methylene group of ethyl cyanoacetate to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n    2.  The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the carbons in 1,5-dibromopentane, displacing a bromine atom. This is the first alkylation.\n        Intermediate: NC-CH(COOEt)-(CH2)5-Br\n    3.  The use of \"excess\" NaH ensures that the remaining acidic proton on the alpha-carbon of this intermediate is also removed, forming a new enolate.\n    4.  This new enolate then undergoes a second, *intramolecular* SN2 reaction, attacking the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromine atom. This cyclization is highly favored as it forms a stable 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is a cyclohexane ring with the cyano and ethyl ester groups attached to the same carbon (C1).\n    *   Structure of Product 4: **Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate**.\n\n**1H NMR Spectrum Analysis of Product 4**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen signals for ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexanecarboxylate.\n\n1.  **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclohexane ring undergoes rapid chair-flipping. Due to this and rotation around the single bonds, the molecule has an effective plane of symmetry that passes through the quaternary carbon (C1), the opposite carbon in the ring (C4), the cyano group, and the ester functional group. This makes the molecule, on average, achiral.\n    *   This plane of symmetry means that C2 is equivalent to C6, and C3 is equivalent to C5.\n\n2.  **Counting the Signals:**\n    *   **Ethyl Group (-COOCH2CH3):**\n        *   **-CH3:** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. They will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   **-OCH2-:** The two methylene protons are diastereotopic. Although the molecule as a whole is achiral, the steric and electronic environment near the complex C1 substituent is asymmetric enough to make the two protons magnetically non-equivalent. They will produce **2 signals**.\n    *   **Cyclohexane Ring Protons:**\n        *   **C4 Protons:** C4 lies on the plane of symmetry. Its two protons are mirror images of each other. They are enantiotopic and therefore chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR experiment. They will produce **1 signal**.\n        *   **C3 and C5 Protons:** These two CH2 groups are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, within each CH2 group, the two protons (one \"axial-like\" and one \"equatorial-like\" on average) are diastereotopic. They have different spatial relationships to the substituents on C1. Therefore, the four protons on C3 and C5 give rise to **2 signals**.\n        *   **C2 and C6 Protons:** Similar to C3/C5, these two CH2 groups are equivalent. The two protons on each carbon are diastereotopic. The four protons on C2 and C6 give rise to **2 signals**.\n\n3.  **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   From the ethyl group: 1 (for CH3) + 2 (for OCH2) = 3 signals.\n    *   From the cyclohexane ring: 1 (for C4-H) + 2 (for C3/C5-H) + 2 (for C2/C6-H) = 5 signals.\n    *   Total distinct signals = 3 + 5 = **8**.\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product.\n\n<<<C>>>"
