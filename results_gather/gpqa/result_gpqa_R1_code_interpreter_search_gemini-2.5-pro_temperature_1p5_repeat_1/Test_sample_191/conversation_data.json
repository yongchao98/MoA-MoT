    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the electric field at point P.\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial setup:** We have an electrically neutral (uncharged) spherical conductor. Inside this conductor, there is a spherical cavity. A positive point charge, +q, is placed somewhere inside this cavity.\n\n2.  **Principle of Electrostatic Induction:** The presence of the positive charge +q inside the cavity will affect the free electrons within the conductor.\n    *   The positive charge +q will attract the free electrons in the conductor. These electrons will move and accumulate on the surface of the cavity. This creates an induced negative charge on the inner surface of the conductor (the wall of the cavity).\n    *   To determine the total amount of this induced negative charge, we can apply Gauss's Law. Imagine a Gaussian surface that is entirely within the material of the conductor and encloses the cavity.\n    *   A fundamental property of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is that the electric field inside the conducting material must be zero ($\\vec{E}_{conductor} = 0$).\n    *   According to Gauss's Law, the total electric flux through our Gaussian surface is $\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_o}$. Since $\\vec{E} = 0$ everywhere on this surface, the total flux is zero. This implies that the total charge enclosed by the surface, $Q_{enclosed}$, must also be zero.\n    *   The enclosed charge is the sum of the point charge +q and the induced charge on the inner surface, $q_{inner}$. So, $Q_{enclosed} = +q + q_{inner} = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, the induced charge on the inner surface of the cavity is $q_{inner} = -q$.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Charge:** The conductor was initially uncharged (net charge = 0). After the charge induction, a charge of -q has accumulated on the inner surface. Since charge must be conserved, a corresponding positive charge must appear elsewhere in the conductor.\n    *   Charge in a conductor resides on its surfaces. Thus, a charge of +q must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.\n    *   Total charge of the conductor = $q_{inner} + q_{outer} = -q + (+q) = 0$. This is consistent with the initial condition.\n\n4.  **Electrostatic Shielding (Faraday Cage Effect):** The conductor material effectively shields the outer surface from the electric field produced by the charges inside the cavity (+q and the induced -q). The arrangement of the charge +q and the induced charge -q on the inner wall is such that their combined electric field is zero everywhere outside the cavity, including within the conductor and outside the conductor.\n    *   This means the distribution of the +q charge on the *outer surface* is not affected by the position of the cavity (s), the size of the cavity (r), or the exact location of the charge +q within the cavity.\n    *   Since the outer surface is a perfect sphere and there are no other external electric fields, the +q charge will distribute itself *uniformly* over the outer surface.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field at Point P:** The electric field at any point P outside the conductor is the superposition of the fields from all charges:\n    *   Field from the point charge +q inside the cavity.\n    *   Field from the induced charge -q on the inner surface.\n    *   Field from the induced charge +q on the outer surface.\n\n    As established by the principle of shielding, the net electric field at P from the first two sources (the +q charge in the cavity and the -q charge on the cavity wall) is zero.\n\n    Therefore, the electric field at point P is determined solely by the +q charge distributed uniformly on the outer surface of the conductor.\n\n6.  **Shell Theorem:** For a point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the electric field is identical to the field that would be produced if all the charge on the shell were concentrated into a single point charge at the center of the sphere.\n    *   In our case, we have a total charge of +q distributed uniformly on the outer surface (a sphere of radius R).\n    *   The point P is located at a distance L from the center of this sphere.\n    *   Using Coulomb's law for a point charge, the magnitude of the electric field at P is:\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{(\\text{Total charge on outer surface})}{(\\text{distance from center})^2}$\n        $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The parameters describing the cavity's geometry and location (r, s), the distance from the cavity's center (l), and the angle ($\\theta$) are irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor due to electrostatic shielding. The final result only depends on the total charge q and the distance L from the center of the conductor.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{l^2}$ (Incorrect, depends on distance from cavity)\nB) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$ (Correct, depends on distance from the center of the conductor)\nC) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l+s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect)\nD) $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{(l-s \\cos\\theta)^2}$ (Incorrect)\n\nThe correct answer is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
