    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Concepts:**\n    *   **Redshift (z):** The light from distant objects is stretched to longer wavelengths as the universe expands. The redshift `z` quantifies this stretching. The formula relating the observed wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$) to the emitted (rest) wavelength ($\\lambda_0$) is:\n        $1 + z = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}}{\\lambda_0}$\n    *   **Lyman-alpha (Ly-$\\alpha$) line:** This is a specific spectral line of hydrogen with a rest wavelength ($\\lambda_0$) in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, at approximately 1216 Ångströms (or 121.6 nm).\n    *   **Ground-based Optical Telescopes:** These telescopes observe from Earth's surface. Their capability is limited by the Earth's atmosphere, which blocks certain wavelengths of light.\n    *   **Atmospheric Window:** The atmosphere is transparent to visible light (the \"optical window\") and some radio waves, but it is opaque to most ultraviolet (UV), X-ray, and gamma-ray radiation.\n\n2.  **Determine the Limiting Factor:**\n    *   The Ly-$\\alpha$ line at its rest wavelength of 1216 Å is deep in the ultraviolet.\n    *   To be detected by a ground-based telescope, this line must be redshifted to a longer wavelength that can pass through the Earth's atmosphere.\n    *   The primary constraint is the atmospheric cutoff at the blue/UV end of the spectrum. Due to absorption by ozone and other molecules, the atmosphere becomes largely opaque below a certain wavelength. For practical ground-based astronomy, this cutoff is typically considered to be around 3200-3600 Å (320-360 nm). Observations below this are very difficult and require exceptional conditions and specialized equipment.\n\n3.  **Set up the Calculation:**\n    *   We need to find the *minimum* redshift (`z_min`) required for detection. This corresponds to the case where the Ly-$\\alpha$ line is shifted to the *minimum* observable wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\text{obs, min}}$).\n    *   We can rearrange the redshift formula to solve for `z`:\n        $z = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}}{\\lambda_0} - 1$\n    *   Let's use a practical value for the atmospheric cutoff, such as 3500 Å, which is a common effective limit for routine optical spectroscopy.\n    *   Given:\n        *   $\\lambda_0 = 1216$ Å\n        *   $\\lambda_{\\text{obs, min}} \\approx 3500$ Å\n\n4.  **Compute the Redshift:**\n    *   We can use a simple Python script to perform the calculation accurately.\n\n```python\n# The rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line in Angstroms.\nlambda_rest = 1216.0\n\n# The practical minimum wavelength observable from the ground due to the\n# atmospheric cutoff, in Angstroms. A typical effective limit for spectroscopy is ~3500 A.\nlambda_obs_min = 3500.0\n\n# Calculate the minimum redshift using the formula: z = (lambda_obs / lambda_rest) - 1\nz_min = (lambda_obs_min / lambda_rest) - 1\n\nprint(z_min)\n```\n\n5.  **Analyze the Result and Select the Answer:**\n    *   The calculation `(3500 / 1216) - 1` gives approximately 1.878.\n    *   This value is very close to the option D) 1.9.\n\n    To confirm, let's check what observed wavelength a redshift of 1.9 corresponds to:\n    $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} = \\lambda_0 (1+z) = 1216 \\times (1+1.9) = 1216 \\times 2.9 = 3526.4$ Å.\n    This wavelength is just above the practical atmospheric cutoff, making z=1.9 a reasonable lower limit for detection with standard ground-based optical telescopes. The other options are either too low (z=1.2 would be unobservable from the ground) or represent objects that are easily observable, but not at the lower limit.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The calculation shows that a redshift of approximately 1.88 is required to shift the Lyman-alpha line from its rest wavelength of 1216 Å to the edge of the atmospheric window at ~3500 Å.\n\nLet's review the options based on this result:\n*   A) 1.2: This redshift is too low. The observed wavelength would be $1216 \\times (1+1.2) = 2675.2$ Å, which is deep in the ultraviolet and blocked by the Earth's atmosphere.\n*   B) 2.4: This redshift is high enough to be observed. The observed wavelength would be $1216 \\times (1+2.4) = 4134.4$ Å, well within the visible range. This is not the *lower limit*.\n*   C) 3: This redshift is also high enough to be observed. The observed wavelength would be $1216 \\times (1+3) = 4864$ Å. This is also not the *lower limit*.\n*   D) 1.9: This redshift corresponds to an observed wavelength of $1216 \\times (1+1.9) = 3526.4$ Å. This is just above the atmospheric cutoff (~3500 Å) and represents a realistic *lower limit* for detection with ground-based optical telescopes.\n\nOur calculated value of 1.88 is closest to 1.9, confirming that this is the best estimate for the lower limit.\n\n<<<D>>>"
