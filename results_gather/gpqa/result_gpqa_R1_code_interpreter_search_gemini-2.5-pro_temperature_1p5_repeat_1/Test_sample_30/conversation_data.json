    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the molecular symmetry group of product 3.\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid.**\nThis is a classic electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction: the nitration of toluene.\n*   **Reactant:** Toluene (C₆H₅CH₃). The methyl group (-CH₃) is an ortho-, para-directing and activating group.\n*   **Reagents:** A mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO₃) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), known as \"mixed acid\".\n*   **Product 1:** The reaction produces a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. In the context of a multi-step synthesis problem, it is common to proceed with the major isomer, which is often the para isomer due to less steric hindrance and greater thermodynamic stability. The para isomer also has higher symmetry, which can be a clue in such problems. Let's assume **Product 1 is p-nitrotoluene**.\n    *   Structure of p-nitrotoluene: A benzene ring with a methyl group (-CH₃) and a nitro group (-NO₂) at positions 1 and 4. This molecule belongs to the C₂ᵥ point group.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO₂ and H₂SO₄.**\nThis step involves the oxidation of the methyl group on the aromatic ring.\n*   **Reactant:** p-nitrotoluene.\n*   **Reagents:** Manganese dioxide (MnO₂) in sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) is a strong oxidizing agent.\n*   **Reaction:** Strong oxidizing agents oxidize alkyl side chains on a benzene ring to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), provided there is a benzylic hydrogen. The methyl group is oxidized to a carboxylic acid. The nitro group is stable under these conditions.\n*   **Product 2:** The product is **p-nitrobenzoic acid**.\n    *   Structure of p-nitrobenzoic acid: A benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a nitro group (-NO₂) at positions 1 and 4. This molecule also belongs to the C₂ᵥ point group.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide.**\nThis step is the most complex. Let's analyze the possible reactions.\n*   **Reactants:** p-nitrobenzoic acid, acetone ((CH₃)₂CO), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   First, an acid-base reaction occurs: p-nitrobenzoic acid is deprotonated by NaOH to form sodium p-nitrobenzoate.\n*   **Possibility 1: Janovsky reaction.** The strong base (NaOH) also deprotonates acetone to form an enolate anion (`⁻CH₂COCH₃`), which is a nucleophile. The p-nitrobenzoate anion has a highly electron-deficient ring due to two strong electron-withdrawing groups (-NO₂ and -COO⁻). The acetone enolate could attack the ring (a Janovsky reaction) to form a Meisenheimer complex. The attack would occur at a position ortho to the nitro group (C-3 or C-5). This would create a non-aromatic, puckered cyclohexadienyl anion with an sp³ carbon at the site of attack. This resulting structure is asymmetric and would belong to the C₁ point group. Since C₁ is not an option, this is likely not the intended final product.\n\n*   **Possibility 2: Reductive Dimerization.** It is a known, though less common, reaction that nitroarenes can undergo reductive dimerization under basic conditions, especially with a potential reductant present. In this case, acetone can act as the reducing agent, itself being oxidized. Two molecules of p-nitrobenzoate are coupled together. The nitro groups (-NO₂) are reduced and dimerize to form either an azoxy (-N=N(O)-) or an azo (-N=N-) bridge between the two aromatic rings.\n    *   **Azoxy product:** Formation of trans-4,4'-azoxydibenzoic acid (as its disodium salt). The `R-N=N(O)-R` structure is not symmetric about the central bridge. If the molecule is assumed to be planar, it would possess a single plane of symmetry (the molecular plane), giving it **Cₛ** symmetry. This matches option A.\n    *   **Azo product:** Further reduction leads to the formation of trans-4,4'-azodibenzoic acid (as its disodium salt). The azo compound `R-N=N-R` is the more fully reduced and typically more stable product. Let's analyze the symmetry of the trans-isomer, which is sterically preferred and more stable.\n\n**Symmetry analysis of trans-4,4'-azodibenzoic acid (or its salt):**\n\n1.  **Structure:** Two p-carboxyphenyl groups are linked by a trans -N=N- double bond.\n    `HOOC-C₆H₄-N=N-C₆H₄-COOH`\n2.  **Planarity:** The molecule is essentially planar due to the sp² hybridization of the benzene rings and the N=N double bond.\n3.  **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   **Identity (E):** All molecules have this.\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** There is a center of inversion at the midpoint of the N=N bond. For any atom at coordinates (x, y, z), there is an identical atom at (-x, -y, -z).\n    *   **Proper Axis of Rotation (C₂):** There is a C₂ axis perpendicular to the N=N bond, lying in the plane of the molecule. A 180° rotation about this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** There is a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) that is coincident with the molecular plane. Reflection through this plane leaves the molecule unchanged.\n\n4.  **Point Group:** A molecule possessing a C₂ axis with a plane of symmetry perpendicular to it (σₕ) belongs to the **C₂ₕ** point group. The presence of a center of inversion (i) is also characteristic of this group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reaction sequence leads to p-nitrobenzoic acid. The final reaction is a reductive dimerization to form trans-4,4'-azodibenzoic acid (or its dianion). The molecular symmetry group for this planar, centrosymmetric molecule is C₂ₕ.\n\n<<<C>>>"
