    "**Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** `A + H2SO4 ---> 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one`\n2.  **Reagents and Product:** The reagent is sulfuric acid (H2SO4), a strong acid and dehydrating agent. The product is a spiroketone.\n3.  **Name Reaction Identification:** The formation of a spiroketone from a bicyclic precursor under strong acid conditions is characteristic of a **Pinacol Rearrangement** (or a related Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement). This reaction typically starts from a 1,2-diol (a glycol).\n4.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   The diol is protonated by H2SO4 at one of the hydroxyl groups.\n    *   This protonated hydroxyl group leaves as a water molecule, creating a carbocation.\n    *   A 1,2-alkyl shift (rearrangement) occurs where a C-C bond migrates to the carbocation. In this case, the migration of a bond from the adjacent ring leads to a ring contraction of one ring and the formation of a spirocyclic system.\n    *   The positive charge is transferred to the carbon that was originally attached to the second hydroxyl group.\n    *   Deprotonation of this second hydroxyl group yields the ketone carbonyl group.\n5.  **Identifying Reactant A:**\n    *   To form the spiro[4.5]decanone skeleton, a logical precursor is a fused bicyclic diol, such as a decalin-diol (octahydronaphthalene-diol).\n    *   Looking at the options, `2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol` fits this description perfectly. The two hydroxyl groups are on the bridgehead carbons (4a and 8a), which is the ideal setup for a pinacol rearrangement to a spiroketone.\n    *   Let's trace the reaction: `2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol` (a bicyclo[4.4.0] system) rearranges into `2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-one` (a spiro[4.5] system). This transformation is a well-documented example of the pinacol rearrangement.\n    *   Option `A = 2,8-dimethylspiro[4.5]decan-6-ol` is the alcohol corresponding to the product. Treatment with H2SO4 would lead to dehydration, forming an alkene, not rearrangement to the ketone.\n    *   Therefore, reactant A must be `2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol`. This eliminates options A and B.\n\n**Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n1.  **Reaction:** `B + BuLi + H+ ---> 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol`\n2.  **Reagents and Product:** The reagents are butyllithium (BuLi), a very strong base, followed by an acidic workup (H+). The product is a specific homoallylic alcohol.\n3.  **Name Reaction Identification:** The conversion of an allylic ether to a rearranged homoallylic alcohol using a strong base is the hallmark of the **[2,3]-Wittig Rearrangement**, which is a type of sigmatropic rearrangement.\n4.  **Mechanism:**\n    *   BuLi acts as a base and deprotonates the starting ether at a position alpha (adjacent) to the ether oxygen, forming a carbanion.\n    *   This carbanion then undergoes a concerted [2,3]-sigmatropic shift.\n    *   This shift involves a 5-membered cyclic transition state, resulting in a rearranged lithium alkoxide.\n    *   The final acidic workup (H+) protonates the alkoxide to give the product alcohol.\n5.  **Identifying Reactant B:**\n    *   We need an ether that can undergo this rearrangement to give the specified product. Let's look at the options for B.\n    *   Option `B = (((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene` is Benzyl Prenyl Ether: `Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`. This is an allylic ether. The most acidic proton is on the benzylic carbon (`Ph-CH2-`), which is alpha to the ether oxygen.\n    *   Let's trace the reaction:\n        a. BuLi deprotonates the benzylic carbon: `Ph-CH(-)-O-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`.\n        b. A [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement occurs. A new C-C bond forms between the benzylic carbon and the terminal carbon of the allyl group's double bond. The `O-CH2` bond of the allyl group breaks.\n        c. The intermediate alkoxide is: `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(Ph)-O(-)`.\n        d. Protonation with H+ gives the final product: `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(Ph)-OH`.\n    *   Let's name this product using IUPAC rules. The longest carbon chain containing the OH group and the double bond is a pentene chain. Numbering starts from the carbon bearing the OH group: `HO-C(1)H(Ph)-C(2)H2-C(3)H=C(4)(CH3)2`.\n        - The name is `1-phenyl-4-methylpent-3-en-1-ol`. This matches the product given in the question.\n    *   Option `B = 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-one` is a ketone. If BuLi were to react with it, it would act as a nucleophile (Bu-), adding a butyl group to the carbonyl carbon. The product would be `5-butyl-4-methyl-1-phenylpent-3-en-1-ol`, which is not the observed product.\n    *   Therefore, reactant B must be `(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   Reactant A is `2,7-dimethyloctahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol`.\n*   Reactant B is `(((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene`.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
