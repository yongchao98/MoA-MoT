    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Premise:** The problem states that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This is a crucial starting point. A uniform distribution means that the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ`, is constant everywhere. The number of stars `N` in any given volume `V` is simply `N = ρ * V`.\n\n2.  **Relate the Number of Stars to Distance:** Let's consider a sphere of radius `d` centered on the observer (the Sun). The volume of this sphere is `V = (4/3)πd³`. The total number of stars (`N`) within this distance `d` is:\n    `N(d) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πd³`\n    This shows that the total number of stars up to a certain distance `d` is proportional to the cube of the distance (`N ∝ d³`).\n\n3.  **Introduce Parallax (plx):** Stellar parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`d`) to the star. The relationship is given by:\n    `plx = 1/d`\n    (when `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds).\n    From this, we can express the distance in terms of parallax:\n    `d = 1/plx`\n\n4.  **Find the Number of Stars in a Thin Shell:** The question asks for the \"number of stars per unit range of parallax\". This is a rate, which in calculus terms means a derivative. Let's find the number of stars `dN` in a thin spherical shell of space. This shell is between a distance `d` and a slightly larger distance `d + dd`.\n    *   The volume of the thin shell `dV` can be approximated by the surface area of the inner sphere (`4πd²`) times the thickness of the shell (`dd`):\n        `dV = 4πd² * dd`\n    *   The number of stars `dN` in this shell is the density `ρ` times the shell's volume `dV`:\n        `dN = ρ * dV = ρ * 4πd² * dd`\n\n5.  **Change Variables from Distance to Parallax:** Now we need to express `dN` in terms of parallax `plx`. We have the relationships:\n    *   `d = 1/plx`\n    *   To find the relationship between `dd` and `d(plx)`, we differentiate `d` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dd/d(plx) = d/d(plx) (1/plx) = -1/plx²`\n        `dd = -(1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    The negative sign simply indicates that as distance (`d`) increases, parallax (`plx`) decreases. Since we are interested in the number of stars in a range, which must be a positive quantity, we consider the magnitude: `|dd| = (1/plx²) * d(plx)`.\n\n6.  **Substitute and Simplify:** Now substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` back into the equation for `dN`:\n    `dN = ρ * 4π * (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) * d(plx)`\n    `dN = (4πρ / plx⁴) * d(plx)`\n\n7.  **Find the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** The question asks for the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which is `dN/d(plx)`. From the equation above, we can see:\n    `dN/d(plx) = 4πρ / plx⁴`\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** Since `4`, `π`, and `ρ` are constants, we can see the relationship:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n    This means the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to `1/plx⁴`.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
