    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence**\n\n1.  **Reaction 1: Formation of Product 1**\n    *   Starting material: 1,3-dibromoadamantane.\n    *   Reagents: excess KOH, heated to 240°C.\n    *   Product 1 is described as a light yellow solid with an IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group (likely a ketone), and a ¹H NMR spectrum suggesting 14 protons. The molecular formula C10H14O is consistent with the starting material C10H14Br2 (replacement of 2Br by 1 O).\n    *   The harsh reaction conditions (strong base, high temperature) on a bridged polycyclic system like adamantane are known to cause skeletal rearrangements. A simple substitution or elimination is unlikely. While the exact structure of Product 1 is difficult to determine from the given information alone (the provided NMR data is for a specific, non-obvious rearranged product), we can establish that **Product 1 is a ketone with a C10H14O formula and a rearranged polycyclic (cage-like) structure.**\n\n2.  **Reaction 2: Formation of Product 2**\n    *   Reagents: Product 1 (a ketone) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide (Al(O-iPr)₃).\n    *   The subsequent reaction is ozonolysis, which cleaves C=C double bonds. This is a crucial clue: **Product 2 must be an alkene.**\n    *   The conversion of a ketone (Product 1) to an alkene (Product 2) using Al(O-iPr)₃ is not a standard named reaction. However, it can be logically deduced as a two-step sequence occurring in the same pot:\n        *   First, a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction of the ketone to a secondary alcohol.\n        *   Second, dehydration (elimination of water) of the alcohol to form an alkene, likely catalyzed by the Lewis acidic aluminum species at high temperature.\n    *   The dehydration step will generally follow Zaitsev's rule, forming the most substituted (and thus most stable) alkene.\n\n3.  **Reaction 3: Formation of Product 3**\n    *   Reagents: Ozone (O₃) followed by dimethyl sulfide (DMS).\n    *   This is a standard reductive ozonolysis reaction, which cleaves the C=C double bond of Product 2 and replaces it with two carbonyl groups (C=O).\n    *   If a carbon in the double bond is bonded to a hydrogen (R₂C=CHR'), it becomes an aldehyde (R'CHO).\n    *   If a carbon in the double bond is not bonded to any hydrogens (R₂C=CR'₂), it becomes a ketone (R'₂C=O).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the nature of the final product, Product 3**\n\n*   The skeleton of Product 1 is derived from adamantane, which is built entirely from tertiary (CH) and secondary (CH₂) carbons. There are no quaternary carbons.\n*   Product 1 is a ketone, so its C=O group must be at a secondary position.\n*   Product 1 is reduced to a secondary alcohol.\n*   Dehydration of this alcohol cannot form a tetra-substituted alkene (R₂C=CR'₂) because there aren't enough substituents available on the skeleton. Therefore, the alkene **Product 2 must have at least one proton on the double bond** (i.e., it is of the form RCH=CR'₂ or RCH=CHR').\n*   Consequently, the ozonolysis of Product 2 **must form at least one aldehyde group (-CHO) in Product 3.**\n\n**Step 3: Identify the most deshielded hydrogen in Product 3 and its coupling pattern**\n\n*   The most deshielded hydrogen atom in Product 3 (excluding exchangeable protons like -OH) will be the aldehyde proton (H-C=O). Its chemical shift is typically in the 9-10 ppm range, far downfield from other C-H protons.\n*   The question asks for the coupling pattern of this aldehyde proton. The splitting of the aldehyde proton signal is determined by the number of protons on the adjacent carbon (the α-carbon), according to the n+1 rule. We must also consider the possibility of long-range coupling to protons on the β-carbon.\n\nLet's analyze the structure around the aldehyde group, O=CH-Cα-Cβ...\n\n1.  The structure of Product 1 is a rearranged cage. The adamantane skeleton itself has only CH groups adjacent to any secondary position (e.g., C2 is adjacent to C1 and C3, both are CH groups). If Product 1 were 2-adamantanone, the alcohol would be 2-hydroxyadamantane. Dehydration would create an alkene adjacent to a bridgehead, leading to an aldehyde of the form OHC-CH< upon ozonolysis. The aldehyde proton would be coupled to one proton on the α-carbon, resulting in a **doublet**. This is not one of the simple options (C), and while it could be part of a complex pattern like (A) or (D), it's a strong indicator that the skeleton is not the simple adamantane one.\n\n2.  Since a simple adamantane skeleton doesn't lead to the given options cleanly, we must rely on the fact that a rearrangement has occurred. A rearranged C10 cage can easily have environments where a secondary carbon is adjacent to both a CH group and a CH2 group. Let's assume Product 1 is such a ketone: `...-CH-C(=O)-CH₂-...`\n\n3.  The formation of Product 2 (alkene) from this ketone would proceed via the alcohol `...-CH-CH(OH)-CH₂-...`. Dehydration follows Zaitsev's rule, eliminating a proton from the more substituted adjacent carbon (the CH group).\n    *   Alkene (Product 2): `...-C=CH-CH₂-...`\n\n4.  Ozonolysis of this alkene cleaves the C=C bond:\n    *   `...-C=CH-CH₂-...`  --[O₃; DMS]--> `...-C=O` (a ketone) + `OHC-CH₂-...` (an aldehyde).\n\n5.  The final product (Product 3) contains an aldehyde with the structure `OHC-CH₂-...`.\n    *   The aldehyde proton (CHO) is adjacent to an α-carbon that is a CH₂ group.\n    *   According to the n+1 rule, the two protons on the α-CH₂ group will split the aldehyde proton signal into a **triplet** (n=2, so 2+1=3).\n\n6.  Now we must consider the options. Option (C) is a triplet. The other options (A, B, D) involve more complex splitting, likely due to long-range coupling (e.g., to protons on the β-carbon). For example, if the fragment is `OHC-CH₂(α)-CH₂(β)-...`, the aldehyde proton couples with the α-CH₂ (triplet) and could also couple with the β-CH₂ (another triplet), resulting in a **triplet of triplets** (D). This requires that the 4-bond coupling (J₄) is significant and resolved.\n\n7.  Given the options, the question is likely testing for the possibility of long-range coupling, which is common in rigid systems that can enforce a \"W\" geometry between protons. The formation of a `OHC-CH₂-CH₂-...` fragment from the cleavage of a cyclic alkene is very plausible. Therefore, expecting the J₄ coupling to the β-CH₂ protons to be resolved is a reasonable interpretation for an advanced problem. This would lead to a triplet (from the α-CH₂) of triplets (from the β-CH₂).\n\nTherefore, the most likely coupling pattern is a triplet of triplets.\n\n<<<D>>>"
