    "An object's perceived color is the color of the light it reflects or transmits, while the absorbed color is complementary to the perceived color. When a molecule absorbs light, an electron is promoted to a higher energy level. When it returns to the ground state, it often emits light of a longer wavelength (lower energy) due to some energy loss through non-radiative processes (like vibrations). This emitted light is called fluorescence or phosphorescence. The color we see is the color of this emitted light. The question states the dye *emits* light with a specific energy, so we need to determine the color corresponding to this emission and then find the complementary color, which would be the absorbed color that caused the initial excitation.\n\n1.  **Calculate the wavelength of the emitted light.**\n    The relationship between energy (E) in electron volts (eV) and wavelength (λ) in nanometers (nm) is given by the formula:\n    λ (nm) = 1240 / E (eV)\n    Given the energy of the emitted light is E = 2.3393 eV.\n\n    Let's calculate the wavelength.\n    ```python\n    # Calculate the wavelength (in nm) from the energy (in eV)\n    energy_eV = 2.3393\n    wavelength_nm = 1240 / energy_eV\n    print(wavelength_nm)\n    ```\n    <execute_result>\n    530.0731000726713\n    </execute_result>\n2.  **Determine the color of the emitted light.**\n    The calculated wavelength is approximately 530 nm. Looking at the visible light spectrum:\n    *   Violet: 380–450 nm\n    *   Blue: 450–495 nm\n    *   Green: 495–570 nm\n    *   Yellow: 570–590 nm\n    *   Orange: 590–620 nm\n    *   Red: 620–750 nm\n\n    A wavelength of 530 nm falls squarely in the **green** region. Therefore, the textile dye emits green light.\n\n3.  **Determine the color of the absorbed light.**\n    The color of light a substance absorbs is complementary to the color it emits or transmits. We need to find the complementary color of green. On a standard color wheel:\n    *   The complementary color of Red is Green.\n    *   The complementary color of Yellow is Violet.\n    *   The complementary color of Blue is Orange.\n\n    Since the dye emits green light, it must absorb its complementary color, which is **red**. Therefore, the organic compound absorbed red light to become excited.\n\n<<<A>>>"
