    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator.\n\n### 1. Define the System and Conserved Quantities\n\n*   **Particle:** A mass $m$.\n*   **Force:** A restoring force given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$.\n*   **Potential Energy:** The potential energy $U(x)$ associated with this force is the work done against the force to move the mass from the equilibrium position (x=0) to a position $x$.\n    $U(x) = - \\int_0^x F(x') dx' = - \\int_0^x (-kx') dx' = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n*   **Relativistic Energy:** In special relativity, the total energy of a particle with mass $m$ and velocity $v$ is given by $E_{particle} = \\gamma mc^2$, where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$. This energy includes the rest mass energy $E_0 = mc^2$.\n*   **Total Conserved Energy:** The total energy of the system, which is conserved throughout the motion, is the sum of the particle's relativistic energy and its potential energy.\n    $E_{total} = E_{particle} + U(x) = \\gamma mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n### 2. Apply the Principle of Conservation of Energy\n\nThe total energy $E_{total}$ must be the same at every point in the oscillator's path. We can find the value of this constant energy by considering a point where the energy is easy to calculate. A convenient point is the point of maximum displacement (the amplitude).\n\n*   **At the maximum amplitude ($x=A$):**\n    *   The mass momentarily comes to a stop before changing direction. Therefore, its velocity is zero, $v=0$.\n    *   When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0^2/c^2}} = 1$.\n    *   The potential energy is at its maximum: $U(A) = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   The total conserved energy of the system is:\n        $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n### 3. Analyze the System at Maximum Speed\n\nThe mass reaches its maximum speed, $v_{max}$, when it passes through the equilibrium position ($x=0$). At this point, the potential energy is zero.\n\n*   **At the equilibrium position ($x=0$):**\n    *   The velocity is maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The potential energy is zero: $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n    *   The total energy of the system is:\n        $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max} mc^2 + 0 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$.\n\n### 4. Equate Energies and Solve for v_max\n\nBy the principle of conservation of energy, the total energy at the amplitude must equal the total energy at the equilibrium position.\n\n$E_{total}(\\text{at } x=A) = E_{total}(\\text{at } x=0)$\n$mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\gamma_{max} mc^2$\n\nNow, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$.\n\n1.  **Isolate $\\gamma_{max}$:**\n    Divide the entire equation by $mc^2$:\n    $1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\gamma_{max}$\n\n2.  **Substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:**\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n3.  **Solve for the square root term:**\n    Invert both sides of the equation:\n    $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}$\n\n4.  **Square both sides:**\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n5.  **Isolate the $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$ term:**\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n6.  **Solve for $v_{max}$:**\n    Multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root:\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe derived expression for the maximum speed is:\n$v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
