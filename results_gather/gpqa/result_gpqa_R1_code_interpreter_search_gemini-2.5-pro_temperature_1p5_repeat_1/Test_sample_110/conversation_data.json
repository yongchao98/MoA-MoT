    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the major products of the given reactions.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Ketone:** 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. This will be the nucleophile after deprotonation.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt). This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, the electrophile.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). A strong, bulky base.\n    *   The reaction is a **Michael Addition**. The base will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate, which will then attack the Michael acceptor.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Enolate (Nucleophile):**\n    *   First, we need to identify the acidic α-protons on the ketone. The α-carbons are C2 and C6 relative to the carbonyl group (C1).\n    *   Let's analyze the substitution at the α-carbons:\n        *   **C2:** is substituted with one ethyl group and one methyl group. It is a quaternary carbon and has **no α-protons**.\n        *   **C6:** is substituted with one methyl group and has **one α-proton**.\n    *   Since there are α-protons only at the C6 position, the base (t-BuOK) can only abstract the proton from C6 to form the enolate. The enolate will have a double bond between C1 and C6.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The C6 carbon of the enolate is the nucleophilic center. It will attack the electrophilic β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (the CH₂ group).\n    *   The reaction forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate molecule.\n    *   The initial adduct is an enolate of the ester, which is then protonated during the work-up step to give the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product A:**\n    *   The new substituent attached to the C6 position of the original ketone ring is -CH₂-CH₂-COOEt.\n    *   Let's determine the IUPAC name of the product. The product is an ethyl ester, specifically an ethyl propanoate derivative. The main chain is the propanoate.\n        *   Chain: ethyl O-C(=O)¹-CH₂²-CH₂³-\n    *   A substituted cyclohexyl group is attached to C3 of the propanoate chain. We need to name this cyclohexyl substituent.\n    *   According to IUPAC rules, the numbering of the substituent ring starts at the point of attachment.\n        *   **C1'**: The attachment point (the original C6 of the ketone). It has a methyl group.\n        *   **C2'**: The adjacent carbon with the carbonyl group (the original C1). It is an \"oxo\" group.\n        *   **C3'**: The next carbon (the original C2). It has an ethyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   Putting the substituent name together: (3'-ethyl-1',3'-dimethyl-2'-oxocyclohexyl).\n    *   Therefore, the full name of product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Nitroalkane:** 1-nitropropane (CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-NO₂). The α-protons (on the carbon attached to the -NO₂ group) are acidic.\n    *   **Base:** Potassium hydroxide (KOH). A strong base.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH₃-CH=CH-CN), also known as crotononitrile. An α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n    *   This is another **Michael Addition**. The base deprotonates the nitroalkane to form a nitronate anion, which acts as the nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Formation of the Nucleophile:**\n    *   The base (KOH) removes an acidic α-proton from C1 of 1-nitropropane.\n    *   This forms a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion: [CH₃-CH₂-CH-NO₂]⁻ ↔ CH₃-CH₂-CH=N⁺(O⁻)O⁻. The nucleophilic attack occurs through the carbon atom.\n\n3.  **Michael Addition Step:**\n    *   The Michael acceptor is but-2-enenitrile (C⁴H₃-C³H=C²H-C¹N). The β-carbon is C3.\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon (C1 of the nitropropane) attacks the electrophilic β-carbon (C3) of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed. The resulting carbanion at C2 is protonated by water (H₂O) to give the final product.\n\n4.  **Structure and Naming of Product B:**\n    *   Let's assemble the product structure from the two parts:\n        *   From 1-nitropropane: (CH₃-CH₂-CH-NO₂)\n        *   From but-2-enenitrile: (CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN)\n        *   Connecting them: CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN\n    *   To name the product, we identify the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The parent chain is the longest carbon chain that includes the nitrile carbon.\n        *   C¹N - C²H₂ - C³H(CH₃) - C⁴H(NO₂) - C⁵H₂ - C⁶H₃\n    *   The longest chain has 6 carbons, so the parent name is **hexanenitrile**.\n    *   The substituents are:\n        *   A methyl group (-CH₃) on C3.\n        *   A nitro group (-NO₂) on C4.\n    *   Alphabetizing the substituents, the full name of product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   **Product A:** ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate\n*   **Product B:** 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\n*   A) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect B)\n*   B) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile (Incorrect A and B)\n*   C) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (Incorrect A)\n*   D) A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile (**Correct A and B**)\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
