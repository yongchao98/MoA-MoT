    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions**\n    *   **Mean Free Path (MFP):** The average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is related to the number density of target particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ): λ ∝ 1/(nσ).\n    *   **λ1:** The mean free path of a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules.\n    *   **λ2:** The mean free path of a high-energy electron colliding with the gas molecules.\n    *   **Given:** The number density (n) of gas molecules and the temperature are the same for both scenarios.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Scenario for λ1 (Gas-Gas Collisions)**\n    *   In this case, both the projectile particle (a gas molecule) and the target particles (other gas molecules) are in random thermal motion.\n    *   The standard formula for the mean free path from the kinetic theory of gases, which accounts for the relative motion of all particles, is:\n        λ₁ = 1 / (√2 * n * σ₁)\n    *   Here, `n` is the number density of gas molecules, and `σ₁` is the kinetic collision cross-section between two gas molecules. The factor `√2` is crucial and arises because the target particles are also moving.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Scenario for λ2 (Electron-Gas Collisions)**\n    *   In this case, the projectile is a high-energy electron from a 1000 kV beam. These electrons are moving at relativistic speeds, vastly greater than the thermal velocities of the residual gas molecules.\n    *   Because the electrons are so much faster, the gas molecules can be considered essentially stationary targets.\n    *   The mean free path for a fast particle moving through a field of stationary targets is given by:\n        λ₂ = 1 / (n * σ₂)\n    *   Notice the absence of the `√2` factor. Here, `σ₂` is the total scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron with a gas molecule.\n\n4.  **Compare the Collision Cross-Sections (σ₁ vs. σ₂)**\n    *   **σ₁ (Gas-Gas):** This cross-section is related to the effective physical size of the gas molecules. It's the \"kinetic diameter\" that matters for low-energy collisions governed by intermolecular forces.\n    *   **σ₂ (Electron-Gas):** This is the scattering cross-section. For a very high-energy (1000 keV) electron, the interaction is quite different. The electron is a point-like particle that interacts with the electromagnetic field of the atom (both the nucleus and the atomic electrons). Due to its high energy, the electron can penetrate the electron cloud easily. High-energy scattering cross-sections are generally *smaller* than the low-energy kinetic cross-sections of the molecules themselves. An electron traveling at such a high velocity is less likely to be deflected by a gas molecule than two slow-moving gas molecules are to collide with each other.\n    *   Therefore, we can confidently conclude that **σ₁ > σ₂**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio of λ2 to λ1**\n    *   Let's divide the equation for λ₂ by the equation for λ₁:\n        λ₂ / λ₁ = [1 / (n * σ₂)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ₁)]\n    *   Simplifying the expression by canceling `n`:\n        λ₂ / λ₁ = (√2 * σ₁) / σ₂\n    *   λ₂ = λ₁ * √2 * (σ₁ / σ₂)\n\n6.  **Draw the Final Conclusion**\n    *   We have two factors contributing to the ratio:\n        1.  **The Target Motion Factor:** `√2` (which is approximately 1.414). This factor alone, which comes from the gas molecules being stationary targets for the electrons, makes λ₂ larger than λ₁.\n        2.  **The Cross-Section Factor:** `(σ₁ / σ₂)`. Since we established that σ₁ > σ₂, this ratio is greater than 1.\n    *   Combining these, the total ratio λ₂ / λ₁ = √2 * (a number greater than 1).\n    *   This means that **λ₂ / λ₁ > √2 ≈ 1.414**.\n    *   Therefore, we must have λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Given Options**\n    *   A) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22 * λ₁ : This is false, because λ₂ is greater than 1.414 * λ₁.\n    *   B) λ₂ < λ₁ : This is false.\n    *   C) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation: This is false, as the underlying physics is different.\n    *   D) λ₂ >= 1.22 * λ₁ : This is true. Since our calculation shows that λ₂ > 1.414 * λ₁, it is necessarily true that λ₂ is also greater than or equal to 1.22 * λ₁. This option correctly identifies that λ₂ is significantly larger than λ₁.\n\n<<<D>>>"
