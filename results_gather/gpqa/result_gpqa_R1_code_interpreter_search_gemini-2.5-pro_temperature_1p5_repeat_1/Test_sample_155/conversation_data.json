    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene. This is a trans-alkene. It is a symmetrical molecule, so it is achiral.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2   H\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n                H   CH2CH2CH3\n    ```\n2.  **Reagent 1: mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid).** This reagent performs epoxidation, which is a syn-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond.\n    *   The syn-addition to a trans-alkene results in a trans-epoxide.\n    *   Since the starting alkene is achiral, the epoxidation can occur from either the top face or the bottom face of the double bond with equal probability.\n    *   Attacking from one face produces one enantiomer of the epoxide, and attacking from the other face produces the other enantiomer.\n    *   The product of this step is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-4,5-epoxyoctane and (4S,5S)-4,5-epoxyoctane.\n\n3.  **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This reagent performs an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. The mechanism involves protonation of the epoxide oxygen followed by a backside (anti) attack by a water molecule (Sₙ2-like). This process results in an anti-dihydroxylation of the original alkene.\n    *   We have a racemic mixture of the trans-epoxide, and we are performing an anti-addition of two -OH groups.\n    *   Let's consider the stereochemical outcome. The overall transformation is an anti-dihydroxylation of a trans-alkene. A common rule in stereochemistry is: **trans-alkene + anti-addition → meso compound** (if the product molecule has a plane of symmetry).\n    *   Let's verify this:\n        *   Opening of (4R,5R)-epoxide via anti-attack by water leads to inversion at one of the carbons. For example, attack at C4 inverts its configuration from R to S, while C5 remains R. The product is (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n        *   Opening of (4S,5S)-epoxide via anti-attack by water leads to inversion at one carbon. For example, attack at C4 inverts its configuration from S to R, while C5 remains S. The product is (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   The compounds (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol are the same molecule. This molecule has two stereocenters but also has a plane of symmetry, making it a **meso compound**. It is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The product is a single compound, meso-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene. This is a cis-alkene. It is a symmetrical molecule and is achiral.\n    ```\n       CH3CH2CH2   CH2CH2CH3\n                 \\ /\n                  C=C\n                 / \\\n                H   H\n    ```\n2.  **Reagent 1: mCPBA.** Again, this is a syn-addition.\n    *   Syn-addition to a cis-alkene results in a cis-epoxide (also called a meso-epoxide in this case).\n    *   The product, cis-4,5-epoxyoctane, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a meso compound. Only one epoxide product is formed.\n\n3.  **Reagent 2: Aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).** This performs an anti-dihydroxylation.\n    *   We are starting with a cis-alkene and performing an overall anti-dihydroxylation. The stereochemistry rule is: **cis-alkene + anti-addition → racemic mixture**.\n    *   Let's verify this by considering the opening of the meso-epoxide.\n        *   The meso-epoxide is attacked by water from the side opposite the epoxide oxygen (anti-attack).\n        *   Attack at C4 (let's say it's R) gives the (4S,5S)-diol.\n        *   Attack at C5 (which is S) gives the (4R,5R)-diol.\n        *   Since attack at C4 and C5 is equally probable, a 50:50 mixture of the two products is formed.\n    *   The products, (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, are non-superimposable mirror images of each other; they are **enantiomers**.\n    *   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The product is a racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct chemical species:\n1.  **meso-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 1)\n2.  **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n3.  **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThese three molecules are all stereoisomers of octane-4,5-diol.\n*   The (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) forms are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso form is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) forms.\n\n### **Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Achiral columns separate compounds based on differences in physical properties like polarity and size.\n    *   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated by achiral chromatography. Therefore, the meso-diol will be separated from the enantiomeric pair.\n    *   **Enantiomers** have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They will not be separated and will elute at the same time (co-elute), appearing as a single peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **2 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: The co-eluting racemic mixture of (4R,5R)- and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral columns have a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The column will separate the meso-diol from the chiral diols (as they are diastereomers).\n    *   The column will also separate the two enantiomers, (4R,5R)-diol and (4S,5S)-diol, from each other.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatogram will show **3 peaks**:\n        *   Peak 1: meso-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 2: (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol\n        *   Peak 3: (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe chemist will observe **2 peaks** on the standard HPLC and **3 peaks** on the chiral HPLC. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
