    "The user is asking for the value of \"a\" that normalizes the given wave function in the specified interval.\n\n**1. Understand the Normalization Condition**\nIn quantum mechanics, a wave function ψ(x) must be normalized. This means that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere in the allowed space is 1. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n∫|ψ(x)|² dx = 1\nThe integral is taken over all space where the particle can exist.\n\n**2. Define the problem-specific parameters**\n*   Wave function: ψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n*   The particle exists only between x=1 and x=3. So, these are our integration limits.\n\n**3. Calculate the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |ψ(x)|²**\nA complex number z = p + qi has a magnitude squared of |z|² = p² + q².\nFor our wave function ψ(x):\n*   The real part is Re(ψ) = a / sqrt(1 + x)\n*   The imaginary part is Im(ψ) = -0.5\nSo, |ψ(x)|² = (Re(ψ))² + (Im(ψ))²\n|ψ(x)|² = (a / sqrt(1 + x))² + (-0.5)²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n**4. Set up the normalization integral**\nWe need to integrate |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 and set the result equal to 1.\n∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\n**5. Solve the integral**\nLet's break the integral into two parts:\n∫(a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫(0.25) dx\n\nPart 1: ∫(a² / (1 + x)) dx = a² * ∫(1 / (1 + x)) dx = a² * ln(1 + x)\nPart 2: ∫(0.25) dx = 0.25 * x\n\nNow, combine them and apply the limits [1, 3]:\n[ a² * ln(1 + x) + 0.25 * x ] from 1 to 3\n\n= (a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3) - (a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1)\n= (a² * ln(4) + 0.75) - (a² * ln(2) + 0.25)\n= a² * ln(4) - a² * ln(2) + 0.75 - 0.25\n= a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5\n\nUsing the logarithm property ln(b) - ln(c) = ln(b/c):\n= a² * ln(4/2) + 0.5\n= a² * ln(2) + 0.5\n\n**6. Solve for 'a'**\nNow, we set the result of the definite integral equal to 1:\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\na = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))\n\n**7. Calculate the numerical value**\nUsing the value ln(2) ≈ 0.6931:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213\na ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.8493\n\nThis value is very close to 0.85. The python code confirmed this calculation.\n\nThe calculated value of 'a' is approximately 0.8493. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 0.85\nB) 0.6\nC) 0.35\nD) 1.1\n\nThe closest option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
