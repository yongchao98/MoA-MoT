    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the RV Method and Doppler Shift:** The Radial Velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the periodic Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. The star \"wobbles\" as the planet orbits it, causing its light to be blueshifted when it moves towards us and redshifted when it moves away. The magnitude of this shift, `Δλ`, is directly proportional to the amplitude of the star's radial velocity, which we denote as `K`.\n    Therefore, we can establish the following relationship:\n    `K ∝ Δλ`\n    This means the ratio of the velocity amplitudes of the two stars is equal to the ratio of their observed wavelength shifts:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`\n\n2.  **Relate Stellar Velocity (K) to Orbital Period (P):** For a planet in a circular orbit (`e=0`), the amplitude of the star's radial velocity `K` is given by the formula:\n    `K = (Mₚ sin(i) / Mₛ^(2/3)) * (2πG / P)^(1/3)`\n    where:\n    *   `Mₚ` is the planet's mass.\n    *   `Mₛ` is the star's mass.\n    *   `P` is the orbital period.\n    *   `i` is the inclination of the orbit.\n    *   `G` is the gravitational constant.\n\n3.  **Simplify the relationship for this specific problem:** The problem states that several key parameters are the same for both systems:\n    *   The star masses are the same (`Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂`).\n    *   The planet masses are the same (`Mₚ₁ = Mₚ₂`).\n    *   In RV measurements, the value determined is the \"minimum mass\", `Mₚ sin(i)`. The problem's statement that the planets have similar masses implies that this measured value is the same for both. So, `Mₚ₁ sin(i₁) = Mₚ₂ sin(i₂)`.\n    *   `G` and `2π` are constants.\n\n    Because all terms except `P` are the same for both systems, we can treat them as a single constant `C`:\n    `K = C * P^(-1/3)`\n    This shows that the star's velocity amplitude `K` is inversely proportional to the cube root of the planet's orbital period `P`.\n\n4.  **Set up the Ratio of Periods:** Now we can write the relationship for each system and find their ratio:\n    `K₁ = C * P₁^(-1/3)`\n    `K₂ = C * P₂^(-1/3)`\n\n    Dividing the first equation by the second gives:\n    `K₁ / K₂ = (C * P₁^(-1/3)) / (C * P₂^(-1/3)) = P₁^(-1/3) / P₂^(-1/3) = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\n5.  **Combine the Ratios and Solve:** We have two expressions for the ratio `K₁ / K₂`. By equating them, we can solve for the ratio of the periods, `P₂ / P₁`.\n    From step 1: `K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂`\n    From step 4: `K₁ / K₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\n    Therefore:\n    `Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\n6.  **Substitute the Given Values and Calculate:** We are given:\n    *   `Δλ₁ = 5` miliangstrom\n    *   `Δλ₂ = 7` miliangstrom\n\n    Plugging these values into the equation:\n    `5 / 7 = (P₂ / P₁)^(1/3)`\n\n    To find `P₂ / P₁`, we cube both sides of the equation:\n    `P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³`\n\n    Now, we perform the calculation.\n```python\n# The ratio of the orbital periods P2/P1 can be found from the ratio of the wavelength shifts (Δλ).\n# The amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is proportional to the wavelength shift (Δλ).\n# So, K1/K2 = Δλ1/Δλ2 = 5/7.\n# For a circular orbit, K is proportional to P^(-1/3), where P is the orbital period.\n# Therefore, K1/K2 = (P1/P2)^(-1/3) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).\n# Equating the two expressions for the ratio K1/K2 gives:\n# Δλ1/Δλ2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n# (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)\n# To find P2/P1, we cube both sides.\nratio = (5/7)**3\nprint(ratio)\n```\n<execute_result>\n0.3644315830899321\n</execute_result>\nThe calculation shows that `P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.364`. This value corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "I have already provided the final answer based on the calculation. The code execution confirms that `(5/7)³` is approximately `0.3644`. This value corresponds to option C.\n\nThe question asks for the ratio `P₂ / P₁`, which we calculated to be `~0.36`.\n\nFinal Answer is C.\n<<<C>>>"
