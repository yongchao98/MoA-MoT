    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct reaction sequence:\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\n\nThe target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   The parent structure is acetophenone (a benzene ring with an acetyl group, -COCH3).\n*   The substituents on the ring are:\n    *   An acetyl group (-COCH3) at position 1.\n    *   A bromo group (-Br) at position 3.\n    *   A nitro group (-NO2) at position 5.\n*   The key feature is the substitution pattern: all three groups are *meta* to each other (1,3,5 substitution).\n\n**2. Understand the Directing Effects of Substituents**\n\nIn electrophilic aromatic substitution, existing groups on the benzene ring direct new groups to specific positions:\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Deactivating (weakly) and an *ortho, para*-director.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating and a *meta*-director.\n*   **Amino group (-NH2):** Strongly activating and an *ortho, para*-director. (Relevant for intermediates in some options).\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Proposed Reaction Sequence**\n\nLet's analyze each option to see if it can logically produce the target molecule.\n\n*   **Sequence A:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n    1.  **Benzene -> Nitrobenzene:** Nitration of benzene. The -NO2 group is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **Nitrobenzene -> Aniline:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amino group (-NH2). The -NH2 group is strongly activating and *ortho, para*-directing.\n    3.  **Aniline + CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** This step is highly problematic. Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work on rings with strongly activating groups like -NH2. The lone pair on the nitrogen atom of aniline reacts with the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3), forming a strongly deactivating complex (-N+H2-AlCl3), which prevents the desired reaction on the ring. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Sequence B:** i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ...\n    1.  **Benzene -> Bromobenzene:** Bromination of benzene. The -Br group is an *ortho, para*-director.\n    2.  **Bromobenzene -> o/p-Bromonitrobenzene:** Nitration of bromobenzene gives a mixture of ortho and para products, with the para isomer (4-bromonitrobenzene) being the major one. This does not lead to a *meta* relationship between Br and NO2.\n    3.  **p-Bromonitrobenzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3:** Friedel-Crafts acylation on this ring is very difficult because it is strongly deactivated by both the -Br and -NO2 groups. Even if it worked, the directing effects would not lead to the 1,3,5 pattern. This sequence is incorrect.\n\n*   **Sequence C:** i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) NaNO2/HCl ; iv) H3PO2 ...\n    1.  **Benzene -> Nitrobenzene**\n    2.  **Nitrobenzene -> Aniline**\n    3.  **Aniline -> Benzenediazonium chloride:** Diazotization of aniline.\n    4.  **Benzenediazonium chloride -> Benzene:** Reduction of the diazonium salt with H3PO2 removes the group entirely, regenerating the starting material, benzene. This sequence is nonsensical.\n\n*   **Sequence D:** i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...\n    1.  **Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 -> Acetophenone:** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation. The product is acetophenone. The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 -> 3-Bromoacetophenone:** This is an electrophilic bromination. Since the acetyl group is a *meta*-director, the bromine atom is added at the meta position (position 3). This step is correct.\n    3.  **3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** This is an electrophilic nitration on 3-bromoacetophenone. We must consider the directing effects of both substituents:\n        *   The -COCH3 group at position 1 is a *meta*-director, directing the new -NO2 group to position 5.\n        *   The -Br group at position 3 is an *ortho, para*-director, directing the new group to positions 2, 4, and 6.\n        At first glance, the directors seem to conflict. However, the -COCH3 group is a strong deactivator, making the positions *ortho* and *para* to it (positions 2, 4, 6) very unreactive. The least deactivated position on the ring is position 5 (meta to the strong deactivator). Therefore, the nitration occurs preferentially at position 5, yielding the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. This reaction is known to proceed with a good yield.\n\nThe first three steps of sequence D provide a valid and high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. The subsequent steps (iv to vii) are superfluous and would modify the desired product if carried out, but the question asks for a sequence that *would lead to* the product. This implies that the correct path is contained within the option.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSequence D correctly outlines the steps to first install a *meta*-director (acetyl group), then use it to direct the second substituent (bromo group) to the meta position, and finally, perform a third substitution (nitration) which is directed to the only remaining favorable position to give the 1,3,5-trisubstituted product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
