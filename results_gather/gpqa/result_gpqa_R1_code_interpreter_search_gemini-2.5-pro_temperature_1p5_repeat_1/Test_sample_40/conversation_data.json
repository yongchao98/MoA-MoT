    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   We have two inertial frames of reference.\n    *   **Frame S (Laboratory Frame):** This is the frame where the observer is stationary.\n    *   **Frame S' (Glass's Rest Frame):** This is the frame moving along with the piece of glass.\n\n2.  **Identify the Velocities:**\n    *   **v:** The velocity of the glass (Frame S') relative to the laboratory (Frame S). The problem states the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. We'll assign this a positive value, `v`.\n    *   **u':** The velocity of the light beam relative to the glass (Frame S'). The speed of light in a medium with an index of refraction `n` is given by `c/n`. Since the problem sets the speed of light in a vacuum `c = 1`, the speed of light in the rest frame of the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n    *   **u:** The velocity of the light beam relative to the observer in the laboratory (Frame S). This is the value we need to find.\n\n3.  **Choose the Correct Physical Law:**\n    *   In classical physics, one might simply add the velocities (`u = u' + v`). However, velocities close to the speed of light must be handled using the principles of Special Relativity.\n    *   The correct formula is the **Einstein velocity-addition formula**. For motion along a single axis (in this case, the direction of the beam and the glass's motion), the formula is:\n        `u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c^2)`\n\n4.  **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula:**\n    *   We have:\n        *   `u' = 1/n`\n        *   `v = v`\n        *   `c = 1`\n    *   Substituting these into the velocity-addition formula:\n        `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1^2 )`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Algebraic Expression:**\n    *   `u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/n )`\n    *   To simplify the complex fraction, find a common denominator for the terms in the numerator and the denominator.\n        *   Numerator: `(1/n) + v = (1/n) + (nv/n) = (1 + nv) / n`\n        *   Denominator: `1 + (v/n) = (n/n) + (v/n) = (n + v) / n`\n    *   Now substitute these back into the expression for `u`:\n        `u = ( (1 + nv) / n ) / ( (n + v) / n )`\n    *   The `n` in the denominator of both the main numerator and the main denominator cancels out.\n        `u = (1 + nv) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare the Result with the Given Options:**\n    *   The calculated speed of the light beam relative to the observer is `(1 + nv) / (n + v)`.\n    *   Let's check the options provided:\n        A) (1-n*v)/(n+v)\n        B) 1\n        C) (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n        D) (1+n*v)/(n-v)\n    *   Our result perfectly matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
