    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem Statement:**\n    *   We are given an observational relationship in a specific region of the sky: \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\".\n    *   Let 'N' be the number of stars and 'plx' be the parallax. The given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5.\n    *   We need to determine how the number of stars per unit distance, dN/dr, changes with distance, r.\n\n2.  **Interpret the phrase \"number of stars varies with...\":**\n    In astronomy, statements about number counts (e.g., \"number of stars/galaxies\") as a function of an observable quantity (like magnitude, flux, or parallax) often refer to the **cumulative number** of objects. For example, \"the number of stars brighter than magnitude m\" or \"the number of galaxies with flux greater than S\".\n    *   Parallax (plx) is inversely related to distance (r): plx = 1/r.\n    *   A larger parallax means a smaller distance, and a smaller parallax means a larger distance.\n    *   It is standard to count stars *out to* a certain distance r, which we denote as N(<r). This corresponds to counting stars with a parallax *greater than* a certain value plx = 1/r, which we can denote as N(>plx).\n    *   Therefore, the most plausible interpretation of the statement \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\" is that it describes the cumulative number of stars with parallax greater than plx.\n    *   So, we have: N(>plx) ∝ 1/plx^5.\n\n3.  **Translate the Relationship from Parallax to Distance:**\n    *   We want to express the cumulative number of stars as a function of distance, r.\n    *   The cumulative number of stars within a distance r is N(<r).\n    *   Since r = 1/plx, a star being within distance r is equivalent to its parallax being greater than plx. So, N(<r) = N(>plx).\n    *   Substitute plx = 1/r into the given relationship:\n        N(<r) ∝ 1/(1/r)^5\n        N(<r) ∝ r^5\n\n4.  **Calculate the Number of Stars per Unit Distance:**\n    *   The question asks for how the number of stars \"change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)\". This is the definition of the derivative, dN/dr.\n    *   We can find dN/dr by differentiating the cumulative number N(<r) with respect to r.\n    *   Let N(<r) = k * r^5, where k is a constant of proportionality.\n    *   Differentiate N(<r) with respect to r:\n        dN/dr = d/dr (k * r^5)\n        dN/dr = k * 5 * r^(5-1)\n        dN/dr = 5k * r^4\n    *   This shows that the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to r^4.\n    *   dN/dr ∝ r^4\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r) in proportion to r^4. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
