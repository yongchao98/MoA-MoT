    "This is a classic structure elucidation problem that can be solved by systematically analyzing the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n    The formula for DBE is: C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n    DBE = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 10/2 = 5\n    A DBE of 5 typically suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DBEs: 1 ring and 3 double bonds) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O or C=C).\n\n2.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹:** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a definitive indicator of a primary amine (-NH₂). The two bands correspond to the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations.\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group. The frequency is typical for an ester, specifically an alkyl ester conjugated with an aromatic ring. It's too high for a typical amide (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹) and fits an ester perfectly.\n\n3.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (7.0 - 8.0 ppm):**\n        *   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is the classic signature of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The protons on the ring split each other, resulting in two distinct signals.\n    *   **Aliphatic and Functional Group Region:**\n        *   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)** and **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** This triplet-quartet combination is the tell-tale sign of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n            *   The triplet (t) for 3H is the -CH₃ group, split by the adjacent -CH₂ group.\n            *   The quartet (q) for 2H is the -CH₂ group, split by the adjacent -CH₃ group.\n            *   The chemical shift of the quartet at **4.5 ppm** is highly significant. It indicates that the -CH₂ group is attached to a very electronegative atom, specifically an oxygen atom of an ester (-CO-**O**-CH₂-).\n        *   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** This is a **b**road **s**inglet integrating to two protons. Its chemical shift and broadness are characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The protons are exchangeable, which often leads to signal broadening.\n\n### Assembling the Structure\n\n*   From the DBE and NMR, we have a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   From the IR and NMR, one substituent is a **primary amine (-NH₂) **. This is an electron-donating group.\n*   From the IR and NMR, the other substituent is an **ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃)**. This is an electron-withdrawing group.\n\nPutting these pieces together on the para-substituted ring gives us the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's verify this structure against the data:\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₁NO₂. Benzene ring (C₆H₄) + amine (NH₂) + ethyl ester (COOCH₂CH₃) = C(6+1+2)H(4+2+5)NO₂ = C₉H₁₁NO₂. **Matches.**\n*   **IR:** Primary amine (-NH₂) and an ester C=O. **Matches.**\n*   **¹H NMR:**\n    *   Ethyl group with -CH₂- at ~4.5 ppm. **Matches.**\n    *   -NH₂ protons as a broad singlet. **Matches.**\n    *   Para-substituted ring pattern. The protons ortho to the electron-donating -NH₂ group will be shielded (upfield), while the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing -COOCH₂CH₃ group will be deshielded (downfield). This perfectly explains the doublet at **7.0 ppm** (ortho to -NH₂) and the doublet at **8.0 ppm** (ortho to -COOEt). **Matches perfectly.**\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\n*   **A) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Has a secondary amide (-NH-), inconsistent with the two N-H bands in the IR.\n*   **B) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Has a meta-substitution pattern, inconsistent with the para-pattern (two doublets) in the NMR. Also, the C=O is an amide, which would absorb at a lower frequency in the IR.\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** All data points align perfectly with this structure.\n*   **D) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** This is an isomer. The structure is H₂N-C₆H₄-O-CO-CH₂CH₃. The ethyl group's -CH₂- would be adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O), not the oxygen, and its chemical shift would be around 2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n\nThus, the only structure that fits all the data is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
