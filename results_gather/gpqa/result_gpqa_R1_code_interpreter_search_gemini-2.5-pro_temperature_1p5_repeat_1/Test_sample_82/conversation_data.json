    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning and calculation to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Initial State and Dilution**\n\n*   First, we calculate the initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) before dilution.\n    *   Initial volume of acetic acid = 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n    *   Initial concentration of acetic acid = 0.05 M\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = Concentration × Volume = 0.05 mol/L × 0.0200 L = 0.001 mol.\n\n*   Next, the acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. We need to find the new concentration of the acid.\n    *   Volume of water added = 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n    *   Total volume of the diluted solution = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L\n    *   The number of moles of acetic acid (0.001 mol) remains the same.\n    *   New concentration of CH3COOH (Ca) = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M.\n\n**2. pH at 25% Titration**\n\n*   Titration involves the reaction: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O\n*   This point is in the buffer region, where we have a mixture of the weak acid (CH3COOH) and its conjugate base (CH3COO-). We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n    pH = pKa + log([CH3COO⁻] / [CH3COOH])\n*   First, calculate pKa from the given Ka:\n    *   Ka = 1.85 × 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log₁₀(Ka) = -log₁₀(1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n*   At 25% titration, 25% of the initial acetic acid has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO⁻), and 75% of the acid remains.\n*   The ratio of the concentrations [CH3COO⁻] / [CH3COOH] is equal to the ratio of their moles.\n    *   Ratio = (moles of base) / (moles of acid) = 25% / 75% = 1/3\n*   Now, we can calculate the pH:\n    *   pH = pKa + log₁₀(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 + (-0.477)\n    *   pH ≈ 4.253\n\n**3. pH at the Equivalence Point**\n\n*   At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH3COONa).\n*   First, let's find the volume of 0.1 M NaOH required to reach the equivalence point.\n    *   Moles of NaOH needed = Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.001 mol\n    *   Volume of NaOH (Vb) = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   The solution at the equivalence point contains 0.001 mol of CH3COONa in a total volume of:\n    *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L\n*   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion (CH3COO⁻):\n    *   [CH3COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M\n*   The acetate ion is a weak base and hydrolyzes in water, producing OH⁻ ions:\n    CH3COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH⁻\n*   We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate, which can be found using the ion product of water (Kw = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C) and the Ka of acetic acid.\n    *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 × 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰\n*   We set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis reaction:\n    *   Kb = [CH3COOH][OH⁻] / [CH3COO⁻]\n    *   Let x = [OH⁻] = [CH3COOH] at equilibrium.\n    *   5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n*   Since Kb is very small, we can assume x is negligible compared to 0.02 (i.e., 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02).\n    *   5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰ ≈ x² / 0.02\n    *   x² = (5.405 × 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 ≈ 1.081 × 10⁻¹¹\n    *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.081 × 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.288 × 10⁻⁶ M\n*   Now, we can calculate the pOH and then the pH:\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(3.288 × 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n\nTo get more precise values, we can use a script for calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given constants\nKa = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Step 1: Initial conditions ---\ninitial_acid_vol = 0.0200  # L\ninitial_acid_conc = 0.05  # M\nmoles_acid = initial_acid_vol * initial_acid_conc\ndiluted_acid_vol = 0.0400 # L\ndiluted_acid_conc = moles_acid / diluted_acid_vol # This is 0.025 M\n\n# Titrant\nnaoh_conc = 0.1 # M\n\n# --- Step 2: pH at 25% titration ---\n# Using Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n# At 25% titration, ratio [A-]/[HA] = 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3\npKa = -math.log10(Ka)\npH_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(1/3)\n\nprint(f\"The calculated pH at 25% titration is: {pH_25_percent:.2f}\")\n\n# --- Step 3: pH at the equivalence point ---\n# Volume of NaOH needed for equivalence\nvol_naoh_eq = moles_acid / naoh_conc  # This is 0.010 L\n# Total volume at equivalence point\ntotal_vol_eq = diluted_acid_vol + vol_naoh_eq\n# Concentration of acetate [A-] at equivalence\nconc_A_minus_eq = moles_acid / total_vol_eq\n# Kb for acetate\nKb = Kw / Ka\n# Hydrolysis: A- + H2O <=> HA + OH-\n# Kb = [OH-]^2 / [A-], so [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [A-])\nOH_conc = math.sqrt(Kb * conc_A_minus_eq)\n# pOH and pH\npOH = -math.log10(OH_conc)\npH_eq = 14.0 - pOH\n\nprint(f\"The calculated pH at the equivalence point is: {pH_eq:.2f}\")\n\n```\n\nThe calculated pH at 25% titration is: 4.26\nThe calculated pH at the equivalence point is: 8.52\n\nComparing our results (4.26 and 8.52) with the given options:\nA) 4.57; 6.92\nB) 4.26; 8.52\nC) 3.17; 6.73\nD) 4.73; 7.00\n\nThe calculated values match option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial problem:** We start with a solution of acetic acid (CH₃COOH), a weak acid. It is first diluted and then titrated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a strong base. We need to find the pH at two specific points in the titration: at 25% completion and at the equivalence point.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Dilution Calculation**\n    *   Initial moles of acetic acid:\n        *   Volume = 20.00 cm³ = 0.0200 L\n        *   Concentration = 0.05 M\n        *   Moles = Volume × Concentration = 0.0200 L × 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol of CH₃COOH.\n    *   Dilution: 20.00 cm³ of water is added.\n        *   Initial volume of acid solution = 20.00 cm³\n        *   Volume of water added = 20.00 cm³\n        *   Total volume after dilution = 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³ = 0.0400 L.\n    *   Concentration of acetic acid after dilution:\n        *   The moles of acid remain the same (0.001 mol).\n        *   New Concentration (Ca) = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0400 L = 0.025 M.\n\n3.  **Step 2: pH at 25% Titration**\n    *   The titration reaction is: CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O.\n    *   At 25% titration, 25% of the initial CH₃COOH has been converted to its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻). This means 75% of the CH₃COOH remains unreacted.\n    *   This is a buffer region because we have a significant amount of both the weak acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻). The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is perfect for this calculation:\n        pH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[weak acid])\n    *   First, calculate pKa from the given Ka:\n        *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n        *   pKa = -log₁₀(Ka) = -log₁₀(1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n    *   The ratio of concentrations [CH₃COO⁻]/[CH₃COOH] is equal to the ratio of moles, which is 25% / 75% = 1/3.\n    *   Now, calculate the pH:\n        *   pH = pKa + log₁₀(1/3) = pKa - log₁₀(3)\n        *   pH = -log₁₀(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) + log₁₀(1/3)\n    *   Let's use Python to compute this value accurately.\n\n4.  **Step 3: pH at the Equivalence Point**\n    *   At the equivalence point, all the initial moles of CH₃COOH (0.001 mol) have reacted completely with an equal number of moles of NaOH. The resulting solution contains only the conjugate base, sodium acetate (CH₃COONa), in water.\n    *   First, find the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point:\n        *   Moles NaOH needed = Moles CH₃COOH = 0.001 mol\n        *   Concentration of NaOH = 0.1 M\n        *   Volume NaOH = Moles / Concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³.\n    *   Calculate the total volume of the solution at the equivalence point:\n        *   Total Volume = Volume of diluted acid + Volume of NaOH added = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.0500 L.\n    *   Calculate the concentration of the acetate ion (CH₃COO⁻) at the equivalence point:\n        *   Moles of CH₃COO⁻ = 0.001 mol (from the reaction)\n        *   Concentration [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.0500 L = 0.02 M.\n    *   The acetate ion is a weak base and hydrolyzes in water:\n        CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    *   To find the pH, we first need to find the concentration of OH⁻. We use the base dissociation constant, Kb, for the acetate ion.\n        *   Kb = Kw / Ka, where Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ (at 25°C).\n        *   Kb = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵)\n    *   Set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis reaction or use the approximation for weak bases:\n        *   Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n        *   Let x = [OH⁻]. Then [CH₃COOH] = x, and [CH₃COO⁻] ≈ 0.02 M.\n        *   Kb ≈ x² / 0.02\n        *   x = [OH⁻] ≈ √(Kb × 0.02)\n    *   Once [OH⁻] is found, calculate pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]).\n    *   Finally, calculate pH = 14.00 - pOH.\n    *   Again, let's use Python to perform these calculations accurately.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation and Verification**\n    *   The steps outlined above can be translated into a Python script to get precise numerical answers.\n    *   The script will calculate pKa, then pH at 25% titration.\n    *   Then it will calculate the concentration of acetate at the equivalence point, Kb, [OH⁻], pOH, and finally the pH at the equivalence point.\n    *   This will provide the two values needed to select the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Constants and Initial Values ---\ninitial_acid_volume_cm3 = 20.00\ninitial_acid_concentration_M = 0.05\nwater_volume_cm3 = 20.00\ntitrant_concentration_M = 0.1\nKa_acid = 1.85e-5\nKw = 1.0e-14\n\n# --- Step 1: Dilution ---\ninitial_moles_acid = (initial_acid_volume_cm3 / 1000) * initial_acid_concentration_M\ntotal_volume_L = (initial_acid_volume_cm3 + water_volume_cm3) / 1000\nconcentration_acid_after_dilution = initial_moles_acid / total_volume_L\n\n# --- Step 2: pH at 25% Titration ---\n# Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n# At 25% titration, the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 25/75 = 1/3.\npKa = -math.log10(Ka_acid)\npH_at_25_percent = pKa + math.log10(0.25 / 0.75)\nprint(f\"The pH at 25% titration is: {pH_at_25_percent:.2f}\")\n\n# --- Step 3: pH at Equivalence Point ---\n# Moles of base needed is equal to the initial moles of acid.\nvolume_base_for_equivalence_L = initial_moles_acid / titrant_concentration_M\n# Total volume at the equivalence point\ntotal_volume_at_equivalence_L = total_volume_L + volume_base_for_equivalence_L\n# The solution now contains moles of acetate equal to the initial moles of acid\nmoles_acetate = initial_moles_acid\nconcentration_acetate = moles_acetate / total_volume_at_equivalence_L\n# Acetate is a weak base, it hydrolyzes: A- + H2O <-> HA + OH-\n# We need Kb for acetate.
