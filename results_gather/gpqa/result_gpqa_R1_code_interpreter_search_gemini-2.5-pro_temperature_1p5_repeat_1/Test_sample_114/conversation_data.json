    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principles:** The core of this problem lies in the principles of special relativity, specifically the conservation of energy and momentum in a particle collision.\n\n2.  **Define the initial state:**\n    *   We have two particles: an electron (e-) and a positron (e+).\n    *   The electron moves from left to right (we'll define this as the positive x-direction). Its Lorentz factor is γ_e = 4.\n    *   The positron moves from right to left (negative x-direction). Its Lorentz factor is γ_p = 2.\n    *   The rest mass of an electron and a positron is the same, let's call it `m_e`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the initial total energy (E_i):**\n    *   The energy of a relativistic particle is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.\n    *   Energy of the electron: E_e = γ_e * m_e * c² = 4 * m_e * c²\n    *   Energy of the positron: E_p = γ_p * m_e * c² = 2 * m_e * c²\n    *   Total initial energy: E_i = E_e + E_p = (4 + 2) * m_e * c² = 6 * m_e * c²\n\n4.  **Calculate the initial total momentum (p_i):**\n    *   The momentum of a relativistic particle is given by p = √(γ² - 1) * mc.\n    *   Momentum of the electron (in the +x direction): p_e = √(4² - 1) * m_e * c = √15 * m_e * c\n    *   Momentum of the positron (in the -x direction): p_p = -√(2² - 1) * m_e * c = -√3 * m_e * c\n    *   Total initial momentum is purely in the x-direction: p_i_x = p_e + p_p = (√15 - √3) * m_e * c\n    *   The initial momentum in the y-direction is zero: p_i_y = 0.\n\n5.  **Define the final state:**\n    *   The annihilation produces two photons (γ1 and γ2).\n    *   The problem states that their energies are equal: E_γ1 = E_γ2 = E_γ.\n    *   One photon moves \"upper-right\" and the other \"lower-right\". This means they are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. Let the angle of the upper photon with the x-axis be θ, and the angle of the lower photon be -θ.\n\n6.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the two photons: E_f = E_γ1 + E_γ2 = 2 * E_γ.\n    *   Equating initial and final energy: E_i = E_f => 6 * m_e * c² = 2 * E_γ.\n    *   Solving for the energy of a single photon: E_γ = 3 * m_e * c².\n\n7.  **Apply Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   For a photon, momentum `p` is related to energy `E` by p = E/c.\n    *   So, the magnitude of the momentum of each photon is p_γ = E_γ / c = 3 * m_e * c.\n    *   **Conservation in the y-direction:** The initial y-momentum is 0. The final y-momentum is the sum of the y-components of the photons' momenta: p_γ * sin(θ) + p_γ * sin(-θ) = p_γ * sin(θ) - p_γ * sin(θ) = 0. This is consistent with our symmetric setup and confirms that the angles must be equal and opposite.\n    *   **Conservation in the x-direction:** The initial x-momentum must equal the final x-momentum.\n    *   p_i_x = p_γ1_x + p_γ2_x\n    *   (√15 - √3) * m_e * c = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(-θ)\n    *   (√15 - √3) * m_e * c = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(θ) = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)\n    *   Now, substitute the value of p_γ:\n    *   (√15 - √3) * m_e * c = 2 * (3 * m_e * c) * cos(θ)\n    *   (√15 - √3) * m_e * c = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ)\n    *   We can cancel `m_e * c` from both sides:\n    *   √15 - √3 = 6 * cos(θ)\n    *   cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\n\n8.  **Calculate the angle:**\n    *   Now we calculate the value of θ and then find the total angle between the photons, which is 2θ.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of cos(theta)\ncos_theta = (math.sqrt(15) - math.sqrt(3)) / 6\n\n# Calculate theta in radians\ntheta_rad = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n# Convert theta to degrees\ntheta_deg = math.degrees(theta_rad)\n\n# The total angle between the photons is 2 * theta\ntotal_angle_deg = 2 * theta_deg\n\nprint(total_angle_deg)\n```\n<execution_outputs>\n138.2833010724817\n</execution_outputs>\n\nThe calculated angle is approximately 138.28 degrees.

    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principles:** The problem involves a relativistic collision and annihilation. The key principles to use are the conservation of total relativistic energy and the conservation of momentum.\n\n2.  **Define the system's state before the collision (Initial State):**\n    *   We have an electron (mass `m_e`, charge `-e`) and a positron (mass `m_e`, charge `+e`). Let's assume they are moving along the x-axis.\n    *   The electron moves from left to right (in the +x direction) with a Lorentz factor γ_e = 4.\n    *   The positron moves from right to left (in the -x direction) with a Lorentz factor γ_p = 2.\n    *   The speed of light is `c`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total initial energy (E_i):**\n    *   The energy of a relativistic particle is given by the formula E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor and m is the rest mass.\n    *   Energy of the electron: E_e = γ_e * m_e * c² = 4 * m_e * c²\n    *   Energy of the positron: E_p = γ_p * m_e * c² = 2 * m_e * c²\n    *   The total initial energy is the sum of their individual energies:\n        E_i = E_e + E_p = 4*m_e*c² + 2*m_e*c² = 6*m_e*c²\n\n4.  **Calculate the total initial momentum (p_i):**\n    *   The momentum of a relativistic particle is given by p = √(γ² - 1) * mc.\n    *   Momentum of the electron (in the +x direction): p_e = √(4² - 1) * m_e * c = √(16 - 1) * m_e * c = √15 * m_e * c\n    *   Momentum of the positron (in the -x direction): p_p = -√(2² - 1) * m_e * c = -√(4 - 1) * m_e * c = -√3 * m_e * c\n    *   The total initial momentum is the vector sum. Since both particles move along the x-axis, we just add the components:\n        p_i_x = p_e + p_p = (√15 - √3) * m_e * c\n    *   The initial momentum in the y and z directions is zero.\n\n5.  **Define the system's state after the collision (Final State):**\n    *   The electron and positron annihilate, producing two photons.\n    *   The problem states that the two photons have the same energy. Let's call this energy E_γ.\n    *   The total final energy is E_f = E_γ + E_γ = 2E_γ.\n\n6.  **Apply the Law of Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   E_i = E_f\n    *   6 * m_e * c² = 2 * E_γ\n    *   Solving for the energy of a single photon: E_γ = 3 * m_e * c²\n\n7.  **Apply the Law of Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   The initial momentum in the y-direction is 0. Therefore, the total final momentum in the y-direction must also be 0. Since one photon goes \"upper-right\" and the other \"lower-right\", this means they must be moving at equal and opposite angles (θ and -θ) with respect to the x-axis.\n    *   The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by p = E/c.\n    *   The magnitude of the momentum of each photon is: p_γ = E_γ / c = (3 * m_e * c²) / c = 3 * m_e * c.\n    *   The total final momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of each photon's momentum:\n        p_f_x = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(-θ) = p_γ * cos(θ) + p_γ * cos(θ) = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)\n    *   Now, we set the initial x-momentum equal to the final x-momentum:\n        p_i_x = p_f_x\n        (√15 - √3) * m_e * c = 2 * p_γ * cos(θ)\n    *   Substitute the value of p_γ:\n        (√15 - √3) * m_e * c = 2 * (3 * m_e * c) * cos(θ)\n        (√15 - √3) * m_e * c = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ)\n    *   We can cancel `m_e * c` from both sides:\n        √15 - √3 = 6 * cos(θ)\n    *   So, cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\n\n8.  **Calculate the angle:**\n    *   The angle θ is the angle each photon makes with the horizontal axis.
