    "This is a two-body decay problem from a stationary particle. We will use the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum to solve it.\n\n**1. Define the initial and final states:**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A positive pion (π⁺) is at rest.\n    *   Initial energy (E_i) = Rest mass energy of the pion = m_πc² = 139.6 MeV.\n    *   Initial momentum (p_i) = 0, since it is stationary.\n\n*   **Final State:** A positive muon (μ⁺) and a neutrino (ν) are created and move in opposite directions.\n    *   Final energy (E_f) = Total energy of muon (E_μ) + Total energy of neutrino (E_ν).\n    *   Final momentum (p_f) = Momentum of muon (p_μ) + Momentum of neutrino (p_ν).\n\n**2. Apply Conservation Laws:**\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:**\n    *   p_i = p_f\n    *   0 = p_μ + p_ν\n    *   This implies p_μ = -p_ν. The muon and neutrino have equal magnitude of momentum and move in opposite directions. Let's denote the magnitude of their momentum as 'p'. So, |p_μ| = |p_ν| = p.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   E_i = E_f\n    *   m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n**3.

Solve for the Unknowns:**\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for E_μ and E_ν into the energy conservation equation:\nm_πc² = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²) + pc\n\nTo solve for 'pc', we rearrange the equation:\nm_πc² - pc = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n\nSquare both sides:\n(m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²) (pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n\nThe (pc)² terms on both sides cancel out:\n(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) = (m_μc²)²\n\nNow, isolate 'pc':\n2(m_πc²)(pc) = (m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²\npc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2(m_πc²)]\n\n**5.

    "The problem asks for the kinetic energies of the product particles, a positive muon (μ⁺) and a neutrino (ν), from the decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺).\n\n**1. Principles**\nWe will use the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Since the speeds of the particles can be relativistic, we must use the relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum:** The initial pion is at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total final momentum must also be zero. This means the muon and the neutrino fly off in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. Let this magnitude be 'p'.\n    *   p_μ = p_ν = p\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:** The total initial energy is the rest mass energy of the pion (m_πc²). This must equal the sum of the total energies of the final particles (muon and neutrino).\n    *   E_initial = E_final\n    *   m_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n\n**2. Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**\nThe total energy (E) of a particle is related to its momentum (p) and rest mass (m) by the equation:\nE² = (pc)² + (m_c²)²  or  E = √((pc)² + (m_c²)²)\n\n*   For the muon (μ⁺), which has a rest mass m_μ = 105.7 MeV/c²:\n    *   E_μ = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n\n*   For the neutrino (ν), we assume it is massless (a standard approximation in such problems), so m_ν = 0:\n    *   E_ν = √((pc)² + 0) = pc\n\n**3. Solving for Momentum**\nSubstitute the expressions for E_μ and E_ν into the energy conservation equation:\nm_πc² = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²) + pc\n\nTo solve for 'pc', we rearrange and square the equation:\nm_πc² - pc = √((pc)² + (m_μc²)²)\n(m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) + (pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)²\n\nThe (pc)² terms cancel out:\n(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)(pc) = (m_μc²)²\n\nNow, solve for 'pc':\npc = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2(m_πc²)]\n\n**4. Calculation**\nUsing the given values:\n*   m_πc² = 139.6 MeV\n*   m_μc² = 105.7 MeV\n\npc = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\npc = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / [279.2]\npc = 8315.67 / 279.2\npc ≈ 29.78 MeV\n\n**5. Finding Kinetic Energies (KE)**\nKinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy (KE = E - mc²).\n\n*   **KE of the neutrino (KE_ν):**\n    Since the neutrino is treated as massless, its entire energy is kinetic.\n    KE_ν = E_ν = pc ≈ 29.78 MeV ≈ **29.8 MeV**\n\n*   **KE of the muon (KE_μ):**\n    KE_μ = E_μ - m_μc²\n    From energy conservation, we know E_μ = m_πc² - E_ν = m_πc² - pc.\n    KE_μ = (m_πc² - pc) - m_μc²\n    KE_μ = 139.6 - 29.78 - 105.7\n    KE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV\n\nThe kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, respectively.\n\n<<<A>>>"
