    "*   **Initial State:** The system of two electrons is in a coupled angular momentum state described by the ket $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1, 2, -1>$.\n    *   $l_1=1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the first electron (since it's in a p orbital).\n    *   $l_2=1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the second electron (also in a p orbital).\n    *   $l=2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the two-electron system.\n    *   $m=-1$ is the magnetic quantum number for the total orbital angular momentum. This means the system is an eigenstate of the total z-component of angular momentum operator, $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$, with eigenvalue $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n*   **Measurement:** A measurement of the individual z-components of the orbital angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed. This measurement projects the system's state onto an eigenstate of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$. These eigenstates are the uncoupled states, denoted by $|l_1, m_{l1}; l_2, m_{l2}>$.\n\n*   **Desired Outcome:** We want to find the joint probability of obtaining the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for $L_{1z}$ and the eigenvalue $-\\hbar$ for $L_{2z}$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $m_{l1}\\hbar$. So, getting $-\\hbar$ means $m_{l1}=-1$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is $m_{l2}\\hbar$. So, getting $-\\hbar$ means $m_{l2}=-1$.\n    *   This corresponds to finding the system in the uncoupled state $|l_1=1, m_{l1}=-1; l_2=1, m_{l2}=-1>$. Let's call this the \"final state\" or \"measured state\".\n\n*   **Calculating Probability:** The probability of this outcome is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product (or projection) of the initial state onto the final state, according to Born's rule:\n    $P = |< \\text{final state} | \\text{initial state} >|^2$\n    $P = |<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1>|^2$\n\n*   **Using Conservation of Angular Momentum (z-component):**\n    A key principle in the addition of angular momentum is that the coupled state $|l, m>$ is a linear combination of uncoupled states $|m_{l1}, m_{l2}>$ only if the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers equals the total magnetic quantum number. That is, the projection $<m_{l1}, m_{l2} | l, m>$ is non-zero only if $m_{l1} + m_{l2} = m$. This is a fundamental selection rule.\n\n    1.  For the **initial state** $|1, 1, 2, -1>$, the total magnetic quantum number is $m_{initial} = -1$.\n    2.  For the **final measured state** $|1, -1; 1, -1>$, the individual magnetic quantum numbers are $m_{l1}=-1$ and $m_{l2}=-1$. The total magnetic quantum number for this state is $m_{final} = m_{l1} + m_{l2} = -1 + (-1) = -2$.\n\n    Since $m_{initial} \\neq m_{final}$ (i.e., $-1 \\neq -2$), the initial state and the final state are orthogonal. Their inner product is zero:\n    $<1, -1; 1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1> = 0$\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The probability, being the square of this inner product, is:\n    $P = |0|^2 = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is 0.\n\n<<<D>>>"
