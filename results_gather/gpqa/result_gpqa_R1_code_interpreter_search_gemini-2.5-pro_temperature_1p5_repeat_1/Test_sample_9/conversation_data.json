    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine which exoplanet has the highest density:\n\n1.  **Analyze the concept of density in planets:** A planet's density is determined by two main factors: its composition (the type of materials it's made of) and the gravitational compression from its own mass. Denser materials like iron lead to higher overall density than lighter materials like silicates or ices. For a given composition, a more massive planet will exert a stronger gravitational force, compressing its constituent materials and increasing its overall density.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Option (a): An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.**\n    *   This serves as our baseline reference.\n    *   Mass = 1 M_Earth.\n    *   Radius = 1 R_Earth.\n    *   The density is that of Earth, which is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Option (b): A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³.**\n    *   The density is explicitly given as ~5.5 g/cm³. This is very close to Earth's density.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Option (c): A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.**\n    *   **Composition:** Same as Earth (a mix of an iron core and a silicate mantle).\n    *   **Mass:** 5 M_Earth.\n    *   Because this planet is much more massive than Earth, its internal gravity will be significantly stronger. This stronger gravity will compress the iron and silicate materials much more than they are compressed inside Earth.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This increased compression means the planet's overall density will be significantly *higher* than Earth's density (> 5.51 g/cm³).\n\n5.  **Evaluate Option (d): A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.**\n    *   **Composition:** Same as Earth.\n    *   **Mass:** 0.5 M_Earth.\n    *   Since this planet is less massive than Earth, its internal gravity will be weaker. The materials will be less compressed.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This lack of compression means the planet's overall density will be *lower* than Earth's density (< 5.51 g/cm³).\n\n6.  **Compare the densities:**\n    *   (a) Density ≈ 5.51 g/cm³\n    *   (b) Density ≈ 5.5 g/cm³\n    *   (c) Density > 5.51 g/cm³ (due to high gravitational compression)\n    *   (d) Density < 5.51 g/cm³ (due to low gravitational compression)\n\nComparing the four options, the planet in option (c) is the only one that is guaranteed to have a density significantly higher than Earth's. Therefore, it has the highest density among the choices.\n\n<<<A>>>"
