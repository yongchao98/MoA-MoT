    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to identify which pair of compounds, from a given list, corresponds to the described 1H NMR spectrum of a 1:1 mixture.\n\n**2. Analyze the Provided NMR Data**\nThe spectrum of the 1:1 mixture shows:\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals. Both are singlets. Their integration ratio is 1:1.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals. All are singlets. Their integration ratio is 2:1:1.\n\n**3. Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum for Each Individual Compound**\nLet's analyze the molecular formula and structure of each option to predict its spectrum. All listed compounds have the molecular formula C10H14.\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule is highly symmetrical. There are two perpendicular planes of symmetry through the ring.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C3 and C6) are chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They have no adjacent protons. Thus, they will produce a single **singlet** corresponding to 2H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are also chemically equivalent due to symmetry. They will produce a single **singlet** corresponding to 12H.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C2 and C5 positions.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C4 and C6) are in different chemical environments. The proton at C4 is adjacent to one methyl group, while the proton at C6 is flanked by two methyl groups. They are not equivalent and will produce **two distinct signals**. Since neither has an adjacent proton, they will both be **singlets**, each corresponding to 1H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C3 are equivalent (related by the mirror plane). They give one signal (6H).\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is unique (on the mirror plane). It gives a second signal (3H).\n        *   The methyl group at C5 is unique (on the mirror plane). It gives a third signal (3H).\n        *   This results in **three alkyl singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 alkyl singlets (2:1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)**\n    *   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C1-C2 and C3-C4 bonds.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons (at C5 and C6) are chemically equivalent due to this symmetry. They will produce a single **singlet** corresponding to 2H. (While they are adjacent, their chemical equivalence in a symmetrical system simplifies the pattern to a singlet).\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:**\n        *   The methyl groups at C1 and C4 are equivalent. They give one signal (6H).\n        *   The methyl groups at C2 and C3 are equivalent. They give a second signal (6H).\n        *   This results in **two alkyl singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:6H, which simplifies to **1:1**.\n    *   **Summary:** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 2 alkyl singlets (1:1 ratio).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Symmetry:** Highly symmetrical, similar to p-xylene.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** All four aromatic protons are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single **singlet** corresponding to 4H.\n    *   **Alkyl Protons:** The two ethyl groups are equivalent. The methylene (CH2) protons will appear as a **quartet** (split by the adjacent CH3), and the methyl (CH3) protons will appear as a **triplet** (split by the adjacent CH2). The problem states all alkyl signals are singlets, so this compound can be ruled out immediately.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options based on the Mixture Spectrum**\nNow, let's combine the predicted spectra for the pairs in each option, remembering it's a 1:1 molar mixture.\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   From 1,2,4,5-TMB: 1 singlet (2H).\n        *   From 1,2,3,4-TMB: 1 singlet (2H).\n        *   Total: **Two aromatic singlets**. Since the compounds are in a 1:1 ratio and each signal represents 2H, their integration ratio will be **1:1**. This **matches** the data.\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:**\n        *   From 1,2,4,5-TMB: 1 singlet (12H).\n        *   From 1,2,3,4-TMB: 2 singlets (6H each).\n        *   Total: **Three alkyl singlets**. The integration ratio will be 12H : 6H : 6H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**. This also **matches** the data.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This option is a perfect match.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   From 1,2,4,5-TMB: 1 singlet (2H).\n        *   From 1,2,3,5-TMB: 2 singlets (1H each).\n        *   Total: **Three aromatic singlets**. This **does not match** the \"two signals\" described.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n    *   **Aromatic Signals:**\n        *   From 1,2,3,4-TMB: 1 singlet (2H).\n        *   From 1,2,3,5-TMB: 2 singlets (1H each).\n        *   Total: **Three aromatic singlets**. This **does not match** the \"two signals\" described.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**\n    *   **Alkyl Signals:** The spectrum would contain singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB and a quartet and triplet from 1,4-diethylbenzene. This **does not match** the data, which specifies only three singlets in the alkyl region.\n\n**5. Final Answer**\nThe only pair of compounds that produces the described 1H NMR spectrum when mixed in a 1:1 ratio is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
