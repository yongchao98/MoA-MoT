    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, which is `[Co(SCN)2]`, relative to the total concentration of all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\n2.  **Identify the Species:** In a solution of `Co(II)` and thiocyanate (`SCN-`), several complex species can form. The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the free `Co^2+` ion and all the complexes:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]+ + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3]- + [Co(SCN)4]2-`\n\n3.  **Use Stability Constants (β):** The overall stability constants (`βn`) relate the concentration of each complex to the concentration of the free metal ion (`[Co^2+]`) and the free ligand (`[SCN-]`).\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]+ = β1 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)2] = β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)3]- = β3 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^3`\n    *   `[Co(SCN)4]2- = β4 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^4`\n\n4.  **Formulate the Fraction:** The fraction of a specific complex, `[Co(SCN)n]^(2-n)`, is called its distribution coefficient, `αn`. We are interested in `α2` for the dithiocyanato complex `[Co(SCN)2]`.\n    `α2 = [Co(SCN)2] / c(Co)`\n\n    By substituting the expressions from step 3 into the equation for `c(Co)` from step 2, we get:\n    `c(Co) = [Co^2+] * (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4)`\n\n    Now substitute this and the expression for `[Co(SCN)2]` into the formula for `α2`:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2) / ([Co^2+] * (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4))`\n\n    The `[Co^2+]` term cancels out, leaving:\n    `α2 = (β2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1*[SCN-] + β2*[SCN-]^2 + β3*[SCN-]^3 + β4*[SCN-]^4)`\n\n5.  **Approximate Ligand Concentration:** The total cobalt concentration is `c(Co) = 10^-2 M = 0.01 M`, and the total thiocyanate concentration is `[SCN-]total = 0.1 M`. Since the ligand concentration is ten times higher than the metal ion concentration, we can make a common approximation that the free ligand concentration `[SCN-]` is nearly equal to its total concentration. This is because only a fraction of the ligand will be bound to the metal.\n    `[SCN-] ≈ [SCN-]total = 0.1 M`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Value:** Now we can plug the given values into the formula for `α2`.\n    *   `[SCN-] = 0.1 M`\n    *   `β1 = 9`\n    *   `β2 = 40`\n    *   `β3 = 63`\n    *   `β4 = 16`\n\n    First, calculate the numerator:\n    `Numerator = β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n\n    Next, calculate the terms in the denominator:\n    *   `1`\n    *   `β1 * [SCN-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9`\n    *   `β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 0.4`\n    *   `β3 * [SCN-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 0.063`\n    *   `β4 * [SCN-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 0.0016`\n\n    Sum the terms to find the denominator:\n    `Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n    Finally, calculate the fraction `α2`:\n    `α2 = Numerator / Denominator = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n7.  **Convert to Percentage:** To get the percentage, multiply the fraction by 100:\n    `Percentage = α2 * 100 = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis result matches option D. To ensure accuracy, let's verify with a Python script.\n\n```python\nbeta1 = 9\nbeta2 = 40\nbeta3 = 63\nbeta4 = 16\nscn_conc = 0.1\n\n# The formula for the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (alpha2) is:\n# alpha2 = (beta2 * [SCN-]^2) / (1 + beta1*[SCN-] + beta2*[SCN-]^2 + beta3*[SCN-]^3 + beta4*[SCN-]^4)\n\nnumerator = beta2 * scn_conc**2\ndenominator = 1 + (beta1 * scn_conc) + (beta2 * scn_conc**2) + (beta3 * scn_conc**3) + (beta4 * scn_conc**4)\n\nalpha2 = numerator / denominator\npercentage = alpha2 * 100\n\nprint(f\"The percentage of dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is: {percentage}%\")\n```\n\n>>>\nThe percentage of dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is: 16.91618032648228%\n<<<\n\nThe calculation confirms that the percentage is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The percentage of a specific complex in a solution can be determined by calculating its mole fraction (α) relative to all species containing the central metal ion. The total concentration of cobalt, `c(Co)`, is the sum of the concentrations of the free ion and all its complexes:\n\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)]⁺ + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ + [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻`\n\nThe concentration of each species can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion `[Co²⁺]`, the free thiocyanate ligand `[SCN⁻]`, and the overall stability constants (βn):\n*   `[Co(SCN)]⁺ = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₂] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻ = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n*   `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for total cobalt concentration:\n`c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nThe mole fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, `α₂`, is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration:\n`α₂ = [Co(SCN)₂] / c(Co)`\n\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n\nThe `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, leaving a formula that depends only on the free ligand concentration and the stability constants:\n`α₂ = (β₂ * [SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\nThe problem states that the total cobalt concentration (`10⁻² M`) is significantly lower than the total thiocyanate concentration (`0.1 M`). This means the concentration of the free ligand `[SCN⁻]` is approximately equal to its total concentration, so we can use `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`.\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   `[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M`\n*   `β₁ = 9`\n*   `β₂ = 40`\n*   `β₃ = 63`\n*   `β₄ = 16`\n\nCalculate the individual terms in the denominator:\n*   `β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n*   `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n*   `β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n*   `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\nCalculate the denominator (the sum of all terms, including 1 for the free `Co²⁺`):\n`Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\nThe numerator is the term for the dithiocyanato complex:\n`Numerator = β₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4`\n\nCalculate the fraction `α₂`:\n`α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\nTo express this as a percentage, multiply by 100:\n`Percentage = 0.16916 * 100 ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
