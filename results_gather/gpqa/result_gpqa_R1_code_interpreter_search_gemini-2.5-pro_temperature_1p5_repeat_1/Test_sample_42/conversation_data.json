    "This problem requires us to determine the correct IUPAC name for a complex substituted benzene molecule. We must first deduce the structure of the molecule from the description and then apply IUPAC nomenclature rules to name it.\n\n### Step 1: Deducing the Molecular Structure\n\n1.  **Parent Structure:** The presence of a carboxylic acid group on a benzene ring makes the parent compound **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom of the ring attached to the carboxylic acid (-COOH) is assigned position **1**.\n\n2.  **Relative Positions of Key Groups:** \"A carboxylic acid a carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another.\"\n    *   This means these three groups occupy positions 1, 3, and 5 relative to each other on the benzene ring.\n    *   Since the carboxylic acid is the principal functional group, it is at position 1.\n    *   Therefore, the carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl group) and the cyano group (-CN) must be at positions **3 and 5**.\n\n3.  **Positions of Other Substituents:**\n    *   \"Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino\": The ortho positions relative to C1 are C2 and C6. So, the hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) groups are at positions **2 and 6**.\n    *   \"para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group\": The para position relative to C1 is C4. So, the methoxy group (-OCH3) is at position **4**.\n\n4.  **Final Structural Clue:** \"The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile.\"\n    *   The methoxy group (-OCH3) is at C4. The ortho positions to C4 are C3 and C5. Since the nitrile (-CN) is at either C3 or C5, this condition is always met for the methoxy group.\n    *   The alcohol (hydroxyl group, -OH) is at C2 or C6. It must be ortho to the nitrile (-CN), which is at C3 or C5. Let's test the two possibilities for the nitrile's position:\n        *   **Case A: If the nitrile (-CN) is at position 3.** For the alcohol to be ortho to it, the alcohol must be at position 2 or 4. Since we know the alcohol is at C2 or C6, it **must be at C2**.\n        *   **Case B: If the nitrile (-CN) is at position 5.** For the alcohol to be ortho to it, the alcohol must be at position 4 or 6. Since we know the alcohol is at C2 or C6, it **must be at C6**.\n\n5.  **Assembling the Full Structure:**\n    *   From Case A (nitrile at C3):\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C2: -OH (hydroxy)\n        *   C3: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C5: -CHO (formyl, the other meta group)\n        *   C6: -N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino, the other ortho group)\n    *   From Case B (nitrile at C5):\n        *   C1: -COOH\n        *   C6: -OH (hydroxy)\n        *   C5: -CN (cyano)\n        *   C4: -OCH3 (methoxy)\n        *   C3: -CHO (formyl)\n        *   C2: -N(CH3)2\n    *   If you examine these two resulting structures, you will find they are identical. Structure B is just Structure A flipped horizontally. Therefore, the description points to a single, unique molecule.\n\n### Step 2: Applying IUPAC Nomenclature Rules\n\n1.  **Parent Name:** benzoic acid.\n2.  **Numbering:** The numbering starts at C1 (-COOH). We need to decide whether to number clockwise (1 -> 6 -> 5...) or counter-clockwise (1 -> 2 -> 3...). The rule is to choose the direction that gives the **lowest possible set of locants** to the substituents.\n    *   In our case, the substituents are at all other positions (2, 3, 4, 5, 6), so the locant set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} regardless of the direction.\n3.  **Tie-Breaking Rule:** When the locant sets are identical, the numbering is chosen to give the lowest possible locant to the substituent that comes **first in alphabetical order**.\n4.  **Alphabetical Order of Substituents:**\n    *   **C**yano\n    *   **D**imethylamino\n    *   **F**ormyl\n    *   **H**ydroxy\n    *   **M**ethoxy\n5.  **Comparing Numbering Directions:**\n    *   **Counter-clockwise (1 -> 2 -> 3...):** This gives the locants {2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 5-formyl, 6-dimethylamino, 4-methoxy}.\n    *   **Clockwise (1 -> 6 -> 5...):** This gives the locants {6-hydroxy, 5-cyano, 3-formyl, 2-dimethylamino, 4-methoxy}.\n    *   Let's check the locant for the first substituent in the alphabetical list, which is \"cyano\".\n        *   Counter-clockwise numbering gives **cyano** the locant **3**.\n        *   Clockwise numbering gives **cyano** the locant **5**.\n    *   Since 3 is lower than 5, the **counter-clockwise direction is correct**.\n\n6.  **Final Name Construction:** We use the locants from the counter-clockwise numbering and list the substituents in alphabetical order.\n    *   The correct locants are: 3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino, 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.\n    *   The name is constructed as: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\n### Step 3: Matching with Options\n\n*   A) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid - Incorrect locants and alphabetization.\n*   B) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - Incorrect locants (results from choosing the wrong numbering direction).\n*   C) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid - **This matches our derived name perfectly.**\n*   D) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid - This lists the substituents by number, not alphabetically, which is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct IUPAC name is given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
