    "This is a classic problem in quantum mechanics involving spin precession, also known as Larmor precession. Let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n### 1. Initial State (t < 0)\n\n*   A spin-1/2 particle has a magnetic moment **μ** = γ**S**, where **S** is the spin angular momentum operator and γ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n*   The magnetic field is initially **B** = B**k̂** (in the +Z direction).\n*   The Hamiltonian of the system is H = -**μ** ⋅ **B** = -γS_z B.\n*   The particle is \"aligned\" with the magnetic field. This means its magnetic moment **μ** points in the same direction as **B**, i.e., in the +Z direction. For this to happen, the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, ⟨μ_z⟩, must be positive.\n*   Since μ_z = γS_z, we need ⟨γS_z⟩ > 0.\n    *   For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvalues of S_z are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.\n    *   Let's assume γ is positive (like for a proton). Then we need ⟨S_z⟩ to be positive. This means the particle must be in the eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue +ħ/2. This state is commonly denoted as \"spin-up\" or |↑⟩_z.\n*   So, the initial state of the system at t=0 is |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z. In the standard basis where |↑⟩_z = [1, 0]ᵀ and |↓⟩_z = [0, 1]ᵀ, this is simply the vector [1, 0]ᵀ.\n\n### 2. The New Hamiltonian (t > 0)\n\n*   At t=0, the magnetic field is suddenly switched to **B'** = B**ĵ** (in the +Y direction).\n*   The new Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution for t > 0 is H' = -**μ** ⋅ **B'** = -γB S_y.\n*   The S_y operator in the S_z basis is given by S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].\n*   So, H' = -γB(ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].\n\n### 3. Time Evolution\n\nThe state of the system evolves according to the Schrödinger equation:\n|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-iH't/ħ) |ψ(0)⟩\n\nWe want to find the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is ⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ⟨S_z⟩(t).\n⟨S_z⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩.\n\nWe can solve this in two ways:\n\n#### Method 1: Schrödinger Picture (Evolving the state vector)\n\n1.  **Express the initial state in the eigenbasis of the new Hamiltonian H'.**\n    The eigenstates of H' are the eigenstates of S_y. They are:\n    *   |↑⟩_y = (1/√2) * [1, i]ᵀ (eigenvalue +ħ/2)\n    *   |↓⟩_y = (1/√2) * [1, -i]ᵀ (eigenvalue -ħ/2)\n\n    We express our initial state |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z = [1, 0]ᵀ as a linear combination of these eigenvectors:\n    |↑⟩_z = (1/√2)|↑⟩_y + (1/√2)|↓⟩_y.\n\n2.  **Evolve the state in time.**\n    Let ω = γB. This is the Larmor frequency. The energy eigenvalues of H' are E_± = -γB(±ħ/2) = ∓(ħω/2).\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) * exp(-iE_+t/ħ)|↑⟩_y + (1/√2) * exp(-iE_-t/ħ)|↓⟩_y\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = (1/√2) * exp(iωt/2)|↑⟩_y + (1/√2) * exp(-iωt/2)|↓⟩_y\n\n3.  **Convert back to the S_z basis to calculate ⟨S_z⟩.**\n    Using |↑⟩_y = (1/√2)(|↑⟩_z + i|↓⟩_z) and |↓⟩_y = (1/√2)(|↑⟩_z - i|↓⟩_z), we substitute back into |ψ(t)⟩. After simplification using Euler's formulas (cos(x) = (e^(ix)+e^(-ix))/2, sin(x) = (e^(ix)-e^(-ix))/2i), we get:\n    |ψ(t)⟩ = cos(ωt/2)|↑⟩_z - sin(ωt/2)|↓⟩_z.\n\n4.  **Calculate the expectation value.**\n    ⟨S_z⟩(t) = ⟨ψ(t)|S_z|ψ(t)⟩\n    With S_z|↑⟩_z = +(ħ/2)|↑⟩_z and S_z|↓⟩_z = -(ħ/2)|↓⟩_z, we find:\n    ⟨S_z⟩(t) = (cos(ωt/2) * ⟨↑|_z - sin(ωt/2) * ⟨↓|_z) * S_z * (cos(ωt/2)|↑⟩_z - sin(ωt/2)|↓⟩_z)\n    ⟨S_z⟩(t) = cos²(ωt/2) * (ħ/2) + sin²(ωt/2) * (-ħ/2)\n    ⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * (cos²(ωt/2) - sin²(ωt/2))\n    Using the trigonometric identity cos(2θ) = cos²(θ) - sin²(θ), we get:\n    ⟨S_z⟩(t) = (ħ/2) * cos(ωt)\n\n5.  **Find the oscillation frequency.**\n    The z-component of the magnetic moment is ⟨μ_z⟩(t) = γ⟨S_z⟩(t) = γ(ħ/2)cos(ωt).\n    Substituting ω = γB, we have:\n    ⟨μ_z⟩(t) = (γħ/2)cos((γB)t)\n\n    The function oscillates with an angular frequency equal to the coefficient of `t` inside the cosine, which is **γB**.\n\n#### Method 2: Heisenberg Picture (Classical Analogy)\n\nThe expectation value of the spin vector ⟨**S**⟩ obeys the classical torque equation:\nd⟨**S**⟩/dt = γ⟨**S**⟩ × **B'**\n\nIn our case, **B'** is along the y-axis, so **B'** = (0, B, 0).\nThe components of the equation are:\n*   d⟨S_x⟩/dt = γ(⟨S_y⟩B - ⟨S_z⟩*0) = -γB⟨S_z⟩ (using right-hand rule for cross product, not just magnitudes)\n*   d⟨S_y⟩/dt = γ(⟨S_z⟩*0 - ⟨S_x⟩*B) = 0\n*   d⟨S_z⟩/dt = γ(⟨S_x⟩*B - ⟨S_y⟩*0) = γB⟨S_x⟩\n\nThis describes the precession of the vector ⟨**S**⟩ around the Y-axis. To find the oscillation frequency of ⟨S_z⟩, we can solve this system.\nTake the time derivative of the third equation:\nd²⟨S_z⟩/dt² = γB * d⟨S_x⟩/dt\n\nSubstitute the first equation into this:\nd²⟨S_z⟩/dt² = γB * (-γB⟨S_z⟩) = -(γB)²⟨S_z⟩\n\nThis is the standard equation for a simple harmonic oscillator, d²x/dt² = -ω²x, where the angular frequency ω is **γB**.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The oscillation frequency is the Larmor frequency, ω = γB.\n\n<<<A>>>"
