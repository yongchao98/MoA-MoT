    "Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Concept:** The question asks about distinguishing two energy levels with given lifetimes. The connection between the lifetime of a quantum state and the precision with which its energy can be determined is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n2.  **State the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle relates the uncertainty in energy ($\\Delta E$) and the uncertainty in time ($\\Delta t$). The mathematical relationship is:\n    $\\Delta E \\cdot \\Delta t \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($\\hbar = h/2\\pi$).\n\n3.  **Apply the Principle to the Problem:**\n    *   The \"lifetime\" ($\\tau$) of a quantum state is the characteristic time it exists. This can be taken as the uncertainty in time, so $\\Delta t = \\tau$.\n    *   This lifetime implies that the energy of the state is not a perfectly sharp, single value but is \"smeared\" out over a range of energies. This \"smearing\" or \"broadening\" is the energy uncertainty, $\\Delta E$.\n    *   From the uncertainty principle, we can find the minimum energy uncertainty (or the energy width) for each state:\n        $\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau}$\n\n4.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   Lifetime of state 1: $\\tau_1 = 10^{-9}$ s.\n    *   Lifetime of state 2: $\\tau_2 = 10^{-8}$ s.\n    *   Value of the reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar \\approx 6.582 \\times 10^{-16}$ eV·s. Using this value is convenient because the options are in electron-volts (eV).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Energy Uncertainty for Each State:**\n    *   For state 1: $\\Delta E_1 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_1} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}}{10^{-9} \\text{ s}} = 6.582 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ eV}$.\n    *   For state 2: $\\Delta E_2 \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau_2} = \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}}{10^{-8} \\text{ s}} = 6.582 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ eV}$.\n\n6.  **Establish the \"Resolution\" Criterion:** To \"clearly distinguish\" or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their central energies, $|E_1 - E_2|$, must be larger than their energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller than the widths, the two smeared-out energy levels will overlap so much that they appear as a single, broader level. The resolution is limited by the state with the larger energy width (which corresponds to the shorter lifetime).\n    *   The larger energy width is $\\Delta E_1 \\approx 6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n    *   Therefore, for the levels to be resolved, the required condition is:\n        $|E_1 - E_2| > \\Delta E_1$\n        $|E_1 - E_2| > 6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n    *   A) $10^{-11}$ eV: This is much smaller than $6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV. The levels would not be resolved.\n    *   B) $10^{-8}$ eV: This is smaller than $6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV. The levels would not be resolved.\n    *   C) $10^{-4}$ eV: This is much larger than $6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV. The levels would be clearly resolved.\n    *   D) $10^{-9}$ eV: This is much smaller than $6.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV. The levels would not be resolved.\n\n8.  **Formulate the Final Answer:** The only option that provides an energy difference large enough to overcome the natural lifetime broadening of the states is C.\n\nI will use a short Python script to perform the calculations accurately and confirm the reasoning.\n\n```python\n# We use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which connects the lifetime of a state (tau)\n# to the uncertainty in its energy (Delta E). The relation is Delta E * tau >= hbar/2.\n# To resolve two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than their energy uncertainties (widths).\n# The resolution is limited by the larger of the two widths.\n\n# Constants\nhbar_eVs = 6.582119569e-16  # Reduced Planck constant in eV*s\n\n# Lifetimes of the two states\ntau1 = 1e-9  # seconds\ntau2 = 1e-8  # seconds\n\n# Calculate the minimum energy uncertainty (width) for each state using Delta E ~ hbar / tau\ndelta_E1 = hbar_eVs / tau1\ndelta_E2 = hbar_eVs / tau2\n\n# To resolve the levels, the energy difference must be larger than the largest width.\n# The largest width corresponds to the shortest lifetime.\nrequired_energy_separation = max(delta_E1, delta_E2)\n\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 1 (Delta E1): {delta_E1:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"Energy width of state 2 (Delta E2): {delta_E2:.4e} eV\")\nprint(f\"To be clearly resolved, the energy difference must be greater than: {required_energy_separation:.4e} eV\")\n\n# Checking the options against this requirement\noptions = {\n    \"A\": 1e-11,\n    \"B\": 1e-8,\n    \"C\": 1e-4,\n    \"D\": 1e-9\n}\n\nprint(\"\\nEvaluating options:\")\nfor option_label, energy_diff in options.items():\n    if energy_diff > required_energy_separation:\n        print(f\"Option {option_label} ({energy_diff:.1e} eV) is a valid energy difference for resolution.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Option {option_label} ({energy_diff:.1e} eV) is NOT a valid energy difference for resolution.\")\n```\n\n<<<C>>>",
    "The problem revolves around the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, specifically the energy-time uncertainty relation:\n\n$\\Delta E \\cdot \\Delta t \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n\nHere, $\\Delta E$ is the uncertainty in the energy of a quantum state, and $\\Delta t$ is the uncertainty in time, which can be taken as the lifetime ($\\tau$) of the state. $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nThis principle implies that a state with a finite lifetime does not have a perfectly defined energy. Instead, its energy is \"smeared\" out over a range of width $\\Delta E$. This is often called \"lifetime broadening\" or \"natural broadening\". The minimum energy width is given by:\n\n$\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{\\hbar}{\\tau}$\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the energy width for each state.**\n\nWe are given:\n*   Lifetime of state 1, $\\tau_1 = 10^{-9}$ s\n*   Lifetime of state 2, $\\tau_2 = 10^{-8}$ s\n*   Reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar \\approx 6.582 \\times 10^{-16}$ eV·s\n\nThe energy width for state 1 is:\n$\\Delta E_1 \\approx \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}}{10^{-9} \\text{ s}} \\approx 6.58 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV\n\nThe energy width for state 2 is:\n$\\Delta E_2 \\approx \\frac{6.582 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ eV·s}}{10^{-8} \\text{ s}} \\approx 6.58 \\times 10^{-8}$ eV\n\n**Step 2: Determine the condition for resolving the two energy levels.**\n\nTo clearly distinguish or \"resolve\" two energy levels, the difference in their energies ($|E_1 - E_2|$) must be significantly larger than their individual energy widths. If the energy difference is smaller than the widths, the two smeared energy profiles will overlap to such an extent that they cannot be told apart.\n\nThe resolution is limited by the state with the *larger* energy width, which corresponds to the *shorter* lifetime. In this case, the larger energy width is $\\Delta E_1 \\approx 6.58 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n\nTherefore, the condition to resolve the two levels is:\n$|E_1 - E_2| > \\Delta E_1 \\approx 6.58 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV\n\n**Step 3: Compare the given options with the required condition.**\n\nWe need to find the option that is greater than $6.58 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n\n*   A) $10^{-11}$ eV is much smaller than $6.58 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n*   B) $10^{-8}$ eV is smaller than $6.58 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n*   C) $10^{-4}$ eV is much larger than $6.58 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n*   D) $10^{-9}$ eV is much smaller than $6.58 \\times 10^{-7}$ eV.\n\nOnly option C provides an energy difference large enough to clearly resolve the two states, as it is several orders of magnitude greater than the largest energy width.\n\n<<<C>>>"
