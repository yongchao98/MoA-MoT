    "This question asks for the threshold energy of a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) that can interact with a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon ($\\gamma_{CMB}$) to produce an electron-positron pair ($e^{-}e^{+}$). The reaction is:\n$\\gamma + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-}$\n\nTo solve this, we will use the principle of conservation of four-momentum and the concept of invariant mass.\n\n1.  **Four-Momentum and Invariant Mass**\n    Let the four-momentum of the high-energy gamma-ray be $p_{\\gamma} = (E_{\\gamma}/c, \\vec{p}_{\\gamma})$ and for the CMB photon be $p_{CMB} = (E_{CMB}/c, \\vec{p}_{CMB})$. For a photon, its rest mass is zero, so the magnitude of its 3-momentum is $|\\vec{p}| = E/c$. We will work in natural units where $c=1$, so the four-momentum is $p=(E, \\vec{p})$ and $|\\vec{p}|=E$.\n\n    The total four-momentum of the system before the collision is $P_{in} = p_{\\gamma} + p_{CMB}$.\n    The total four-momentum after the collision is $P_{out} = p_{e^+} + p_{e^-}$.\n    Conservation of four-momentum implies $P_{in} = P_{out}$.\n\n    The square of the total four-momentum, known as the Mandelstam variable $s$ (or invariant mass squared), is a Lorentz invariant. Therefore, $s = P_{in}^2 = P_{out}^2$.\n\n2.  **Calculating the Invariant Mass**\n    Let's calculate $s$ for the initial state (the two photons):\n    $s = (p_{\\gamma} + p_{CMB})^2 = p_{\\gamma}^2 + p_{CMB}^2 + 2 p_{\\gamma} \\cdot p_{CMB}$\n    Since photons are massless, their four-momentum squared is zero: $p_{\\gamma}^2 = 0$ and $p_{CMB}^2 = 0$.\n    The dot product is $p_{\\gamma} \\cdot p_{CMB} = E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} - \\vec{p}_{\\gamma} \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB}$.\n    $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma} \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB} = |\\vec{p}_{\\gamma}||\\vec{p}_{CMB}|\\cos\\theta = E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}\\cos\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the directions of the two photons.\n    So, $s = 2(E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} - E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}\\cos\\theta) = 2E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1-\\cos\\theta)$.\n\n3.  **Threshold Condition**\n    The threshold energy is the minimum energy required for the reaction to occur. This minimum corresponds to the case where the final products (electron and positron) are created at rest in the center-of-momentum frame.\n    In this case, the total energy in the center-of-momentum frame is just the sum of the rest energies of the electron and positron. The rest energy of an electron is $m_e c^2$, and a positron has the same rest energy.\n    So, the minimum energy in the center-of-momentum frame is $\\sqrt{s}_{min} = m_e c^2 + m_e c^2 = 2m_e c^2$.\n    Squaring this gives the invariant mass at the threshold: $s_{min} = (2m_e c^2)^2 = 4(m_e c^2)^2$.\n\n4.  **Finding the Threshold Energy**\n    To find the minimum possible energy $E_{\\gamma}$ for the reaction, we need to maximize the center-of-mass energy for a given $E_{\\gamma}$. This occurs when the term $(1-\\cos\\theta)$ is maximized. The maximum value is $1 - (-1) = 2$, which happens when $\\cos\\theta = -1$, i.e., $\\theta = \\pi$ (180 degrees). This corresponds to a head-on collision.\n\n    Now we equate the two expressions for $s$ at the threshold condition:\n    $s = 2E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}(1 - (-1)) = 4E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB}$\n    $s = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n\n    Setting them equal:\n    $4E_{\\gamma}E_{CMB} = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n    $E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n5.  **Numerical Calculation**\n    We are given the following values:\n    *   Average CMB photon energy, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n    *   The rest energy of an electron, $m_e c^2$, is a well-known physical constant, approximately $0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n\n    Now, we substitute these values into the formula:\n    $E_{\\gamma} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n    We can perform this calculation using Python.\n```python\n# Constants\nm_e_c2_in_MeV = 0.511  # Rest energy of an electron in MeV\nm_e_c2_in_eV = m_e_c2_in_MeV * 1e6  # Convert to eV\nE_CMB_in_eV = 1e-3  # Average energy of a CMB photon in eV\n\n# Calculate the threshold gamma-ray energy in eV\nE_gamma_in_eV = (m_e_c2_in_eV**2) / E_CMB_in_eV\n\n# Convert the result to Giga-electron-volts (GeV)\n# 1 GeV = 1e9 eV\nE_gamma_in_GeV = E_gamma_in_eV / 1e9\n\nprint(f\"The threshold energy is {E_gamma_in_GeV:.2f} GeV\")\n# To express in scientific notation like the options\nprint(f\"The threshold energy is {E_gamma_in_GeV / 1e5:.1f} * 1e5 GeV\")\n```\n<execution_outputs>\nThe threshold energy is 261121.00 GeV\nThe threshold energy is 2.6 * 1e5 GeV\n</execution_outputs>\nThe calculation shows that the threshold energy for the high-energy gamma-ray is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV.
