    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to completely inactivate the gene responsible for synthesizing the anti-nutritional compound. This requires a \"knockout\" or \"null\" mutation, which results in a non-functional protein.\n\n2.  **Types of Mutations and their Effects:**\n    *   **Silent (Synonymous) Mutation:** A change in the DNA sequence that does not change the amino acid sequence of the protein. This usually has no effect on the protein's function.\n    *   **Missense (Non-synonymous) Mutation:** A change in the DNA that results in a different amino acid being incorporated into the protein. The effect can range from negligible to a complete loss of function, depending on the importance of the specific amino acid that was changed. It does not guarantee inactivation.\n    *   **Nonsense Mutation:** A change in the DNA that creates a premature STOP codon. This causes protein synthesis to halt, resulting in a truncated (shortened) and almost always non-functional protein. This is a very effective way to knock out a gene.\n    *   **Frameshift Mutation (Insertion/Deletion):** The insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not a multiple of three. This shifts the \"reading frame\" of the codons, causing all downstream amino acids to be incorrect. This usually creates a premature stop codon soon after the mutation and results in a completely non-functional protein. This is also a very effective way to knock out a gene.\n    *   **In-frame Deletion/Insertion:** The insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is a multiple of three (e.g., deleting one whole codon). This removes or adds one or more amino acids, but the rest of the protein sequence remains correct. Like a missense mutation, its effect depends on the importance of the altered region. It does not guarantee inactivation.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Each Mutant:** We need to translate the DNA sequence into its amino acid sequence for the intact gene and each mutant to see the effect. The reading frame starts with the `ATG` start codon.\n\n    *   **Intact Gene:**\n        *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...`\n        *   Protein: Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - ...\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:**\n        *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT...`\n        *   Comparison to Intact:\n            *   `TTT` -> `TTC` (Both code for Phenylalanine, Phe). This is a **silent** mutation.\n            *   `CTC` (Leucine) -> `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense** mutation.\n        *   Effect: The protein will have one amino acid changed. It might still be functional. This is not the most probable way to eliminate the compound.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        *   DNA: `5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...`\n        *   Comparison to Intact:\n            *   `TTT` -> `TTC` (Silent mutation).\n            *   `CTC` (Leucine) -> `TAA` (**STOP codon**). This is a **nonsense** mutation.\n        *   Effect: The ribosome will stop translation after the second amino acid. The resulting product would be a tiny dipeptide (Met-Phe), which will be non-functional. This is highly probable to eliminate the compound.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        *   A close comparison of the intact sequence and Mutant 3's sequence reveals a difference in length and a scramble of characters, which is characteristic of a **frameshift mutation** (caused by an insertion or deletion of bases not in a multiple of 3). A frameshift completely alters the protein sequence from the point of mutation onwards and is very likely to introduce a premature stop codon, leading to a non-functional protein. This is also a strong candidate.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        *   A close comparison reveals a deletion of three base pairs (`GGT`) and other changes. Assuming the primary intended mutation is the deletion of a whole codon, this represents an **in-frame deletion**. One amino acid (Glycine) would be missing from the protein. While this could be detrimental, the protein might retain some or all of its function if that specific amino acid is not critical. This is less certain to cause a complete knockout than a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** We are looking for the mutation that will *most probably* eliminate the compound.\n    *   Mutant 1 (missense) and Mutant 4 (in-frame deletion) are less likely to cause a complete loss of function.\n    *   Mutant 2 (nonsense) and Mutant 3 (frameshift) are both highly effective at knocking out gene function.\n    *   However, the sequence for **Mutant 2** provides the most clear and unambiguous example of a knockout mutation. The introduction of a premature stop codon (`TAA`) at the third position of the coding sequence guarantees the production of a severely truncated and non-functional protein.\n\nTherefore, Mutant 2 is the most probable choice to achieve the desired outcome.\n\n<<<B>>>"
