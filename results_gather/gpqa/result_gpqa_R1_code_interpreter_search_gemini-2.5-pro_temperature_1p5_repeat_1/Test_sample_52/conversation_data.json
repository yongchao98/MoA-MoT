    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound from the given spectroscopic data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Spectroscopic Information**\n\n*   **Compound Type:** Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. This tells us the core structure is a benzene ring with two substituents, which can be represented as a C6H4 group.\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** Shows an ester group (-COO-). This accounts for the two oxygen atoms in all the proposed formulas. An ester group also contains a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **1H NMR Spectrum Breakdown:**\n    *   **No –CH2 groups:** This is a crucial constraint. It rules out groups like ethyl (-CH2CH3), propyl (-CH2CH2CH3), etc.\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 aromatic protons (C6**H4**). Two signals for these 4 protons typically indicate a para-substitution pattern with two different substituents, resulting in two doublets (an AA'BB' system). This fragment accounts for **C6** and **H4**.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This is a classic pattern for a propenyl group (`-CH=CH-CH3`).\n        *   Let's label the protons: `(A)H-C=C(B)-CH3`.\n        *   Proton (A) is adjacent to only proton (B), so its signal would be a **doublet (d)**.\n        *   Proton (B) is adjacent to proton (A) (1H) and the methyl group (3H). According to the n+1 rule, it will be split into a doublet by proton (A) and a quartet by the -CH3 group. This results in a **doublet of quartets (dq)**.\n        *   This fragment is `-CH=CH-CH3` and accounts for **C3** and **H5** (1 vinyl-H + 1 vinyl-H + 3 methyl-H).\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:**\n        *   One of these signals corresponds to the methyl group in the propenyl fragment (`-CH=CH-CH3`). This would be a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent vinyl proton.\n        *   The second -CH3 signal must come from the other part of the molecule. Since there are no -CH2- groups, this methyl group is likely part of the ester, forming a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`) or an acetate group (`-O-CO-CH3`). In either case, this fragment adds a **-CH3** group, accounting for **H3**.\n\n**2. Assemble the Fragments and Calculate the Formula**\n\nLet's sum up the atoms from the fragments we have deduced:\n\n*   **From the aromatic ring:** C6H4\n*   **From the vinyl and first methyl groups:** A propenyl group, `-CH=CH-CH3`. This has C3H5.\n*   **From the ester and the second methyl group:** We need an ester (`-COO-`) and a methyl group (`-CH3`). The most logical combinations that don't introduce a CH2 group are a methyl carboxylate (`-COOCH3`) or an acetoxy group (`-O-CO-CH3`).\n    *   If the substituent is `-COOCH3`, it contributes C2H3O2.\n    *   If the substituent is `-O-CO-CH3`, it contributes C2H3O2.\n\nLet's build a complete molecule. The two substituents on the C6H4 ring must be the propenyl group and the ester-containing group.\n\n*   **Structure 1:** `(propenyl group)`-C6H4-`(methyl carboxylate group)` -> `CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-COOCH3`\n*   **Structure 2:** `(propenyl group)`-C6H4-`(acetoxy group)` -> `CH3-CH=CH-C6H4-O-CO-CH3`\n\nNow, let's calculate the total molecular formula for either of these possible structures:\n\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 2 (from C2H3O2 ester/acetate part) = **11 carbons**.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5 propenyl) + 3 (from C2H3O2 ester/acetate part) = **12 hydrogens**.\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 (from the ester group) = **2 oxygens**.\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n**3. Compare with the Options**\n\nThe calculated formula is C11H12O2. Let's compare this with the given choices:\nA) C12H14O2\nB) C12H12O2\nC) C11H12O2\nD) C11H14O2\n\nOur derived formula matches option C.\n\nTo be certain, we can quickly re-check the hydrogen and carbon counts from the NMR data alone:\n*   **Total Hydrogens:** 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 3 (methyl 1) + 3 (methyl 2) = 12 H. This eliminates options A (14 H) and D (14 H).\n*   **Total Carbons:** 6 (aromatic ring) + 2 (vinyl C=C) + 1 (methyl C) + 1 (second methyl C) + 1 (ester C=O) = 11 C. This eliminates option B (12 C).\n\nBoth methods of analysis consistently lead to the same formula.\n\n<<<C>>>"
