    "This problem describes the reaction of an aryl halide, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, with a very strong base, sodium amide (NaNH2), in liquid ammonia. This is a classic example of an elimination-addition reaction that proceeds via a benzyne intermediate.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction mechanism to determine all possible products:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Benzyne Intermediate (Elimination)**\n\nThe amide ion (:NH2-), being a strong base, abstracts an acidic proton from a carbon atom ortho to the bromine atom. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such positions:\n*   C-6, which has a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   C-2, which has a deuterium atom (d).\n\nThe C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond. Due to this kinetic isotope effect (KIE), the abstraction of the proton from C-6 is faster than the abstraction of the deuteron from C-2. However, both reactions are possible and will occur, leading to two different benzyne intermediates.\n\n*   **Pathway A: Abstraction of H from C-6**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the proton (H+) from C-6.\n    2.  This creates a carbanion at C-6.\n    3.  The carbanion intermediate rapidly eliminates the bromide ion (Br-) from the adjacent C-1 position.\n    4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-6. The deuterium atom at C-2 is unaffected. This intermediate is **3-deuteriobenzyne**.\n\n*   **Pathway B: Abstraction of D from C-2**\n    1.  The amide ion removes the deuteron (D+) from C-2.\n    2.  This creates a carbanion at C-2.\n    3.  This intermediate eliminates the bromide ion (Br-) from C-1.\n    4.  This forms a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between C-1 and C-2. Importantly, since the deuterium atom was abstracted, this benzyne intermediate is **unlabeled benzyne** (it contains no deuterium).\n\nSo, we have two distinct benzyne intermediates forming concurrently: 3-deuteriobenzyne and unlabeled benzyne.\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack on the Benzyne Intermediates (Addition)**\n\nThe nucleophile, which is also the amide ion (:NH2-), attacks the highly reactive triple bond of the benzyne intermediates. The resulting carbanion is then protonated by the solvent (ammonia, NH3).\n\n*   **Products from 3-deuteriobenzyne (from Pathway A)**\n    The amide ion can attack either of the two carbons of the triple bond (C-1 or C-6).\n    1.  **Attack at C-1:** The -NH2 group attaches to C-1, creating a carbanion at C-6. Protonation of C-6 yields **2-deuterioaniline** (the -NH2 group is at C-1 and the deuterium is at C-2).\n    2.  **Attack at C-6:** The -NH2 group attaches to C-6, creating a carbanion at C-1. Protonation of C-1 yields **3-deuterioaniline** (the -NH2 group is at C-6 and the deuterium is at C-2, which are meta to each other).\n\n*   **Products from unlabeled benzyne (from Pathway B)**\n    The amide ion attacks the symmetric benzyne. Attack at C-1 or C-2 leads to the same carbanion, which is then protonated by the solvent. Since this intermediate has no deuterium, the final product is **aniline** (C6H5NH2).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy considering all possible pathways, we find three distinct organic products are formed:\n1.  **Aniline** (from the D-abstraction pathway)\n2.  **2-deuterioaniline** (from the H-abstraction pathway)\n3.  **3-deuterioaniline** (from the H-abstraction pathway)\n\nTherefore, there are 3 possible organic products in this reaction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
