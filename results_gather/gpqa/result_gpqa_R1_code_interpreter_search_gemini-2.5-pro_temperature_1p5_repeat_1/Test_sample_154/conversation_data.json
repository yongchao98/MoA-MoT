    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to calculate the uncertainty in the measurement of the observable $P_z$, denoted as $\\Delta P_z$, for a system in a given quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula for Uncertainty:** The uncertainty of an operator A is defined by the standard deviation of its measurements, given by the formula:\n    $(\\Delta A)^2 = \\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2$\n    where $\\langle A \\rangle$ is the expectation value of A, and $\\langle A^2 \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A^2$.\n    For this problem, the formula is:\n    $(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2$\n\n3.  **Define the Given Quantities:**\n    *   The matrix for the operator $P_z$ is:\n        $P_z = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   The state of the system is given by the column vector (ket):\n        $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   To calculate expectation values, we also need the corresponding row vector (bra), which is the conjugate transpose of the ket. Since all components are real, it's just the transpose:\n        $\\langle\\psi| = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$:**\n    The expectation value is calculated as $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z|\\psi\\rangle$.\n    First, let's compute the action of the operator $P_z$ on the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (0)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(-1/2) + (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) + (-1)(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    Now, we compute the inner product with $\\langle\\psi|$:\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(1/2) \\right)$\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left( 1/4 + 0 - 1/4 \\right) = 0$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$:**\n    First, we need the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$.\n    $P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & (-1)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    Now, we calculate the expectation value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle\\psi|P_z^2|\\psi\\rangle$.\n    $P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    Now, we compute the inner product with $\\langle\\psi|$:\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-1/2) \\right)$\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left( 1/4 + 0 + 1/4 \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$:**\n    Now we substitute the calculated expectation values into the uncertainty formula:\n    $(\\Delta P_z)^2 = \\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n    Finally, we take the square root to find the uncertainty:\n    $\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated result $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$ matches option C.\n\nTo double-check the calculations, we can use Python.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define constants\n# Let's use hbar = 1 for calculation and add it back at the end.\nhbar = 1\n\n# Define the operator Pz and the state vector psi\nPz = hbar * np.array([\n    [1, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, -1]\n])\n\npsi = np.array([\n    [-1/2],\n    [1/np.sqrt(2)],\n    [-1/2]\n])\n\n# Get the conjugate transpose of psi\npsi_dagger = psi.conj().T\n\n# Calculate the expectation value of Pz\n# <Pz> = psi_dagger * Pz * psi\nexp_Pz = psi_dagger @ Pz @ psi\nexp_Pz_val = exp_Pz[0, 0]\n\n# Calculate the operator Pz^2\nPz_squared = Pz @ Pz\n\n# Calculate the expectation value of Pz^2\n# <Pz^2> = psi_dagger * Pz^2 * psi\nexp_Pz_squared = psi_dagger @ Pz_squared @ psi\nexp_Pz_squared_val = exp_Pz_squared[0, 0]\n\n# Calculate the variance (Delta Pz)^2\nvariance_Pz = exp_Pz_squared_val - (exp_Pz_val)**2\n\n# Calculate the uncertainty Delta Pz (standard deviation)\nuncertainty_Pz = np.sqrt(variance_Pz)\n\nprint(f\"Expectation value <Pz> = {exp_Pz_val} * hbar\")\nprint(f\"Expectation value <Pz^2> = {exp_Pz_squared_val} * hbar^2\")\nprint(f\"Variance (Delta Pz)^2 = {variance_Pz} * hbar^2\")\nprint(f\"Uncertainty Delta Pz = {uncertainty_Pz} * hbar\")\n# Compare with 1/sqrt(2)\nprint(f\"Value of 1/sqrt(2) is approximately {1/np.sqrt(2)}\")\n```\n<execute_result>\nExpectation value <Pz> = 0.0 * hbar\nExpectation value <Pz^2> = 0.5 * hbar^2\nVariance (Delta Pz)^2 = 0.5 * hbar^2\nUncertainty Delta Pz = 0.7071067811865476 * hbar\nValue of 1/sqrt(2) is approximately 0.7071067811865476\n</execute_result>\n\nThe code output confirms that the uncertainty is $\\sqrt{0.5} \\times \\hbar = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\hbar = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\n<<<C>>>",
