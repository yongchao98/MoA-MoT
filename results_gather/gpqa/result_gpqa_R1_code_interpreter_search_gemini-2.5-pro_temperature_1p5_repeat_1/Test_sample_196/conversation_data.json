    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of compound X from the spectroscopic data.**\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   The broad absorption in the range of **3400–2500 cm-1** is a classic signature for the O-H stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid dimer.\n    *   The strong absorption at **1720 cm-1** is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretching of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The absorptions at **1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1** are indicative of C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Conclusion from IR:** Compound X contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A broad singlet for one proton far downfield is a definitive signal for the acidic proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). This confirms the IR data.\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm), each integrating to two protons, strongly suggests a para-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield doublet at 8.0 ppm corresponds to the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm corresponds to the protons meta to the -COOH group (and ortho to the other substituent).\n    *   **Alkyl side-chain analysis:** We need to assemble the structure of the alkyl group from the remaining signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) next to a methine group (-CH-).\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for 2H corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-). It is adjacent to the methyl group at 0.9 ppm and the methine proton at 2.9 ppm.\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for 1H corresponds to the methine group (-CH-). This proton is attached directly to the benzene ring (benzylic position), which explains its relatively downfield shift. It is adjacent to the methyl group at 1.4 ppm and the methylene group at 1.7 ppm.\n    *   **Assembling the alkyl group:** Based on the splitting patterns, the fragments are -CH₂CH₃ and -CH(CH₃)-. The benzylic carbon is the -CH-. Therefore, the full alkyl group is -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃), which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n*   **Structure of Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the reaction and predict the final product.**\n\n*   **Reagents:** The reaction is carried out with **red phosphorus and hydroiodic acid (HI)**.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents (Red P / HI) is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to completely reduce a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) to a methyl group (-CH₃). It will also reduce alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones to alkanes, but the alkyl sec-butyl group is already an alkane chain and will not be affected.\n*   **Transformation:** The carboxylic acid group on the benzene ring of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid will be reduced to a methyl group.\n    *   Starting Material (Compound X): 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   Product: 4-(sec-butyl)-1-methylbenzene (also known as 4-sec-butyltoluene)\n\n**Step 3: Compare the predicted product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid - Incorrect structure and is still an acid.\n*   B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid - This is the starting material, compound X, not the final product.\n*   C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene - Incorrect. The side chain is sec-butyl, not isobutyl.\n*   D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene - This matches our predicted final product.\n\n<<<D>>>"
