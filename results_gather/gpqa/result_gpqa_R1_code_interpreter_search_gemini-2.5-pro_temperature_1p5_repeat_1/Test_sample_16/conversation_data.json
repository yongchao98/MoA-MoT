    "The user wants to find the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], in a solution of Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n1.  **Chemical Reaction:** The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is an equilibrium process. The complex dissociates into calcium ions (Ca²⁺) and the EDTA ligand (represented as Y⁴⁻ for simplicity, as the problem states an ideal pH where EDTA is fully deprotonated).\n    [CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Constant:** The question provides the formation constant (K_f or K_Ca-EDTA), which is for the reverse reaction (formation of the complex).\n    Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻\n    K_f = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n3.  **ICE Table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium):** We can set up an ICE table to determine the equilibrium concentrations. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that forms from the dissociation of the complex.\n    *   **Reaction:**         [CaY]²⁻     ⇌     Ca²⁺     +     Y⁴⁻\n    *   **Initial (I):**      0.02 M             0 M           0 M\n    *   **Change (C):**        -x                +x            +x\n    *   **Equilibrium (E):**  0.02 - x             x             x\n\n4.  **Calculation:** Now, we plug the equilibrium concentrations into the formation constant expression.\n    K_f = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n    5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\n5.  **Assumption:** Because the formation constant (K_f) is very large, the equilibrium lies far to the left. This means the dissociation is minimal, and the value of 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of the complex (0.02 M). Therefore, we can make the simplifying assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n    5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n\n6.  **Solve for x:**\n    *   Rearrange the equation to solve for x²:\n        x² = 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    *   Calculate the value:\n        x² = 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    *   Take the square root to find x:\n        x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\n        x ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n7.  **Final Concentration:** The value of 'x' represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ ions.\n    [Ca²⁺] = x ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThis matches option D.\n\nLet's verify the calculation with a script.\n```python\nimport math\n\nK_f = 5e10\ninitial_complex_conc = 0.02\n\n# We are solving the equation: K_f = (initial_conc - x) / x^2\n# Using the approximation: K_f = initial_conc / x^2\nx_squared = initial_complex_conc / K_f\nx = math.sqrt(x_squared)\n\nprint(f\"{x:.2e}\")\n```\n<<<D>>>",
    "**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Reaction:** The problem involves the equilibrium of the calcium-EDTA complex ([CaY]²⁻, where Y⁴⁻ represents the fully deprotonated EDTA anion). The complex is in solution, and we want to find the concentration of free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) that have dissociated from the complex. The dissociation reaction is the reverse of the formation reaction.\n    *   Formation: Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻ ⇌ [CaY]²⁻\n    *   Dissociation: [CaY]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + Y⁴⁻\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Initial stoichiometric concentration of the complex, [[CaY]²⁻]initial = 0.02 M.\n    *   Formation constant (also called stability constant), K_f or K_Ca-EDTA = 5 x 10¹⁰.\n    *   The problem specifies \"ideal pH,\" which means we can assume EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form (Y⁴⁻) and we don't need to consider side-reaction coefficients for H⁺.\n\n3.  **Set up the Equilibrium Expression:** The formation constant K_f is defined for the formation reaction:\n    K_f = [[CaY]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻])\n\n4.  **Use an ICE Table:** To find the equilibrium concentrations, we can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table for the dissociation reaction. Let 'x' be the concentration of the complex that dissociates.\n\n| Species         | [CaY]²⁻    | Ca²⁺ | Y⁴⁻  |\n|-----------------|------------|------|------|\n| **I**nitial (M)   | 0.02       | 0    | 0    |\n| **C**hange (M)    | -x         | +x   | +x   |\n| **E**quilibrium (M)| 0.02 - x   | x    | x    |\n\n5.  **Substitute into the K_f Expression:** Now we plug the equilibrium concentrations into the expression for the formation constant:\n    5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / (x * x)\n    5 x 10¹⁰ = (0.02 - x) / x²\n\n6.  **Apply a Simplification:** The value of K_f is extremely large (5 x 10¹⁰), which indicates that the equilibrium lies very far to the left (favoring the complex). This means that only a tiny amount of the complex will dissociate, so 'x' will be very small compared to the initial concentration of 0.02 M. We can therefore make the assumption that (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n\n7.  **Solve for x:**\n    *   The simplified equation is: 5 x 10¹⁰ ≈ 0.02 / x²\n    *   Rearrange to solve for x²: x² ≈ 0.02 / (5 x 10¹⁰)\n    *   Calculate x²: x² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\n    *   Take the square root to find x: x = √(4 x 10⁻¹³) = 2 x 10⁻⁶.⁵ ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n8.  **Final Result:** The variable 'x' represents the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ ions.\n    *   [Ca²⁺] = x ≈ 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n9.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   A) 5.0x10⁻³ M\n    *   B) 1.0x10⁻² M\n    *   C) 2.0x10⁻² M\n    *   D) 6.3x10⁻⁷ M\n\n    Our calculated value matches option D. The python code output of `6.32e-07` confirms this calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
