    "This problem is an application of the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   The **Galaxy's frame of reference** is the \"stationary\" frame.\n    *   The **ejecta's frame of reference** is the \"moving\" frame.\n\n2.  **Identify the Given Values:**\n    *   Velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (this is the proper time), `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n    *   The speed of light, `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance `d` the ejecta travels as measured by an observer in the Galaxy's reference frame.\n\n4.  **Apply the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   To find the distance in the Galaxy's frame, we need the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`).\n    *   According to the theory of special relativity, a moving clock runs slower as observed from a stationary frame. This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n    *   The relationship between the time in the stationary frame (`Δt`) and the proper time in the moving frame (`Δt₀`) is given by the time dilation formula:\n        `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    *   Where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) `\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   First, calculate the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light, `β = v/c`:\n        `β = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Time Elapsed in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   `Δt = γ * Δt₀ = (1 / sqrt(0.96)) * 50 s`\n    *   Since `sqrt(0.96)` is slightly less than 1, `1 / sqrt(0.96)` will be slightly greater than 1. This means `Δt` will be slightly longer than `50 s`, which is consistent with time dilation.\n    *   `Δt ≈ (1 / 0.9798) * 50 s ≈ 51.03 s`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\n    *   The distance is the velocity multiplied by the time measured in the same frame.\n    *   `d = v * Δt`\n    *   `d = 60,000 km/s * (50 s / sqrt(0.96))`\n    *   `d = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96) km`\n    *   Using the output from the code execution, which calculated this precise value:\n        `d = 3,061,862 km`\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 3,000,000 km (This would be the answer in a non-relativistic scenario, `60,000 * 50`)\n    *   B) 2,880,000 km\n    *   C) 3,060,000 km\n    *   D) 2,940,000 km\n\nThe calculated distance of `3,061,862 km` is closest to option C, `3,060,000 km`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
