    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Process:** The problem describes a decay from the hydrogen atom state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to the state $|1,0,0\\rangle$. It explicitly states that this occurs via \"two dipole transition\", which implies a cascade decay involving an intermediate state. The process is:\n    $|3,0,0\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{dipole transition 1}} |n',l',m'\\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{dipole transition 2}} |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n2.  **Determine the Intermediate State using Selection Rules:** We apply the selection rules for electric dipole (E1) transitions to find the allowed intermediate state(s) $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n    The selection rules are:\n    *   $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n    *   $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n    *   The principal quantum number $n$ must decrease for a decay process ($\\Delta n$ can be any integer).\n\n    *   **First Transition:** From $|n_i, l_i, m_i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to $|n',l',m'\\rangle$.\n        *   $\\Delta l = l' - l_i = l' - 0 = \\pm 1 \\implies l' = 1$.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m' - m_i = m' - 0 = 0, \\pm 1 \\implies m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$.\n        *   Since this is a decay, $n' < n_i = 3$. Also, for a given $n'$, we must have $l' < n'$. Since $l'=1$, the smallest possible $n'$ is 2. So, $n'$ must be 2.\n        *   Therefore, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n    *   **Second Transition:** From an intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ to the final state $|n_f, l_f, m_f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$.\n        *   $\\Delta l = l_f - l' = 0 - 1 = -1$. This satisfies the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule.\n        *   $\\Delta m = m_f - m' = 0 - m'$. This is allowed if $m' \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, which is true for all our possible intermediate states.\n        *   $\\Delta n = 1 - 2 = -1$. This is also an allowed decay.\n    *   **Conclusion on Routes:** All three intermediate states provide a valid decay path. The three possible routes are:\n        1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n        The options A, B, and D all list valid routes. To distinguish between them, we must calculate the associated probabilities.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Transition Probability (Branching Ratio):**\n    The question asks for the probability of a specific route. In a cascade decay, this is determined by the branching ratio of the first transition. The atom in the initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ has three possible decay channels to the $n=2$ level. The probability of following a specific channel is the ratio of the partial decay rate for that channel to the total decay rate.\n\n    Branching Ratio for channel $m'$ = $\\frac{\\text{Rate}(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m'\\rangle)}{\\sum_{m''=-1,0,1} \\text{Rate}(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,m''\\rangle)}$\n\n    The spontaneous emission rate (Einstein A coefficient) is proportional to the square of the dipole transition matrix element:\n    Rate $\\propto |\\langle n_f, l_f, m_f | e\\mathbf{r} | n_i, l_i, m_i \\rangle|^2$\n\n    We need to calculate this for the first transition: $|\\langle 2,1,m' | e\\mathbf{r} | 3,0,0 \\rangle|^2$.\n    *   The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (it's an s-state, with $l=0$).\n    *   The final states $|2,1,m'\\rangle$ are degenerate in energy in the non-relativistic H-atom model without external fields.\n    *   Due to the spherical symmetry of the initial state and the interaction Hamiltonian (when averaged over all directions and polarizations of the emitted photon), the transition probability is independent of the final magnetic quantum number $m'$.\n\n    This can be shown formally using the Wigner-Eckart theorem. The matrix element $\\langle n' l' m' | T_q^{(k)} | n l m \\rangle$ separates into a geometric part (a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient) and a physical part (the reduced matrix element), which is independent of the magnetic quantum numbers.\n    For a transition from $l=0$ to $l'=1$, the squared Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are identical for all three possible final states $m' = -1, 0, 1$.\n\n    Therefore, the transition rates to each of the three states are equal:\n    Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle$) = Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle$) = Rate($|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle$)\n\n    Let's call this rate $R$. The total rate is $R+R+R = 3R$.\n    The branching ratio for any specific channel $m'$ is:\n    Branching Ratio = $\\frac{R}{3R} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n    Once the atom is in an intermediate state $|2,1,m'\\rangle$, it can only decay to $|1,0,0\\rangle$. So the probability of the second step is 1.\n    The overall probability for a given cascade path is thus the branching ratio of the first step, which is $1/3$.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches our result.\n    *   B) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is correct, but the probability is not.\n    *   C) Malformed option, but probability is $\\frac{2}{3}$. Incorrect.\n    *   D) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$. The route is correct, but the probability is not.\n\n    Therefore, the only correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
