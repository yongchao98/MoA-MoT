    "Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\n\nWe are given a vector field **f**(r) with the following properties:\n*   Its magnitude is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the origin: |**f**(r)| = f(r) = 1/r².\n*   Its direction is purely radial, pointing away from the origin.\n\nWe need to calculate the volume integral of the divergence of this field (∫∫∫ ∇·**f** dV) over a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.\n\n### 2. Expressing the Vector Field\n\nIn spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ), a purely radial vector field can be written as:\n**f**(r) = f(r) * **r̂**\nwhere **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction.\nGiven that f(r) = 1/r², the vector field is:\n**f**(r) = (1/r²) **r̂**\n\nThis field is analogous to the electric field of a unit point charge at the origin or the gravitational field of a unit mass at the origin (ignoring constants and signs).\n\n### 3. Method 1: Direct Calculation of Divergence (with a caveat)\n\nThe formula for the divergence of a vector field **A** = Aᵣ **r̂** + A_θ **θ̂** + A_φ **φ̂** in spherical coordinates is:\n∇·**A** = (1/r²) ∂/∂r (r² Aᵣ) + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂/∂θ (sinθ A_θ) + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂/∂φ (A_φ)\n\nFor our field **f**(r), we have:\n*   Aᵣ = fᵣ = 1/r²\n*   A_θ = 0\n*   A_φ = 0\n\nSubstituting these into the divergence formula:\n∇·**f** = (1/r²) ∂/∂r (r² * (1/r²)) + 0 + 0\n∇·**f** = (1/r²) ∂/∂r (1)\n∇·**f** = (1/r²) * 0 = 0\n\nThis calculation seems to imply that the divergence is zero everywhere. If we integrate zero over the volume, the result would be 0.\n`∫∫∫ (0) dV = 0`\n\n**However, this is incorrect.** The vector field **f**(r) = 1/r² is singular (undefined) at the origin (r=0). Our calculation of the divergence is only valid for r ≠ 0. The point r=0, which is a point of infinite divergence (a \"source\"), is included in our integration volume. Therefore, we cannot simply conclude the integral is zero.\n\n### 4. Method 2: Using the Divergence Theorem (Gauss's Theorem)\n\nA more robust way to solve this problem, especially with a singularity at the origin, is to use the Divergence Theorem. The theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume V is equal to the flux of that field through the closed surface S that bounds the volume:\n\n∫∫∫_V (∇·**f**) dV = ∮_S (**f** · d**S**)\n\n*   **V** is the volume of the sphere of radius R.\n*   **S** is the surface of the sphere of radius R.\n*   **f** is our vector field, **f**(r) = (1/r²) **r̂**.\n*   d**S** is the differential surface area vector. For a sphere of radius r, its direction is radially outward, so d**S** = dS **r̂**. The magnitude dS in spherical coordinates is r² sin(θ) dθ dφ.\n\nNow, we evaluate the surface integral (flux) over the sphere of radius R:\n∮_S (**f** · d**S**)\n\nOn the surface of the sphere, the radius r is constant and equal to R. So, we evaluate **f** at r=R:\n**f**(r=R) = (1/R²) **r̂**\n\nThe differential surface element on this sphere is:\nd**S** = (R² sinθ dθ dφ) **r̂**\n\nNow we compute the dot product **f** · d**S**:\n**f** · d**S** = [(1/R²) **r̂**] · [(R² sinθ dθ dφ) **r̂**]\nSince **r̂** · **r̂** = 1, the dot product simplifies to:\n**f** · d**S** = (1/R²) * (R² sinθ dθ dφ) = sinθ dθ dφ\n\nNow, we integrate this expression over the entire surface of the sphere. The limits for a full sphere are θ from 0 to π, and φ from 0 to 2π.\n\n∮_S (**f** · d**S**) = ∫(from φ=0 to 2π) ∫(from θ=0 to π) sinθ dθ dφ\n\nLet's evaluate the integral. We can separate the variables:\n= [∫(from φ=0 to 2π) dφ] * [∫(from θ=0 to π) sinθ dθ]\n\nEvaluating the first integral:\n∫(from φ=0 to 2π) dφ = [φ] from 0 to 2π = 2π - 0 = 2π\n\nEvaluating the second integral:\n∫(from θ=0 to π) sinθ dθ = [-cosθ] from 0 to π = -cos(π) - (-cos(0)) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nMultiplying the results:\n∮_S (**f** · d**S**) = (2π) * (2) = 4π\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, this surface integral is equal to the volume integral of the divergence:\n∫∫∫_V (∇·**f**) dV = 4π\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe divergence of the field is zero everywhere except at the origin, where it is a singularity. This singularity represents a source. The Divergence Theorem allows us to find the total \"strength\" of this source by measuring the total flux leaving the enclosing surface. The result of the volume integral of the divergence is 4π.\n\nLet's check the options:\nA) 4 π\nB) 4/3 π R\nC) 0\nD) 1\n\nOur calculated answer is 4π, which matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
