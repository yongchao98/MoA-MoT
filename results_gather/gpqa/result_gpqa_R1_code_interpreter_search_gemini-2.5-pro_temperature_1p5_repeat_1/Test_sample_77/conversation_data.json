    "The problem asks for the scalar potential V and the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ at a specific point in space $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$, generated by a moving point charge $q$. The charge follows a trajectory $\\vec{s}(t')$. These potentials are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n1.  **Retarded Time:** The core concept is that electromagnetic fields propagate at the speed of light, $c$. Therefore, the field observed at $(\\vec{r}, t)$ was generated by the charge at an earlier time, known as the retarded time, $t_r$. This is the time it took for the field to travel from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n    *   Let $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ be the position of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   Let $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$ be the vector from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n    *   The distance the field travels is $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n    *   The time taken for this travel is $d/c$.\n    *   The relationship between the observation time $t$ and the retarded time $t_r$ is given by the implicit equation:\n        $t = t_r + \\frac{d}{c} \\implies t_r = t - \\frac{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|}{c}$.\n\n2.  **Liénard-Wiechert Potentials:** The scalar and vector potentials for a moving point charge are derived from the general retarded potential formulas by treating the charge as a distribution represented by a Dirac delta function. The derivation is non-trivial because the integration volume appears distorted due to the charge's motion. The final results are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n\n3.  **Scalar Potential (V):**\n    The scalar potential is given by:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    where:\n    *   $q$ is the charge.\n    *   $\\epsilon_o$ is the permittivity of free space.\n    *   $\\vec{v} = \\frac{d\\vec{s}}{dt_r}$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time $t_r$.\n    *   $\\vec{d}$ is the vector from the charge's retarded position $\\vec{s}(t_r)$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$.\n    *   $d = |\\vec{d}|$.\n    *   All quantities related to the source ($d, \\vec{d}, \\vec{v}$) are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$.\n\n    The denominator, often written as $d(1 - \\frac{\\hat{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c})$ where $\\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d$, accounts for the Doppler effect and the fact that the \"effective\" volume of the charge is altered by its motion relative to the observer.\n\n    To match the form in the options, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n    $V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n4.  **Vector Potential ($\\vec{A}$):**\n    Similarly, the vector potential is given by:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\frac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}}$\n    where $\\mu_o$ is the permeability of free space.\n\n    Again, multiplying the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi (cd - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\n5.  **Relationship between V and $\\vec{A}$:**\n    By comparing the expressions for V and $\\vec{A}$, we can see a simple relationship:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v}}{1} \\left( \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\frac{q}{d - \\frac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right) = \\mu_o \\epsilon_o \\vec{v} V(\\vec{r}, t)$\n    Using the relation $c^2 = 1/(\\mu_o \\epsilon_o)$, we get:\n    $\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r}, t)$\n\n6.  **Comparison with Options:**\n    Let's check the given options against our derived formulas:\n    *   **A)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v^2}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$ - Incorrect. This is a static potential and the relation for A is wrong.\n    *   **B)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c + \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$ - Incorrect. The sign in the denominator is wrong. This corresponds to the advanced potential (violates causality).\n    *   **C)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})},  \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}$ - Correct. These are the Liénard-Wiechert potentials.\n    *   **D)** $V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o r}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V(\\vec{r},t)$ - Incorrect. While the relationship between A and V is correct, the potential V is the static one, not the correct retarded potential.\n\nThe correct expressions for the retarded scalar and vector potentials are given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
