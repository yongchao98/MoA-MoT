    "*   **Analysis of the first reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n    *   This is a classic example of **cyanohydrin formation**. In this reaction, a ketone (butan-2-one) reacts with a cyanide source.\n    *   The mechanism involves two main steps:\n        1.  **Nucleophilic attack:** The cyanide ion (CN⁻), from the dissociation of NaCN, is a strong nucleophile. It attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This breaks the C=O pi bond and forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate.\n            ```\n            CH3-C(=O)-CH2CH3 + CN⁻  --->  CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2CH3\n            ```\n        2.  **Protonation:** The negatively charged alkoxide ion is then protonated to form the final hydroxyl (-OH) group. This requires a proton source.\n            ```\n            CH3-C(O⁻)(CN)-CH2CH3 + H⁺  --->  CH3-C(OH)(CN)-CH2CH3 (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile)\n            ```\n    *   **Identifying Reagent A:** Reagent A must be the proton source.\n        *   `NaHSO3` (Sodium bisulfite) is used for the purification of aldehydes and some ketones by forming crystalline adducts, but it's not the protonating agent in this synthesis.\n        *   `H3O⁺` (Hydronium ion) represents an acidic aqueous solution (e.g., HCl(aq) or H2SO4(aq)). This is a suitable proton source to protonate the alkoxide intermediate. In practice, the reaction is often carried out by adding an acid to an aqueous solution of the ketone and NaCN, which generates the required protons.\n    *   Therefore, **A = H3O⁺**.\n\n*   **Analysis of the second reaction:**\n    *   **Reaction:** 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n    *   This reaction shows the conversion of a **nitrile group (-C≡N)** into a **carboxylic acid group (-COOH)**.\n    *   This transformation is known as **nitrile hydrolysis**.\n    *   Nitrile hydrolysis can be catalyzed by either a strong acid or a strong base in the presence of water and usually requires heat.\n        *   **Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis:** R-C≡N is treated with a strong acid like HCl or H2SO4 in water. The reaction proceeds through an amide intermediate (R-CONH2) and yields a carboxylic acid (R-COOH) and an ammonium salt (NH4⁺).\n        *   **Base-catalyzed hydrolysis:** R-C≡N is treated with a strong base like NaOH. This initially forms a carboxylate salt (R-COO⁻). An acidic workup is then required to protonate the salt to get the final carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Identifying Reagent B:** The product is shown as the carboxylic acid, not a salt. This suggests a one-step acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.\n        *   `HCl` is a strong acid and is a standard reagent for the complete hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.\n        *   `CH3COOH` (Acetic acid) is a weak acid. While it could protonate certain species, it is not strong enough to effectively catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a stable nitrile group to a carboxylic acid under typical conditions.\n    *   Therefore, **B = HCl**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Reagent A is H3O⁺.\n    *   Reagent B is HCl.\n    *   This combination matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
