    "The user wants me to identify the reason for the failed overexpression of a recombinant GADD45G protein.\n\n**1. Analyze the Experimental Design:**\n*   **Gene:** GADD45G\n*   **Tag:** Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag\n*   **Tag Position:** N-terminus\n*   **Problem:** The recombinant protein is not expressed in CHO cells.\n*   **Key Information:** The DNA sequence of the construct is provided.\n\n**2. Analyze the Provided DNA Sequence:**\nThe sequence is:\n`5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'`\n\nMy task is to \"read\" this sequence as a ribosome would and see if anything is wrong.\n\n**3. Check the N-terminal Tag:**\n*   The construct is designed to have an N-terminal HA tag.\n*   The standard amino acid sequence for an HA tag is `YPYDVPDYA`.\n*   The DNA sequence should start with an `ATG` start codon, which codes for Methionine (M).\n*   Let's translate the beginning of the DNA sequence:\n    *   `ATG` -> Methionine (M)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n    *   `GTT` -> Valine (V)\n    *   `CCA` -> Proline (P)\n    *   `GAT` -> Aspartic Acid (D)\n    *   `TAC` -> Tyrosine (Y)\n    *   `GCC` -> Alanine (A)\n*   The translated N-terminus is `M-YPYDVPDYA...`. This correctly corresponds to a starting Methionine followed by the HA tag. So far, so good.\n\n**4. Check the Sequence Immediately Following the Tag:**\n*   The DNA sequence for the HA tag is `TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC`.\n*   The sequence immediately following this is `AAA TGA CTC...`\n*   Let's examine this junction in codon context:\n    *   `...GCC` (Last codon of the HA tag)\n    *   `AAA` -> This codes for Lysine (K).\n    *   `TGA` -> This is a **STOP codon**.\n*   The ribosome translating this mRNA (where T would be U, so `UGA`) will encounter this stop codon and terminate translation.\n*   The resulting polypeptide chain will be extremely short: `M-Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A-K`. It's just 11 amino acids long. The actual GADD45G protein sequence, which should come after this, will never be translated.\n*   This very short peptide would likely be too small to be detected by standard methods like Western Blotting, or it might be rapidly degraded by the cell, leading to the observation of \"no expression\".\n\n**5. Evaluate the Options:**\n*   **A) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While linkers are good practice, their absence is not the primary issue here. The protein isn't being fully synthesized in the first place. Proteolysis might happen to the tiny peptide, but the root cause is the failure of translation.\n*   **B) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This is factually incorrect. UAA is a universal stop codon and is recognized by release factors, not tRNAs. Furthermore, the stop codon in the sequence is TGA, not TAA.\n*   **C) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** As translated above, the sequence `ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC` correctly codes for Met-YPYDVPDYA. There is no missense mutation in the tag sequence.\n*   **D) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This is the correct conclusion. The presence of the premature `TGA` stop codon causes translation to halt long before the GADD45G coding sequence is read, resulting in a failure to produce the desired full-length protein.\n\n<<<D>>>"
