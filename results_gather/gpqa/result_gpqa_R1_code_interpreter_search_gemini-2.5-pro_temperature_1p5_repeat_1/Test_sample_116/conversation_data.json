    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the given organic compounds show optical isomerism.\n\n**Core Concept: Optical Isomerism**\n\nFor a molecule to exhibit optical isomerism, it must be **chiral**. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common features that lead to chirality are:\n1.  **Chiral Center (Asymmetric Carbon):** A carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n2.  **Axial Chirality (Atropisomerism):** Chirality arising from restricted rotation around a single bond, typically seen in substituted biphenyl compounds.\n3.  **Absence of Symmetry Elements:** Chiral molecules lack a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n\nLet's examine each compound:\n\n**1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n*   **Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single bond.\n*   **Analysis:** The key to chirality in biphenyls is restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the rings. This restriction, known as atropisomerism, occurs when there are bulky substituents at the *ortho* positions (the positions next to the connecting bond: 2, 6, 2', and 6').\n*   In this molecule, all four *ortho* positions are substituted:\n    *   Positions 2 and 2' have bulky methoxycarbonyl groups (-COOCH₃).\n    *   Positions 6 and 6' have bulky nitro groups (-NO₂).\n*   These large groups physically block the free rotation around the central C-C bond. This forces the two phenyl rings to be in different planes (non-coplanar). The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Conclusion:** This molecule is chiral due to atropisomerism and therefore exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n**2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Methyl lactate)**\n*   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃\n*   **Analysis:** We need to check for chiral centers. Let's look at the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group).\n*   This carbon atom is bonded to four different groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n*   Since the carbon at position 2 is bonded to four distinct groups, it is a chiral center.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of a single chiral center makes the molecule chiral, and thus it exhibits optical isomerism. It exists as two enantiomers (R- and S-methyl lactate).\n\n**3. benzophenone**\n*   **Structure:** (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It consists of two phenyl rings attached to a central carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Analysis:** The central carbon atom is sp² hybridized and is only bonded to three groups (two phenyl rings, one oxygen). It cannot be a chiral center. The molecule as a whole is symmetric. It has a plane of symmetry that runs through the C=O bond, bisecting the molecule.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry, it is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism. It is superimposable on its mirror image.\n\n**4. dimethyl fumarate**\n*   **Structure:** This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The structure is *trans*-CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n*   **Analysis:** The molecule is planar due to the C=C double bond. There are no chiral centers. The molecule has both a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself) and a center of inversion (at the midpoint of the C=C double bond).\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of symmetry elements makes the molecule achiral. It does not exhibit optical isomerism. It does, however, have a geometric isomer (dimethyl maleate, the *cis*-isomer), but neither is optically active.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   Molecule 1: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n*   Molecule 2: Shows optical isomerism (chiral).\n*   Molecule 3: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n*   Molecule 4: Does not show optical isomerism (achiral).\n\nTherefore, the correct compounds are 1 and 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
