    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield during electrophilic bromination.\n\n**1. Understand the Reaction and the Goal**\n\nThe reaction is electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on substituted benzene rings. The goal is to arrange the given substances in order of increasing yield of the *para*-bromo isomer. The weight fraction of the yield is directly proportional to the mole fraction (percentage yield) of the para-isomer, as all monobromo-isomers of a given substance have the same molar mass.\n\nThe substances are:\n1)  C6H5-CH3 (Toluene)\n2)  C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)\n3)  C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)\n4)  C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)\n5)  C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)\n6)  C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)\n\n**2. Classify the Substituents**\n\nWe need to classify each substituent based on its directing effect in electrophilic aromatic substitution. This effect determines where the incoming electrophile (Br+) will attack the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Ortho-, Para-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   -CH3 (Toluene) and -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene): Alkyl groups are weakly activating and o,p-directing.\n    *   -Cl (Chlorobenzene): Halogens are deactivating but o,p-directing.\n*   **Meta-directing groups:** These groups direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position.\n    *   -NO2 (Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating and m-directing.\n    *   -COOH (Benzoic acid): Moderately deactivating and m-directing.\n    *   -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate): Moderately deactivating and m-directing.\n\n**3. General Yield Comparison**\n\n*   **Ortho-, para-directing groups** yield ortho and para isomers as the major products. The yield of the para-isomer is substantial (typically >30%).\n*   **Meta-directing groups** yield the meta isomer as the major product. The yields of ortho and para isomers are very low (typically <5-10%).\n\nTherefore, any substance with an o,p-directing group will produce a significantly higher yield of the para-isomer than any substance with an m-directing group. This allows us to split the list into two parts:\nLow para yield: (Nitrobenzene, Benzoic acid, Ethyl benzoate)\nHigh para yield: (Toluene, Ethylbenzene, Chlorobenzene)\n\n**4. Ordering within the Meta-Directing Group (Low Para Yield)**\n\nThe substances are Nitrobenzene (4), Benzoic acid (6), and Ethyl benzoate (2). All are m-directors. The question asks for the yield of the para-isomer, which is a minor product for these compounds. The amount of the minor (ortho/para) products formed is inversely related to how strongly the substituent deactivates the ring. A stronger deactivating group leads to greater selectivity for the meta position and thus a lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nLet's rank the deactivating strength of these groups:\n*   **-NO2:** Very strong deactivating effect (strong -I inductive effect and -R resonance effect).\n*   **-COOH:** Strong deactivating effect (-I and -R effects).\n*   **-COOC2H5:** Strong deactivating effect (-I and -R effects). The alkyl group (-C2H5) has a slight electron-donating (+I) effect, which makes the -COOC2H5 group slightly less deactivating than the -COOH group.\n\nSo, the order of deactivating strength is: **-NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5**.\nThis means the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order: **Nitrobenzene (4) < Benzoic acid (6) < Ethyl benzoate (2)**.\n\n**5. Ordering within the Ortho-, Para-Directing Group (High Para Yield)**\n\nThe substances are Toluene (1), Ethylbenzene (5), and Chlorobenzene (3). For these compounds, we need to compare the ratio of para to ortho isomers. The formation of the para-isomer is generally favored over the ortho-isomer due to steric hindrance from the substituent.\n\n*   **Toluene (-CH3) vs. Ethylbenzene (-C2H5):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This creates more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, making the attack at the para position more favorable. Therefore, ethylbenzene will produce a higher percentage of the para-isomer than toluene.\n    *   Order: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5)**\n*   **Chlorobenzene (-Cl):** Halogens like chlorine are a special case. While chlorine is less bulky than a methyl group, it has a very strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I). This effect deactivates the nearby ortho positions more strongly than the more distant para position. This electronic effect, combined with steric hindrance, leads to a very high preference for the para-isomer. Experimental data shows that bromination of chlorobenzene yields nearly 90% para-isomer, which is higher than for both toluene (~67%) and ethylbenzene (~76%).\n    *   Order: **Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**\n\nCombining these, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is: **Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3)**.\n\n**6. Final Overall Ordering**\n\nNow, we combine the two ordered lists. The group of m-directors comes first (lowest para yield), followed by the group of o,p-directors (highest para yield).\n\n*   Order of m-directors: **4 < 6 < 2**\n*   Order of o,p-directors: **1 < 5 < 3**\n\nCombining them gives the final order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis sequence corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
