    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principle:** The question deals with the population of atomic energy levels in the photospheres of stars. Since the stars are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms across different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation.\n\n2.  **State the Boltzmann Equation:** The Boltzmann equation gives the ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (N_j) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (N_i):\n    N_j / N_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n    Where:\n    *   `N_j`, `N_i` are the number of atoms in levels j and i.\n    *   `g_j`, `g_i` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the levels (E_j - E_i).\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (k ≈ 1.380649 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Apply the equation to both stars:**\n    Let's denote the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the ground state as `R = N_excited / N_ground`. Let `C = g_excited / g_ground` be the ratio of statistical weights, which is a constant for a given atomic transition.\n\n    *   For star_1 (with temperature T_1):\n        R_1 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n\n    *   For star_2 (with temperature T_2):\n        R_2 = C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n4.  **Incorporate the condition from the problem:** The problem states that \"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to the iron atoms in star_2.\" This means the ratio of populations `R` for star_1 is twice the ratio for star_2.\n    R_1 = 2 * R_2\n\n5.  **Substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the condition:**\n    C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [C * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]\n\n6.  **Simplify the equation:** The constant `C` (ratio of statistical weights) cancels out from both sides:\n    exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n7.  **Solve for the temperatures:** To isolate the temperatures, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of the equation.\n    ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))] = ln[2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]\n    Using the logarithm property ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b):\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) + ln[exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]\n    -ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2) - ΔE / (k * T_2)\n\n8.  **Rearrange the equation to match the options:** We want to express ln(2) in terms of the temperatures.\n    ΔE / (k * T_2) - ΔE / (k * T_1) = ln(2)\n    Factor out the common term (ΔE / k):\n    (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = ln(2)\n\n9.  **Combine the fractions:** Find a common denominator for the terms in the parenthesis.\n    (1/T_2 - 1/T_1) = (T_1 / (T_1*T_2)) - (T_2 / (T_1*T_2)) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n    Substitute this back into the equation:\n    (ΔE / k) * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n\n10. **Use the given numerical values:** The problem provides the energy difference ΔE ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant is k ≈ 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K.\n    The ratio ΔE / k is therefore:\n    ΔE / k ≈ (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J) / (1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K) ≈ 1 K\n\n11. **Final Substitution:** Substitute this value back into the derived equation:\n    1 * [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ] = ln(2)\n    ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2) ]\n\n12. **Compare with the given options:** This result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
