    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nBoth reactions produce a substituted lactone:\n*   Reaction 1 Product: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   Reaction 2 Product: (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nThe name \"tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\" describes a six-membered ring containing an oxygen atom and a carbonyl group in a position that forms a cyclic ester (lactone). Specifically, this is a δ-lactone. The chiral center is at position C4, which bears an ethyl group.\n\nA δ-lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a 5-hydroxycarboxylic acid. In this case, the specific precursor would be **5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid**.\n\n**HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-CH2OH(5)** --- (cyclization) ---> **(4-ethyl)-lactone**\n\nCrucially, the cyclization reaction (lactonization) does not affect the chiral center (C3 in the acid, which becomes C4 in the lactone). Therefore:\n*   (R)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid will form the (R)-lactone.\n*   (S)-5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid will form the (S)-lactone.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nThe options describe the starting materials as stereoisomers of \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". This is best interpreted as a mono-isobutyl ester of 3-ethylglutaric acid (a 5-carbon dicarboxylic acid). The most plausible structure that fits the name and reactions is:\n\n**HOOC(1)-CH2(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH2(4)-C(=O)O-isobutyl(5)**\n\nThis molecule has two different functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an ester (-COO-iBu). The chiral center is at C3.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ ---> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride) is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters and ketones but is very slow to react with carboxylic acids. Therefore, it will selectively reduce the ester group.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  The ester group at C5 is reduced to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid at C1 is unaffected.\n        **A** (HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu) --- (LiBH₄) ---> **HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH**\n    2.  The resulting molecule is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    3.  This intermediate cyclizes (with acid catalysis, H⁺) to form the 6-membered δ-lactone product.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction occurs at C5, which is not the chiral center. The cyclization also does not affect the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the starting material is retained in the product.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Since the product is the **(R)**-lactone, the intermediate must have been the (R)-hydroxyacid, which in turn must have come from starting material **A** with the **(R)** configuration.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis conclusion eliminates options (A) and (D).\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ ---> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent:** BH₃ (Borane) is also a selective reducing agent. It rapidly reduces carboxylic acids but reduces esters much more slowly. Therefore, it will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Similar to Reaction 1, the reduction process does not involve the chiral center, so its configuration should be conserved. To produce the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material **B** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n*   **Mechanistic Note:** There is a discrepancy in the problem statement for this reaction. The reduction of the carboxylic acid in B would yield `HOCH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COO-iBu`. Cyclization of this molecule would form a 7-membered ring (an ε-lactone), not the 6-membered ring (δ-lactone) specified. However, in the context of a multiple-choice question, this is most likely an error in the problem's text. The most reliable line of reasoning is to follow the conservation of stereochemistry, which is a fundamental principle. The transformation from an (S) starting material to an (S) product is stereochemically sound.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **A** must be the **(R)**-isomer to yield the (R)-product.\n*   **B** must be the **(S)**-isomer to yield the (S)-product.\n\nThis corresponds to option (B).\n\n<<<B>>>"
