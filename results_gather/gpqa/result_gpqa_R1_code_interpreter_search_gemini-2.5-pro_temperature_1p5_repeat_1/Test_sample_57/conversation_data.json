    "Let's break down each of the options to determine which one does not require regularization at high energies.\n\n**Regularization at High Energies (Ultraviolet Regularization):**\nIn physics, particularly in Quantum Field Theory (QFT), calculations of physical quantities (like scattering amplitudes or particle self-energies) often involve integrals over all possible energies or momenta of virtual particles in loops. These integrals frequently diverge at the high-energy (or \"ultraviolet\", UV) end. Regularization is a mathematical procedure used to handle these infinities, making them finite so that they can be manipulated. A subsequent step, called renormalization, is then used to absorb these infinities into the definitions of physical parameters like mass and charge, yielding finite and physically meaningful predictions. The need for regularization is a sign that the theory is incomplete or breaks down at very high energies.\n\nNow let's examine the choices:\n\n*   **A) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** This is the theory of the strong nuclear force. As a quantum field theory within the Standard Model, it describes interactions between quarks and gluons. Like other QFTs, calculations in QCD involving loop diagrams (virtual particle exchanges) suffer from UV divergences. Therefore, QCD *requires* regularization and renormalization to make physical predictions.\n\n*   **B) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the quantum theory of electromagnetism. It was the first successful QFT and describes the interactions of light and matter. QED also encounters UV divergences in its calculations, most famously in the electron self-energy and vacuum polarization. These infinities must be managed through regularization and renormalization. So, QED *requires* regularization.\n\n*   **D) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory, governed by Maxwell's equations, describes the behavior of electric and magnetic fields. While not a quantum theory, it has its own high-energy problem. If you model an elementary particle like an electron as a true mathematical point charge, the energy stored in its own electric field (the self-energy) becomes infinite. To get a finite answer, one must introduce a cutoff, essentially assuming the electron has a small but non-zero radius. This is a form of classical regularization. Thus, in the context of point particles, even classical electrodynamics runs into a high-energy/short-distance divergence.\n\n*   **C) Superstring Theory:** This is a theoretical framework that aims to be a unified theory of everything, including gravity. A key feature and motivation for string theory is its potential to solve the problem of UV divergences. Instead of point-like particles, the fundamental entities in string theory are tiny, one-dimensional vibrating strings. The interactions between these strings are not localized at a single point but are \"smeared out\" in spacetime. This smearing effect naturally smooths out the short-distance behavior that leads to infinities in QFT. As a result, calculations in superstring theory are believed to be free of UV divergences. The theory is said to be \"UV-complete\" or \"UV-finite\", meaning it does not break down at high energies and therefore *never requires* the artificial procedure of regularization.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nQuantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and even Classical Electrodynamics (with point charges) all encounter infinities related to high-energy/short-distance phenomena that necessitate some form of regularization. Superstring theory, by its fundamental construction, avoids these infinities and is therefore the theory that does not require regularization at high energies.\n\n<<<C>>>"
