    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2, which is $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Equilibrium Temperature Formula:** The equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    $T_{eq} = T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2d} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}$\n    where:\n    *   $T_{star}$ is the effective temperature of the star.\n    *   $R_{star}$ is the radius of the star.\n    *   $d$ is the orbital distance of the planet from the star.\n    *   $A$ is the albedo of the planet.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We can write the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures for the two planets:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2d_1} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2d_2} \\right)^{1/2} (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\n4.  **Simplify the Ratio:** The problem states that the planets orbit the same star, so $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are constant and cancel out. It is also given that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$). Therefore, the terms $(1-A)^{1/4}$ also cancel out. The simplified ratio becomes:\n    $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{d_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{d_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{d_2}{d_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n    This shows that the ratio of the temperatures depends only on the ratio of their orbital distances. The next step is to find this distance ratio.\n\n5.  **Relate Radial Velocity to Orbital Parameters:** The periodic Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) is caused by the star's \"wobble\" induced by the orbiting planet. The amplitude of the star's radial velocity ($K$) is related to the maximum Doppler shift by:\n    $K = c \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_0}$\n    where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\n    For a planet in a circular orbit, the stellar radial velocity amplitude $K$ can also be expressed as:\n    $K = \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{d}}$\n    This formula assumes the planet's mass ($M_p$) is much smaller than the star's mass ($M_{star}$) and that the orbit is viewed edge-on (inclination $i=90^\\circ$), which is a valid assumption for planets detected by both transit and RV methods.\n\n6.  **Solve for the Orbital Distance Ratio ($d_2/d_1$):** First, rearrange the formula to solve for the orbital distance $d$:\n    $K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_{star} d} \\implies d = \\frac{G M_p^2}{M_{star} K^2}$\n\n    Now, form the ratio $d_2/d_1$:\n    $\\frac{d_2}{d_1} = \\frac{\\frac{G M_{p2}^2}{M_{star} K_2^2}}{\\frac{G M_{p1}^2}{M_{star} K_1^2}}$\n    The gravitational constant $G$ and the star's mass $M_{star}$ cancel out:\n    $\\frac{d_2}{d_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left( \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^2$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Necessary Ratios:**\n    *   **Mass Ratio:**\n        $M_{p1} = 7 M_{Earth}$\n        $M_{p2} = 5 M_{Earth}$\n        $\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\n    *   **Radial Velocity Amplitude Ratio ($K_1/K_2$):**\n        $\\Delta\\lambda_1 = 0.03$ Å\n        $\\Delta\\lambda_2 = 0.04$ Å\n        $\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{c \\cdot \\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\lambda_0}{c \\cdot \\Delta\\lambda_2 / \\lambda_0} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n8.  **Compute the Final Answer:** Substitute the calculated ratios back into the equations.\n    *   First, find the distance ratio:\n        $\\frac{d_2}{d_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n    *   Now, find the temperature ratio:\n        $\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left( \\frac{d_2}{d_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\left( \\frac{225}{784} \\right)^{1/2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{225}}{\\sqrt{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nTo get the decimal value, we perform the division:\n```python\n# Given values\n# Planet 1 mass in Earth masses\nm1 = 7\n# Planet 2 mass in Earth masses\nm2 = 5\n# Planet 1 Doppler shift in Angstroms\ndl1 = 0.03\n# Planet 2 Doppler shift in Angstroms\ndl2 = 0.04\n\n# Calculate the ratio of masses (m2/m1)\nmass_ratio = m2 / m1\n\n# The ratio of radial velocity amplitudes (K1/K2) is equal to the ratio of Doppler shifts (dl1/dl2)\nK_ratio = dl1 / dl2\n\n# Calculate the ratio of orbital distances (d2/d1)\n# d is proportional to (M_p/K)^2\n# d2/d1 = (m2/k2)^2 / (m1/k1)^2 = (m2/m1)^2 * (k1/k2)^2\ndistance_ratio_d2_d1 = (mass_ratio)**2 * (K_ratio)**2\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T1/T2) is sqrt(d2/d1)\ntemp_ratio = distance_ratio_d2_d1**0.5\n\nprint(f\"{temp_ratio:.4f}\")\n```\n>>>\n0.5357\n\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 0.536.

    "Answering this question involves determining the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets.\n\n**1. Formula for Equilibrium Temperature**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$) of a planet orbiting a star in a circular orbit is given by the formula:\n$T_{eq} = T_{star} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2d} \\right)^{1/2} \\cdot (1 - A)^{1/4}$\nwhere:\n-   $T_{star}$ is the effective temperature of the star.\n-   $R_{star}$ is the radius of the star.\n-   $d$ is the orbital distance of the planet from the star.\n-   $A$ is the albedo of the planet.\n\n**2. Temperature Ratio**\n\nWe need to find the ratio $T_{eq,1} / T_{eq,2}$. Let's set up the ratio using the formula:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{T_{star} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2d_1} \\right)^{1/2} \\cdot (1 - A_1)^{1/4}}{T_{star} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{R_{star}}{2d_2} \\right)^{1/2} \\cdot (1 - A_2)^{1/4}}$\n\nSince both planets orbit the same star, $T_{star}$ and $R_{star}$ are the same and cancel out. The problem states that both planets have the same albedo ($A_1 = A_2$), so the $(1 - A)^{1/4}$ terms also cancel out. The equation simplifies to:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{d_1} \\right)^{1/2}}{\\left( \\frac{1}{d_2} \\right)^{1/2}} = \\left( \\frac{d_2}{d_1} \\right)^{1/2}$\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we must first find the ratio of their orbital distances, $d_2 / d_1$.\n\n**3. Relating Radial Velocity to Orbital Distance**\n\nThe problem provides information from the radial velocity (RV) method. For a planet in a circular orbit, the amplitude of the star's radial velocity ($K$) is given by:\n$K = \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{d}}$\nwhere $M_p$ is the planet's mass, $M_{star}$ is the star's mass, $i$ is the orbital inclination, and $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n\nSince the planets were detected by both transit and RV methods, we can assume their orbits are edge-on, so $\\sin i \\approx 1$. The formula becomes:\n$K \\approx \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{M_{star}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{d}}$\n\nWe can solve this for the orbital distance, $d$:\n$K^2 = \\frac{M_p^2 G}{M_{star} d} \\implies d = \\frac{G \\cdot M_p^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K^2}$\n\nNow we can find the ratio $d_2 / d_1$:\n$\\frac{d_2}{d_1} = \\frac{\\frac{G \\cdot M_{p2}^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K_2^2}}{\\frac{G \\cdot M_{p1}^2}{M_{star} \\cdot K_1^2}}$\n\nThe terms $G$ and $M_{star}$ are constants and cancel out, leaving:\n$\\frac{d_2}{d_1} = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 / K_2^2}{M_{p1}^2 / K_1^2} = \\left( \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^2$\n\n**4. Calculating the Ratios**\n\nFirst, let's find the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes, $K_1 / K_2$. The RV amplitude is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift ($\\Delta\\lambda$) via the formula $K = c (\\Delta\\lambda / \\lambda_0)$. Thus, the ratio $K_1 / K_2$ is equal to the ratio $\\Delta\\lambda_1 / \\Delta\\lambda_2$:\n$\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda_1}{\\Delta\\lambda_2} = \\frac{0.03 \\text{ Å}}{0.04 \\text{ Å}} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nNext, we have the ratio of the planet masses:\n$\\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \\frac{5 \\text{ Earth masses}}{7 \\text{ Earth masses}} = \\frac{5}{7}$\n\nNow, we can calculate the ratio of the orbital distances:\n$\\frac{d_2}{d_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{49} \\cdot \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{225}{784}$\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\n\nFinally, we substitute the distance ratio back into our simplified temperature ratio equation:\n$\\frac{T_{eq,1}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{d_2}{d_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{225}{784}} = \\frac{15}{28}$\n\nCalculating the decimal value:\n$\\frac{15}{28} \\approx 0.5357$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Masses of the planets in Earth masses\nm1 = 7\nm2 = 5\n\n# Periodic Doppler shifts in Angstroms\ndl1 = 0.03\ndl2 = 0.04\n\n# The ratio of radial velocity amplitudes (K1/K2) is the same as the ratio of Doppler shifts\nK_ratio_1_over_2 = dl1 / dl2\n\n# The ratio of the masses of the planets (M2/M1)\nmass_ratio_2_over_1 = m2 / m1\n\n# The ratio of orbital distances (d2/d1) is derived from the radial velocity formula\n# d is proportional to (M_p / K)^2\n# So, d2/d1 = (M2/K2)^2 / (M1/K1)^2 = (M2/M1)^2 * (K1/K2)^2\ndistance_ratio_2_over_1 = (mass_ratio_2_over_1)**2 * (K_ratio_1_over_2)**2\n\n# The ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T_eq1 / T_eq2) is the square root of the inverse orbital distance ratio (d2/d1)\ntemperature_ratio = math.sqrt(distance_ratio_2_over_1)\n\nprint(f\"{temperature_ratio:.4f}\")\n```\n<<<A>>>",
