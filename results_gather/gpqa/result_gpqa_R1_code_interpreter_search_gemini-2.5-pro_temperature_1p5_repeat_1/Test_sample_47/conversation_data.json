    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2) to form product 1.**\nThis reaction is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. The bromine atom adds to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon). Due to the symmetry of cyclohexanone, both α-carbons are equivalent. The reaction proceeds through an enol intermediate and results in the formation of 2-bromocyclohexanone.\n*   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 (2-bromocyclohexanone) heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form product 2.**\nThis reaction involves an α-haloketone with a strong base, which are the classic conditions for a **Favorskii rearrangement**.\nThe mechanism is as follows:\n1.  The hydroxide ion (OH-) is a strong base and removes the most acidic proton. The α-protons are acidic, but the ones on the carbon not bearing the halogen (C6) are more accessible and lead to the rearrangement.\n2.  Deprotonation at C6 forms an enolate.\n3.  The enolate anion performs an intramolecular S_N2 attack on the carbon bearing the bromine (C2), displacing the bromide ion and forming a bicyclic ketone intermediate (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-one).\n4.  The hydroxide ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of the bicyclic ketone.\n5.  The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, leading to the cleavage of the C1-C6 bond. This ring-opening is favored because it forms a more stable carbanion on a five-membered ring.\n6.  Protonation of the resulting cyclopentyl carboxylate during workup yields cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\nAn alternative reaction, E2 elimination to form cyclohex-2-enone, is less likely under these conditions and would not react in the subsequent step.\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid) treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine to form product 3.**\nThis is a standard method for converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride. Thionyl chloride replaces the -OH group of the carboxylic acid with a -Cl atom. Pyridine is used to neutralize the HCl gas produced as a byproduct.\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 (Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride) treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)3) to form product 4.**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a sterically hindered and mild reducing agent. It is specifically used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes without further reduction to the primary alcohol. The bulky tert-butoxy groups make the reagent less reactive than LiAlH4, allowing the reaction to be stopped at the aldehyde stage.\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde\n\n**Final Analysis: Counting the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in Product 4 (Cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde).**\nThe structure of cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde is a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO). To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogens, we must analyze the molecule's symmetry.\n\nThe structure is:\n      H_aldehyde\n      |\n    C=O\n      |\nH1--C1---C2(H,H)\n    /  \\\nC5(H,H)---C3(H,H)\n    \\  /\n    C4(H,H)\n\n1.  **Symmetry:** At room temperature, the cyclopentane ring undergoes rapid conformational changes (pseudorotation). The time-averaged structure possesses a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (H-C=O), the C1 carbon and its attached hydrogen (H1), and bisects the C3-C4 bond.\n\n2.  **Chirality:** The C1 carbon is attached to four different groups (H, CHO, the -C2-C3- part of the ring, and the -C5-C4- part of the ring). Therefore, C1 is a chiral center, and the molecule is chiral.\n\n3.  **Counting the distinct hydrogens:**\n    *   **The aldehyde proton (H_aldehyde):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n    *   **The proton on C1 (H1):** This methine proton is also unique. (1 type)\n    *   **Protons on C2 and C5:** The plane of symmetry makes C2 and C5 equivalent. However, because C2 is adjacent to the chiral center (C1), its two protons are diastereotopic (they exist in different chemical environments relative to the rest of the molecule). Thus, they are chemically distinct from each other. Let's call them H2a and H2b. Due to the symmetry plane, H2a is equivalent to H5a, and H2b is equivalent to H5b. This gives two sets of equivalent protons. (2 types)\n    *   **Protons on C3 and C4:** The plane of symmetry makes C3 and C4 equivalent. The two protons on C3 are also diastereotopic because they are in a chiral molecule. Their relationship to the chiral center at C1 is different. Let's call them H3a and H3b. Due to the symmetry plane, H3a is equivalent to H4a, and H3b is equivalent to H4b. This gives another two sets of equivalent protons. (2 types)\n\n**Total Count:**\n*   1 type (aldehyde H)\n*   1 type (C1 methine H)\n*   2 types (from the C2/C5 diastereotopic protons)\n*   2 types (from the C3/C4 diastereotopic protons)\n\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<C>>>"
