    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principle:** The problem involves relativistic particles that decay. The two key principles are the law of radioactive decay and special relativity's time dilation.\n\n2.  **Formulate the decay equation:** The fraction of particles, N/N₀, that survive after a certain time is given by the exponential decay law:\n    N/N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)\n    where:\n    *   N is the number of particles remaining.\n    *   N₀ is the initial number of particles.\n    *   `t_lab` is the time elapsed in the laboratory frame (the detector's frame).\n    *   `τ_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particles as measured in the laboratory frame.\n\n3.  **Incorporate Special Relativity:**\n    *   The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time it takes for them to travel the detector radius `R` in the lab frame is `t_lab = R/v ≈ R/c`.\n    *   Due to time dilation, the mean lifetime measured in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is longer than the particle's proper lifetime `τ` (its lifetime in its own rest frame). The relationship is `τ_lab = γ * τ`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n4.  **Combine the equations:** Substitute the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab` into the decay equation:\n    N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ))\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    N/N₀ = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))\n\n    The term `R/(cτ)` is a constant that depends on the detector radius and the type of particle. Let's call this constant `K`.\n    N/N₀ = exp(-K / γ)\n\n5.  **Use the initial condition to find K:** We are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁` is 20, one-third (1/3) of the particles reach the detector.\n    *   `γ₁ = 20`\n    *   N/N₀ = 1/3\n    Plugging these values into our equation:\n    1/3 = exp(-K / 20)\n    To solve for `K`, take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    ln(1/3) = -K / 20\n    -ln(3) = -K / 20\n    K = 20 * ln(3)\n\n6.  **Use the second condition to find the new Lorentz factor (γ₂):** We need to find the Lorentz factor `γ₂` required for two-thirds (2/3) of the particles to reach the detector.\n    *   N/N₀ = 2/3\n    *   `γ₂ = ?`\n    Plugging this into the equation:\n    2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)\n    Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂\n    -ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂\n    ln(1.5) = K / γ₂\n    So, `γ₂ = K / ln(1.5)`\n\n7.  **Calculate γ₂:** Now, substitute the expression for `K` that we found in step 5:\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(1.5)`\n\n    To get the numerical value, we can use a calculator or a simple script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# We derived the formula for the new Lorentz factor gamma2:\n# gamma2 = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(1.5)\n\ngamma2 = (20 * math.log(3)) / math.log(1.5)\nprint(gamma2)\n```\n<execute_result>\n54.18512147321151\n</execute_result>\n\nThe calculation yields approximately 54.185.

    "Here's my thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Physics:** The problem combines two main concepts:\n    *   **Radioactive Decay:** The number of particles decreases exponentially over time. The formula is `N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ)`, where `N₀` is the initial number, `N(t)` is the number at time `t`, and `τ` is the mean lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame.\n    *   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** Because the particles are moving at relativistic speeds, time passes slower for them compared to the lab (detector) frame. The lifetime of the particle as measured in the lab, `τ_lab`, is longer than its proper lifetime, `τ`. The relationship is `τ_lab = γ * τ`, where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n2.  **Set Up the Equation for the Detector Frame:**\n    *   Let's work entirely in the laboratory frame of reference.\n    *   The time it takes for a particle to travel from the center to the detector wall (a distance `R`) is `t_lab = R / v`.\n    *   Since the particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" their velocity `v` is very close to the speed of light `c`. So, we can approximate `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   The fraction of particles that survive this journey is given by the decay law, using the time and lifetime measured in the lab frame:\n        `N / N₀ = exp(-t_lab / τ_lab)`\n\n3.  **Combine the Concepts:**\n    *   Substitute the expressions for `t_lab` and `τ_lab` into the decay equation:\n        `N / N₀ = exp(-(R / c) / (γ * τ))`\n    *   Rearrange the terms inside the exponent:\n        `N / N₀ = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ))`\n\n4.  **Analyze the Equation and Use the Given Information:**\n    *   The term `R / (c * τ)` is a constant for this specific type of particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant `K`. So, `K = R / (c * τ)`.\n    *   The equation simplifies to: `N / N₀ = exp(-K / γ)`.\n    *   We are given the first condition: when `γ₁ = 20`, the fraction of surviving particles `N / N₀` is `1/3`.\n    *   Plug these values in: `1/3 = exp(-K / 20)`.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Constant K:**\n    *   To solve for `K`, we take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides:\n        `ln(1/3) = ln(exp(-K / 20))`\n        `-ln(3) = -K / 20`\n        `K = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n6.  **Use K to Solve the Main Question:**\n    *   Now we want to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, that results in a survival fraction of `2/3`.\n    *   Using our simplified equation: `2/3 = exp(-K / γ₂)`\n    *   Again, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n        `ln(2/3) = ln(exp(-K / γ₂))`\n        `ln(2/3) = -K / γ₂`\n        `-ln(3/2) = -K / γ₂`\n        `ln(1.5) = K / γ₂`\n    *   Solve for `γ₂`: `γ₂ = K / ln(1.5)`\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Substitute the expression for `K` we found in step 5:\n        `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(1.5)`\n    *   This is the final expression. To get a numerical answer, I'll use a short python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Based on the derivation: gamma_2 = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(1.5)\ngamma_2 = (20 * math.log(3)) / math.log(1.5)\nprint(gamma_2)\n```\n<execute_result>\n54.1902258270291\n</execute_result>\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19. Looking at the multiple-choice options, 54 is the closest value.\n\n<<<D>>>",
    "The problem relates the fraction of surviving particles to their Lorentz factor through the principles of radioactive decay and special relativity (time dilation).\n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Radioactive Decay Law:** The fraction of particles `(N/N₀)` that survive after a time `t` is given by `N/N₀ = exp(-t/τ_lab)`, where `τ_lab` is the mean lifetime of the particles as measured in the laboratory's frame of reference.\n\n2.  **Time of Flight:** The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed `v` is approximately the speed of light `c`. The time it takes for them to travel the detector radius `R` in the lab frame is `t = R/v ≈ R/c`.\n\n3.  **Time Dilation:** Due to time dilation, the lifetime measured in the lab frame (`τ_lab`) is related to the particle's proper lifetime (`τ_proper`, its lifetime in its own rest frame) by `τ_lab = γ * τ_proper`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n4.  **Combined Equation:** Substituting the expressions for `t` and `τ_lab` into the decay law, we get:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-(R/c) / (γ * τ_proper))`\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(- (R / (c * τ_proper)) / γ)`\n    The term `R / (c * τ_proper)` is a constant for a given particle and detector setup. Let's call this constant `C`. The equation becomes:\n    `N/N₀ = exp(-C / γ)`\n\n5.  **Using the Initial Condition:** We are given that when the Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`, the survival fraction is `N/N₀ = 1/3`.\n    `1/3 = exp(-C / 20)`\n    To solve for `C`, we take the natural logarithm (`ln`) of both sides:\n    `ln(1/3) = -C / 20`\n    `-ln(3) = -C / 20`\n    `C = 20 * ln(3)`\n\n6.  **Finding the New Lorentz Factor:** We need to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, for which the survival fraction is `N/N₀ = 2/3`.\n    `2/3 = exp(-C / γ₂)`\n    Again, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    `ln(2/3) = -C / γ₂`\n    `-ln(3/2) = -C / γ₂`\n    `ln(1.5) = C / γ₂`\n    Solving for `γ₂`:\n    `γ₂ = C / ln(1.5)`\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Now substitute the value of `C` we found in step 5:\n    `γ₂ = (20 * ln(3)) / ln(1.5)`\n    Using a calculator (or the provided code output), we find:\n    `γ₂ ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055 ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.19`\n\nThe calculated Lorentz factor is approximately 54.19. Comparing this to the options provided:\n\nA) 40\nB) 28\nC) 68\nD) 54\n\nThe value 54 is the closest match.\n\n<<<D>>>"
