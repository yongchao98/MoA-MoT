    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dicarboxylic Acid and Anhydride:** The problem starts with a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene. Upon dehydration, it forms an anhydride with a very simple NMR spectrum:\n    *   ¹H NMR: one singlet at 7.0 ppm. This indicates all protons are chemically equivalent and are in the vinylic region.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons, C=C) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons, C=O).\n    *   The only molecule that fits this description is **maleic anhydride**. It is formed from the dehydration of maleic acid (*cis*-butenedioic acid). Maleic anhydride (C₄H₂O₃) has a plane of symmetry that makes the two vinylic protons equivalent and the two carbonyl carbons equivalent, resulting in the simple spectra described.\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is explicitly named as **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a cyclic diene (C₉H₁₄) that is substituted with four methyl groups on the double-bonded carbons.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reaction**\n\n*   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a type of [4+2] cycloaddition.\n*   This reaction forms a bicyclic adduct. The molecular formula of the product would be the sum of the reactants: C₄H₂O₃ + C₉H₁₄ = **C₁₃H₁₆O₃**, which matches the formula given in the problem.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Diels-Alder reactions with cyclic dienes can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* product and the *exo* product. According to the Alder rule, the *endo* product is typically the kinetically favored product and is therefore the **major product**. The *exo* product is the thermodynamically favored but kinetically slower-forming product, making it the **minor product**.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Major and Minor Products**\n\nLet's visualize the structures of the *endo* (major) and *exo* (minor) products. The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton.\n\n*   **Common features of both isomers:**\n    *   A C=C double bond with two methyl groups attached (from C2 and C3 of the diene). Let's call these **vinylic methyls**.\n    *   Two bridgehead carbons, each with a methyl group attached (from C1 and C4 of the diene). Let's call these **bridgehead methyls**.\n    *   A fused anhydride ring (from maleic anhydride). The two protons on the carbons where the ring is fused originate from the maleic anhydride. Let's call these **anhydride protons**.\n    *   A one-carbon bridge (a CH₂ group from C5 of the diene).\n\n*   **Key stereochemical difference:**\n    *   **Endo Product (Major):** The anhydride ring is on the same side (*syn*) as the C=C double bond bridge. The anhydride protons point \"under\" the C=C bridge.\n    *   **Exo Product (Minor):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side (*anti*) of the C=C double bond bridge.\n\nBoth products possess a plane of symmetry that passes through the CH₂ bridge and the oxygen of the anhydride. This means that in both isomers:\n*   The two vinylic methyl groups are equivalent.\n*   The two bridgehead methyl groups are equivalent.\n*   The two anhydride protons are equivalent.\n\n**4. Assign the ¹H NMR Signals**\n\nBased on typical chemical shifts, we can assign the signals mentioned in the options to the different types of protons in the product:\n*   **~3.5 ppm (2H singlet):** Protons on carbons adjacent to two carbonyl groups (the anhydride protons) are highly deshielded. This is a very characteristic shift.\n*   **~1.7 ppm (6H singlet):** Methyl groups attached to a double bond (vinylic methyls) typically appear around 1.6-2.0 ppm.\n*   **~1.0 ppm (6H singlet):** Methyl groups on saturated carbons (bridgehead methyls) typically appear around 0.8-1.2 ppm.\n*   **~1.5 ppm (1H doublet):** This must be one of the two protons on the CH₂ bridge. These two protons are diastereotopic (not equivalent) and would couple to each other, forming two doublets (an AB system, which can look like two doublets if Δν >> J).\n\n**5. Analyze the NOESY Spectrum**\n\n*   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close to each other in space (through-space interaction, not through bonds). A cross-peak connects the signals of two protons that are spatially near (typically < 5 Å).\n*   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the **major** product but absent/weak in the **minor** product. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n*   **In the Endo (Major) Product:**\n    *   The anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) are positioned directly under the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm). They are very close in space.\n    *   Therefore, a strong NOE cross-peak between the **anhydride protons** and the **vinylic methyl protons** is expected.\n\n*   **In the Exo (Minor) Product:**\n    *   The anhydride ring is flipped away from the vinylic methyl groups. The distance between the anhydride protons and the vinylic methyl protons is now large.\n    *   Therefore, the NOE cross-peak between these two groups would be absent or very weak.\n    *   (In the *exo* product, a new NOE between the anhydride protons and the bridgehead methyls (~1.0 ppm) would appear, as these groups are now close).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe cross-peak that is strong in the major product and absent/weak in the minor product is the one connecting the **anhydride protons** and the **vinylic methyl protons**.\n*   Signal for vinylic methyl protons: **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**\n*   Signal for anhydride protons: **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**\n\nThis corresponds to the pair of resonances described in option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
