    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the products formed in two separate reactions and then determining how these products will be separated using two different types of High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reaction I\n\n*   **Reactant:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.\n    *   The structure is CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.\n    *   There is a pre-existing stereocenter at C-5 with the (S) configuration. This means the starting material is a single, pure enantiomer.\n*   **Reagent:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup (H3O+).\n*   **Reaction:** LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C-3 to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C-3 creates a new stereocenter. The hydride ion (H-) can attack the planar carbonyl group from two different faces. Since the molecule already contains a stereocenter at C-5, these two faces are diastereotopic. The attack from one face will lead to the (3S) alcohol, and the attack from the other face will lead to the (3R) alcohol. The stereocenter at C-5 is not affected by the reaction.\n*   **Products of Reaction I:** The reaction produces two stereoisomers:\n    1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Relationship between Products:** These two products are diastereomers because they have two stereocenters, with one being the same (5S) and the other being different (3S vs. 3R).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction II\n\n*   **Reactant:** Pentane-2,4-dione.\n    *   The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.\n    *   This is an achiral molecule (it has a plane of symmetry).\n*   **Reagent:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4), followed by an acidic workup.\n*   **Reaction:** NaBH4 is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to hydroxyl groups. The product is pentane-2,4-diol.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Product:** The reaction creates two new stereocenters at C-2 and C-4.\n    The possible configurations are (2R, 4R), (2S, 4S), (2R, 4S), and (2S, 4R).\n    *   **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol** and **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** are enantiomers of each other. Since the starting material and reagents are achiral, this pair of chiral products will be formed in equal amounts, resulting in a racemic mixture.\n    *   **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol** is a meso compound. It is superimposable on its mirror image ((2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol) and is achiral.\n*   **Products of Reaction II:** The reaction produces a mixture of three stereoisomers:\n    1.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    2.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    3.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n    The first two are produced as a single racemic mixture. The meso compound is a diastereomer of the other two.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Normal-Phase HPLC\n\nNormal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity). It operates in an achiral environment.\n*   It **can** separate constitutional isomers.\n*   It **can** separate diastereomers, as they have different physical properties.\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers, as they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n\nLet's analyze the combined product mixture:\n*   **From Reaction I:** (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. These are diastereomers and will be separated into **two distinct peaks**.\n*   **From Reaction II:** The racemic mixture of [(2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol] and the meso-pentane-2,4-diol. The racemic pair and the meso compound are diastereomers and will be separated. The two enantiomers within the racemic mixture will elute together. This gives **two distinct peaks**: one for the racemic pair and one for the meso compound.\n*   **Total Peaks:** The products from Reaction I (C7 ether-alcohols) are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols) and will have different retention times. Therefore, there will be no accidental overlap.\n\nThe total number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC is the sum of peaks from the separated groups: 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Combined Mixture with Chiral HPLC\n\nAn HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate enantiomers. It creates a chiral environment where enantiomers interact differently with the stationary phase, leading to different retention times. It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   We have a total of five distinct stereoisomers in the final mixture:\n    1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    5.  meso-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   The chiral column will separate the two diastereomers from Reaction I.\n*   The chiral column will separate the two enantiomers from Reaction II.\n*   The meso compound from Reaction II, being a diastereomer of the other products from Reaction II, will also be separated.\n*   Since all five compounds are stereochemically unique (or achiral but diastereomeric to the chiral molecules), they will each interact differently with the chiral stationary phase. Assuming an ideal separation with no accidental co-elution, each compound will produce its own peak.\n\nThe total number of peaks in the chiral HPLC is **5 peaks**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC: 4 peaks\n*   Chiral HPLC: 5 peaks\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
