    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the unknown compound:\n\n**1. Analysis of FTIR Data**\n\n*   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic signature of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding. The peak is characteristically very broad, often spanning from ~2500 cm⁻¹ to ~3300 cm⁻¹.\n*   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration. A value around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for the carbonyl group in a saturated carboxylic acid.\n\nConclusion from FTIR: The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four options (A, B, C, and D) contain a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group, so the FTIR data is consistent with all of them. We must use the NMR data to differentiate them.\n\n**2. Analysis of ¹H NMR Data**\n\nThe crucial information lies in the complex splitting patterns observed for two different signals:\n*   One signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**.\n*   Another signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**.\n\nThe multiplicity of a proton's signal is determined by the number of adjacent, non-equivalent protons (n) according to the n+1 rule. For complex splitting, we consider each group of neighboring protons separately.\n*   Doublet (d): Coupling to 1 neighboring proton.\n*   Triplet (t): Coupling to 2 neighboring protons.\n*   Quartet (q): Coupling to 3 neighboring protons.\n\nTherefore:\n*   **dtq** implies a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: one group with 1 proton, one group with 2 protons, and one group with 3 protons.\n*   **dtt** implies a proton is coupled to three different sets of neighbors: one group with 1 proton, one group with 2 protons, and another group with 2 protons.\n\nNow, let's analyze the structure of each option to see which one would produce both of these signals. We'll determine the IUPAC name for each condensed formula to have a clear structure.\n\n---\n\n**A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 3,4-dimethylhexanoic acid**\n`COOH(1)-CH(a)(CH₃)-CH(b)(CH₃)-CH₂(c)-CH₃(d)`\n*   Let's analyze the proton `H(b)`. It is coupled to `H(a)` (1 neighbor), the `CH₂(c)` group (2 neighbors), and its attached `CH₃` group... wait, no. Vicinal coupling is to neighbors on adjacent carbons. So, `H(b)` is coupled to `H(a)` (1H) and `CH₂(c)` (2H). There is also a methyl group on the same carbon, but that is not vicinal coupling. Let's re-read the structure, the formula must be `CH₃-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`. The chain is 6 carbons long. Let's draw it and label the protons.\n`CH₃(d)-CH₂(c)-CH(b)(CH₃(f))-CH(a)(CH₃(e))-COOH`\n*   **`H(b)`:** Coupled to `H(a)` (1H), `CH₂(c)` (2H), and the protons of the methyl group `CH₃(f)` (3H). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 3H). This would result in a **dtq** signal. So, this molecule has a `dtq` signal.\n*   **`dtt` signal?** A `dtt` requires (1H, 2H, 2H) neighbors. No proton in this molecule has this combination of neighbors. Thus, compound A is incorrect.\n\n**C) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(d)-CH₂(c)-CH(b)(C₂H₅(g))-CH(a)(C₂H₅(f))-COOH`\n*   Let's analyze the proton `H(b)`. It is coupled to `H(a)` (1H), the `CH₂(c)` group (2H), and the `CH₂` of its ethyl substituent `C₂H₅(g)` (2H). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 2H). This would result in a **dtt** signal. So, this molecule has a `dtt` signal.\n*   **`dtq` signal?** A `dtq` requires (1H, 2H, 3H) neighbors. No proton in this molecule has this specific combination. For example, the diastereotopic protons of `CH₂(c)` are coupled to `H(b)` (1H), `CH₃(d)` (3H), and each other (1H), which would give a doublet of doublets of quartets (ddq), not a `dtq`. Thus, compound C is incorrect.\n\n**D) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(d)-CH(c)(CH₃(f))-CH(b)(CH₃(e))-CH₂(a)-COOH`\n*   Let's analyze the proton `H(b)`. It is coupled to `H(c)` (1H), the `CH₂(a)` group (2H), and the protons of its methyl substituent `CH₃(e)` (3H). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 3H). This would result in a **dtq** signal.\n*   **`dtt` signal?** A `dtt` requires (1H, 2H, 2H) neighbors. No proton in this molecule has this combination. Thus, compound D is incorrect.\n\n**B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3,4-diethylpentanoic acid**\n`CH₃(d)-CH(c)(C₂H₅(g))-CH(b)(C₂H₅(f))-CH₂(a)-COOH`\n*   Let's analyze proton **`H(b)`**. It is coupled to the `CH₂(a)` group (2H), `H(c)` (1H), and the `CH₂` protons of its ethyl substituent `C₂H₅(f)` (2H). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 2H). This proton would show a **dtt** (doublet of triplets of triplets) splitting pattern. **This matches one of the required signals.**\n*   Let's analyze proton **`H(c)`**. It is coupled to `H(b)` (1H), the `CH₃(d)` group (3H), and the `CH₂` protons of its ethyl substituent `C₂H₅(g)` (2H). The neighbors are (1H, 2H, 3H). This proton would show a **dtq** (doublet of triplets of quartets) splitting pattern. **This matches the other required signal.**\n\nConclusion: Compound B is the only structure that has one proton (`H(b)`) that would produce a `dtt` signal and another proton (`H(c)`) that would produce a `dtq` signal. Therefore, it is the correct structure.\n\n<<<B>>>"
