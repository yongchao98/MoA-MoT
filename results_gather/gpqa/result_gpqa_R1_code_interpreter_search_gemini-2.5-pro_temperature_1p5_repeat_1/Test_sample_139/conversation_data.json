    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: Substance X contains a heavier isotope.** This points towards elements like hydrogen (Deuterium, D), carbon (¹³C), etc.\n    *   **Clue 2, 3, 4: X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming precipitate G.** A violent reaction with a liquid (often water) is characteristic of highly reactive hydrides or similar compounds.\n    *   **Clue 5 & 6: G, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point very close to 277 K.** 277 K is approximately 4°C. The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82°C (276.97 K). This is a very strong indicator that **B is D₂O**, confirming that the heavy isotope from Clue 1 is Deuterium (D).\n    *   If heating G produces D₂O, then G must be a deuterated hydrate or a compound that decomposes to yield D₂O, like a metal deuteroxide.\n    *   **Clue 3 Revisited: Gas W's molecule has an equal number of neutrons and protons.** Let's analyze some potential gases:\n        *   H₂: 2 protons, 0 neutrons (No)\n        *   D₂: 2 protons (1+1), 2 neutrons (1+1) (Yes)\n        *   N₂: 14 protons (7+7), 14 neutrons (7+7) (Yes)\n        *   C₂H₄: 16 protons, 16 neutrons (Yes)\n        Given that Deuterium is central to the problem, **W = D₂** is the most plausible candidate.\n    *   **Clue 8: X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.** This strongly suggests common laboratory reagents, very likely reducing agents like Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄) or Lithium Aluminium Hydride (LiAlH₄). Their deuterated analogs are NaBD₄ and LiAlD₄.\n    *   **Clue 7: The reaction product of X with a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms.** A keto acid has the general structure R-CO-COOH. Powerful reducing agents like LiAlH₄ reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid functional groups. The reaction `R-CO-COOH + [Reducing Agent]` yields a diol, `R-CH(OH)-CH₂(OH)`. This product molecule contains exactly **2 oxygen atoms**, which perfectly matches the clue.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    Let's test the hypothesis that X is the deuterated analog of LiAlH₄, which is **Lithium Aluminium Deuteride (LiAlD₄)**.\n    *   **Reaction with Y:** LiAlH₄ reacts violently with water. If we assume Y is D₂O (heavy water) to produce D₂ gas, the reaction is: `LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O -> LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂`.\n    *   **Gas W:** The gas produced is D₂, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, matching the clue.\n    *   **Precipitate G:** Aluminium hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is a well-known gelatinous precipitate. Therefore, its deuterated analog, Aluminium deuteroxide (Al(OD)₃), would also be a precipitate. So, **G = Al(OD)₃**.\n    *   **Heating G:** Heating a metal hydroxide causes decomposition into the metal oxide and water. So, heating G (Al(OD)₃) would yield `2Al(OD)₃ -> Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O`. This releases **B = D₂O**, which matches our finding from its melting point.\n    *   All clues fit perfectly with **X = LiAlD₄**.\n    *   (Alternative check: If X were NaBD₄, the reaction `NaBD₄ + 2D₂O -> NaBO₂ + 4D₂` produces the right gas (D₂) but Sodium Metaborate (NaBO₂) is soluble in water, so no precipitate G would form. This rules out NaBD₄).\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    The question asks for the **cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄)**. We should use integer mass numbers for the isotopes involved.\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n    *   **Constituent Elements:** Lithium (Li), Aluminium (Al), and Hydrogen (present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Identify Lightest and Heaviest Elements:** Based on atomic number (Z) or atomic mass, the lightest element is Hydrogen (Z=1) and the heaviest is Aluminium (Z=13).\n    *   **Sum the masses of all atoms of these elements in the molecule:** The formula is LiAlD₄.\n        *   **Lightest Element (Hydrogen):** There are **four** atoms of Deuterium (D). The mass number of D is 2.\n          Total mass from Hydrogen = 4 × (mass of D) = 4 × 2 = 8.\n        *   **Heaviest Element (Aluminium):** There is **one** atom of Aluminium (Al). The mass number of its only stable isotope is 27.\n          Total mass from Aluminium = 1 × (mass of Al) = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   **Calculate the final cumulative mass:**\n        Cumulative Mass = (Total mass from lightest element) + (Total mass from heaviest element)\n        Cumulative Mass = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
