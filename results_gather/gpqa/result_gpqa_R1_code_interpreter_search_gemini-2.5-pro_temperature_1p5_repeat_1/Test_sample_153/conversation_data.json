    "*   **Analysis of Mass Spectrum (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the compound with the most common isotope of chlorine, ³⁵Cl.\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M+2 peak) with a relative abundance of 32%. The ratio of the intensities of the M+ peak (100%) to the M+2 peak (32%) is approximately 3:1. This isotopic pattern is a classic signature for a compound containing a single chlorine atom, due to the natural abundance of its isotopes (³⁵Cl ≈ 75%, ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%).\n    *   All four options (Phenyl chloroformate, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde) have the same chemical formula C₇H₅ClO₂ and a molecular weight of approximately 156.5 g/mol, which is consistent with the mass spectrum data.\n\n*   **Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid dimer.\n    *   A strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. The position is consistent with a carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid that is conjugated with an aromatic ring.\n    *   The combination of these two peaks strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This evidence rules out Phenyl chloroformate (A), which is an acid chloride, and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (D), which is an aldehyde and a phenol. Phenolic -OH peaks are typically broad but usually don't extend as low as 2700 cm⁻¹.\n\n*   **Analysis of Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectrum:**\n    *   **δ = 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H):** A signal this far downfield (>10 ppm) is definitively a proton of a carboxylic acid (-COO**H**). This further confirms the IR analysis and rules out options A and D. The signal is a singlet because carboxylic acid protons are acidic and typically do not couple with other protons due to rapid chemical exchange.\n    *   **δ = 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H) and δ = 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). The key information is the pattern: two doublets, each integrating to two protons (2H). This highly symmetrical pattern is characteristic of a *para*-disubstituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The symmetry makes the two protons on one side of the axis of symmetry chemically equivalent to the two protons on the other side, resulting in only two distinct signals.\n    *   Comparing the remaining options, 2-chlorobenzoic acid (B) has an *ortho* substitution pattern, which would result in four distinct aromatic proton signals with more complex splitting (not two simple doublets).\n    *   4-chlorobenzoic acid (C) has a *para* substitution pattern. This perfectly matches the observed NMR data, giving two doublets for the four aromatic protons. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are more deshielded and appear at a higher chemical shift (8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom are slightly less deshielded and appear at 7.72 ppm.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The combination of all spectral data points unequivocally to 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The MS shows a molecular weight of 156 and the presence of one chlorine atom. The IR and ¹H NMR confirm the presence of a carboxylic acid group. The ¹H NMR aromatic region pattern confirms a *para*-disubstituted benzene ring.\n\n<<<C>>>"
