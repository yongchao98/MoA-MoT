    "This problem requires a step-by-step analysis of the acid-base reactions occurring in the mixed solution.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the number of moles of each reactant: the weak acid (CH3COOH), the strong acid (HCl), and the strong base (Ba(OH)2).\n\n1.  **Moles of Acetic Acid (CH3COOH):**\n    *   Molarity = 0.1 M\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.05 mol\n\n2.  **Moles of Hydrochloric Acid (HCl):**\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.08 mol\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.08 moles of H+ ions.\n\n3.  **Moles of Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2):**\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.09 mol\n    *   Since Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, it dissociates as Ba(OH)2 → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻. Therefore, it provides 2 × 0.09 = 0.18 moles of OH⁻ ions.\n\nNext, we need to determine the net reaction. The strong acid (H⁺ from HCl) and the strong base (OH⁻ from Ba(OH)2) will react first in a neutralization reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Neutralization of Strong Acid and Strong Base**\nThe reaction is H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O.\n*   Initial moles of H⁺ = 0.08 mol\n*   Initial moles of OH⁻ = 0.18 mol\nThe H⁺ ions are the limiting reactant. They will be completely consumed, and there will be an excess of OH⁻ ions.\n*   Moles of OH⁻ remaining = 0.18 mol - 0.08 mol = 0.10 mol\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Remaining Strong Base with Weak Acid**\nThe remaining 0.10 moles of OH⁻ will then react with the weak acid, CH3COOH.\nThe reaction is CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O.\n*   Initial moles of CH₃COOH = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.10 mol\nHere, the CH₃COOH is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n*   Moles of OH⁻ consumed = 0.05 mol\n*   Moles of excess OH⁻ remaining = 0.10 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol\n\nAfter all reactions are complete, the solution contains 0.05 moles of excess OH⁻ ions from the strong base. The presence of a strong base will be the primary determinant of the solution's pH.\n\nNow, we calculate the final concentration of OH⁻ in the total volume of the solution.\n*   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n*   Final concentration of OH⁻, [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n*   [OH⁻] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\nWith the concentration of OH⁻, we can calculate the pOH and then the pH.\n*   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167)\n*   pOH ≈ 1.38\n*   pH = 14 - pOH (assuming standard temperature, 25°C)\n*   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nTherefore, the pH of the final solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<B>>>"
