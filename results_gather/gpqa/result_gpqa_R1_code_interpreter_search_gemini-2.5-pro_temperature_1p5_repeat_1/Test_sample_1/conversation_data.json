    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the number of carbon atoms in the final product.\n\n**Step 1: trans-cinnamaldehyde treated with methylmagnesium bromide**\n\n*   **Reactant 1: trans-cinnamaldehyde**\n    *   The structure is C₆H₅-CH=CH-CHO.\n    *   Let's count the carbon atoms: 6 in the phenyl ring (C₆H₅), 1 in the `-CH=` group, 1 in the `=CH-` group, and 1 in the aldehyde group (`-CHO`).\n    *   Total carbons in cinnamaldehyde = 6 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9 carbons.\n\n*   **Reactant 2: Methylmagnesium bromide (CH₃MgBr)**\n    *   This is a Grignard reagent, which acts as a source of the nucleophilic methyl anion (CH₃⁻). It contains one carbon atom.\n\n*   **Reaction**\n    *   Grignard reagents react with aldehydes via nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl carbon. This is a 1,2-addition reaction.\n    *   The methyl group (CH₃) from the Grignard reagent attacks the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde. After an acidic workup (which is implied in Grignard reactions), the resulting alkoxide is protonated to form an alcohol.\n    *   C₆H₅-CH=CH-CHO + CH₃MgBr → [intermediate] → (workup) → C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH₃\n    *   This reaction adds one carbon atom (from the methyl group) to the cinnamaldehyde skeleton.\n\n*   **Product 1**\n    *   The structure of Product 1 is (E)-1-phenylbut-1-en-3-ol.\n    *   Number of carbons in Product 1 = (carbons in cinnamaldehyde) + (carbons in methyl group) = 9 + 1 = 10 carbons.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 treated with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)**\n\n*   **Reactant: Product 1 (C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH₃)**\n    *   Product 1 is a secondary alcohol. It has 10 carbon atoms.\n\n*   **Reagent: Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)**\n    *   PCC is a mild oxidizing agent that selectively oxidizes secondary alcohols to ketones. It does not affect other functional groups like carbon-carbon double bonds.\n\n*   **Reaction**\n    *   The secondary alcohol group (`-CH(OH)-`) is oxidized to a ketone group (`-C(=O)-`).\n    *   C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH₃ + PCC → C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃\n\n*   **Product 2**\n    *   The structure of Product 2 is (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one (also known as benzalacetone).\n    *   This oxidation reaction does not add or remove any carbon atoms.\n    *   Number of carbons in Product 2 = 10 carbons.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane**\n\n*   **Reactant: Product 2 (C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃)**\n    *   Product 2 is an α,β-unsaturated ketone. It has 10 carbon atoms.\n\n*   **Reagent: (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfaneylidene)methane**\n    *   This is the IUPAC name for dimethylsulfoxonium methylide, ((CH₃)₂S(=O)=CH₂), also known as the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent. This reagent is a sulfur ylide that provides a methylene group (CH₂). It contains one functional carbon atom in the methylene group.\n\n*   **Reaction**\n    *   With α,β-unsaturated ketones, the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent undergoes a conjugate addition (Michael addition) to the carbon-carbon double bond, followed by an intramolecular ring-closure to form a cyclopropane ring.\n    *   The CH₂ group from the ylide is added across the C=C double bond.\n    *   C₆H₅-CH=CH-C(=O)CH₃ + (CH₃)₂S(=O)CH₂ → Product 3 + DMSO\n    *   The reaction adds one carbon atom (from the methylene group) to the skeleton of Product 2.\n\n*   **Product 3**\n    *   The structure of Product 3 is 1-(2-phenylcyclopropyl)ethanone.\n    *   Number of carbons in Product 3 = (carbons in Product 2) + (carbons from the methylene group) = 10 + 1 = 11 carbons.\n\nTo confirm the carbon count through each step:\n1.  **Cinnamaldehyde**: 9 carbons\n2.  **Product 1**: 9 + 1 = 10 carbons\n3.  **Product 2**: 10 carbons (no change)\n4.  **Product 3**: 10 + 1 = 11 carbons\n\nThe final product, Product 3, has 11 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<B>>>"
