    "This question asks for the set of assumptions that together define the impulse approximation in nuclear physics. Let's break down the meaning of the impulse approximation and then evaluate each of the four statements.\n\nThe \"impulse approximation\" is a framework used to describe the interaction of a high-energy probe (like an electron, neutrino, or photon) with a nucleus. The core idea is that the interaction happens so quickly (it's an \"impulse\") that it can be treated as an interaction with a single, individual nucleon (a proton or neutron) inside the nucleus, and that this nucleon behaves as if it were free during the brief moment of the collision.\n\nLet's analyze each statement in this context:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.**\n    This is the foundational principle of the impulse approximation. It simplifies the complex many-body problem by assuming the probe interacts with just one constituent nucleon at a time. It explicitly ignores more complicated effects like meson-exchange currents, where the probe interacts with the particles that mediate the force *between* nucleons. This statement is essential.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.**\n    This assumption deals with what are known as \"final-state interactions\" (FSI) and \"initial-state interactions\" (ISI). For the measurement to reflect a clean interaction with a single \"free\" nucleon, the incoming probe must reach the target nucleon without being disturbed, and the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the ejected nucleon) must exit the nucleus without further interactions. Assuming the rest of the nucleus is \"transparent\" is a way of neglecting these initial and final state interactions. This is a crucial simplification needed to relate the observed event to a free-nucleon process. This statement is essential.\n\n3.  **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.**\n    This statement concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself. The impulse approximation is primarily a statement about the nucleon's state of motion and interaction *within the nucleus*, not about its internal quark-gluon structure. In fact, the impulse approximation is widely used in deep inelastic scattering, a process where the high-energy probe resolves the individual quarks (partons) inside the nucleon, and these quarks are treated as highly relativistic. Therefore, assuming non-relativistic quarks is not a general requirement for the impulse approximation. This statement is not essential.\n\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.**\n    This is the \"impulse\" part of the approximation. The idea is that the interaction time (τ_int) is much shorter than the characteristic time of the nucleon's motion within the nucleus (τ_nuc). The nuclear timescale is determined by the binding energy (~1/8 MeV). If the energy transfer is large, the interaction time is short (by the uncertainty principle, τ_int ~ ħ/E). If τ_int << τ_nuc, then during the very brief interaction, the nucleon doesn't have time to interact with the other nucleons or feel the nuclear potential. It behaves, for that instant, as a free particle. This statement is essential.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe three assumptions that jointly define the impulse approximation are:\n*   The interaction is with a single nucleon (Statement 1).\n*   Initial and final state interactions with other nucleons are ignored (Statement 2).\n*   The binding potential is ignored during the brief interaction (Statement 4).\n\nTherefore, the correct combination of assumptions is 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
