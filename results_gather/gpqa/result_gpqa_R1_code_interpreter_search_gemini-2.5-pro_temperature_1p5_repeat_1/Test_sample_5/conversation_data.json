    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle.\n\n**1. Express the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ):\n$V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr^2 + 3/2 kr^2 cos^2(θ)$\n\nTo analyze this system, it's beneficial to convert the potential into Cartesian coordinates (x, y). The relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:\n$x = r \\cos(θ)$\n$y = r \\sin(θ)$\n$r^2 = x^2 + y^2$\n\nLet's substitute these into the potential expression:\nThe first term is:\n$1/2 * kr^2 = 1/2 * k * (x^2 + y^2)$\n\nThe second term involves $r \\cos(θ)$, which is simply x:\n$3/2 * kr^2 cos^2(θ) = 3/2 * k * (r \\cos(θ))^2 = 3/2 * k * x^2$\n\nNow, combine the two terms to get the full potential in Cartesian coordinates:\n$V(x, y) = 1/2 * k * (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 * k * x^2$\n$V(x, y) = 1/2 * kx^2 + 1/2 * ky^2 + 3/2 * kx^2$\n\nCombine the terms with $x^2$:\n$V(x, y) = (1/2 * k + 3/2 * k) * x^2 + 1/2 * k * y^2$\n$V(x, y) = (4/2 * k) * x^2 + 1/2 * k * y^2$\n$V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + 1/2 * ky^2$\n\n**2. Separate the Hamiltonian**\n\nThe potential $V(x, y)$ is a sum of a function of x only and a function of y only:\n$V(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)$\nwhere:\n$V_x(x) = 2kx^2$\n$V_y(y) = 1/2 * ky^2$\n\nThis means the system is separable. The time-independent Schrödinger equation can be solved by separating the variables x and y. The total energy E will be the sum of the energies from the x-motion ($E_x$) and the y-motion ($E_y$):\n$E = E_x + E_y$\n\n**3. Identify the Potentials as Harmonic Oscillators**\n\nThe potentials $V_x(x)$ and $V_y(y)$ are both of the form of a one-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator, which has the general form:\n$V(z) = 1/2 * m * ω^2 * z^2$, where ω is the angular frequency.\n\n*   **For the x-direction:**\n    $V_x(x) = 2kx^2 = 1/2 * m * ω_x^2 * x^2$\n    By comparing the coefficients, we find:\n    $1/2 * m * ω_x^2 = 2k$\n    $ω_x^2 = 4k/m$\n    $ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 * sqrt(k/m)$\n\n*   **For the y-direction:**\n    $V_y(y) = 1/2 * ky^2 = 1/2 * m * ω_y^2 * y^2$\n    By comparing the coefficients, we find:\n    $1/2 * m * ω_y^2 = 1/2 * k$\n    $ω_y^2 = k/m$\n    $ω_y = sqrt(k/m)$\n\n**4. Determine the Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator are given by the formula:\n$E_n = (n + 1/2) * ℏ * ω$, where n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\nUsing this formula for our two separated oscillators:\n*   The energy for the x-motion is:\n    $E_{n_x} = (n_x + 1/2) * ℏ * ω_x = (n_x + 1/2) * ℏ * (2 * sqrt(k/m))$\n\n*   The energy for the y-motion is:\n    $E_{n_y} = (n_y + 1/2) * ℏ * ω_y = (n_y + 1/2) * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)$\n\nThe total energy E is the sum $E_{n_x} + E_{n_y}$:\n$E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} = (n_x + 1/2) * ℏ * (2 * sqrt(k/m)) + (n_y + 1/2) * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)$\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression by factoring out the common term $ℏ * sqrt(k/m)$:\n$E = [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)$\n$E = [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)$\n$E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)$\n\n**5. Compare with the Options**\n\nThe derived energy spectrum is $E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ℏ * sqrt(k/m)$. This matches option C.\n\nA) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nB) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nC) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\nD) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\n<<<C>>>"
