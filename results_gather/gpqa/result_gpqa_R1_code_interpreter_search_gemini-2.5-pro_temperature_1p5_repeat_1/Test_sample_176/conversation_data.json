    "Here is the reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 to that of Star_2 (`L_1 / L_2`).\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Radius ratio: `R_1 = 1.5 * R_2`  or `R_1 / R_2 = 1.5`\n    *   Mass ratio: `M_1 = 1.5 * M_2` (This turns out to be extra information, not needed for the calculation).\n    *   Observed peak wavelength: `λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2`\n    *   Radial velocities: `v_r1 = 0 km/s`, `v_r2 = 700 km/s`\n    *   Physical model: The stars are assumed to be black body radiators.\n\n3.  **Recall the Relevant Physics Principles:**\n    *   **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a spherical black body is given by `L = 4 * π * R^2 * σ * T^4`, where R is the radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the surface temperature.\n    *   **Wien's Displacement Law:** The peak emission wavelength (`λ_emitted`) of a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature: `λ_emitted * T = b`, where b is Wien's constant.\n    *   **Doppler Effect:** The observed wavelength (`λ_obs`) of light from a moving source is shifted relative to the emitted wavelength (`λ_emitted`). For non-relativistic speeds (`v << c`), the formula is `λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r / c)`, where `v_r` is the radial velocity (positive for receding, negative for approaching) and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n4.  **Formulate a Plan:**\n    a.  Write down the expression for the luminosity ratio `L_1 / L_2` using the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n    b.  Use the given radius ratio to simplify the expression.\n    c.  Determine the ratio of the temperatures `T_1 / T_2`. This will involve relating temperature to the emitted peak wavelength using Wien's Law.\n    d.  Relate the emitted peak wavelengths to the observed peak wavelengths using the Doppler effect formula.\n    e.  Use the fact that the observed peak wavelengths are equal to find a relationship between the emitted wavelengths, and thus the temperatures.\n    f.  Substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio expression.\n    g.  Calculate the final numerical value.\n\n5.  **Execute the Plan:**\n\n    *   **Step a & b: Luminosity Ratio**\n        From the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n        `L_1 / L_2 = (4 * π * R_1^2 * σ * T_1^4) / (4 * π * R_2^2 * σ * T_2^4)`\n        `L_1 / L_2 = (R_1 / R_2)^2 * (T_1 / T_2)^4`\n        Given `R_1 / R_2 = 1.5`:\n        `L_1 / L_2 = (1.5)^2 * (T_1 / T_2)^4 = 2.25 * (T_1 / T_2)^4`\n\n    *   **Step c, d & e: Temperature Ratio**\n        From Wien's Law, `T = b / λ_emitted`. Therefore, the temperature ratio is:\n        `T_1 / T_2 = (b / λ_emitted_1) / (b / λ_emitted_2) = λ_emitted_2 / λ_emitted_1`\n\n        Now we relate emitted and observed wavelengths using the Doppler shift. By convention, a positive radial velocity means the object is receding (redshift).\n        For Star_1: `v_r1 = 0`, so there is no Doppler shift. `λ_obs_1 = λ_emitted_1`.\n        For Star_2: `v_r2 = 700 km/s`, which is positive. `λ_obs_2 = λ_emitted_2 * (1 + v_r2 / c)`.\n\n        We are given `λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2`. Therefore:\n        `λ_emitted_1 = λ_emitted_2 * (1 + v_r2 / c)`\n        Rearranging this gives the ratio of emitted wavelengths:\n        `λ_emitted_2 / λ_emitted_1 = 1 / (1 + v_r2 / c)`\n\n        Substituting this into our temperature ratio expression:\n        `T_1 / T_2 = 1 / (1 + v_r2 / c)`\n\n    *   **Step f: Final Expression**\n        Now, substitute the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n        `L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 * (1 / (1 + v_r2 / c))^4`\n        `L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 / (1 + v_r2 / c)^4`\n\n    *   **Step g: Calculation**\n        The final step is to plug in the values and compute the result. This is best done with a script to maintain precision.\n\n        *   `v_r2 = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s`\n        *   `c ≈ 299,792,458 m/s` (speed of light)\n        *   `R_1/R_2 = 1.5`\n\n```python\n# Constants\nc = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s\n\n# Given values\nR_ratio = 1.5\nvr2 = 700 * 1000  # Radial velocity of Star_2 in m/s\n\n# Calculate v/c for Star 2\nv_over_c = vr2 / c\n\n# Calculate the luminosity ratio\n# L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 / (1 + v_over_c)^4\nluminosity_ratio = (R_ratio**2) / ((1 + v_over_c)**4)\n\nprint(luminosity_ratio)\n```\n```output\n2.229094709841838\n```\nThe calculated ratio is approximately 2.229, which rounds to 2.23. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The reasoning process is as follows:\n\n1.  **Luminosity Relation**: The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio**: We need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to that of Star_2 (L₂):\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Information**: We are given that R₁ = 1.5 * R₂, so (R₁/R₂) = 1.5. Substituting this into the equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n4.  **Temperature Relation**: To find the temperature ratio (T₁/T₂), we use Wien's Displacement Law. This law relates a star's temperature to the peak wavelength at which it emits light (λ_emitted):\n    T = b / λ_emitted\n    where b is Wien's constant.\n    Therefore, the ratio of the temperatures is:\n    T₁/T₂ = (b / λ_emitted,₁) / (b / λ_emitted,₂) = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁\n\n5.  **Doppler Shift**: The observed peak wavelength (λ_obs) is affected by the star's radial velocity (v_r) due to the Doppler effect. The relationship between the emitted and observed wavelength is:\n    λ_obs = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r / c)\n    where c is the speed of light.\n\n6.  **Relating Temperatures to Observations**:\n    *   For Star_1: v_r1 = 0 km/s. There is no Doppler shift, so its observed wavelength is equal to its emitted wavelength: λ_obs,₁ = λ_emitted,₁.\n    *   For Star_2: v_r2 = 700 km/s. It is moving away, so its light is redshifted: λ_obs,₂ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r2 / c).\n    *   We are told that the observed peak wavelengths are the same: λ_obs,₁ = λ_obs,₂.\n    *   Therefore: λ_emitted,₁ = λ_emitted,₂ * (1 + v_r2 / c).\n\n7.  **Calculating Temperature Ratio**: Now we can find the ratio of the emitted wavelengths:\n    λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁ = 1 / (1 + v_r2 / c)\n    Since T₁/T₂ = λ_emitted,₂ / λ_emitted,₁, we have:\n    T₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r2 / c)\n\n8.  **Final Calculation**: Substitute this temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 * (1 / (1 + v_r2 / c))⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r2 / c)⁴\n\n    Using the values:\n    *   v_r2 = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s\n    *   c (speed of light) ≈ 299,792,458 m/s\n    *   The calculation `2.25 / (1 + 700000 / 299792458)⁴` was performed by the code.\n\n9.  **Result**: The code output `2.2291...` is the numerical result of this calculation. This value rounds to 2.23.\n\n<<<B>>>"
