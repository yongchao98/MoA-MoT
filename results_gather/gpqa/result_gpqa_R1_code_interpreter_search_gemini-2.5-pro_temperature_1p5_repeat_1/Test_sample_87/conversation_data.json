    "The user is asking to identify a specific immunological process based on experimental observations. Let's break down the scenario:\n\n1.  **Antigen Administration:** Rotavirus capsid proteins (the antigen) are delivered orally. This mimics a natural infection of the gut.\n2.  **Antigen Trafficking:** The antigen reaches the Peyer's patches, which are key secondary lymphoid organs in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT).\n3.  **Immune Response:** In the Peyer's patches, cells are proliferating. This indicates an active immune response, where antigen-specific lymphocytes are selected and expanding.\n4.  **Genetic Analysis:** The proliferating cells have their variable heavy chain (VH) gene sequenced. The key finding is \"high variability\" in this region. The variable region of an antibody is what binds to the antigen.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options:\n\n*   **A) Complement activation:** This is a humoral part of the innate immune system. It involves a cascade of proteins that help clear pathogens. It does not involve genetic changes in lymphocytes.\n*   **B) VDJ recombination:** This is the process that creates the initial diversity of B cell and T cell receptors. It occurs in *primary* lymphoid organs (bone marrow for B cells) *before* the B cells have encountered an antigen. The experiment describes a process happening in a *secondary* lymphoid organ (Peyer's patch) *after* antigen exposure.\n*   **C) Class switching recombination:** This process changes the constant region of the heavy chain gene, switching the antibody class (e.g., from IgM to IgA, which is important in mucosal immunity). However, it does *not* affect the variable region, so it doesn't account for the observed high variability in the VH gene.\n*   **D) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs in activated B cells within germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs (like Peyer's patches) following antigen stimulation. SHM introduces point mutations specifically into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes (both heavy and light chains). This creates a pool of antibodies with slightly different affinities for the antigen. B cells with higher-affinity receptors are then selected to proliferate, a process known as affinity maturation. This directly leads to the \"high variability\" observed in the variable heavy chain gene of the proliferating cell population.\n\nThe scenario perfectly describes the events leading to and including somatic hypermutation, which is a core component of the germinal center reaction designed to produce high-affinity antibodies.\n\n<<<D>>>"
