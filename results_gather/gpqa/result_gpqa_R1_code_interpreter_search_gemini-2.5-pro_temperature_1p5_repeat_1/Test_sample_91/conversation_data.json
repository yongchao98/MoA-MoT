    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Molar Mass**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule to determine its chemical formula. The given compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let's break it down and count the number of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms:\n*   **(CH3)2C=**: This group has 1 carbon atom in the main chain and 2 methyl (CH3) groups attached. So, C = 1 + 2 = 3, and H = 2 * 3 = 6.\n*   **=CH-**: This group has 1 C and 1 H.\n*   **-CH2-**: This group has 1 C and 2 H.\n*   **-CH(CH3)-**: This group has 1 C in the chain, 1 H in the chain, and one attached methyl group (1 C, 3 H). So, C = 1 + 1 = 2, and H = 1 + 3 = 4.\n*   **-CH2-**: This group has 1 C and 2 H.\n*   **-CH=**: This group has 1 C and 1 H.\n*   **=C(CH3)2**: This group has 1 C in the chain and 2 attached methyl groups. So, C = 1 + 2 = 3, and H = 2 * 3 = 6.\n\nLet's sum the atoms:\n*   Total Carbons (C) = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n*   Total Hydrogens (H) = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n\nSo, the molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\nThe molar mass (M) of C12H22 is:\nM = 12 * (atomic mass of C) + 22 * (atomic mass of H)\nM ≈ 12 * 12 + 22 * 1 = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n\n**2. Calculate the Total Enthalpy of Atomization of the Constituent Elements**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) is calculated based on the formation of the compound from its elements in their standard states (C as graphite solid, H as H2 gas). The calculation involves converting these elements into gaseous atoms.\n\n*   **Enthalpy of atomization of Carbon (C(s) -> C(g))**: Given as 1000 kJ/mol.\n*   **Enthalpy of atomization of Hydrogen (1/2 H2(g) -> H(g))**: We are given the bond energy of H-H is 100 kJ/mol. This corresponds to the reaction H2(g) -> 2H(g). Therefore, the enthalpy of atomization for one mole of H atoms is half of this value:\n    ΔH_atom(H) = (1/2) * BE(H-H) = 100 kJ/mol / 2 = 50 kJ/mol.\n\nNow, for C12H22, the total enthalpy of atomization of the elements is:\nΔH_atom(elements) = (12 * ΔH_atom(C)) + (22 * ΔH_atom(H))\nΔH_atom(elements) = (12 * 1000) + (22 * 50)\nΔH_atom(elements) = 12000 + 1100 = 13100 kJ/mol.\n\n**3. Count the Bonds and Calculate the Total Bond Energy of the Molecule**\n\nNext, we need to count all the chemical bonds in one molecule of C12H22. Let's analyze the structure again: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **C-H bonds**: We already counted the hydrogen atoms, and each is bonded to a carbon atom. So, there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C bonds**: The structure clearly shows two double bonds: one at the beginning `(C=CH)` and one at the end `(CH=C)`. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds**: These are all the single bonds between carbon atoms. Let's count them carefully:\n    *   In (CH3)2C=: 2 bonds connecting the two CH3 groups to the chain.\n    *   Between =CH- and -CH2-: 1 bond.\n    *   Between -CH2- and -CH(CH3)-: 1 bond.\n    *   In -CH(CH3)-: 1 bond connecting the CH3 group to the chain.\n    *   Between -CH(CH3)- and -CH2-: 1 bond.\n    *   Between -CH2- and -CH=: 1 bond.\n    *   In =C(CH3)2: 2 bonds connecting the two CH3 groups to the chain.\n    *   Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\nNow, calculate the total bond energy of the molecule (which is the enthalpy of atomization for the molecule).\n*   Bond energy of C-H = 400 kJ/mol\n*   Bond energy of C=C = 300 kJ/mol\n*   Bond energy of C-C = 200 kJ/mol\n\nTotal Bond Energy = (22 * BE(C-H)) + (9 * BE(C-C)) + (2 * BE(C=C))\nTotal Bond Energy = (22 * 400) + (9 * 200) + (2 * 300)\nTotal Bond Energy = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = 11200 kJ/mol.\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to atomize the elements and the energy released when forming the bonds in the molecule.\nΔHf = ΔH_atom(elements) - Total Bond Energy\nΔHf = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\nΔHf = 1900 kJ/mol.\n\n**5. Compare with Options and Final Answer**\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's look at the options:\nA) 1900 kJ/g\nB) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the total bond energy, an intermediate value)\nC) 67.4 kJ/mol\nD) 11.44 kJ/g\n\nOur calculated value is in kJ/mol. Some options are in kJ/g. Let's convert our result to kJ/g using the molar mass (166 g/mol).\nΔHf (kJ/g) = ΔHf (kJ/mol) / Molar Mass (g/mol)\nΔHf (kJ/g) = 1900 / 166 ≈ 11.4457 kJ/g.\n\nThis value matches option D exactly.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms\nnum_C = 12\nnum_H = 22\n\n# Given data in kJ/mol\nH_atom_C = 1000\nBE_HH = 100\nBE_CC_single = 200\nBE_CC_double = 300\nBE_CH = 400\n\n# Step 1: Molar Mass\nmolar_mass_C = 12  # g/mol\nmolar_mass_H = 1   # g/mol\ntotal_molar_mass = num_C * molar_mass_C + num_H * molar_mass_H\n\n# Step 2: Enthalpy of atomization of elements\nH_atom_H = BE_HH / 2\ntotal_H_atom_elements = num_C * H_atom_C + num_H * H_atom_H\n\n# Step 3: Bond Count and Total Bond Energy\n# C12H22: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\nnum_CH_bonds = 22\nnum_CC_single_bonds = 9\nnum_CC_double_bonds = 2\ntotal_bond_energy = (num_CH_bonds * BE_CH) + (num_CC_single_bonds * BE_CC_single) + (num_CC_double_bonds * BE_CC_double)\n\n# Step 4: Enthalpy of formation in kJ/mol\nenthalpy_of_formation_mol = total_H_atom_elements - total_bond_energy\n\n# Step 5: Enthalpy of formation in kJ/g\nenthalpy_of_formation_g = enthalpy_of_formation_mol / total_molar_mass\n\nprint(f\"Molecular Formula: C{num_C}H{num_H}\")\nprint(f\"Molar Mass: {total_molar_mass} g/mol\")\nprint(f\"Total enthalpy of atomization of elements: {total_H_atom_elements} kJ/mol\")\nprint(f\"Total bond energy of the molecule: {total_bond_energy} kJ/mol\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation: {enthalpy_of_formation_mol} kJ/mol\")\nprint(f\"Enthalpy of formation: {enthalpy_of_formation_g} kJ/g\")\n```\n\n<<<D>>>",
