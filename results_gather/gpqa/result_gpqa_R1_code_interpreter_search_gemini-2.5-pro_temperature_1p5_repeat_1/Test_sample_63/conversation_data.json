    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental data to identify the products of the decomposition.**\n    *   An initial equimolar mixture of two salts, A and B, weighing 7.20 g, is heated. It decomposes completely into a mixture of gases.\n    *   The gas mixture is passed through a series of tubes to identify its components.\n    *   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a strong desiccant, meaning it absorbs water (H₂O). The mass increase of 3.60 g corresponds to the mass of H₂O produced.\n        *   Molar mass of H₂O ≈ 18.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n    *   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases, most commonly carbon dioxide (CO₂). The mass of this tube did not change.\n        *   This is a crucial clue: **no CO₂ was produced.** Therefore, the original salts A and B do not contain carbon.\n    *   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The mass increase of 0.80 g is the mass of the oxygen that reacted.\n        *   Molar mass of O₂ = 32.0 g/mol.\n        *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.0 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n    *   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through all tubes, 2.24 L of a gas C remains, measured at standard temperature and pressure (STP).\n        *   At STP, 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4 L.\n        *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n        *   The decomposition occurred without air. The gas produced is not H₂O, not O₂, and not an acidic gas. The most plausible identity for Gas C, formed from heating nitrogen-containing salts, is nitrogen gas (N₂).\n\n2.  **Determine the elemental composition of the original salts.**\n    *   The products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂. By the law of conservation of mass, the original salts must be composed of Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Nitrogen (N).\n    *   Let's check if the total mass of the elements in the products equals the initial mass of the salt mixture (7.20 g).\n        *   Mass of H = 0.20 mol H₂O * (2 mol H / 1 mol H₂O) * 1.0 g/mol H = 0.40 g.\n        *   Mass of O = (0.20 mol H₂O * 16.0 g/mol O) + (0.025 mol O₂ * 32.0 g/mol O₂) - Mass O in O₂ = (0.20 mol * 16.0 g/mol) + 0.80 g = 3.20 g + 0.80 g = 4.00 g.\n        *   Mass of N = 0.10 mol N₂ * 28.0 g/mol N₂ = 2.80 g.\n        *   Total Mass = 0.40 g (H) + 4.00 g (O) + 2.80 g (N) = 7.20 g.\n    *   This matches the initial mass perfectly, confirming our identification of the products.\n\n3.  **Identify salts A and B.**\n    *   We need to find two salts made of N, H, and O.\n    *   The most common cation formed from H and N is the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺).\n    *   Common anions formed from N and O are the nitrite (NO₂⁻) and nitrate (NO₃⁻) ions.\n    *   Therefore, the most likely candidates for salts A and B are **ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).**\n\n4.  **Use stoichiometry to confirm the identities and quantities.**\n    *   Let `n` be the number of moles for both salt A and salt B (since they are in an equimolar mixture).\n    *   Consider the known thermal decomposition reactions:\n        *   **NH₄NO₂ (s) → N₂ (g) + 2H₂O (g)**\n        *   **2NH₄NO₃ (s) → 2N₂ (g) + O₂ (g) + 4H₂O (g)** (This reaction occurs under specific conditions but fits our products).\n    *   Let's write equations for the total moles of each product based on `n` moles of each salt:\n        *   Total moles N₂ = n (from NH₄NO₂) + n (from NH₄NO₃) = 2n\n        *   Total moles H₂O = 2n (from NH₄NO₂) + 2n (from NH₄NO₃) = 4n\n        *   Total moles O₂ = 0 (from NH₄NO₂) + 0.5n (from NH₄NO₃) = 0.5n\n    *   Now, we use our experimental mole data to solve for `n`:\n        *   From O₂: 0.5n = 0.025 mol  => **n = 0.05 mol**.\n    *   Let's verify this value of `n` with the other products:\n        *   N₂: 2n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 mol. (Matches experiment).\n        *   H₂O: 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.20 mol. (Matches experiment).\n    *   The model is fully consistent. The mixture contained 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n5.  **Answer the specific question.**\n    *   The question asks for the **total number of all atoms in salts A and B**. This typically refers to the sum of atoms in the chemical formulas of the two distinct compounds.\n    *   Salt A: **NH₄NO₂**. Number of atoms = (1 N + 4 H) + (1 N + 2 O) = 2 N + 4 H + 2 O = **8 atoms**.\n    *   Salt B: **NH₄NO₃**. Number of atoms = (1 N + 4 H) + (1 N + 3 O) = 2 N + 4 H + 3 O = **9 atoms**.\n    *   Total number of atoms = 8 (from salt A) + 9 (from salt B) = **17**.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
