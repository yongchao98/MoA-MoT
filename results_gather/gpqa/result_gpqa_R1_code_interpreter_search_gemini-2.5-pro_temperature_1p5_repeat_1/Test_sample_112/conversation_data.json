    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FTIR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹:** A very broad peak in the 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ region is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The broadness is due to strong hydrogen bonding between the acid molecules.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak falls within the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. A peak at ~1700-1725 cm⁻¹ is typical for the C=O group of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an alkene functional group.\n    *   **FTIR Conclusion:** The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Spectrum Data:**\n    *   **Peaks for vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl-hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation confirms the presence of an alkene, supporting the FTIR data.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry Data:**\n    *   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very diagnostic fragment in mass spectrometry. Let's calculate the mass of the carboxyl group ([COOH]⁺):\n        *   Carbon (C): ~12 amu\n        *   Oxygen (O): ~16 amu\n        *   Oxygen (O): ~16 amu\n        *   Hydrogen (H): ~1 amu\n        *   Total Mass = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45 amu.\n    *   **Mass Spec Conclusion:** This fragment strongly confirms the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   From the combined spectral data, we know the unknown compound is a carboxylic acid that also contains an alkene (a C=C double bond).\n    *   A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) by definition contains **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates options B (C6H10O) and C (C6H12O), which only have one oxygen atom.\n    *   We are left with two possibilities: A) C6H12O2 and D) C6H10O2.\n    *   To distinguish between these two, we calculate the **Degree of Unsaturation** (DoU), also known as the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD). The DoU tells us the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The formula is:\n        DoU = C - (H/2) + 1 (for formulas containing only C, H, and O).\n    *   Our identified functional groups tell us what the DoU should be:\n        *   One C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid) contributes 1 to the DoU.\n        *   One C=C double bond (from the alkene) contributes another 1 to the DoU.\n        *   Therefore, the total DoU of the molecule must be 1 + 1 = **2**.\n    *   Now let's calculate the DoU for the remaining options:\n        *   **For A) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 - (12/2) + 1 = 6 - 6 + 1 = **1**. This DoU of 1 only accounts for the C=O in the carboxylic acid. It does not allow for the additional C=C double bond. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n        *   **For D) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 - (10/2) + 1 = 6 - 5 + 1 = **2**. This DoU of 2 perfectly matches our required value, accounting for both the carboxylic acid's C=O bond and the alkene's C=C bond.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe spectroscopic evidence points to a molecule with a carboxylic acid group and an alkene group. This structure requires two oxygen atoms and two degrees of unsaturation. Only the chemical formula C6H10O2 satisfies these requirements.\n\n<<<D>>>"
