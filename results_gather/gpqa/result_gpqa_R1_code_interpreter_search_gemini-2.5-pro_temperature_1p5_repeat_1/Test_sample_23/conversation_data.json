    "Here is my reasoning and thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Identify Hydrocarbon Z**\n\n*   The problem states Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n*   The mass fraction is given by: %H = (mass of H / total mass) * 100%.\n*   Let's test the general formulas for hydrocarbons.\n    *   For an alkane (CₙH₂ₙ₊₂): %H = (2n + 2) / (12n + 2n + 2) = (2n + 2) / (14n + 2). Setting this to 0.1428 (14.28%) does not yield an integer solution for n.\n    *   For a cycloalkane (CₙH₂ₙ): %H = (2n) / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7.\n*   Let's calculate 1/7 as a percentage: `1 / 7 ≈ 0.142857`, which is 14.2857%. This is a perfect match for the given 14.28%.\n*   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   The problem also states that Z is widely used as a solvent and is a liquid. Common cycloalkane solvents are cyclopentane (C₅H₁₀) and cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). Both fit the formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n*   Z does not react further with hydrogen, confirming it is saturated.\n\n**2. Deduce the Components of Mixture Y**\n\n*   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic.\n*   One component of Y is Z.\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only Z. This means that both components of Y, when hydrogenated, yield Z.\n*   Let the two components be Y₁ and Y₂. We know Y₁ = Z.\n*   So, hydrogenation of Y₂ must give Z. Since Y₂ doesn't decolorize bromine water, it cannot be an alkene or alkyne. It must have the same carbon skeleton as Z.\n*   If we assume Z is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), then Y₂ must be a C₆ compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane but is not an alkene. The only common compound that fits this description is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic and does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions. It can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions (high pressure/temperature with a catalyst).\n*   If Z were cyclopentane, there isn't a simple, stable aromatic counterpart like benzene. This makes cyclohexane the much more likely identity for Z.\n*   So, we conclude:\n    *   **Z = Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**\n    *   **Mixture Y = {Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), Benzene (C₆H₆)}**\n    *   This is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that do not decolorize bromine water. This fits the description perfectly.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reaction from X to Y**\n\n*   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X₁ and X₂.\n*   It undergoes a disproportionation reaction when heated with platinum to form the equimolar mixture Y.\n*   Since X and Y are both equimolar, the reaction stoichiometry must be 1:1 → 1:1.\n    `X₁ + X₂ --(Pt, heat)--> Y₁ + Y₂`\n*   Substituting the components of Y, we get:\n    `X₁ + X₂ --> Cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) + Benzene (C₆H₆)`\n*   Hydrogenation of mixture X also gives only Z (cyclohexane). This means X₁ and X₂ must both have a six-membered carbon ring skeleton. So they can be represented as C₆Hₐ and C₆Hₙ.\n\n**4. Determine the Number of Hydrogen Atoms in X**\n\n*   From the balanced chemical reaction above, we can apply the law of conservation of atoms. Since all molecules involved have 6 carbon atoms, we only need to balance the hydrogen atoms.\n*   Total H atoms in reactants = Total H atoms in products\n*   Number of H in X₁ + Number of H in X₂ = Number of H in C₆H₁₂ + Number of H in C₆H₆\n*   Number of H in X₁ + Number of H in X₂ = 12 + 6\n*   **Total H atoms = 18**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component. Our calculation shows this sum is 18.\n\n**5. Final Verification of the Components of X**\n\n*   Let's check if we can find two molecules for mixture X that fit the description.\n*   H atoms in X₁ + H atoms in X₂ = 18.\n*   X₁ and X₂ decolorize bromine water, so they must be unsaturated (contain C=C bonds). This means they have fewer than 12 hydrogen atoms each.\n*   They must not have conjugated multiple bonds.\n*   The possible non-conjugated unsaturated C₆ ring compounds are:\n    *   **Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀)**: One double bond, not conjugated.\n    *   **1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈)**: Two double bonds separated by CH₂ groups, so they are isolated (not conjugated). Note: 1,3-Cyclohexadiene is conjugated and thus excluded.\n*   Let's check the sum of hydrogen atoms for this pair: 10 + 8 = 18.\n*   This pair fits all conditions:\n    *   Equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   Both decolorize bromine water.\n    *   No conjugated bonds.\n    *   Hydrogenation of both C₆H₁₀ and C₆H₈ gives C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane).\n    *   The reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ --> C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is a valid hydrogen transfer (disproportionation), producing an equimolar mixture of products.\n\nThe logic is consistent throughout. The total number of hydrogen atoms in the molecules of the two liquids constituting mixture X is 18.\n\n```python\n# This script confirms the %H calculation and the final answer based on atom conservation.\n\n# 1.

    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z:**\n    *   The problem states that Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   Let the formula of the hydrocarbon be CₓHᵧ. The mass fraction of hydrogen is given by `(y * 1.008) / (x * 12.011 + y * 1.008)`. For simplicity, we can use integer masses: `y / (12x + y)`.\n    *   Let's test the general formula for cycloalkanes, CₙH₂ₙ. The mass fraction of hydrogen would be `2n / (12n + 2n) = 2n / 14n = 1/7`.\n    *   Calculating `1/7` as a percentage gives `(1/7) * 100% ≈ 14.2857%`. This is a perfect match for the given value.\n    *   Therefore, Z is a cycloalkane with the formula CₙH₂ₙ.\n    *   The problem also states that Z is a liquid widely used as a solvent and does not react further with hydrogen (it's saturated). The most common cycloalkane fitting this description is **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂)**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Components of Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning its components are saturated or aromatic.\n    *   We are told that Z (cyclohexane) is one of the components of mixture Y.\n    *   Hydrogenation of mixture Y under severe conditions gives *only* Z (cyclohexane). This means both components of Y must have a six-carbon skeleton.\n    *   Let the components of Y be Y₁ and Y₂. We know Y₁ is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). The other component, Y₂, must also produce cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. Since Y₂ does not decolorize bromine water, it cannot be an alkene. The only common C₆ compound that is not an alkene but can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane is **benzene (C₆H₆)**. Benzene is aromatic and does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions, but it is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions (high temperature/pressure).\n    *   Therefore, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of **cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction from Mixture X to Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture X (an equimolar mixture of two liquids, X₁ and X₂) is converted into mixture Y (cyclohexane and benzene) through a disproportionation reaction. A disproportionation reaction is one where a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. In this context, it refers to a hydrogen transfer reaction.\n    *   The reaction is: `X₁ + X₂ --(Pt, heat)--> C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆`\n    *   We are also told that hydrogenating mixture X gives only Z (cyclohexane). This implies that both X₁ and X₂ are C₆ hydrocarbons with a ring structure, which become C₆H₁₂ upon adding hydrogen.\n    *   The reaction involves molecules that all have 6 carbon atoms. Therefore, we can find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants (mixture X) by applying the law of conservation of mass to the hydrogen atoms.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X:**\n    *   According to the law of conservation of atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants must equal the total number of hydrogen atoms in the products.\n    *   Total H atoms in products = (H atoms in one molecule of cyclohexane) + (H atoms in one molecule of benzene)\n    *   Total H atoms in products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of each) must also be 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n(For a complete picture, a plausible identity for mixture X would be cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈). They both decolorize bromine water, have no conjugated bonds, and their total hydrogen count is 10 + 8 = 18. The disproportionation reaction `C₆H₁₀ + C₆H₈ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆` is chemically sound.)\n\n<<<D>>>"
