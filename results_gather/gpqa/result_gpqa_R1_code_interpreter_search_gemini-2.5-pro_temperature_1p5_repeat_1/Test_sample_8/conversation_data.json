    "*   **Analysis of Symmetry for Each Molecule**\n\n    1.  **C) Triisopropyl borate (B(OCH(CH₃)₂)₃)**:\n        *   Structure: A central boron atom is bonded to three isopropoxy groups. The B(O)₃ core is trigonal planar.\n        *   Symmetry elements: The isopropyl groups (-CH(CH₃)₂) are not planar and can rotate around the B-O and O-C bonds. Due to steric hindrance, the most stable conformation is likely a \"propeller\" shape where all three isopropyl groups are twisted in the same direction.\n        *   This propeller conformation would possess a C₃ rotational axis passing through the boron atom, perpendicular to the B(O)₃ plane.\n        *   However, it lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σh) because reflecting the atoms of the isopropyl groups (which are out of the B(O)₃ plane) across this plane does not result in an identical configuration. The atoms above the plane would be mapped to empty space below the plane.\n        *   Therefore, its point group is most likely C₃, not C₃h.\n\n    2.  **B) Quinuclidine (1-Azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)**:\n        *   Structure: A rigid bicyclic amine with a cage-like structure.\n        *   Symmetry elements: There is a C₃ rotational axis that passes through the nitrogen atom and the opposing bridgehead carbon atom (CH).\n        *   There are also three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the C₃ axis and pass through the middle of one of the three -(CH₂)₂- bridges.\n        *   The presence of a C₃ axis and three σv planes defines the C₃v point group.\n        *   It does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Thus, its point group is C₃v, not C₃h.\n\n    3.  **D) Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**:\n        *   Structure: This is the chemical name for mellitic trianhydride. It consists of a central benzene ring fused with three anhydride rings. The anhydride groups are formed from adjacent pairs of carboxylic acids (from mellitic acid, which is benzene-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexacarboxylic acid).\n        *   The molecule is completely planar.\n        *   Symmetry elements:\n            *   It has a C₃ rotational axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n            *   The plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σh).\n            *   The definition of the C₃h point group requires a C₃ axis and a σh plane perpendicular to it. This molecule fits the definition.\n            *   Let's check for higher symmetry. It does not possess any C₂ axes perpendicular to the C₃ axis, nor does it have any vertical mirror planes (σv). The \"twist\" of the anhydride C-O-C bonds breaks these potential symmetries.\n        *   Therefore, the point group of this molecule is exactly C₃h.\n\n    4.  **A) Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**:\n        *   Structure: This molecule is analogous to mellitic trianhydride but is built on a larger triphenylene core instead of a benzene core. It is also a planar molecule.\n        *   Symmetry elements:\n            *   Like the previous molecule, it has a C₃ axis and a σh plane (the molecular plane).\n            *   However, due to the higher symmetry of the triphenylene core, it possesses additional symmetry elements. It has three C₂ axes lying in the molecular plane, passing through the center of the molecule.\n            *   The presence of a C₃ axis, three perpendicular C₂ axes, and a σh plane means the molecule belongs to the D₃h point group.\n        *   While a molecule with D₃h symmetry does contain all the symmetry operations of the C₃h group, its full point group is D₃h. In chemistry questions of this type, one typically looks for the molecule whose point group is precisely the one asked.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n\n    Comparing the point groups of the four molecules:\n    *   A) D₃h\n    *   B) C₃v\n    *   C) C₃ (most likely)\n    *   D) C₃h\n\n    The only molecule that belongs to the C₃h point group is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.\n\n<<<D>>>"
