    "This is a classic problem in peptide analysis that points to a specific type of isomerism. Let's break down the evidence provided.\n\n1.  **¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** Two peaks for a single alpha-proton.\n    *   **Observation:** The peaks have roughly equal integrals, and the total integral is correct (1H).\n    *   **Interpretation:** This tells us that the alpha-proton exists in two distinct chemical environments. Since it's the same proton on the same molecule, this means there must be two different forms (isomers) of the molecule present in solution, in approximately a 1:1 ratio. The fact that we see two sharp peaks instead of one broad peak indicates that the exchange between these two forms is slow on the NMR timescale (typically, the rate of exchange is less than the difference in frequency between the two peaks).\n\n2.  **LC-MS Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** Two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities at elevated temperature.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The liquid chromatography (LC) is able to physically separate the two forms of the molecule. This confirms they are distinct chemical species. The \"elevated temperature\" is a key clue; it often helps to sharpen peaks for compounds that are slowly interconverting, suggesting an energy barrier between the two forms.\n    *   **Observation:** Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected product.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This is a crucial piece of information. It confirms that the two species are isomers (same molecular formula, same mass) and not an impurity like a precursor or a side-product from \"double coupling,\" both of which would have different masses.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have different physical properties and can be separated by standard chromatography (like LC). They would also give different NMR spectra. A common source of diastereomerism in peptides is **cis-trans isomerism** around the amide bond. Due to the partial double-bond character of the C-N bond in an amide, rotation is restricted, leading to stable *cis* and *trans* conformers. These conformers are diastereomers and interconvert slowly, fitting all the observations perfectly: two species, same mass, separable by LC, and giving distinct NMR signals. This is especially common for X-Proline amide bonds. Another possibility is epimerization at an alpha-carbon during synthesis, which also produces diastereomers. In either case, the observation points to a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. They cannot be distinguished or separated by standard ¹H NMR or standard LC. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This would mean an extra amino acid was added, resulting in a product with a higher molecular weight. The mass spectrometry data, which shows both peaks have the mass of the *expected* molecule, directly refutes this. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor (a starting material or an intermediate) would have a different chemical structure and almost certainly a different molecular weight. The mass spectrometry data rules this out. This option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to the presence of two isomers that are separable by standard analytical techniques and have the same mass. This eliminates enantiomers and impurities of different masses. The two species must be diastereomers. The most common phenomenon that explains this exact set of data in peptides is the slow interconversion of *cis* and *trans* isomers around an amide bond, which are a specific type of diastereomer called atropisomers or rotamers.\n\n<<<A>>>"
