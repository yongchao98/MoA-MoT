    "**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n1.  **Analyze Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with three carbonyl (C=O) groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons at positions 2, 4, and 6 are methylene groups (-CH₂-).\n    *   Tautomerism, specifically keto-enol tautomerism, requires the presence of an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group).\n    *   In cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the hydrogen atoms on the -CH₂- groups (at C-2, C-4, and C-6) are α-hydrogens. Each of these carbons is adjacent to two carbonyl groups, which makes the α-hydrogens particularly acidic and easy to remove.\n    *   The removal of a proton and rearrangement of electrons leads to the formation of an enol. In this case, the molecule can undergo enolization at all three positions to form 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol).\n    *   **Keto form:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione\n    *   **Enol form:** 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (Phloroglucinol)\n    *   The enol form (phloroglucinol) is an aromatic compound, which makes it exceptionally stable. Due to this high stability of the aromatic enol form, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione exists predominantly as its tautomer, phloroglucinol.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione clearly exhibits tautomerism.\n\n2.  **Analyze Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   The structure is a six-membered ring with two double bonds and two carbonyl groups at opposite (para) positions.\n    *   The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the carbon-carbon double bonds within the ring (`...-C(=O)-CH=C-...`).\n    *   These α-carbons are sp² hybridized and do not have the typical sp³ hybridized C-H bond that readily participates in keto-enol tautomerism.\n    *   While benzoquinone can be converted to hydroquinone (1,4-dihydroxybenzene), this is a reduction reaction (addition of two hydrogen atoms) and not a simple intramolecular proton shift that defines tautomerism.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does not have the necessary α-hydrogens on an sp³ carbon and thus does not undergo keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*Therefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.*\n\n---\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n1.  **Analyze Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Optical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules. A common feature of chirality is a stereocenter, typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (C-2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl group. The four groups attached to this carbon are:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   Since all four groups are different, this carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   A molecule with a single chiral center is always chiral and will have two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and will show optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **Analyze Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans* isomer of butenedioic acid.\n    *   The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the two -COOCH₃ groups on opposite sides of the C=C double bond.\n    *   To exhibit optical isomerism, the molecule must be chiral (not superimposable on its mirror image).\n    *   Dimethyl fumarate does not contain any chiral centers (no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups).\n    *   Furthermore, the molecule possesses a center of symmetry (an inversion center) at the midpoint of the C=C bond. A molecule with a center of symmetry is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate is an achiral molecule and will not show optical isomerism.\n\n*Therefore, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.*\n\n---\n\n**Final Summary:**\n\n*   **A (does not show tautomerism):** Benzoquinone\n*   **B (shows optical isomerism):** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
