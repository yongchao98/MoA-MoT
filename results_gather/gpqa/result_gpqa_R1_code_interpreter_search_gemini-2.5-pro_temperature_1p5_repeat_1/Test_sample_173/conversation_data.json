    "Here is a step-by-step reasoning process to solve the problem:\n\n### 1. Understand the Initial and Final States\n\n*   **Initial State:** A nucleus of mass `M` is at rest.\n    *   Initial total energy: `E_initial = M * c^2 = 300 GeV`\n    *   Initial momentum: `P_initial = 0`\n\n*   **Final State:** The nucleus splits into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n    *   Let `m1` be the more massive fragment. We are given `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n    *   The sum of the rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n    *   The fragments will have kinetic energies `T1` and `T2` and momenta `p1` and `p2`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Rest-Masses and Kinetic Energy Released\n\nFirst, let's find the rest-masses `m1` and `m2` in terms of `M`.\nWe have a system of two equations:\n1) `m1 = 2 * m2`\n2) `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n\nSubstitute (1) into (2):\n`2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3 * m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nNext, let's find their rest-mass energies in GeV:\n*   `m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`\n*   `m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`\n\nThe total kinetic energy `Q` released in the fission is the \"missing\" mass, which is converted into energy.\n`Q = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: `Q = T1 + T2 = 3 GeV`.\n\n### 3. Relativistic Calculation of T1 (Correct Value)\n\nWe must use the laws of conservation of energy and momentum.\n*   **Energy Conservation:** `M*c^2 = (T1 + m1*c^2) + (T2 + m2*c^2)`. We've already used this to find Q.\n*   **Momentum Conservation:** Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the total final momentum must be zero. `p1 + p2 = 0`. This means the magnitudes of their momenta are equal: `|p1| = |p2| = p`.\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (`E`), kinetic energy (`T`), momentum (`p`), and rest-mass (`m`) is:\n`E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\nwhere `E = T + m*c^2`.\nSubstituting `E` gives:\n`(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n`T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2 + (m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n`(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`\n\nSince the momenta are equal in magnitude, `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*m1*c^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2*c^2`\n\nWe also know `T2 = Q - T1`. Let's substitute this into the equation:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*m1*c^2 = (Q - T1)^2 + 2*(Q - T1)*m2*c^2`\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*m1*c^2 = Q^2 - 2*Q*T1 + T1^2 + 2*Q*m2*c^2 - 2*T1*m2*c^2`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out. Now, we group the `T1` terms to solve for `T1`:\n`2*T1*m1*c^2 + 2*Q*T1 + 2*T1*m2*c^2 = Q^2 + 2*Q*m2*c^2`\n`T1 * (2*m1*c^2 + 2*m2*c^2 + 2*Q) = Q^2 + 2*Q*m2*c^2`\nThe term in the parenthesis is `2 * (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2 + Q) = 2 * E_final = 2 * E_initial = 2 * M*c^2`.\n`T1 * (2 * M*c^2) = Q * (Q + 2*m2*c^2)`\n`T1 = (Q * (Q + 2*m2*c^2)) / (2 * M*c^2)`\n\nNow, we plug in the values (in GeV):\n`Q = 3`\n`m2*c^2 = 99`\n`M*c^2 = 300`\n\n`T1 = (3 * (3 + 2 * 99)) / (2 * 300)`\n`T1 = (3 * (3 + 198)) / 600`\n`T1 = (3 * 201) / 600`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### 4. Classical Calculation of T1 (Approximation)\n\nIn classical (non-relativistic) mechanics, the kinetic energy is `T = p^2 / (2m)`.\nFrom momentum conservation, `p1 = p2 = p`.\nSo, `T1_c = p^2 / (2*m1)` and `T2_c = p^2 / (2*m2)`.\n\nThis implies a relationship between their kinetic energies:\n`p^2 = 2*m1*T1_c = 2*m2*T2_c`\n`m1 * T1_c = m2 * T2_c`\n`T1_c / T2_c = m2 / m1`\n\nSince `m1 = 2*m2`, the ratio `m2 / m1 = 1/2`.\n`T1_c / T2_c = 1/2`, which means `T2_c = 2 * T1_c`.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is still `Q = T1_c + T2_c = 3 GeV`.\nSubstitute `T2_c`:\n`3 GeV = T1_c + 2 * T1_c = 3 * T1_c`\n`T1_c = 3 GeV / 3 = 1 GeV`\n\n### 5. Calculate the Difference\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) value `T1` and the classical approximation `T1_c`.\n`Difference = T1 - T1_c`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nTo express the answer in MeV, we multiply by 1000:\n`Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV`\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n```python\n# All energy values are in GeV.\n# Initial rest-mass energy of the nucleus\nMc2 = 300.0\n\n# Calculate rest-mass energies of the two fragments\n# Given m1 = 2*m2 and m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n# This leads to m1*c^2 = 0.66*Mc2 and m2*c^2 = 0.33*Mc2\nm1c2 = 0.66 * Mc2\nm2c2 = 0.33 * Mc2\n\n# Calculate the total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission\nQ = Mc2 - (m1c2 + m2c2)\n\n# --- Correct Relativistic Calculation for T1 ---\n# From conservation of energy and momentum, we derived the formula:\n# T1 = (Q * (Q + 2*m2*c^2)) / (2 * M*c^2)\nT1_relativistic = (Q * (Q + 2 * m2c2)) / (2 * Mc2)\n\n# --- Classical (Non-relativistic) Calculation for T1 ---\n# From conservation of momentum in classical mechanics (m1*v1 = m2*v2),\n# it follows that T1/T2 = m2/m1.

    "An atomic nucleus with a rest-mass energy of `E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV` is initially at rest. It fissions into two fragments with rest-masses `m1` and `m2`.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the rest-masses of the fragments.\n\nWe are given two conditions:\n1.  One fragment is twice as massive as the other: `m1 = 2 * m2`.\n2.  The sum of their rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass: `m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M`.\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second:\n`2*m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`3*m2 = 0.99 * M`\n`m2 = 0.33 * M`\n\nNow, find `m1`:\n`m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M`\n\nWe can express their rest-mass energies in GeV:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1: `m1*c^2 = 0.66 * (M*c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV`.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2: `m2*c^2 = 0.33 * (M*c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV`.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the total kinetic energy released (Q-value).\n\nThe energy released, `Q`, is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the total final rest-mass energy. This released energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments.\n`Q = T1 + T2 = E_initial - (m1*c^2 + m2*c^2)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV)`\n`Q = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV`\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the kinetic energy T1 using the classical approximation.\n\nIn the classical (non-relativistic) framework, we use the conservation of momentum. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the final momenta of the fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: `p1 = p2 = p`.\n\nThe kinetic energy is `T_c = p^2 / (2m)`.\nTherefore, `T1_c = p^2 / (2*m1)` and `T2_c = p^2 / (2*m2)`.\n\nThis gives us a relationship between the kinetic energies:\n`p^2 = 2*m1*T1_c = 2*m2*T2_c`\n`T1_c / T2_c = m2 / m1 = m2 / (2*m2) = 1/2`\nSo, `T2_c = 2 * T1_c`.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is `Q = T1_c + T2_c`. Substituting the relationship above:\n`3 GeV = T1_c + 2 * T1_c = 3 * T1_c`\n`T1_c = 1 GeV`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the correct kinetic energy T1 using relativistic mechanics.\n\nThe relativistic relationship between total energy (`E`), momentum (`p`), and rest-mass (`m`) is `E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`. The total energy is also `E = T + m*c^2`, where `T` is the kinetic energy.\n\nSubstituting for `E`, we can solve for `(p*c)^2`:\n`(T + m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n`T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2 + (m*c^2)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2`\n`(p*c)^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2`\n\nFrom momentum conservation, `p1 = p2`, so `(p1*c)^2 = (p2*c)^2`.\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*m1*c^2 = T2^2 + 2*T2*m2*c^2`\n\nWe also know `T2 = Q - T1 = 3 GeV - T1`. Let's substitute this into the equation:\n`T1^2 + 2*T1*(198) = (3 - T1)^2 + 2*(3 - T1)*(99)`\n`T1^2 + 396*T1 = (9 - 6*T1 + T1^2) + (594 - 198*T1)`\n\nThe `T1^2` terms on both sides cancel out. Now, group the terms with `T1` to solve for `T1`:\n`396*T1 = 9 - 6*T1 + 594 - 198*T1`\n`396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1`\n`396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603`\n`600*T1 = 603`\n`T1 = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV`\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the difference.\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct value (`T1`) and the classical approximation (`T1_c`).\n`Difference = T1 - T1_c`\n`Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV`\n\nFinally, convert the answer to Mega-electron Volts (MeV):\n`Difference = 0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV`\n\n<<<D>>>"
