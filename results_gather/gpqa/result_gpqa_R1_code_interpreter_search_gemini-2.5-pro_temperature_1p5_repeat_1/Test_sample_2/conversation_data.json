    "Here is the step-by-step reasoning to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the quantum state and the operator.**\n    The quantum state of the spin-half particle is given by the superposition:\n    `|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩`\n    This can be written in vector notation, where `|↑⟩ = [1, 0]^T` and `|↓⟩ = [0, 1]^T`:\n    `|ψ⟩ = 0.5 * [1, 0]^T + (√3)/2 * [0, 1]^T = [0.5, √3/2]^T`\n\n    The operator for which we need to find the expectation value is:\n    `O = 10σ_z + 5σ_x`\n\n2.  **Recall the matrix representations of the Pauli operators.**\n    `σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]`\n    `σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n\n3.  **Construct the matrix for the operator O.**\n    `O = 10 * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] + 5 * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`\n    `O = [[10, 0], [0, -10]] + [[0, 5], [5, 0]]`\n    `O = [[10, 5], [5, -10]]`\n\n4.  **Calculate the expectation value.**\n    The expectation value `⟨O⟩` for a state `|ψ⟩` is given by the formula `⟨O⟩ = ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩`.\n\n    *   First, find the bra vector `⟨ψ|`, which is the conjugate transpose of `|ψ⟩`. Since the components are real, it's just the transpose:\n        `⟨ψ| = [0.5, √3/2]`\n\n    *   Now, we compute the product `⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩`:\n        `⟨O⟩ = [0.5, √3/2] * [[10, 5], [5, -10]] * [0.5, √3/2]^T`\n\n    This calculation can be done step-by-step or using a computational tool for precision.\n\nAn alternative, and often simpler, method is to use the linearity of expectation values:\n`⟨O⟩ = ⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ = 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩`\n\n*   **Calculate `⟨σ_z⟩`:**\n    For a state `|ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩`, the expectation value is `⟨σ_z⟩ = |a|^2 - |b|^2`.\n    Here, `a = 0.5` and `b = √3/2`.\n    `⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.5)^2 - (√3/2)^2 = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5`\n\n*   **Calculate `⟨σ_x⟩`:**\n    For the same state, `⟨σ_x⟩ = 2 * Re(a*b)`.\n    Here, `a*b = 0.5 * (√3/2) = √3/4`. Both are real, so `Re(a*b) = √3/4`.\n    `⟨σ_x⟩ = 2 * (√3/4) = √3/2`\n\n*   **Combine the results:**\n    `⟨O⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2)`\n    `⟨O⟩ = -5 + 2.5 * √3`\n\nNow, let's compute the final numerical value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the final value\nsqrt_3 = math.sqrt(3)\nexpectation_value = -5 + 2.5 * sqrt_3\n\n# Print the result rounded to one decimal place\nprint(f\"{expectation_value:.1f}\")\n```\n-0.7\n\nThe result of the calculation is approximately -0.67, which rounds to -0.7 to one decimal place.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) -1.4\nB) -0.7\nC) 0.85\nD) 1.65\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>",
    "The problem asks for the expectation value of the operator `O = 10σ_z + 5σ_x` for a spin-half particle in the state `|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩`.\n\n**1. Define the State and Operator**\n\n*   The quantum state is given by `|ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩`, where `a = 0.5` and `b = √3/2`.\n*   The operator is `O = 10σ_z + 5σ_x`.\n\n**2. Use the Linearity of Expectation Values**\n\nThe expectation value of a sum of operators is the sum of their individual expectation values.\n`⟨O⟩ = ⟨10σ_z + 5σ_x⟩ = 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩`\n\n**3. Calculate the Expectation Value of `σ_z`**\n\nThe expectation value of `σ_z` for the state `|ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩` is given by `⟨σ_z⟩ = |a|² - |b|²`.\n*   `a = 0.5`\n*   `b = √3/2`\n\n`⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.5)² - (√3/2)² = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5`\n\n**4. Calculate the Expectation Value of `σ_x`**\n\nThe expectation value of `σ_x` for the state `|ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩` is given by `⟨σ_x⟩ = a*b + ab*`, where `*` denotes the complex conjugate. Since our coefficients `a` and `b` are real, this simplifies to `⟨σ_x⟩ = 2ab`.\n*   `a = 0.5`\n*   `b = √3/2`\n\n`⟨σ_x⟩ = 2 * (0.5) * (√3/2) = 1 * (√3/2) = √3/2`\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Expectation Value**\n\nNow, substitute the individual expectation values back into the equation for `⟨O⟩`:\n`⟨O⟩ = 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩`\n`⟨O⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * (√3/2)`\n`⟨O⟩ = -5 + 2.5 * √3`\n\n**6. Compute the Numerical Value**\n\nUsing the value `√3 ≈ 1.732`:\n`⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732`\n`⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33`\n`⟨O⟩ ≈ -0.67`\n\nRounding to one decimal place, we get -0.7. The provided code output confirms this calculation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe expectation value of the operator `10σ_z + 5σ_x` is -0.7.\n\n<<<B>>>"
