    "This problem requires us to calculate the factor by which the ratio of the population of two energy levels of neutral Titanium (Ti) changes. This ratio is governed by the Boltzmann equation, as we assume the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n### 1. The Boltzmann Equation\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two energy levels (2 and 1) is given by the Boltzmann equation:\n\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T)]\n\nwhere:\n-   N₂, N₁ are the number of atoms in energy levels 2 and 1.\n-   g₂, g₁ are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of the levels.\n-   E₂, E₁ are the energies of the levels.\n-   k is the Boltzmann constant (8.617333 × 10⁻⁵ eV/K).\n-   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n### 2. Defining the Ratios\n\nLet's define the ratio for the two scenarios:\n-   **Without spots:** The temperature is T_nospots = 6000 K. The ratio is R_nospots.\n    R_nospots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_nospots)]\n\n-   **With spots:** The temperature is T_spots = 5500 K. The ratio is R_spots.\n    R_spots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_spots)]\n\n### 3. Calculating the Factor\n\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. This is the ratio of R_nospots to R_spots.\n\nFactor = R_nospots / R_spots\n\nFactor = { (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_nospots)] } / { (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_spots)] }\n\nThe statistical weight term (g₂ / g₁) cancels out:\n\nFactor = exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_nospots)] / exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_spots)]\n\nUsing the property of exponents (exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)):\n\nFactor = exp[ -(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_nospots) - (-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T_spots)) ]\nFactor = exp[ (E₂ - E₁) / k * (1 / T_spots - 1 / T_nospots) ]\n\n### 4. Finding the Energy Difference (E₂ - E₁)\n\nThe energy difference corresponds to the energy of a photon with the given transition wavelength (λ = 1448 Å). The energy (E) of a photon is given by:\n\nE = h * c / λ\n\nwhere:\n-   h is the Planck constant (4.135667 × 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s).\n-   c is the speed of light (2.99792458 × 10⁸ m/s).\n-   λ is the wavelength (1448 Å = 1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m).\n\nThe product h*c is a useful constant, approximately 1.2398 × 10⁻⁶ eV·m.\n\nE₂ - E₁ = (1.2398 × 10⁻⁶ eV·m) / (1448 × 10⁻¹⁰ m) ≈ 8.562 eV\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\n\nNow, we can substitute all the known values into the factor equation:\n-   E₂ - E₁ = 8.562 eV\n-   k = 8.617333 × 10⁻⁵ eV/K\n-   T_spots = 5500 K\n-   T_nospots = 6000 K\n\nFactor = exp[ (8.562 / (8.617333 × 10⁻⁵)) * (1 / 5500 - 1 / 6000) ]\nFactor = exp[ 99358 * (0.000181818 - 0.000166667) ]\nFactor = exp[ 99358 * (0.000015151) ]\nFactor = exp(1.5054)\nFactor ≈ 4.506\n\nTo ensure precision, let's use a Python script for the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Constants\nh_ev_s = 4.135667696e-15  # Planck constant in eV*s\nc_m_s = 299792458         # Speed of light in m/s\nk_ev_k = 8.617333262e-5   # Boltzmann constant in eV/K\n\n# Given values\nlambda_A = 1448          # Wavelength in Angstroms\nT_nospots_K = 6000       # Temperature without spots in K\nT_spots_K = 5500         # Temperature with spots in K\n\n# Convert wavelength to meters\nlambda_m = lambda_A * 1e-10\n\n# Calculate the energy difference E2 - E1 in eV\ndelta_E_ev = (h_ev_s * c_m_s) / lambda_m\n\n# Calculate the exponent for the factor\nexponent = (delta_E_ev / k_ev_k) * (1 / T_spots_K - 1 / T_nospots_K)\n\n# Calculate the factor\nfactor = np.exp(exponent)\n\nprint(f\"{factor=}\")\n```\nfactor=4.506385153205168\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.5.

    "The problem requires us to find the ratio of the population ratios of two energy levels at two different temperatures. This can be calculated using the Boltzmann equation.\n\n### 1. The Boltzmann Equation\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms (N) in two energy levels, an upper level 2 and a lower level 1, is given by the Boltzmann equation, assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE):\n\nN₂ / N₁ = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-(E₂ - E₁) / (k * T)]\n\nwhere:\n-   `N₂ / N₁` is the ratio of the number of atoms in level 2 to level 1.\n-   `g₂ / g₁` is the ratio of the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the levels.\n-   `E₂ - E₁` (or `ΔE`) is the energy difference between the levels.\n-   `k` is the Boltzmann constant.\n-   `T` is the effective temperature.\n\n### 2. Setting up the Ratios\n\nLet's define the ratio for the two scenarios:\n\n-   **Scenario 1: No spots**\n    -   Temperature: `T_nospots = 6000 K`\n    -   Ratio: `R_nospots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)]`\n\n-   **Scenario 2: With spots**\n    -   Temperature: `T_spots = 5500 K`\n    -   Ratio: `R_spots = (g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_spots)]`\n\n### 3. Finding the Required Factor\n\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes, which is the ratio of `R_nospots` to `R_spots`.\n\nFactor = `R_nospots` / `R_spots`\n\nFactor = `[(g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)]] / [(g₂ / g₁) * exp[-ΔE / (k * T_spots)]]`\n\nThe term for the statistical weights, `(g₂ / g₁)`, cancels out:\n\nFactor = `exp[-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)] / exp[-ΔE / (k * T_spots)]`\n\nUsing the exponent property `exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b)`:\n\nFactor = `exp[-ΔE / (k * T_nospots) - (-ΔE / (k * T_spots))]`\nFactor = `exp[ΔE/k * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots)]`\n\n### 4. Calculating the Energy Difference (ΔE)\n\nThe energy difference corresponds to the energy of a photon from the given transition wavelength, `λ = 1448 Å`. The energy of a photon is given by `E = h * c / λ`.\n\nWe will use the following constants:\n-   Planck's constant, `h` = 4.1357 × 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s\n-   Speed of light, `c` = 2.998 × 10¹⁰ Å/s (in Angstroms per second for convenience)\n-   Boltzmann constant, `k` = 8.617 × 10⁻⁵ eV/K\n\nΔE = `(h * c) / λ` = (4.1357 × 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s * 2.998 × 10¹⁸ Å/s) / 1448 Å ≈ 8.56 eV\n\nAlternatively, the code calculated a more precise value `delta_E_ev` = 8.5635 eV.\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\n\nNow, we substitute the values into the factor equation.\n\nFactor = `exp[ (ΔE / k) * (1 / T_spots - 1 / T_nospots) ]`\nFactor = `exp[ (8.5635 eV / (8.617 × 10⁻⁵ eV/K)) * (1/5500 K - 1/6000 K) ]`\nFactor = `exp[ 99379 K * (0.00018182 - 0.00016667) K⁻¹ ]`\nFactor = `exp[ 99379 * (0.00001515) ]`\nFactor = `exp(1.5058)`\nFactor ≈ 4.507\n\nThe provided code execution gave a result of `factor=4.5064092748976705`, which is a more precise calculation. This value is very close to 4.5.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\n\nA) ~4.5\nB) ~7.8\nC) ~2.9\nD) ~1.1\n\nThe calculated factor of approximately 4.5 directly corresponds to option A. The information about the star's radius, mass, and the percentage of spot coverage is supplementary and not required for the calculation since the effective temperatures for both states are given.\n\n<<<A>>>"
