All agents correctly execute the necessary steps of quantum mechanics.\n\nHere is a summary of the logical steps that all agents followed:\n\n1.  **Define the Operator and Direction:** All agents correctly identified the spin operators $P_x, P_y, P_z$ as $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ times the respective Pauli matrices. They also correctly defined a unit vector $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane as $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle with the z-axis.\n\n2.  **Construct the Operator `P_n`:** All agents correctly calculated the operator for spin along the direction $\\vec{n}$ by taking the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_z \\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n3.  **Solve the Eigenvalue Equation:** All agents correctly set up the eigenvalue equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$ with the given eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This simplifies to a system of linear equations, which they solve to find the relationship between the eigenvector components $a$ and $b$.\n\n4.  **Derive the Eigenvector Components:** Using trigonometric half-angle identities, every agent correctly found that the relationship between the components is $\\frac{b}{a} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$. This means the eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n5.  **Normalize the Eigenvector:** The agents then correctly normalized this vector. Since $\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$, the vector is already normalized (up to an irrelevant global phase, which is taken to be 1).\n\n**Conclusion on the Correct Answer:**\nEvery single agent, without exception, derived the same result: the elements of the normalized eigenvector are **$(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$**.\n\nThe disagreement among the agents is purely about which letter option (A, B, C, or D) this corresponds to, indicating that the options were likely presented in a different order to each agent.\n\nReferring back to the options provided in the **question description**:\nA) $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))$\nB) $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))$\nC) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$\nD) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))$\n\nThe universally agreed-upon result $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$ perfectly matches option **B**. Options C and D are incorrect as eigenvectors are dimensionless state vectors and should not contain units of $\\hbar$. Option A has the incorrect functional dependence on the angle $\\theta$.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAn analysis of the provided answers shows that all agents correctly followed the standard procedure to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Here is a consolidated step-by-step breakdown of the solution, which reflects the consensus of the agents' reasoning.\n\n### **Step 1: Construct the Operator**\nThe components of the operator $\\vec{P}$ are given as:\n$P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$, $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$, and $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$, where $\\sigma_i$ are the Pauli matrices. This is the spin angular momentum operator for a spin-1/2 particle.\n\nThe direction vector $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector in the x-z plane. This can be parameterized by the polar angle $\\theta$ (the angle with the z-axis), giving the components $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\nThe operator for the spin along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$:\n$P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z = (\\sin\\theta)P_x + (0)P_y + (\\cos\\theta)P_z$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\n\nSubstituting the matrix representations:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n### **Step 2: Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**\nWe need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. The eigenvalue equation is $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$:\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nCanceling the $\\hbar/2$ factor gives the system of linear equations:\n1.  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2.  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\nFrom the first equation, we get $b \\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$. The ratio of the components is:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\n### **Step 3: Simplify and Normalize**\nUsing the trigonometric half-angle identities, $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$, the ratio becomes:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nThis implies that the eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\nTo normalize, we ensure the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the components is 1:\n$(\\cos(\\theta/2))^2 + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^2 = \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$.\nThe vector is already normalized.\n\n### **Step 4: Conclusion**\nThe elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This result perfectly matches option D from the provided choices. The other options are incorrect:\n*   A has the wrong functional dependence ($\\theta$ instead of $\\theta/2$).\n*   B and C incorrectly contain $\\hbar$ (eigenvectors are dimensionless vectors in Hilbert space) and have incorrect constant factors.\n\nAll agents correctly derived the mathematical form of the eigenvector. The discrepancies in their final answers were due to errors in matching their result to the provided options. The correct calculation unanimously leads to the components $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n**1. Analyze the Physics and Mathematics of the Problem**\n\nThe core task is to find a specific eigenvector for a quantum mechanical spin operator. This involves several standard steps in quantum mechanics:\n\n*   **Step 1: Construct the Operator.** The operator $\\vec{P}$ is the spin angular momentum operator, with components proportional to the Pauli matrices. The direction $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector in the x-z plane. A unit vector in this plane is parameterized by a single angle $\\theta$ (the angle with the z-axis) and can be written as $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$. The operator for the spin component in this direction, $P_n$, is the dot product $\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    \n    $P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z = (\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_x)\\sin\\theta + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_z)\\cos\\theta$\n    \n    Substituting the 2x2 Pauli matrices:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\sin\\theta\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\cos\\theta\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n    \n    This calculation was performed correctly and unanimously by all candidate agents.\n\n*   **Step 2: Set up and Solve the Eigenvalue Equation.** We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ for the given eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. The equation is $P_n|\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda|\\psi\\rangle$.\n    \n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    \n    The constant factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ cancels, leading to a system of linear equations. From the first row:\n    \n    $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a \\implies b \\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    \n    Using the trigonometric half-angle identities ($1-\\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$), we get:\n    \n    $b(2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)) = a(2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)) \\implies \\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n    \n    Again, this derivation was performed correctly by all agents.\n\n*   **Step 3: Normalize the Eigenvector.** The relationship $b/a = \\tan(\\theta/2)$ means the eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. To normalize, we set $|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$ and solve for the normalization constant $C$ such that $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$.\n    \n    $|C|^2 (\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)) = 1 \\implies |C|^2(1) = 1 \\implies |C| = 1$.\n    \n    Choosing the conventional phase $C=1$, the normalized eigenvector's elements are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This final result is also unanimous across all provided solutions.\n\n**2. Evaluate Candidate Answers**\n\n*   **All candidate answers show the same correct mathematical derivation.** They all arrive at the same result: the elements of the eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n*   **The discrepancy between the agents' final lettered choices (e.g., A, B, C, D) is due to them referencing differently ordered lists of options.** For instance, some agents label $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$ as option A, some as B, some as C, and some as D. This is a clerical inconsistency in the agents' outputs, not a disagreement about the physics or mathematics.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe correct mathematical answer, derived consistently by all agents and verified independently, is $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\nComparing this result to the provided master list of options in the question:\n*   **A) (\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))** - This is a perfect match.\n*   B) (\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta)) - Incorrect angle dependence and unnecessary phase factor for this problem.\n*   C) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2)) - Incorrect. Eigenvectors are dimensionless state vectors, and the constants are incorrect.\n*   D) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar) - Incorrect. Eigenvectors are not dimensionful and must depend on the direction $\\theta$.\n\nBased on the universally agreed-upon derivation, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided answers to determine the final correct response.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Problem Formulation:** The core task is to find the eigenvector of the spin operator $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$.\n\n2.  **Operator Construction:**\n    *   The direction vector $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane and is a unit vector. It is correctly parameterized in all candidate answers as $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle with the z-axis.\n    *   The operator $P_n$ is formed by the dot product: $P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$.\n    *   Substituting the given matrices and the components of $\\vec{n}$ yields the operator:\n        $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sin\\theta \\sigma_x + \\cos\\theta \\sigma_z) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   All candidate answers correctly derive this matrix for the operator $P_n$.\n\n3.  **Eigenvalue Equation:** The next step is to solve the eigenvalue equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$, where $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$ and $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    Canceling the $\\hbar/2$ factor gives:\n    $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n\n4.  **Solving for Eigenvector Components:**\n    From the equation above, we get $b \\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$. Using the half-angle identities ($\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$ and $1-\\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$), all candidate solutions correctly derive the relationship:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1-\\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$.\n    This means the eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n5.  **Normalization:** The final step is to normalize the vector. The squared norm of $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$ is $\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$. The vector is already normalized.\n\n### Conclusion on Correctness\n\nAll 15 candidate answers perform a correct physical and mathematical derivation, unanimously arriving at the conclusion that the elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n### Reconciling the Final Answers\n\nThe disagreement in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) among the candidate answers is due to inconsistent labeling of the multiple-choice options they were presented with.

Eigenvectors are dimensionless state vectors and should not contain $\\hbar$. They must also be normalized to unity, which this is not.\n*   B) $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))$ - Incorrect. This is the general form for a qubit state on the Bloch sphere, but the angular dependence is incorrect ($\\theta$ instead of $\\theta/2$), and the presence of $\\phi$ is not required for a vector in the x-z plane.\n*   C) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$ - Incorrect.

Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to find the normalized eigenvector of the spin operator for a spin-1/2 particle (a muon) along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane. The eigenvector must correspond to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$.\n\n### **2. Define the Mathematical Objects**\n\n*   **Operator Components:** The problem provides the spin operators in the x, y, and z directions, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$):\n    *   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **Direction Vector:** The direction $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane. A unit vector in this plane can be parameterized by the angle $\\theta$ it makes with the z-axis. The Cartesian components of this unit vector are $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n### **3. Construct the Operator in the Given Direction**\n\nThe operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is the dot product of the operator vector $\\vec{P}$ and the direction vector $\\vec{n}$.\n$P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\nSubstituting the specific components:\n$P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_y(0) + P_z \\cos\\theta$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta$\nNow, we substitute the matrix representations:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n### **4. Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**\n\nWe need to solve the eigenvalue equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$ for the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ and the given eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$.\n\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe can cancel the constant factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis gives a system of two linear equations:\n1) $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2) $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\nFrom the first equation, we get:\n$b \\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\nUsing the trigonometric half-angle identities, $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$, we can simplify the expression:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nThis relationship, $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$, determines the eigenvector up to a normalization constant. The unnormalized eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n### **5. Normalize the Eigenvector**\n\nLet the eigenvector be $|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. The normalization condition is that the inner product $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$.\n$\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = |C|^2 (|\\cos(\\theta/2)|^2 + |\\sin(\\theta/2)|^2) = 1$\nUsing the fundamental trigonometric identity $\\cos^2(x) + \\sin^2(x) = 1$, we get:\n$|C|^2 (1) = 1 \\implies |C| = 1$\nBy convention, we choose the simplest phase, $C=1$.\nThus, the normalized eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n### **6. Conclusion**\n\nThe elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.

The angular dependence is on $\\theta$, not $\\theta/2$. The phase factor is also not needed for a direction in the x-z plane.\n*   D) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))$ - Incorrect for the same reasons as B.\n\nAll provided candidate answers correctly perform the mathematical derivation.

Let's outline these steps to confirm the result.\n\n1.  **Define the Operator and Direction Vector**:\n    The operator $\\vec{P}$ is the spin angular momentum operator, $\\vec{P} = \\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$, where $\\vec{\\sigma}$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n    *   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    An arbitrary unit vector $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane can be parameterized by the angle $\\theta$ it makes with the z-axis. Its Cartesian components are $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n2.  **Construct the Operator along the direction `n`**:\n    The operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    $P_n = (\\sin\\theta) P_x + (0) P_y + (\\cos\\theta) P_z$\n    Substituting the matrices:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left[ \\sin\\theta \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\cos\\theta \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right]$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This step is performed correctly in all candidate solutions.\n\n3.  **Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**:\n    We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ for the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. The equation is $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    We can cancel the $\\hbar/2$ factor. The resulting matrix equation gives a system of linear equations:\n    1)  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a \\implies b \\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    2)  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n    From equation (1), we find the ratio of the components:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n    Using the trigonometric half-angle identities ($1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$):\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n    This derivation is also correctly shown in all solutions.\n\n4.  **Normalize the Eigenvector**:\n    The relation $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$ means the eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. To express this in a more standard form without fractions, we can multiply by $\\cos(\\theta/2)$, showing the eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    To normalize this, we require the sum of the squared magnitudes of the components to be 1. Let the normalized vector be $C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    $|C|^2 (\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\n    Using the identity $\\cos^2(x) + \\sin^2(x) = 1$, we get $|C|^2 = 1$. By convention, we can choose the phase to be zero, so $C=1$.\n    The normalized eigenvector is therefore $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll the provided solutions correctly derive that the elements of the normalized eigenvector are **$(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$**.\n\nThere are inconsistencies in how the options are labeled in the various candidate answers.

The Cartesian components of this unit vector are:\n*   $n_x = \\sin\\theta$\n*   $n_y = 0$\n*   $n_z = \\cos\\theta$\nSo, the direction vector is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n### Step 2: Construct the spin operator along the direction $\\vec{n}$\nThe operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is given by the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n$P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n$P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_z \\cos\\theta$\n\nSubstituting the matrix representations:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n### Step 3: Solve the eigenvalue problem\nWe need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. The eigenvalue equation is:\n$P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe can cancel the factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis matrix equation yields a system of two linear equations:\n1.  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2.  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\nFrom the first equation:\n$b \\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\nUsing the trigonometric half-angle identities, $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nThis relationship tells us that the eigenvector is proportional to the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n### Step 4: Normalize the eigenvector\nThe eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$ for some normalization constant $C$. The normalization condition is $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$, which means $|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$.\n$|C \\cos(\\theta/2)|^2 + |C \\sin(\\theta/2)|^2 = 1$\n$|C|^2 (\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\n$|C|^2 (1) = 1 \\implies |C|=1$\n\nChoosing the simplest phase factor $C=1$, the normalized eigenvector is:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\nThe elements of this eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n### Step 5: Compare with the given options\n*   A) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$: Incorrect. Eigenvectors are dimensionless state vectors, and should not contain $\\hbar$.\n*   B) $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))$: **Correct**. This matches our derived result.\n*   C) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))$: Incorrect for the same reasons as A.\n*   D) $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))$: Incorrect. The dependence is on $\\theta$, not $\\theta/2$, and our calculation for a vector in the x-z plane has $\\phi=0$, making the phase factor 1. The half-angle dependence is a crucial feature of spin-1/2 systems.\n\nThe derivations provided by the agents are all mathematically sound, but there are numerous inconsistencies in how they map their final answer to the letters A, B, C, D. Based on the rigorous derivation, the correct components are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))$, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided solutions to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Core Physics and Mathematics**\n\nAll 15 candidate answers perform the same fundamental calculation. The steps are consistent and represent the standard method for solving this type of quantum mechanics problem.\n\n*   **Step A: Define the Operator.** The operator for spin along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane is correctly constructed. The direction vector is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$, and the operator is $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$. All agents correctly derive the matrix representation of this operator:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **Step B: Set up the Eigenvalue Equation.** The task is to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ for the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. The equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$ is correctly set up by all agents:\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **Step C: Solve for the Eigenvector.** After canceling the constant $\\hbar/2$, the agents solve the resulting system of linear equations. They all correctly find the relationship between the eigenvector components $a$ and $b$ to be:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\n*   **Step D: Normalize the Eigenvector.** From the relationship above, the eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. All agents correctly show that this vector is already normalized, since $\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$.\n\n**Consensus Result:** All provided derivations unanimously and correctly conclude that the normalized eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. The elements are therefore **$(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$**.\n\n### **2. Matching the Result to the Options**\n\nThe next step is to match this undisputed mathematical result to the provided multiple-choice options.\n\n*   **A) $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))$**: Incorrect. The angular dependence is $\\theta$ instead of $\\theta/2$. It also unnecessarily includes a phase factor $e^{i\\phi}$ which is not derived (as $\\phi=0$).\n*   **B) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$**: Incorrect. Eigenvectors of spin are dimensionless state vectors; they should not contain units of $\\hbar$. They are also not constant values but depend on the angle $\\theta$.\n*   **C) $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$**: **Correct.** This exactly matches the derived result.\n*   **D) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))$**: Incorrect. This also contains units of $\\hbar$ and incorrect numerical prefactors.\n\n### **3. Reconciling Candidate Answers**\n\nThe candidate answers show a high degree of confusion in labeling the final choice (e.g., claiming the answer is \"A\" or \"D\" while deriving the result that corresponds to \"C\"). This appears to be a flaw in the agents' referencing of the option list, not in their mathematical calculation. The reasoning and derivation in every case points to the same result. Based on the correct derivation shared by all agents, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n### Reasoning and Analysis\n\n1.  **Consensus on the Mathematical Derivation**: All 15 candidate answers perform the same core calculation, and all arrive at the identical correct result for the components of the eigenvector. The steps are:\n    *   **Define the direction vector `n`**: Since the direction lies in the x-z plane, a unit vector `n` can be parameterized by the angle `θ` it makes with the z-axis. The components are `n_x = sin(θ)`, `n_y = 0`, and `n_z = cos(θ)`.\n    *   **Construct the operator `P_n`**: The operator along the direction `n` is the dot product `P_n = P · n = P_x*n_x + P_y*n_y + P_z*n_z`. This gives:\n        $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   **Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**: We need to solve `P_n |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>`. This simplifies to:\n        $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   **Find the eigenvector components**: Solving the system of linear equations yields the relationship `b/a = tan(θ/2)`.\n    *   **Normalize the eigenvector**: The eigenvector is proportional to `(cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2))`. Checking the norm: `cos²(θ/2) + sin²(θ/2) = 1`. The vector is already normalized.\n\n2.  **Correct Answer Identification**: The correct components of the normalized eigenvector are **(`cos(θ/2)`, `sin(θ/2)`)**.\n\n3.  **Matching with Provided Options**: Now, we match this result with the multiple-choice options given in the problem description:\n    *   A) `(√{2/3}ħ cos(θ/2), √{1/3}ħ sin(θ/2))` - Incorrect. Eigenvectors are dimensionless state vectors and should not contain `ħ`.\n    *   B) `(cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2))` - **Correct**. This exactly matches our derived result.\n    *   C) `(cos(θ), e^{iφ}sin(θ))` - Incorrect. The functional dependence is on `θ`, not `θ/2`, and it includes an unnecessary `φ` term.\n    *   D) `(√{2/3}ħ, √{1/3}ħ)` - Incorrect. Contains `ħ` and has no angular dependence.\n\n4.  **Analysis of Candidate Answers**:\n    *   The reasoning and mathematical steps in all 15 answers are correct.\n    *   The discrepancies arise when the agents map their correct mathematical result to the lettered choices (A, B, C, D). Many agents appear to be working from a scrambled or mislabeled list of options, causing them to select the wrong letter despite having the correct solution.\n    *   Answers 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 14, and 15 select \"A\". Answers 1, 4, 5, 10 and 13 select \"D\" or \"C\". Answers 8, 11, and 12 correctly select \"B\".\n    *   Since the mathematical result is universally agreed upon and sound, the decision rests purely on matching it to the original list of choices.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe derivation consistently and correctly yields the eigenvector with components (`cos(θ/2)`, `sin(θ/2)`). According to the problem's list of options, this corresponds to choice B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**1. Deconstruction of the Problem**\n\nThe task is to find the normalized eigenvector of a quantum mechanical spin operator, $\\vec{P}$, for a spin-1/2 particle (a muon) along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane. The eigenvector must correspond to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$.\n\n**2. Step-by-step Derivation**\n\n*   **Step 1: Define the operators.**\n    The problem gives the components of the operator $\\vec{P}$ which are proportional to the Pauli matrices:\n    $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **Step 2: Define the direction vector $\\vec{n}$.**\n    The direction $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector in the x-z plane.

    "Based on a step-by-step analysis of the problem and the provided candidate answers, the final answer can be determined.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Goal and the Physics**\n\nThe problem asks for the eigenvector of a spin-1/2 particle's spin operator along a specific direction, corresponding to the \"spin-up\" eigenvalue of $+\\hbar/2$. This is a standard problem in quantum mechanics.\n\n*   **Operators:** The operators $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$ are the components of the spin angular momentum operator, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$).\n*   **Direction:** The direction vector $\\vec{n}$ is in the x-z plane, which can be described by a single angle $\\theta$ relative to the z-axis: $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n*   **Eigenvector:** An eigenvector represents a state that remains unchanged (up to a scalar factor) when the operator acts on it. The scalar factor is the eigenvalue.\n\n### **Step 2: Follow the Unanimous Derivation**\n\nAll the provided candidate answers, despite sometimes choosing a different final letter, follow the same correct mathematical procedure. This indicates a high degree of confidence in the derivation itself.\n\n1.  **Construct the Operator:** The operator for spin along direction $\\vec{n}$ is $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$. All candidates correctly calculate this as:\n    $P_n = P_x\\sin\\theta + P_z\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n2.  **Solve the Eigenvalue Equation:** We must solve $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} |\\psi\\rangle$. Writing the eigenvector as $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$, this leads to the system of equations:\n    *   $a\\cos\\theta + b\\sin\\theta = a$\n    *   $a\\sin\\theta - b\\cos\\theta = b$\n\n3.  **Find Eigenvector Components:** Solving the first equation gives $b\\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$. Using trigonometric half-angle identities, this simplifies to:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\n4.  **Normalize the Eigenvector:** The relationship $\\frac{b}{a} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$ means the eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. The norm of this vector is $\\sqrt{\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)} = \\sqrt{1} = 1$. The vector is already normalized.\n\nTherefore, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Multiple Choice Options**\n\nWe must now compare the correct derived result with the given list of options.\n\n*   **A) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$:** This is incorrect. Eigenvectors are dimensionless vectors in a state space (Hilbert space) and should not contain units of $\\hbar$.

The angular dependence must be on $\\theta/2$ for a spin-1/2 particle, not $\\theta$. The phase factor is also not needed for a direction purely in the x-z plane.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe mathematical derivation is unambiguous and unanimously agreed upon by all provided candidate answers. The resulting eigenvector components are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This corresponds directly to option B.

All agents correctly execute the necessary steps of quantum mechanics.\n\nHere is a summary of the logical steps that all agents followed:\n\n1.  **Define the Operator and Direction:** All agents correctly identified the spin operators $P_x, P_y, P_z$ as $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ times the respective Pauli matrices. They also correctly defined a unit vector $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane as $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle with the z-axis.\n\n2.  **Construct the Operator `P_n`:** All agents correctly calculated the operator for spin along the direction $\\vec{n}$ by taking the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_z \\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n3.  **Solve the Eigenvalue Equation:** All agents correctly set up the eigenvalue equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$ with the given eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This simplifies to a system of linear equations, which they solve to find the relationship between the eigenvector components $a$ and $b$.\n\n4.  **Derive the Eigenvector Components:** Using trigonometric half-angle identities, every agent correctly found that the relationship between the components is $\\frac{b}{a} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$.

Options C and D are incorrect as eigenvectors are dimensionless state vectors and should not contain units of $\\hbar$. Option A has the incorrect functional dependence on the angle $\\theta$.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nAn analysis of the provided answers shows that all agents correctly followed the standard procedure to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Here is a consolidated step-by-step breakdown of the solution, which reflects the consensus of the agents' reasoning.\n\n### **Step 1: Construct the Operator**\nThe components of the operator $\\vec{P}$ are given as:\n$P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x$, $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y$, and $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z$, where $\\sigma_i$ are the Pauli matrices. This is the spin angular momentum operator for a spin-1/2 particle.\n\nThe direction vector $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector in the x-z plane. This can be parameterized by the polar angle $\\theta$ (the angle with the z-axis), giving the components $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\nThe operator for the spin along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$:\n$P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z = (\\sin\\theta)P_x + (0)P_y + (\\cos\\theta)P_z$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\n\nSubstituting the matrix representations:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n### **Step 2: Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**\nWe need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. The eigenvalue equation is $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$:\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nCanceling the $\\hbar/2$ factor gives the system of linear equations:\n1.  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2.  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\nFrom the first equation, we get $b \\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$. The ratio of the components is:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\n### **Step 3: Simplify and Normalize**\nUsing the trigonometric half-angle identities, $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$, the ratio becomes:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nThis implies that the eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\nTo normalize, we ensure the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the components is 1:\n$(\\cos(\\theta/2))^2 + (\\sin(\\theta/2))^2 = \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$.\nThe vector is already normalized.\n\n### **Step 4: Conclusion**\nThe elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This result perfectly matches option D from the provided choices. The other options are incorrect:\n*   A has the wrong functional dependence ($\\theta$ instead of $\\theta/2$).\n*   B and C incorrectly contain $\\hbar$ (eigenvectors are dimensionless vectors in Hilbert space) and have incorrect constant factors.\n\nAll agents correctly derived the mathematical form of the eigenvector. The discrepancies in their final answers were due to errors in matching their result to the provided options. The correct calculation unanimously leads to the components $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n**1. Analyze the Physics and Mathematics of the Problem**\n\nThe core task is to find a specific eigenvector for a quantum mechanical spin operator. This involves several standard steps in quantum mechanics:\n\n*   **Step 1: Construct the Operator.** The operator $\\vec{P}$ is the spin angular momentum operator, with components proportional to the Pauli matrices. The direction $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector in the x-z plane. A unit vector in this plane is parameterized by a single angle $\\theta$ (the angle with the z-axis) and can be written as $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$. The operator for the spin component in this direction, $P_n$, is the dot product $\\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    \n    $P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z = (\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_x)\\sin\\theta + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_z)\\cos\\theta$\n    \n    Substituting the 2x2 Pauli matrices:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\sin\\theta\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\cos\\theta\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n    \n    This calculation was performed correctly and unanimously by all candidate agents.\n\n*   **Step 2: Set up and Solve the Eigenvalue Equation.** We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ for the given eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. The equation is $P_n|\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda|\\psi\\rangle$.\n    \n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    \n    The constant factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ cancels, leading to a system of linear equations. From the first row:\n    \n    $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a \\implies b \\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    \n    Using the trigonometric half-angle identities ($1-\\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$), we get:\n    \n    $b(2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)) = a(2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)) \\implies \\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n    \n    Again, this derivation was performed correctly by all agents.\n\n*   **Step 3: Normalize the Eigenvector.** The relationship $b/a = \\tan(\\theta/2)$ means the eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. To normalize, we set $|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$ and solve for the normalization constant $C$ such that $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$.\n    \n    $|C|^2 (\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)) = 1 \\implies |C|^2(1) = 1 \\implies |C| = 1$.\n    \n    Choosing the conventional phase $C=1$, the normalized eigenvector's elements are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. This final result is also unanimous across all provided solutions.\n\n**2. Evaluate Candidate Answers**\n\n*   **All candidate answers show the same correct mathematical derivation.** They all arrive at the same result: the elements of the eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n*   **The discrepancy between the agents' final lettered choices (e.g., A, B, C, D) is due to them referencing differently ordered lists of options.** For instance, some agents label $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$ as option A, some as B, some as C, and some as D. This is a clerical inconsistency in the agents' outputs, not a disagreement about the physics or mathematics.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe correct mathematical answer, derived consistently by all agents and verified independently, is $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\nComparing this result to the provided master list of options in the question:\n*   **A) (\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))** - This is a perfect match.\n*   B) (\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta)) - Incorrect angle dependence and unnecessary phase factor for this problem.\n*   C) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2)) - Incorrect. Eigenvectors are dimensionless state vectors, and the constants are incorrect.\n*   D) (\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar) - Incorrect. Eigenvectors are not dimensionful and must depend on the direction $\\theta$.\n\nBased on the universally agreed-upon derivation, the correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided answers to determine the final correct response.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Problem Formulation:** The core task is to find the eigenvector of the spin operator $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$.\n\n2.  **Operator Construction:**\n    *   The direction vector $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane and is a unit vector. It is correctly parameterized in all candidate answers as $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle with the z-axis.\n    *   The operator $P_n$ is formed by the dot product: $P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$.\n    *   Substituting the given matrices and the components of $\\vec{n}$ yields the operator:\n        $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sin\\theta \\sigma_x + \\cos\\theta \\sigma_z) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   All candidate answers correctly derive this matrix for the operator $P_n$.\n\n3.  **Eigenvalue Equation:** The next step is to solve the eigenvalue equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$, where $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$ and $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    Canceling the $\\hbar/2$ factor gives:\n    $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n\n4.  **Solving for Eigenvector Components:**\n    From the equation above, we get $b \\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$. Using the half-angle identities ($\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$ and $1-\\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$), all candidate solutions correctly derive the relationship:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1-\\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$.\n    This means the eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n5.  **Normalization:** The final step is to normalize the vector. The squared norm of $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$ is $\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$. The vector is already normalized.\n\n### Conclusion on Correctness\n\nAll 15 candidate answers perform a correct physical and mathematical derivation, unanimously arriving at the conclusion that the elements of the normalized eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n### Reconciling the Final Answers\n\nThe disagreement in the final letter choices (A, B, C, D) among the candidate answers is due to inconsistent labeling of the multiple-choice options they were presented with.

Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to find the normalized eigenvector of the spin operator for a spin-1/2 particle (a muon) along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane. The eigenvector must correspond to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$.\n\n### **2. Define the Mathematical Objects**\n\n*   **Operator Components:** The problem provides the spin operators in the x, y, and z directions, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices ($\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$):\n    *   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **Direction Vector:** The direction $\\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane. A unit vector in this plane can be parameterized by the angle $\\theta$ it makes with the z-axis. The Cartesian components of this unit vector are $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n### **3. Construct the Operator in the Given Direction**\n\nThe operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is the dot product of the operator vector $\\vec{P}$ and the direction vector $\\vec{n}$.\n$P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\nSubstituting the specific components:\n$P_n = P_x \\sin\\theta + P_y(0) + P_z \\cos\\theta$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta$\nNow, we substitute the matrix representations:\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n### **4. Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**\n\nWe need to solve the eigenvalue equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$ for the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ and the given eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$.\n\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe can cancel the constant factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis gives a system of two linear equations:\n1) $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2) $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\nFrom the first equation, we get:\n$b \\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\nUsing the trigonometric half-angle identities, $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$, we can simplify the expression:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nThis relationship, $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$, determines the eigenvector up to a normalization constant. The unnormalized eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n### **5. Normalize the Eigenvector**\n\nLet the eigenvector be $|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. The normalization condition is that the inner product $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$.\n$\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = |C|^2 (|\\cos(\\theta/2)|^2 + |\\sin(\\theta/2)|^2) = 1$\nUsing the fundamental trigonometric identity $\\cos^2(x) + \\sin^2(x) = 1$, we get:\n$|C|^2 (1) = 1 \\implies |C| = 1$\nBy convention, we choose the simplest phase, $C=1$.\nThus, the normalized eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n### **6.

Let's outline these steps to confirm the result.\n\n1.  **Define the Operator and Direction Vector**:\n    The operator $\\vec{P}$ is the spin angular momentum operator, $\\vec{P} = \\vec{S} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\vec{\\sigma}$, where $\\vec{\\sigma}$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n    *   $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    An arbitrary unit vector $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane can be parameterized by the angle $\\theta$ it makes with the z-axis. Its Cartesian components are $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n2.  **Construct the Operator along the direction `n`**:\n    The operator for the spin component along the direction $\\vec{n}$ is the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$.\n    $P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    $P_n = (\\sin\\theta) P_x + (0) P_y + (\\cos\\theta) P_z$\n    Substituting the matrices:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left[ \\sin\\theta \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\cos\\theta \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right]$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This step is performed correctly in all candidate solutions.\n\n3.  **Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**:\n    We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ for the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$. The equation is $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    We can cancel the $\\hbar/2$ factor. The resulting matrix equation gives a system of linear equations:\n    1)  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a \\implies b \\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    2)  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n    From equation (1), we find the ratio of the components:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n    Using the trigonometric half-angle identities ($1 - \\cos\\theta = 2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)$):\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n    This derivation is also correctly shown in all solutions.\n\n4.  **Normalize the Eigenvector**:\n    The relation $b = a \\tan(\\theta/2)$ means the eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ \\tan(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. To express this in a more standard form without fractions, we can multiply by $\\cos(\\theta/2)$, showing the eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    To normalize this, we require the sum of the squared magnitudes of the components to be 1. Let the normalized vector be $C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    $|C|^2 (\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\n    Using the identity $\\cos^2(x) + \\sin^2(x) = 1$, we get $|C|^2 = 1$. By convention, we can choose the phase to be zero, so $C=1$.\n    The normalized eigenvector is therefore $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll the provided solutions correctly derive that the elements of the normalized eigenvector are **$(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$**.\n\nThere are inconsistencies in how the options are labeled in the various candidate answers.

The eigenvalue equation is:\n$P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$\n$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe can cancel the factor $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ from both sides:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis matrix equation yields a system of two linear equations:\n1.  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a$\n2.  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n\nFrom the first equation:\n$b \\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\nUsing the trigonometric half-angle identities, $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$:\n$\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\nThis relationship tells us that the eigenvector is proportional to the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n### Step 4: Normalize the eigenvector\nThe eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$ for some normalization constant $C$. The normalization condition is $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$, which means $|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$.\n$|C \\cos(\\theta/2)|^2 + |C \\sin(\\theta/2)|^2 = 1$\n$|C|^2 (\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)) = 1$\n$|C|^2 (1) = 1 \\implies |C|=1$\n\nChoosing the simplest phase factor $C=1$, the normalized eigenvector is:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$\nThe elements of this eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n### Step 5: Compare with the given options\n*   A) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$: Incorrect. Eigenvectors are dimensionless state vectors, and should not contain $\\hbar$.\n*   B) $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))$: **Correct**. This matches our derived result.\n*   C) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))$: Incorrect for the same reasons as A.\n*   D) $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))$: Incorrect. The dependence is on $\\theta$, not $\\theta/2$, and our calculation for a vector in the x-z plane has $\\phi=0$, making the phase factor 1. The half-angle dependence is a crucial feature of spin-1/2 systems.\n\nThe derivations provided by the agents are all mathematically sound, but there are numerous inconsistencies in how they map their final answer to the letters A, B, C, D. Based on the rigorous derivation, the correct components are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin (\\theta/2))$, which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the provided solutions to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Core Physics and Mathematics**\n\nAll 15 candidate answers perform the same fundamental calculation. The steps are consistent and represent the standard method for solving this type of quantum mechanics problem.\n\n*   **Step A: Define the Operator.** The operator for spin along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane is correctly constructed. The direction vector is $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$, and the operator is $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$. All agents correctly derive the matrix representation of this operator:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **Step B: Set up the Eigenvalue Equation.** The task is to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle$ for the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$. The equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$ is correctly set up by all agents:\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **Step C: Solve for the Eigenvector.** After canceling the constant $\\hbar/2$, the agents solve the resulting system of linear equations. They all correctly find the relationship between the eigenvector components $a$ and $b$ to be:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n\n*   **Step D: Normalize the Eigenvector.** From the relationship above, the eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. All agents correctly show that this vector is already normalized, since $\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1$.\n\n**Consensus Result:** All provided derivations unanimously and correctly conclude that the normalized eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. The elements are therefore **$(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$**.\n\n### **2. Matching the Result to the Options**\n\nThe next step is to match this undisputed mathematical result to the provided multiple-choice options.\n\n*   **A) $(\\cos(\\theta), e^{i\\phi}\\sin (\\theta))$**: Incorrect. The angular dependence is $\\theta$ instead of $\\theta/2$. It also unnecessarily includes a phase factor $e^{i\\phi}$ which is not derived (as $\\phi=0$).\n*   **B) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$**: Incorrect. Eigenvectors of spin are dimensionless state vectors; they should not contain units of $\\hbar$. They are also not constant values but depend on the angle $\\theta$.\n*   **C) $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$**: **Correct.** This exactly matches the derived result.\n*   **D) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar \\cos(\\theta/2), \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar \\sin (\\theta/2))$**: Incorrect. This also contains units of $\\hbar$ and incorrect numerical prefactors.\n\n### **3. Reconciling Candidate Answers**\n\nThe candidate answers show a high degree of confusion in labeling the final choice (e.g., claiming the answer is \"A\" or \"D\" while deriving the result that corresponds to \"C\"). This appears to be a flaw in the agents' referencing of the option list, not in their mathematical calculation. The reasoning and derivation in every case points to the same result. Based on the correct derivation shared by all agents, the correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\n### Reasoning and Analysis\n\n1.  **Consensus on the Mathematical Derivation**: All 15 candidate answers perform the same core calculation, and all arrive at the identical correct result for the components of the eigenvector. The steps are:\n    *   **Define the direction vector `n`**: Since the direction lies in the x-z plane, a unit vector `n` can be parameterized by the angle `θ` it makes with the z-axis. The components are `n_x = sin(θ)`, `n_y = 0`, and `n_z = cos(θ)`.\n    *   **Construct the operator `P_n`**: The operator along the direction `n` is the dot product `P_n = P · n = P_x*n_x + P_y*n_y + P_z*n_z`. This gives:\n        $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   **Solve the Eigenvalue Equation**: We need to solve `P_n |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>`. This simplifies to:\n        $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    *   **Find the eigenvector components**: Solving the system of linear equations yields the relationship `b/a = tan(θ/2)`.\n    *   **Normalize the eigenvector**: The eigenvector is proportional to `(cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2))`. Checking the norm: `cos²(θ/2) + sin²(θ/2) = 1`. The vector is already normalized.\n\n2.  **Correct Answer Identification**: The correct components of the normalized eigenvector are **(`cos(θ/2)`, `sin(θ/2)`)**.\n\n3.  **Matching with Provided Options**: Now, we match this result with the multiple-choice options given in the problem description:\n    *   A) `(√{2/3}ħ cos(θ/2), √{1/3}ħ sin(θ/2))` - Incorrect. Eigenvectors are dimensionless state vectors and should not contain `ħ`.\n    *   B) `(cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2))` - **Correct**. This exactly matches our derived result.\n    *   C) `(cos(θ), e^{iφ}sin(θ))` - Incorrect. The functional dependence is on `θ`, not `θ/2`, and it includes an unnecessary `φ` term.\n    *   D) `(√{2/3}ħ, √{1/3}ħ)` - Incorrect. Contains `ħ` and has no angular dependence.\n\n4.  **Analysis of Candidate Answers**:\n    *   The reasoning and mathematical steps in all 15 answers are correct.\n    *   The discrepancies arise when the agents map their correct mathematical result to the lettered choices (A, B, C, D). Many agents appear to be working from a scrambled or mislabeled list of options, causing them to select the wrong letter despite having the correct solution.\n    *   Answers 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 14, and 15 select \"A\". Answers 1, 4, 5, 10 and 13 select \"D\" or \"C\". Answers 8, 11, and 12 correctly select \"B\".\n    *   Since the mathematical result is universally agreed upon and sound, the decision rests purely on matching it to the original list of choices.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe derivation consistently and correctly yields the eigenvector with components (`cos(θ/2)`, `sin(θ/2)`). According to the problem's list of options, this corresponds to choice B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\n**1. Deconstruction of the Problem**\n\nThe task is to find the normalized eigenvector of a quantum mechanical spin operator, $\\vec{P}$, for a spin-1/2 particle (a muon) along an arbitrary direction $\\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane. The eigenvector must correspond to the eigenvalue $+\\hbar/2$.\n\n**2. Step-by-step Derivation**\n\n*   **Step 1: Define the operators.**\n    The problem gives the components of the operator $\\vec{P}$ which are proportional to the Pauli matrices:\n    $P_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **Step 2: Define the direction vector $\\vec{n}$.**\n    The direction $\\vec{n}$ is a unit vector in the x-z plane. Such a vector can be parameterized by the polar angle $\\theta$ (the angle from the z-axis), with the azimuthal angle $\\phi=0$. The Cartesian components are:\n    $\\vec{n} = (\\sin\\theta, 0, \\cos\\theta)$\n\n*   **Step 3: Construct the operator $P_n$ along the direction $\\vec{n}$.**\n    The operator for the spin component along $\\vec{n}$ is the dot product $P_n = \\vec{P} \\cdot \\vec{n}$:\n    $P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z$\n    $P_n = (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_x) \\sin\\theta + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_y) (0) + (\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma_z) \\cos\\theta$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} (\\sigma_x \\sin\\theta + \\sigma_z \\cos\\theta)$\n    Substituting the matrices:\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\sin\\theta + \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\right)$\n    $P_n = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **Step 4: Set up and solve the eigenvalue equation.**\n    We need to find the eigenvector $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ that satisfies the eigenvalue equation $P_n |\\psi\\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi\\rangle$ for the eigenvalue $\\lambda = +\\hbar/2$.\n    $\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The factor $\\hbar/2$ cancels from both sides, leaving:\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & \\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & -\\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This gives the system of linear equations:\n    1.  $a \\cos\\theta + b \\sin\\theta = a \\implies b \\sin\\theta = a(1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    2.  $a \\sin\\theta - b \\cos\\theta = b$\n    From equation 1, we find the ratio of the components:\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n    Using the half-angle trigonometric identities ($1 - \\cos\\theta = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ and $\\sin\\theta = 2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)$):\n    $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{2\\sin(\\theta/2)\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\tan(\\theta/2)$\n    This relationship means the eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n*   **Step 5: Normalize the eigenvector.**\n    The unnormalized eigenvector can be written as $|\\psi\\rangle = C \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$, where $C$ is a normalization constant. The normalization condition is $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = 1$.\n    $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = |C|^2 ( \\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2) ) = |C|^2(1) = 1$.\n    Thus, $|C|^2 = 1$. We can choose the phase of the eigenvector to be 0, so $C=1$.\n    The normalized eigenvector is $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The elements of this eigenvector are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$.\n\n**3. Comparison with Options**\n\nAll provided candidate answers correctly perform the above calculation, arriving at the mathematical result that the elements are $(\\cos(\\theta/2), \\sin(\\theta/2))$. The confusion between the agents arises from differing labels for the multiple-choice options. I will refer to the options provided in the question description.\n\n*   A) $(\\sqrt{2/3}\\hbar, \\sqrt{1/3}\\hbar)$: Incorrect.
