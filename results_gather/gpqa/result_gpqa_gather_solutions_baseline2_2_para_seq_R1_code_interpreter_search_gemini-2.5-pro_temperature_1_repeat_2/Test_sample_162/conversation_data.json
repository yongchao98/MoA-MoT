This is a multi-step problem that involves both stoichiometry and chemical equilibrium. The correct answer must have a volume and pH that are mutually consistent.\n\n#### Step 1: Calculate the Stoichiometric Requirement\n\n1.  **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃**:\n    M(Fe) + 3 × (M(O) + M(H)) = 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = **106.866 g/mol**.\n\n2.  **Moles of Fe(OH)₃**:\n    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol = **0.00093575 mol**.\n\n3.  **Chemical Reaction**: The acid neutralizes the Fe(OH)₃.\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n    The stoichiometry is 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ to 3 moles of H⁺.\n\n4.  **Moles of H⁺ for Reaction (n_reacted)**: This is the amount of H⁺ consumed by the neutralization.\n    n_reacted = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.00093575 mol = **0.0028073 mol**.\n\nThis value represents the amount of H⁺ *consumed* by the solid. However, to keep the Fe³⁺ ions in solution, an *excess* of H⁺ is needed to maintain a low pH and prevent the reverse reaction (precipitation). The total acid added must account for both the reacted amount and the excess amount.\n\n**Total H⁺ needed (n_total) = H⁺ for reaction (n_reacted) + H⁺ remaining in excess (n_excess)**\n\n#### Step 2: Evaluate the Options for Consistency\n\nWe must test the options to see which pair of (pH, Volume) values is consistent with the chemical principles.\n\n**Test Option C: pH = 2.69; Volume = 30.09 cm³**\n\n1.  **Calculate Total H⁺ Added (from the given volume)**:\n    Volume = 30.09 cm³ = 0.03009 L.\n    n_total = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n\n2.  **Calculate Excess H⁺ (n_excess) from the mole balance**:\n    n_excess = n_total - n_reacted = 0.003009 mol - 0.0028073 mol = **0.0002017 mol**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH from this excess H⁺ and check for consistency**:\n    This excess H⁺ (0.0002017 mol) is present in the final solution volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n    [H⁺]_final = n_excess / Total Volume = 0.0002017 mol / 0.1 L = 0.002017 M.\n    Calculated pH = -log₁₀([H⁺]_final) = -log₁₀(0.002017) ≈ **2.695**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Option C**: The calculated pH of ~2.695 is an excellent match for the pH of 2.69 given in the option. This means the provided volume (30.09 cm³) is consistent with the acid needed to both dissolve the solid and establish the final pH of 2.69. This is the only chemically self-consistent option.\n\n---\n**Why other options are incorrect (e.g., Option A: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³):**\n\n1.  **Volume Check**: The volume 28.05 cm³ provides 0.1 M * 0.02805 L = 0.002805 moles of H⁺. This is almost exactly the amount needed for the reaction (0.002807 mol) and leaves virtually no excess H⁺ to lower the pH significantly.\n2.  **Inconsistency**: A solution with no significant excess strong acid would have its pH determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺ (which gives a pH of ~2.3), not 2.04. Furthermore, to achieve a pH of 2.04, a large excess of H⁺ is required, meaning a much larger volume of acid would be needed (around 37 cm³). Therefore, the pH and volume values in Option A are inconsistent with each other.\n\nFinal analysis confirms that the calculations used by the majority of the agents, which lead to Option C, are correct and rigorous.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the correct answer, we must find the pair of pH and volume that is chemically and stoichiometrically consistent. The process involves two main considerations: the acid needed for the neutralization reaction and the excess acid needed to maintain the final pH for complete dissolution.\n\n**1. Analyze the Stoichiometry**\n\nThe chemical reaction between iron(III) hydroxide and a strong acid (H⁺) is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nFirst, we calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved.\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ ≈ 55.85 + 3*(16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n\nFrom the reaction's stoichiometry (1:3 ratio), we can calculate the moles of H⁺ that are consumed to neutralize the Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Moles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × (9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol) ≈ 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol.\n\n**2. The Role of Excess Acid and Final pH**\n\nThe total acid added serves two purposes: (a) the amount that reacts, and (b) the excess amount that remains in the solution to establish the final pH and prevent the Fe(OH)₃ from re-precipitating.\nTotal Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (excess)\n\nThe most robust way to solve this multiple-choice question is to test which of the options is self-consistent with this equation.\n\n**3. Test the Options for Consistency**\n\nLet's test each option to see if the volume of acid provided can account for both the reaction and the final pH. The final volume of the solution is 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n\n*   **Option A: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n    *   Total H⁺ added = 0.1 M × 0.03214 L = 0.003214 mol.\n    *   Excess H⁺ needed for pH 3.16 = [H⁺] × V_total = (10⁻³.¹⁶ M) × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000069 mol.\n    *   Check: Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (excess) = 0.002807 + 0.000069 = 0.002876 mol.\n    *   This required amount (0.002876 mol) does not match the amount added (0.003214 mol). Inconsistent.\n\n*   **Option B: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n    *   Total H⁺ added = 0.1 M × 0.03009 L = 0.003009 mol.\n    *   Excess H⁺ needed for pH 2.69 = [H⁺] × V_total = (10⁻².⁶⁹ M) × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000204 mol.\n    *   Check: Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (excess) = 0.002807 + 0.000204 = 0.003011 mol.\n    *   This required amount (0.003011 mol) is nearly identical to the amount added (0.003009 mol). The very small difference (<0.1%) is due to rounding in constants. **This option is consistent.**\n\n*   **Option C: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n    *   Total H⁺ added = 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = 0.002805 mol.\n    *   The amount of acid added (0.002805 mol) is less than the amount required just to neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ (0.002807 mol). Therefore, the solid would not completely dissolve. Inconsistent.\n\n*   **Option D: pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\n    *   Total H⁺ added = 0.1 M × 0.02040 L = 0.002040 mol.\n    *   The amount of acid added is far less than what is needed for neutralization. Inconsistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly option B presents a combination of acid volume and final pH that is chemically consistent. The volume of 30.09 cm³ provides enough acid to both react with all the Fe(OH)₃ and leave the correct amount of excess H⁺ to result in a final pH of 2.69.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem requires combining stoichiometry with chemical equilibrium. The most robust way to solve such a multiple-choice question is to test the internal consistency of each answer choice.\n\n**1. Foundational Calculations**\nFirst, let's establish the fixed quantities based on the problem statement.\n\n*   **Reaction:** The dissolution of iron(III) hydroxide in a strong acid follows this stoichiometric reaction:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n    This means 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺ for the reaction.\n\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:** We need to find the number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 (Fe) + 3 × (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) ≈ 106.866 g/mol\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 mol\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ for Reaction:** Based on the stoichiometry, the amount of H⁺ that will be consumed by the reaction is:\n    Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol\n\n**2. The Role of Acid and The Consistency Check**\nThe total acid added must serve two purposes:\n1.  Provide the `0.002807 mol` of H⁺ to react with the Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  Provide some additional, \"excess\" H⁺ that will remain in the final 100 cm³ solution to create the final pH.\n\nThe core relationship to check is:\n**Total Moles H⁺ Added = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (remaining to set pH)**\n\nWe can now test each option to see if it satisfies this relationship.\n\n*   **Testing Option C: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n    1.  **Total Moles H⁺ Added** from the volume of acid:\n        Volume = 30.09 cm³ = 0.03009 L\n        Moles added = 0.1 mol/L × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**\n\n    2.  **Moles H⁺ (remaining to set pH)** from the given pH:\n        [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M\n        Moles remaining = [H⁺] × Total Volume = 0.002042 M × 0.1 L = **0.0002042 mol**\n\n    3.  **Check for Consistency:** Let's see if the two components add up to the total.\n        Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (remaining) = 0.002807 mol + 0.0002042 mol = **0.0030112 mol**\n\n    4.  **Compare:** The total moles of H⁺ we added (0.003009 mol) is almost identical to the total moles of H⁺ required by the system (0.0030112 mol). This minuscule difference (<0.1%) is due to rounding in constants and proves that this option is internally consistent.\n\n*   **Testing Other Options (Quickly)**\n    *   **Options A (20.40 cm³) and D (28.05 cm³):** The volume of acid added provides fewer moles of H⁺ than the `0.002807 mol` needed just for the reaction. Therefore, the Fe(OH)₃ would not fully dissolve. These options are physically impossible.\n    *   **Option B (pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³):** Acid added = 0.003214 mol. Acid for reaction = 0.002807 mol. This leaves an excess of 0.000407 mol. In 0.1 L, this gives [H⁺] = 0.00407 M, and a calculated pH of -log(0.00407) ≈ 2.39. This calculated pH (2.39) does not match the given pH (3.16), so this option is inconsistent.\n\n**Conclusion**\nOnly the values presented in option C (pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³) are consistent with the chemical principles governing the system. The amount of acid added is sufficient to both dissolve the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the specified final pH.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n**Analysis of the Problem and Proposed Solutions**\n\nThe core of the problem involves a stoichiometric calculation coupled with an equilibrium consideration.\n1.  **Stoichiometry:** The reaction Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l) governs the amount of acid consumed to dissolve the solid.\n2.  **Equilibrium:** For the dissolution to be \"complete\", enough *extra* acid must be added to lower the pH and keep the hydroxide concentration ([OH⁻]) sufficiently low, preventing the Fe³⁺ from precipitating back out. This excess acid determines the final pH.\n\nThe total moles of H⁺ added from the acid must equal the sum of the moles that reacted with Fe(OH)₃ and the moles that remain in the final 100 cm³ solution to establish the pH.\nTotal Moles H⁺ = (Moles H⁺ reacted) + (Moles H⁺ remaining)\n\n**Step-by-step Verification**\n\n1.  **Calculate Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.0009358 mol**.\n\n2.  **Calculate Moles of H⁺ for Reaction:**\n    *   From the 1:3 stoichiometry, moles of H⁺ reacted = 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n3.  **Test the Options for Internal Consistency:**\n    We can now test each option to see if the given volume of acid can account for both the reacted H⁺ and the remaining H⁺ required for the given pH.\n\n    *   **Test Option A: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n        *   **Total H⁺ Added:** Volume = 30.09 cm³ = 0.03009 L. Moles H⁺ added = 0.1 mol/L × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n        *   **H⁺ Remaining for pH:** A pH of 2.69 in 100 mL (0.1 L) means [H⁺] = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M. Moles H⁺ remaining = 0.002042 M × 0.1 L ≈ **0.000204 mol**.\n        *   **Check Consistency:** Does (H⁺ Reacted) + (H⁺ Remaining) = (H⁺ Added)?\n            0.002807 mol + 0.000204 mol = **0.003011 mol**.\n        *   The total H⁺ required (0.003011 mol) is virtually identical to the total H⁺ added from the volume (0.003009 mol). This option is internally consistent.\n\n    *   **Test Option B: pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\n        *   The volume of acid needed for the reaction alone is 0.002807 mol / 0.1 M = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³. The provided volume of 20.40 cm³ is insufficient to even dissolve the solid. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Test Option C: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n        *   The volume of 28.05 cm³ is almost exactly what is needed for the reaction (28.07 cm³), leaving virtually no excess H⁺. A lack of excess H⁺ would result in a much higher pH, not 2.04. This option is inconsistent.\n\n    *   **Test Option D: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n        *   Total H⁺ Added = 0.1 M × 0.03214 L = 0.003214 mol.\n        *   H⁺ Remaining for pH = (10⁻³.¹⁶ M) × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000069 mol.\n        *   Check: 0.002807 (reacted) + 0.000069 (remaining) = 0.002876 mol. This does not match the 0.003214 mol added. This option is inconsistent.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the pair of values in Option A (pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³) is chemically and mathematically consistent with the problem's conditions.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires combining stoichiometry and equilibrium principles to find a self-consistent answer.\n\n### Step 1: Stoichiometry of the Reaction\n\nFirst, we need to determine the amount of acid required simply to neutralize the 0.1 g of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.\n\n1.  **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   Fe: 55.845 g/mol\n    *   O: 15.999 g/mol\n    *   H: 1.008 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass = 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = **106.866 g/mol**\n\n2.  **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.0009358 mol**\n\n3.  **Balanced Reaction:** The reaction with a strong monobasic acid (H⁺) is:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n4.  **Moles of H⁺ for Reaction:** From the 1:3 stoichiometry, we need 3 moles of H⁺ for every mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × 0.0009358 mol = **0.0028074 mol**\n\nThis is the amount of H⁺ that will be *consumed* by the neutralization reaction.\n\n### Step 2: The Role of Excess Acid and Final pH\n\nTo ensure the Fe(OH)₃ stays dissolved, the solution must remain acidic. This means we must add *more* acid than the stoichiometric amount calculated above. This *excess* acid will remain in the final 100 cm³ solution and determine its pH.\n\nThe total amount of acid added must satisfy the following balance:\n**Total H⁺ Added = (H⁺ Consumed in Reaction) + (H⁺ Remaining to Set pH)**\n\n### Step 3: Testing the Options for Consistency\n\nThe most robust way to solve this is to check which of the given options satisfies the mole balance equation derived in Step 2. Let's test each plausible option.\n\n*   **Moles H⁺ Consumed in Reaction** = 0.0028074 mol (from Step 1)\n*   **H⁺ Remaining to Set pH** = [H⁺] * V_total = (10⁻ᵖᴴ) * 0.1 L\n*   **Total H⁺ Added** = C_acid * V_acid = 0.1 mol/L * V_acid (in L)\n\n**Option A: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\nThe volume of acid (28.05 cm³) is less than the minimum required just for the reaction (0.0028074 mol requires 28.074 cm³). Therefore, the solid would not dissolve completely. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n**Option B: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n*   **Total H⁺ Added:** 0.1 mol/L × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**\n*   **H⁺ Required by System:** (H⁺ Consumed) + (H⁺ Remaining)\n    *   H⁺ Remaining = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M × 0.1 L ≈ 0.002042 M × 0.1 L = 0.0002042 mol\n    *   Total H⁺ Required = 0.0028074 mol + 0.0002042 mol ≈ **0.0030116 mol**\n*   **Comparison:** The total H⁺ added (0.003009 mol) is almost identical to the total H⁺ required by the system (0.0030116 mol). The very small difference (<0.1%) is due to rounding in the problem's values. **This option is consistent.**\n\n**Option C: pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\nThe volume of acid (20.40 cm³) is far less than the minimum required for reaction. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n**Option D: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n*   **Total H⁺ Added:** 0.1 mol/L × 0.03214 L = **0.003214 mol**\n*   **H⁺ Required by System:** (H⁺ Consumed) + (H⁺ Remaining)\n    *   H⁺ Remaining = 10⁻³.¹⁶ M × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000692 M × 0.1 L = 0.0000692 mol\n    *   Total H⁺ Required = 0.0028074 mol + 0.0000692 mol ≈ **0.0028766 mol**\n*   **Comparison:** The total H⁺ added (0.003214 mol) is significantly different from the H⁺ required by the system (0.0028766 mol). **This option is not consistent.**\n\nThe only option that satisfies the principles of stoichiometry and equilibrium is Option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis problem requires combining stoichiometry and equilibrium principles to find a consistent pair of values for the volume of acid added and the resulting pH.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Stoichiometric Calculation:**\n    The first step is to determine the amount of acid required to simply react with the iron(III) hydroxide according to the neutralization reaction:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n    *   **Calculate Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:**\n        M(Fe) + 3 × (M(O) + M(H)) = 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n    *   **Calculate Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n        Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol.\n    *   **Calculate Moles of H⁺ for Reaction:**\n        From the 1:3 stoichiometry, we need 3 moles of H⁺ for every mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n        Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Consideration and Mole Balance:**\n    To dissolve the solid completely, we need to add more acid than the amount calculated above. This *excess* acid will remain in the final 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution and determine its final pH. The total amount of acid added must therefore be the sum of the acid that reacts and the acid that remains in excess.\n\n    Total Moles H⁺ = (Moles H⁺ reacted) + (Moles H⁺ remaining in excess)\n\n3.  **Testing the Options for Consistency:**\n    The most reliable method is to test which of the given options satisfies this mole balance. Let's analyze Option C.\n\n    **Test Option C: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n\n    *   **Part 1: How much total H⁺ was added?**\n        Volume of acid = 30.09 cm³ = 0.03009 L.\n        Total Moles H⁺ added = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n\n    *   **Part 2: How much total H⁺ was required for the system?**\n        *   The amount required for the reaction is **0.002807 mol** (from Step 1).\n        *   The amount required to remain in excess to achieve the given pH is calculated from that pH:\n            Final [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n            Moles H⁺ remaining = Final [H⁺] × Total Volume = 0.002042 mol/L × 0.1 L = **0.0002042 mol**.\n        *   Total H⁺ required = (Moles H⁺ reacted) + (Moles H⁺ remaining) = 0.002807 mol + 0.0002042 mol = **0.0030112 mol**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The total amount of H⁺ added from the volume in option C (0.003009 mol) is a near-perfect match for the total amount of H⁺ required by the chemical system to achieve the pH in option C (0.003011 mol). The difference is negligible and due to rounding.\n\n    Testing other options reveals significant inconsistencies. For example, in Option B, the volume of acid added (28.05 cm³) provides almost exactly the amount needed for neutralization, leaving virtually no excess H⁺. This would not result in the highly acidic pH of 2.04.\n\nTherefore, Option C is the only chemically self-consistent answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis is a quantitative chemistry problem that requires combining stoichiometry with solubility equilibrium principles. Let's break it down logically.\n\n**1. Stoichiometry: The Dissolution Reaction**\nFirst, we need to know how many moles of acid are chemically consumed by the iron(III) hydroxide. The balanced neutralization reaction is:\n`Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)`\n\nThis equation tells us that for every 1 mole of `Fe(OH)₃` we want to dissolve, we need to add 3 moles of `H⁺` from the strong acid to react with it.\n\n**2. Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\nWe calculate the moles of the 0.1 g sample of `Fe(OH)₃`.\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 (Fe) + 3 × (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) ≈ 106.866 g/mol.\n*   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol.\n\n**3. Acid Required for Reaction**\nBased on the 1:3 stoichiometry, the moles of `H⁺` that will be consumed are:\n*   Moles `H⁺` (reacted) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol.\n\n**4. Equilibrium: The Role of Excess Acid**\nSimply adding the amount of acid calculated above is not enough. To keep the dissolved `Fe³⁺` from precipitating back out as `Fe(OH)₃`, the solution must be sufficiently acidic. This means there must be an excess of `H⁺` ions in the final solution, which will determine its pH.\nTherefore, the total amount of acid added must be:\n`Total Moles H⁺ = (Moles H⁺ reacted) + (Moles H⁺ remaining in excess)`\n\n**5. Testing the Options for Consistency**\nThe most reliable way to solve this is to test which of the given options presents a consistent scenario where the amount of acid added matches the amount required for both reaction and equilibrium.\n\nLet's test Option D: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\n*   **Total Moles H⁺ Added**: The volume is 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L) of a 0.1 M acid.\n    *   Total Moles `H⁺` = 0.1 mol/L × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n*   **Moles H⁺ Required**: Now we calculate the total moles needed based on the given final pH.\n    *   Moles `H⁺` (reacted) = **0.002807 mol** (from Step 3).\n    *   Moles `H⁺` (remaining): This is the amount needed to create a pH of 2.69 in the final 100 cm³ (0.1 L) volume.\n        *   `[H⁺]`_final = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n        *   Moles `H⁺` (remaining) = 0.002042 mol/L × 0.1 L = **0.0002042 mol**.\n    *   Total Moles `H⁺` Required = (Moles reacted) + (Moles remaining) = 0.002807 + 0.0002042 = **0.0030112 mol**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe amount of acid added in Option D (0.003009 mol) is a near-perfect match for the total amount of acid required by the system (0.0030112 mol). The very minor difference (<0.1%) is due to rounding in the problem's constants. No other option comes close to this level of consistency.\n\n*   Testing option B shows that the volume of acid provided (28.05 cm³) is less than the volume needed just to react with the Fe(OH)₃ (28.07 cm³), so it cannot be correct.\n*   Testing option A shows a large discrepancy between the acid added and the acid required.\n\nTherefore, the only chemically consistent answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe user wants me to determine the correct answer by analyzing the provided reasoning from multiple agents. I will perform the calculation from first principles to verify the correct approach and conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved.**\n- First, we need the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.\n- Molar Mass (Fe) ≈ 55.845 g/mol\n- Molar Mass (O) ≈ 15.999 g/mol\n- Molar Mass (H) ≈ 1.008 g/mol\n- Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n- Now, calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ in 0.1 g:\n  Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 mol.\n\n**2. Analyze the chemical reaction and acid requirements.**\nThe dissolution in a strong acid follows this neutralization reaction:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThe total amount of H⁺ ions added from the acid serves two purposes:\n- **Part 1 (Reaction):** An amount of H⁺ is consumed to react with all the Fe(OH)₃.\n- **Part 2 (Excess):** An additional amount of H⁺ must remain in the solution to keep the final pH at a value low enough to prevent the Fe(OH)₃ from re-precipitating.\n\n**3. Set up a material balance for the H⁺ ions.**\nThe core of the problem is this equation:\n(Total moles of H⁺ added) = (Moles of H⁺ consumed in reaction) + (Moles of H⁺ remaining in final solution)\n\nLet's calculate each term:\n- **Moles of H⁺ consumed in reaction:**\n  From the 1:3 stoichiometry, this is 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)₃.\n  Moles H⁺ (consumed) = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol.\n\n- **Moles of H⁺ added** and **Moles of H⁺ remaining** are given by the values in the answer options. We must test which option makes the equation true.\n\n**4. Test the options for internal consistency.**\nWe can check if: `(V_acid * 0.1 M) = 0.002807 mol + (10^(-pH) * 0.1 L)`\n\n- **Test A: pH 3.16; V = 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n  - H⁺ added = 0.03214 L × 0.1 M = 0.003214 mol.\n  - H⁺ required = 0.002807 + (10⁻³.16 × 0.1) = 0.002807 + 0.000069 = 0.002876 mol.\n  - *Inconsistent (0.003214 ≠ 0.002876).*\n\n- **Test B: pH 2.04; V = 28.05 cm³ (0.02805 L)**\n  - H⁺ added = 0.02805 L × 0.1 M = 0.002805 mol.\n  - This is less than the 0.002807 mol required just for the reaction. Therefore, the Fe(OH)₃ would not fully dissolve.\n  - *Inconsistent and impossible.*\n\n- **Test C: pH 4.94; V = 20.40 cm³ (0.02040 L)**\n  - H⁺ added = 0.02040 L × 0.1 M = 0.002040 mol.\n  - This is also less than the 0.002807 mol required for the reaction.\n  - *Inconsistent and impossible.*\n\n- **Test D: pH 2.69; V = 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n  - **H⁺ added** = 0.03009 L × 0.1 M = **0.003009 mol**.\n  - **H⁺ required** = 0.002807 + (10⁻².⁶⁹ × 0.1) = 0.002807 + (0.002042 × 0.1) = 0.002807 + 0.0002042 = **0.0030112 mol**.\n  - The amount of acid added (0.003009 mol) is almost identical to the amount required by the system (0.003011 mol). This tiny discrepancy (<0.1%) is due to rounding in the problem's constants.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe analysis shows that only the values provided in option D are chemically consistent. The volume of acid (30.09 cm³) is sufficient to both neutralize the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ and establish the final pH of 2.69 in the 100 cm³ solution. The approaches leading to option B are flawed as they incorrectly disconnect the volume and pH calculations.\n\nThe reasoning in Candidate Answers 1, 5, 8, 10, 11, and 13 is the most sound, all performing the same consistency check and concluding that the values of pH=2.69 and V=30.09 cm³ align.\n\n<<<B) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Define the Chemical Process**\n\nThe core of the problem involves dissolving solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, which is a sparingly soluble base, using a strong acid. The overall chemical reaction is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThe acid added performs two distinct functions:\n*   **Stoichiometric Reaction:** It neutralizes the Fe(OH)₃ base according to the 1:3 mole ratio shown above.\n*   **Establishing Equilibrium:** It leaves an excess of H⁺ ions in the solution. This excess H⁺ keeps the pH low (and thus the hydroxide ion concentration, [OH⁻], very low), which prevents the newly formed Fe³⁺ from precipitating back out as Fe(OH)₃. The condition \"minimum volume\" implies the final solution is just saturated.\n\n**2. Calculate the Stoichiometric Requirement**\n\nFirst, we calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved.\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 (Fe) + 3 × (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) ≈ 106.87 g/mol.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 mol.\n\nNext, we calculate the moles of H⁺ required just to react with this amount of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Moles H⁺ (for reaction) = 3 × Moles Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.0009357 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**3. Test the Options for Self-Consistency**\n\nSince we are given pairs of (pH, Volume), the most reliable method is to check if these pairs are chemically consistent. Let's create a balance sheet for the H⁺ ions:\nTotal Moles H⁺ Added = Moles H⁺ Reacted + Moles H⁺ Remaining in Excess\n\n*   **Total Moles H⁺ Added** = 0.1 M × V_acid (in Liters)\n*   **Moles H⁺ Reacted** = 0.002807 mol (calculated above)\n*   **Moles H⁺ Remaining in Excess** = [H⁺]_final × V_total = 10⁻ᵖᴴ × 0.1 L\n\nLet's test the options from the question.\n\n**Testing Option C: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n*   **Total Moles H⁺ Added** = 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = **0.002805 mol**.\n*   This amount (0.002805 mol) is slightly *less* than the amount required for the reaction (0.002807 mol). This means the Fe(OH)₃ would not fully dissolve. Furthermore, there would be no excess H⁺ from the acid to achieve the very acidic pH of 2.04. This option is inconsistent.\n\n**Testing Option A: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n*   **Total Moles H⁺ Added** = 0.1 M × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n    *   This is sufficient acid for the reaction.\n*   Let's see what the final pH should be with this amount of acid.\n    *   **Moles H⁺ Remaining in Excess** = (Total H⁺ Added) - (H⁺ Reacted) = 0.003009 mol - 0.002807 mol = **0.000202 mol**.\n    *   **Final [H⁺] Concentration** = (Moles in Excess) / (Total Volume) = 0.000202 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00202 M.\n    *   **Calculated pH** = -log₁₀(0.00202) ≈ **2.695**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated pH of 2.695 is a near-perfect match for the pH given in option A (2.69). This demonstrates that the values in option A are self-consistent and accurately represent the chemical reality of the system, accounting for both the stoichiometric reaction and the equilibrium requirements. The other options are not chemically consistent.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires a detailed analysis combining stoichiometry with chemical equilibrium. We must find the option where the volume of acid added is precisely enough to (1) react with the Fe(OH)₃ and (2) establish the final, given pH in the solution.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Calculate Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   First, we determine the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.\n        Molar Mass = M(Fe) + 3 × (M(O) + M(H)) = 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n    *   Next, calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ in the 0.1 g sample.\n        Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol.\n\n2.  **Determine Stoichiometric H⁺ Requirement:**\n    *   The dissolution reaction with a strong acid (H⁺) is:\n        Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n    *   From the 1:3 stoichiometry, we calculate the moles of H⁺ that are consumed by the reaction.\n        Moles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol.\n\n3.  **Determine Excess H⁺ Requirement:**\n    *   In addition to the H⁺ that reacts, an excess amount of H⁺ must remain in the final 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution to establish its final acidic pH.\n    *   The number of moles of this excess H⁺ is given by:\n        Moles of H⁺ (excess) = [H⁺]final × Total Volume = (10⁻ᵖᴴ) × 0.1 L.\n\n4.  **Test the Options for Consistency:**\n    *   The total moles of H⁺ added from the acid must equal the sum of the moles that reacted and the moles that remain in excess.\n        Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (excess)\n    *   We can calculate the \"Total Moles H⁺\" for each option from the given volume and concentration (0.1 M). We then compare this to the required amount calculated from the reaction and the given pH.\n\nLet's test Option D: **pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n\n*   **Total Moles of H⁺ Added (from volume):**\n    Volume = 30.09 cm³ = 0.03009 L\n    Total Moles Added = 0.1 mol/L × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of H⁺ Required (from reaction + pH):**\n    *   Moles H⁺ (reacted) = **0.002807 mol** (from Step 2).\n    *   Moles H⁺ (excess) = (10⁻².⁶⁹ M) × 0.1 L ≈ (0.002042 M) × 0.1 L = **0.000204 mol**.\n    *   Total Moles Required = 0.002807 mol + 0.000204 mol = **0.003011 mol**.\n\n*   **Comparison:**\n    The total moles of acid added (0.003009 mol) is virtually identical to the total moles required by the system to achieve the final state (0.003011 mol). The difference is negligible and due to rounding. This shows that the values in Option D are internally consistent.\n\nTesting any other option reveals a significant discrepancy. For example, in Option B, the volume of acid (28.05 cm³) provides almost exactly 0.002805 moles of H⁺, which is only enough for the reaction and leaves no excess H⁺ to lower the pH to 2.04.\n\nTherefore, the only chemically consistent option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n**Detailed Step-by-Step Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum volume of a 0.1 M strong acid and the final pH required to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ into a final solution volume of 100 cm³. This is a chemistry problem that requires combining stoichiometry and equilibrium principles.\n\nThe most reliable way to solve a multiple-choice question of this nature is to check which of the given options is internally consistent. The correct pair of (Volume, pH) must satisfy the chemical mole balance of the system.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Reactions and Mole Balance**\n\nThere are two main processes the added acid (H⁺) contributes to:\n\n*   **Stoichiometric Neutralization:** The acid reacts with the solid iron(III) hydroxide to dissolve it.\n    Reaction: `Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)`\n    This equation shows that **3 moles of H⁺** are consumed for every **1 mole of Fe(OH)₃** that dissolves.\n\n*   **Establishing Final pH:** After the solid is dissolved, some excess H⁺ must remain in the 100 cm³ solution to keep the pH at its final acidic value. The \"minimum volume\" of acid implies that the solution is just saturated, preventing the Fe(OH)₃ from re-precipitating.\n\nThe overall mole balance for the H⁺ ions can be stated as:\n`(Total Moles of H⁺ Added) = (Moles of H⁺ Consumed in Reaction) + (Moles of H⁺ Remaining to set pH)`\n\n**2. Calculate the Constant Term: Moles of H⁺ Consumed in Reaction**\n\nThis value is the same regardless of which option we test.\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    M(Fe) + 3 * M(O) + 3 * M(H) = 55.845 + 3*(15.999) + 3*(1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved:**\n    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 mol.\n*   **Moles of H⁺ Consumed in Reaction:**\n    From the 1:3 stoichiometry:\n    Moles_reacted = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**3. Test Each Option for Self-Consistency**\n\nNow, we will test each option to see if the `(Total Moles Added)` from its given volume equals the `(Moles Reacted + Moles Remaining)` calculated from its given pH.\n\n**A) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n*   Total Moles Added = 0.1 M × (28.05 cm³ / 1000) = 0.002805 mol.\n*   The acid added (0.002805 mol) is less than the amount required just to react with the solid (0.002807 mol). Therefore, the solid would not even dissolve completely. This option is incorrect.\n\n**B) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n*   Total Moles Added = 0.1 M × (32.14 cm³ / 1000) = 0.003214 mol.\n*   Moles Remaining = (10⁻³.¹⁶ M) × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000069 mol.\n*   Check Balance: Moles Reacted + Moles Remaining = 0.002807 + 0.000069 = 0.002876 mol.\n*   This required amount (0.002876 mol) does not match the added amount (0.003214 mol). This option is incorrect.\n\n**C) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\n*   Total Moles Added = 0.1 M × (20.40 cm³ / 1000) = 0.002040 mol.\n*   The acid added (0.002040 mol) is significantly less than the amount required for the reaction (0.002807 mol). The solid would not dissolve.

The minor difference (<0.1%) is due to rounding in the problem's given values.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the values in option D are chemically and mathematically consistent with the conditions of the problem.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe problem asks for the minimum volume of a 0.1 M strong monobasic acid and the final pH required to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ into a final volume of 100 cm³.\n\nThis is a multi-step problem that involves both stoichiometry and chemical equilibrium. The correct approach is to test which of the given options is internally consistent with the chemical principles involved.\n\n**Step 1: Stoichiometry**\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃.**\n    *   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 (Fe) + 3 × (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) = 106.866 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 mol.\n\n2.  **Determine the moles of H⁺ required for the reaction.**\n    The balanced equation for the dissolution of the base in a strong acid is:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n    The stoichiometry is 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ to 3 moles of H⁺.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ consumed in the reaction (`n_reacted`) = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ 0.0028073 mol.\n\n**Step 2: Total Acid Requirement and Equilibrium**\n\nThe total amount of H⁺ added from the acid serves two purposes:\n1.

Understand the Chemical Process**\n\nThe core of the problem involves dissolving solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, which is a base, into a solution using a strong acid (H⁺). The process involves two key components:\n*   **Stoichiometric Neutralization:** The acid must react with and neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ to break it down into ions.\n    `Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)`\n*   **Equilibrium Maintenance:** An excess of H⁺ ions must remain in the solution. This creates an acidic environment (a specific final pH) that prevents the newly formed Fe³⁺ ions from reacting with water and re-precipitating as Fe(OH)₃.\n\nThe total amount of acid added must account for both of these roles.\n\n**2. Perform the Foundational Calculations**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ that need to be dissolved.\n*   The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is: 55.845 (Fe) + 3 × (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) ≈ **106.866 g/mol**.\n*   The number of moles of Fe(OH)₃ in 0.1 g is:\n    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.00093575 mol**.\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we know that 3 moles of H⁺ are needed to react with every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Moles of H⁺ for reaction = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**3. Test the Options for Consistency**\n\nSince the problem provides paired values of pH and volume, the most reliable method is to check which pair is chemically consistent. For any given option, the total volume of acid added must equal the amount needed for the reaction *plus* the amount needed to create the final pH.\n\nThe relationship is:\n(Total Moles H⁺ Added) = (Moles H⁺ for Reaction) + (Moles H⁺ for pH)\n`(V_acid × M_acid) = (0.002807 mol) + ([H⁺]_final × V_solution)`\n\nLet's test each option with `V_solution` = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.\n\n*   **Option A: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n    *   Acid added = 0.03214 L × 0.1 M = **0.003214 mol**\n    *   Acid required = 0.002807 + (10⁻³.16 M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 + 0.000069 = **0.002876 mol**\n    *   `0.003214 ≠ 0.002876`. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n    *   Acid added = 0.03009 L × 0.1 M = **0.003009 mol**\n    *   Acid required = 0.002807 + (10⁻².⁶⁹ M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 + 0.000204 = **0.003011 mol**\n    *   `0.003009 ≈ 0.003011`. **This is a match.** The minuscule difference is due to rounding in the problem's values.\n\n*   **Option C: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n    *   Acid added = 0.02805 L × 0.1 M = **0.002805 mol**\n    *   The acid added (0.002805 mol) is less than the amount required just to react with the Fe(OH)₃ (0.002807 mol). This means the solid would not even fully dissolve, making this option impossible. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D: pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\n    *   Acid added = 0.02040 L × 0.1 M = **0.002040 mol**\n    *   Similar to option C, the acid added is far less than what is needed for the initial reaction. **Incorrect.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only option that is stoichiometrically and chemically consistent is Option B. The provided volume of acid (30.09 cm³) is sufficient to both dissolve the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ and establish the final pH of 2.69 in the 100 cm³ solution.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Process**\n\nThe problem involves dissolving a sparingly soluble base, iron(III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)₃), in a strong acid. This is a multi-step process involving:\n*   A stoichiometric neutralization reaction.\n*   A solubility equilibrium (governed by Ksp).\n*   The hydrolysis of the resulting Fe³⁺ ion.\n\nThe overall reaction is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThe \"minimum volume\" of acid implies that just enough acid is added to dissolve the solid, meaning the final solution is saturated. This means the ion product Qsp ([Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³) will be equal to the solubility product constant, Ksp.\n\n**2. Stoichiometric Calculation: Moles of Reactants**\n\n*   First, we calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ in the 0.1 g sample.\n    *   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ ≈ 55.845 (Fe) + 3 × (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) = **106.866 g/mol**.\n    *   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.0009358 mol**.\n*   From the balanced equation, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ consumed by the reaction = 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**3. Total Acid Requirement**\n\nThe total acid added serves two functions:\n1.  **Reaction:** The amount calculated above (0.002807 mol) is consumed in the reaction.\n2.  **Maintaining Equilibrium:** An excess amount of H⁺ must remain in the 100 cm³ solution to keep the [OH⁻] low enough to prevent Fe(OH)₃ from precipitating. This excess H⁺ determines the final pH.\n\nTherefore, the following relationship must hold true:\n(Total Moles of H⁺ Added) = (Moles H⁺ Reacted) + (Moles H⁺ Remaining at Final pH)\n\n**4. Testing the Options for Consistency**\n\nThe most reliable way to solve this problem is to check which of the given options is internally consistent with the chemical principles. Let's use the relationship from Step 3.\n\n**Test Option A: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n\n*   **Calculate Total Moles of H⁺ Added:**\n    *   Volume of acid = 30.09 cm³ = 0.03009 L\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = Concentration × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n*   **Calculate Moles of H⁺ Remaining from Final pH:**\n    *   The final solution volume is 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.\n    *   If pH = 2.69, then [H⁺] = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n    *   Moles H⁺ Remaining = [H⁺] × Volume = 0.002042 mol/L × 0.1 L = **0.0002042 mol**.\n*   **Check Consistency:**\n    *   Let's see if the amounts balance: (Moles H⁺ Reacted) + (Moles H⁺ Remaining) = Total Moles H⁺ Added?\n    *   0.002807 mol + 0.0002042 mol = **0.0030112 mol**.\n*   **Compare:** The calculated total H⁺ required (0.0030112 mol) is almost identical to the amount of H⁺ added from the given volume (0.003009 mol). The difference is less than 0.1%, which is negligible and due to rounding. **This option is chemically consistent.**\n\n**Test Option D: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n\n*   **Calculate Total Moles of H⁺ Added:**\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.1 mol/L × 0.02805 L = **0.002805 mol**.\n*   **Compare to Reacted Moles:**\n    *   The amount of acid added (0.002805 mol) is slightly *less* than the amount required just to neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ (0.002807 mol). This means not all of the solid would dissolve. **This option is physically impossible.**\n\nTesting the other options would reveal similar inconsistencies. The only option where the volume of acid is sufficient to both dissolve the precipitate and establish the stated final pH is Option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires finding the minimum volume of a 0.1 M strong acid and the final pH needed to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ into a 100 cm³ solution. This is a multi-step problem that involves both stoichiometry and chemical equilibrium principles. The best way to solve such a problem with multiple-choice options is to test which option presents a chemically self-consistent scenario.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Calculate Moles and Stoichiometry**\n\n*   **Reaction:** The fundamental chemical reaction is the neutralization of the base Fe(OH)₃ by a strong acid (H⁺).\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n    The stoichiometry is key: 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺.\n\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:** We first need the number of moles corresponding to 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 (Fe) + 3 × (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) ≈ **106.866 g/mol**.\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.00093575 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ for Reaction:** Based on the 1:3 stoichiometry, the moles of H⁺ required to *just react* with the solid are:\n    *   Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Role of the Acid and the Final State**\n\nThe added acid must do two things:\n1.  **React:** Provide the 0.002807 moles of H⁺ needed to neutralize the Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  **Maintain pH:** Provide an additional, excess amount of H⁺ that remains in the final 100 cm³ solution to keep the pH low enough so the Fe(OH)₃ does not precipitate back out. The \"minimum\" volume refers to the smallest amount of acid that can achieve both of these tasks.\n\nThe total amount of acid added must therefore be:\n**Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (excess)**\n\n**3. Test the Options for Consistency**\n\nWe can now check which option provides a (Volume, pH) pair that satisfies this balance. Let's test the options from the question.\n\n*   **Test Option B: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n\n    1.  **Calculate the total moles of H⁺ added from this volume:**\n        *   Volume = 30.09 cm³ = 0.03009 L\n        *   Total Moles H⁺ = Concentration × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n\n    2.  **Calculate the moles of excess H⁺ that *should* be in the solution to produce the given pH:**\n        *   Final solution volume = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L\n        *   Final [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n        *   Moles H⁺ (excess) = Final [H⁺] × Final Volume = 0.002042 mol/L × 0.1 L ≈ **0.000204 mol**.\n\n    3.  **Check if the balance holds:**\n        *   Does (Total Moles H⁺) equal (Moles H⁺ reacted + Moles H⁺ excess)?\n        *   Moles H⁺ reacted + Moles H⁺ excess = 0.002807 + 0.000204 = **0.003011 mol**.\n        *   Compare this required total (0.003011 mol) to the actual total added from the volume (0.003009 mol).\n\n    The values are nearly identical. The minuscule difference (0.000002 mol) is due to rounding in the problem's constants. This shows that the pair {pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³} is stoichiometrically self-consistent.\n\n*   **Test Option C: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n\n    1.  **Total Moles of H⁺ added:**\n        *   Volume = 28.05 cm³ = 0.02805 L\n        *   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.1 mol/L × 0.02805 L = **0.002805 mol**.\n\n    2.  This volume provides almost exactly the amount of acid needed for the reaction (0.002807 mol) and leaves virtually no excess acid from the strong acid itself. The pH would therefore be determined by the hydrolysis of the Fe³⁺ ion. Rigorous calculation of this hydrolysis (Fe³⁺ + H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺ + H⁺) gives a pH of ~2.29, which does not match the stated pH of 2.04. This option is inconsistent.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly the pair of values in option B is internally consistent. The volume of acid is sufficient to both neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the final required pH.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

This is a multi-step problem that involves both stoichiometry and chemical equilibrium. The correct answer must have a volume and pH that are mutually consistent.\n\n#### Step 1: Calculate the Stoichiometric Requirement\n\n1.  **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃**:\n    M(Fe) + 3 × (M(O) + M(H)) = 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = **106.866 g/mol**.\n\n2.  **Moles of Fe(OH)₃**:\n    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol = **0.00093575 mol**.\n\n3.  **Chemical Reaction**: The acid neutralizes the Fe(OH)₃.\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n    The stoichiometry is 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ to 3 moles of H⁺.\n\n4.  **Moles of H⁺ for Reaction (n_reacted)**: This is the amount of H⁺ consumed by the neutralization.\n    n_reacted = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.00093575 mol = **0.0028073 mol**.\n\nThis value represents the amount of H⁺ *consumed* by the solid. However, to keep the Fe³⁺ ions in solution, an *excess* of H⁺ is needed to maintain a low pH and prevent the reverse reaction (precipitation). The total acid added must account for both the reacted amount and the excess amount.\n\n**Total H⁺ needed (n_total) = H⁺ for reaction (n_reacted) + H⁺ remaining in excess (n_excess)**\n\n#### Step 2: Evaluate the Options for Consistency\n\nWe must test the options to see which pair of (pH, Volume) values is consistent with the chemical principles.\n\n**Test Option C: pH = 2.69; Volume = 30.09 cm³**\n\n1.  **Calculate Total H⁺ Added (from the given volume)**:\n    Volume = 30.09 cm³ = 0.03009 L.\n    n_total = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n\n2.  **Calculate Excess H⁺ (n_excess) from the mole balance**:\n    n_excess = n_total - n_reacted = 0.003009 mol - 0.0028073 mol = **0.0002017 mol**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH from this excess H⁺ and check for consistency**:\n    This excess H⁺ (0.0002017 mol) is present in the final solution volume of 100 cm³ (0.1 L).\n    [H⁺]_final = n_excess / Total Volume = 0.0002017 mol / 0.1 L = 0.002017 M.\n    Calculated pH = -log₁₀([H⁺]_final) = -log₁₀(0.002017) ≈ **2.695**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Option C**: The calculated pH of ~2.695 is an excellent match for the pH of 2.69 given in the option. This means the provided volume (30.09 cm³) is consistent with the acid needed to both dissolve the solid and establish the final pH of 2.69. This is the only chemically self-consistent option.\n\n---\n**Why other options are incorrect (e.g., Option A: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³):**\n\n1.  **Volume Check**: The volume 28.05 cm³ provides 0.1 M * 0.02805 L = 0.002805 moles of H⁺. This is almost exactly the amount needed for the reaction (0.002807 mol) and leaves virtually no excess H⁺ to lower the pH significantly.\n2.  **Inconsistency**: A solution with no significant excess strong acid would have its pH determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺ (which gives a pH of ~2.3), not 2.04. Furthermore, to achieve a pH of 2.04, a large excess of H⁺ is required, meaning a much larger volume of acid would be needed (around 37 cm³). Therefore, the pH and volume values in Option A are inconsistent with each other.\n\nFinal analysis confirms that the calculations used by the majority of the agents, which lead to Option C, are correct and rigorous.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nTo determine the correct answer, we must find the pair of pH and volume that is chemically and stoichiometrically consistent. The process involves two main considerations: the acid needed for the neutralization reaction and the excess acid needed to maintain the final pH for complete dissolution.\n\n**1. Analyze the Stoichiometry**\n\nThe chemical reaction between iron(III) hydroxide and a strong acid (H⁺) is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nFirst, we calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved.\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ ≈ 55.85 + 3*(16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol.\n\nFrom the reaction's stoichiometry (1:3 ratio), we can calculate the moles of H⁺ that are consumed to neutralize the Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Moles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × (9.356 x 10⁻⁴ mol) ≈ 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol.\n\n**2. The Role of Excess Acid and Final pH**\n\nThe total acid added serves two purposes: (a) the amount that reacts, and (b) the excess amount that remains in the solution to establish the final pH and prevent the Fe(OH)₃ from re-precipitating.\nTotal Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (excess)\n\nThe most robust way to solve this multiple-choice question is to test which of the options is self-consistent with this equation.\n\n**3. Test the Options for Consistency**\n\nLet's test each option to see if the volume of acid provided can account for both the reaction and the final pH.

Inconsistent.\n\n*   **Option B: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n    *   Total H⁺ added = 0.1 M × 0.03009 L = 0.003009 mol.\n    *   Excess H⁺ needed for pH 2.69 = [H⁺] × V_total = (10⁻².⁶⁹ M) × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000204 mol.\n    *   Check: Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (excess) = 0.002807 + 0.000204 = 0.003011 mol.\n    *   This required amount (0.003011 mol) is nearly identical to the amount added (0.003009 mol).

Inconsistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly option B presents a combination of acid volume and final pH that is chemically consistent. The volume of 30.09 cm³ provides enough acid to both react with all the Fe(OH)₃ and leave the correct amount of excess H⁺ to result in a final pH of 2.69.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nThis problem requires combining stoichiometry with chemical equilibrium. The most robust way to solve such a multiple-choice question is to test the internal consistency of each answer choice.\n\n**1. Foundational Calculations**\nFirst, let's establish the fixed quantities based on the problem statement.\n\n*   **Reaction:** The dissolution of iron(III) hydroxide in a strong acid follows this stoichiometric reaction:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n    This means 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺ for the reaction.\n\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:** We need to find the number of moles in 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 (Fe) + 3 × (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) ≈ 106.866 g/mol\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 mol\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ for Reaction:** Based on the stoichiometry, the amount of H⁺ that will be consumed by the reaction is:\n    Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol\n\n**2. The Role of Acid and The Consistency Check**\nThe total acid added must serve two purposes:\n1.  Provide the `0.002807 mol` of H⁺ to react with the Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  Provide some additional, \"excess\" H⁺ that will remain in the final 100 cm³ solution to create the final pH.\n\nThe core relationship to check is:\n**Total Moles H⁺ Added = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (remaining to set pH)**\n\nWe can now test each option to see if it satisfies this relationship.\n\n*   **Testing Option C: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n    1.  **Total Moles H⁺ Added** from the volume of acid:\n        Volume = 30.09 cm³ = 0.03009 L\n        Moles added = 0.1 mol/L × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**\n\n    2.  **Moles H⁺ (remaining to set pH)** from the given pH:\n        [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M\n        Moles remaining = [H⁺] × Total Volume = 0.002042 M × 0.1 L = **0.0002042 mol**\n\n    3.  **Check for Consistency:** Let's see if the two components add up to the total.\n        Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (remaining) = 0.002807 mol + 0.0002042 mol = **0.0030112 mol**\n\n    4.  **Compare:** The total moles of H⁺ we added (0.003009 mol) is almost identical to the total moles of H⁺ required by the system (0.0030112 mol). This minuscule difference (<0.1%) is due to rounding in constants and proves that this option is internally consistent.\n\n*   **Testing Other Options (Quickly)**\n    *   **Options A (20.40 cm³) and D (28.05 cm³):** The volume of acid added provides fewer moles of H⁺ than the `0.002807 mol` needed just for the reaction. Therefore, the Fe(OH)₃ would not fully dissolve. These options are physically impossible.\n    *   **Option B (pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³):** Acid added = 0.003214 mol. Acid for reaction = 0.002807 mol. This leaves an excess of 0.000407 mol. In 0.1 L, this gives [H⁺] = 0.00407 M, and a calculated pH of -log(0.00407) ≈ 2.39. This calculated pH (2.39) does not match the given pH (3.16), so this option is inconsistent.\n\n**Conclusion**\nOnly the values presented in option C (pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³) are consistent with the chemical principles governing the system. The amount of acid added is sufficient to both dissolve the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the specified final pH.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\n**Analysis of the Problem and Proposed Solutions**\n\nThe core of the problem involves a stoichiometric calculation coupled with an equilibrium consideration.\n1.  **Stoichiometry:** The reaction Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l) governs the amount of acid consumed to dissolve the solid.\n2.  **Equilibrium:** For the dissolution to be \"complete\", enough *extra* acid must be added to lower the pH and keep the hydroxide concentration ([OH⁻]) sufficiently low, preventing the Fe³⁺ from precipitating back out. This excess acid determines the final pH.\n\nThe total moles of H⁺ added from the acid must equal the sum of the moles that reacted with Fe(OH)₃ and the moles that remain in the final 100 cm³ solution to establish the pH.\nTotal Moles H⁺ = (Moles H⁺ reacted) + (Moles H⁺ remaining)\n\n**Step-by-step Verification**\n\n1.  **Calculate Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.0009358 mol**.\n\n2.  **Calculate Moles of H⁺ for Reaction:**\n    *   From the 1:3 stoichiometry, moles of H⁺ reacted = 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n3.  **Test the Options for Internal Consistency:**\n    We can now test each option to see if the given volume of acid can account for both the reacted H⁺ and the remaining H⁺ required for the given pH.\n\n    *   **Test Option A: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n        *   **Total H⁺ Added:** Volume = 30.09 cm³ = 0.03009 L. Moles H⁺ added = 0.1 mol/L × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n        *   **H⁺ Remaining for pH:** A pH of 2.69 in 100 mL (0.1 L) means [H⁺] = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M. Moles H⁺ remaining = 0.002042 M × 0.1 L ≈ **0.000204 mol**.\n        *   **Check Consistency:** Does (H⁺ Reacted) + (H⁺ Remaining) = (H⁺ Added)?\n            0.002807 mol + 0.000204 mol = **0.003011 mol**.\n        *   The total H⁺ required (0.003011 mol) is virtually identical to the total H⁺ added from the volume (0.003009 mol). This option is internally consistent.\n\n    *   **Test Option B: pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\n        *   The volume of acid needed for the reaction alone is 0.002807 mol / 0.1 M = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³. The provided volume of 20.40 cm³ is insufficient to even dissolve the solid. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Test Option C: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n        *   The volume of 28.05 cm³ is almost exactly what is needed for the reaction (28.07 cm³), leaving virtually no excess H⁺. A lack of excess H⁺ would result in a much higher pH, not 2.04. This option is inconsistent.\n\n    *   **Test Option D: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n        *   Total H⁺ Added = 0.1 M × 0.03214 L = 0.003214 mol.\n        *   H⁺ Remaining for pH = (10⁻³.¹⁶ M) × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000069 mol.\n        *   Check: 0.002807 (reacted) + 0.000069 (remaining) = 0.002876 mol. This does not match the 0.003214 mol added. This option is inconsistent.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the pair of values in Option A (pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³) is chemically and mathematically consistent with the problem's conditions.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires combining stoichiometry and equilibrium principles to find a self-consistent answer.\n\n### Step 1: Stoichiometry of the Reaction\n\nFirst, we need to determine the amount of acid required simply to neutralize the 0.1 g of iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃.\n\n1.  **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   Fe: 55.845 g/mol\n    *   O: 15.999 g/mol\n    *   H: 1.008 g/mol\n    *   Molar Mass = 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = **106.866 g/mol**\n\n2.  **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.0009358 mol**\n\n3.  **Balanced Reaction:** The reaction with a strong monobasic acid (H⁺) is:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n4.  **Moles of H⁺ for Reaction:** From the 1:3 stoichiometry, we need 3 moles of H⁺ for every mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × 0.0009358 mol = **0.0028074 mol**\n\nThis is the amount of H⁺ that will be *consumed* by the neutralization reaction.\n\n### Step 2: The Role of Excess Acid and Final pH\n\nTo ensure the Fe(OH)₃ stays dissolved, the solution must remain acidic. This means we must add *more* acid than the stoichiometric amount calculated above. This *excess* acid will remain in the final 100 cm³ solution and determine its pH.\n\nThe total amount of acid added must satisfy the following balance:\n**Total H⁺ Added = (H⁺ Consumed in Reaction) + (H⁺ Remaining to Set pH)**\n\n### Step 3: Testing the Options for Consistency\n\nThe most robust way to solve this is to check which of the given options satisfies the mole balance equation derived in Step 2. Let's test each plausible option.\n\n*   **Moles H⁺ Consumed in Reaction** = 0.0028074 mol (from Step 1)\n*   **H⁺ Remaining to Set pH** = [H⁺] * V_total = (10⁻ᵖᴴ) * 0.1 L\n*   **Total H⁺ Added** = C_acid * V_acid = 0.1 mol/L * V_acid (in L)\n\n**Option A: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\nThe volume of acid (28.05 cm³) is less than the minimum required just for the reaction (0.0028074 mol requires 28.074 cm³). Therefore, the solid would not dissolve completely. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n**Option B: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n*   **Total H⁺ Added:** 0.1 mol/L × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**\n*   **H⁺ Required by System:** (H⁺ Consumed) + (H⁺ Remaining)\n    *   H⁺ Remaining = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M × 0.1 L ≈ 0.002042 M × 0.1 L = 0.0002042 mol\n    *   Total H⁺ Required = 0.0028074 mol + 0.0002042 mol ≈ **0.0030116 mol**\n*   **Comparison:** The total H⁺ added (0.003009 mol) is almost identical to the total H⁺ required by the system (0.0030116 mol). The very small difference (<0.1%) is due to rounding in the problem's values. **This option is consistent.**\n\n**Option C: pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\nThe volume of acid (20.40 cm³) is far less than the minimum required for reaction. **This option is incorrect.**\n\n**Option D: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n*   **Total H⁺ Added:** 0.1 mol/L × 0.03214 L = **0.003214 mol**\n*   **H⁺ Required by System:** (H⁺ Consumed) + (H⁺ Remaining)\n    *   H⁺ Remaining = 10⁻³.¹⁶ M × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000692 M × 0.1 L = 0.0000692 mol\n    *   Total H⁺ Required = 0.0028074 mol + 0.0000692 mol ≈ **0.0028766 mol**\n*   **Comparison:** The total H⁺ added (0.003214 mol) is significantly different from the H⁺ required by the system (0.0028766 mol). **This option is not consistent.**\n\nThe only option that satisfies the principles of stoichiometry and equilibrium is Option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThis problem requires combining stoichiometry and equilibrium principles to find a consistent pair of values for the volume of acid added and the resulting pH.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Stoichiometric Calculation:**\n    The first step is to determine the amount of acid required to simply react with the iron(III) hydroxide according to the neutralization reaction:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\n    *   **Calculate Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:**\n        M(Fe) + 3 × (M(O) + M(H)) = 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n    *   **Calculate Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n        Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol.\n    *   **Calculate Moles of H⁺ for Reaction:**\n        From the 1:3 stoichiometry, we need 3 moles of H⁺ for every mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n        Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Consideration and Mole Balance:**\n    To dissolve the solid completely, we need to add more acid than the amount calculated above. This *excess* acid will remain in the final 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution and determine its final pH. The total amount of acid added must therefore be the sum of the acid that reacts and the acid that remains in excess.\n\n    Total Moles H⁺ = (Moles H⁺ reacted) + (Moles H⁺ remaining in excess)\n\n3.  **Testing the Options for Consistency:**\n    The most reliable method is to test which of the given options satisfies this mole balance. Let's analyze Option C.\n\n    **Test Option C: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n\n    *   **Part 1: How much total H⁺ was added?**\n        Volume of acid = 30.09 cm³ = 0.03009 L.\n        Total Moles H⁺ added = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n\n    *   **Part 2: How much total H⁺ was required for the system?**\n        *   The amount required for the reaction is **0.002807 mol** (from Step 1).\n        *   The amount required to remain in excess to achieve the given pH is calculated from that pH:\n            Final [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n            Moles H⁺ remaining = Final [H⁺] × Total Volume = 0.002042 mol/L × 0.1 L = **0.0002042 mol**.\n        *   Total H⁺ required = (Moles H⁺ reacted) + (Moles H⁺ remaining) = 0.002807 mol + 0.0002042 mol = **0.0030112 mol**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The total amount of H⁺ added from the volume in option C (0.003009 mol) is a near-perfect match for the total amount of H⁺ required by the chemical system to achieve the pH in option C (0.003011 mol). The difference is negligible and due to rounding.\n\n    Testing other options reveals significant inconsistencies. For example, in Option B, the volume of acid added (28.05 cm³) provides almost exactly the amount needed for neutralization, leaving virtually no excess H⁺. This would not result in the highly acidic pH of 2.04.\n\nTherefore, Option C is the only chemically self-consistent answer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nThis is a quantitative chemistry problem that requires combining stoichiometry with solubility equilibrium principles. Let's break it down logically.\n\n**1. Stoichiometry: The Dissolution Reaction**\nFirst, we need to know how many moles of acid are chemically consumed by the iron(III) hydroxide. The balanced neutralization reaction is:\n`Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)`\n\nThis equation tells us that for every 1 mole of `Fe(OH)₃` we want to dissolve, we need to add 3 moles of `H⁺` from the strong acid to react with it.\n\n**2. Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\nWe calculate the moles of the 0.1 g sample of `Fe(OH)₃`.\n*   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 (Fe) + 3 × (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) ≈ 106.866 g/mol.\n*   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol.\n\n**3. Acid Required for Reaction**\nBased on the 1:3 stoichiometry, the moles of `H⁺` that will be consumed are:\n*   Moles `H⁺` (reacted) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol.\n\n**4. Equilibrium: The Role of Excess Acid**\nSimply adding the amount of acid calculated above is not enough. To keep the dissolved `Fe³⁺` from precipitating back out as `Fe(OH)₃`, the solution must be sufficiently acidic. This means there must be an excess of `H⁺` ions in the final solution, which will determine its pH.\nTherefore, the total amount of acid added must be:\n`Total Moles H⁺ = (Moles H⁺ reacted) + (Moles H⁺ remaining in excess)`\n\n**5. Testing the Options for Consistency**\nThe most reliable way to solve this is to test which of the given options presents a consistent scenario where the amount of acid added matches the amount required for both reaction and equilibrium.\n\nLet's test Option D: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³\n*   **Total Moles H⁺ Added**: The volume is 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L) of a 0.1 M acid.\n    *   Total Moles `H⁺` = 0.1 mol/L × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n*   **Moles H⁺ Required**: Now we calculate the total moles needed based on the given final pH.\n    *   Moles `H⁺` (reacted) = **0.002807 mol** (from Step 3).\n    *   Moles `H⁺` (remaining): This is the amount needed to create a pH of 2.69 in the final 100 cm³ (0.1 L) volume.\n        *   `[H⁺]`_final = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n        *   Moles `H⁺` (remaining) = 0.002042 mol/L × 0.1 L = **0.0002042 mol**.\n    *   Total Moles `H⁺` Required = (Moles reacted) + (Moles remaining) = 0.002807 + 0.0002042 = **0.0030112 mol**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe amount of acid added in Option D (0.003009 mol) is a near-perfect match for the total amount of acid required by the system (0.0030112 mol). The very minor difference (<0.1%) is due to rounding in the problem's constants. No other option comes close to this level of consistency.\n\n*   Testing option B shows that the volume of acid provided (28.05 cm³) is less than the volume needed just to react with the Fe(OH)₃ (28.07 cm³), so it cannot be correct.\n*   Testing option A shows a large discrepancy between the acid added and the acid required.\n\nTherefore, the only chemically consistent answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nThe user wants me to determine the correct answer by analyzing the provided reasoning from multiple agents. I will perform the calculation from first principles to verify the correct approach and conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved.**\n- First, we need the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.\n- Molar Mass (Fe) ≈ 55.845 g/mol\n- Molar Mass (O) ≈ 15.999 g/mol\n- Molar Mass (H) ≈ 1.008 g/mol\n- Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n- Now, calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ in 0.1 g:\n  Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 mol.\n\n**2. Analyze the chemical reaction and acid requirements.**\nThe dissolution in a strong acid follows this neutralization reaction:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThe total amount of H⁺ ions added from the acid serves two purposes:\n- **Part 1 (Reaction):** An amount of H⁺ is consumed to react with all the Fe(OH)₃.\n- **Part 2 (Excess):** An additional amount of H⁺ must remain in the solution to keep the final pH at a value low enough to prevent the Fe(OH)₃ from re-precipitating.\n\n**3. Set up a material balance for the H⁺ ions.**\nThe core of the problem is this equation:\n(Total moles of H⁺ added) = (Moles of H⁺ consumed in reaction) + (Moles of H⁺ remaining in final solution)\n\nLet's calculate each term:\n- **Moles of H⁺ consumed in reaction:**\n  From the 1:3 stoichiometry, this is 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)₃.\n  Moles H⁺ (consumed) = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol.\n\n- **Moles of H⁺ added** and **Moles of H⁺ remaining** are given by the values in the answer options. We must test which option makes the equation true.\n\n**4. Test the options for internal consistency.**\nWe can check if: `(V_acid * 0.1 M) = 0.002807 mol + (10^(-pH) * 0.1 L)`\n\n- **Test A: pH 3.16; V = 32.14 cm³ (0.03214 L)**\n  - H⁺ added = 0.03214 L × 0.1 M = 0.003214 mol.\n  - H⁺ required = 0.002807 + (10⁻³.16 × 0.1) = 0.002807 + 0.000069 = 0.002876 mol.\n  - *Inconsistent (0.003214 ≠ 0.002876).*\n\n- **Test B: pH 2.04; V = 28.05 cm³ (0.02805 L)**\n  - H⁺ added = 0.02805 L × 0.1 M = 0.002805 mol.\n  - This is less than the 0.002807 mol required just for the reaction. Therefore, the Fe(OH)₃ would not fully dissolve.\n  - *Inconsistent and impossible.*\n\n- **Test C: pH 4.94; V = 20.40 cm³ (0.02040 L)**\n  - H⁺ added = 0.02040 L × 0.1 M = 0.002040 mol.\n  - This is also less than the 0.002807 mol required for the reaction.\n  - *Inconsistent and impossible.*\n\n- **Test D: pH 2.69; V = 30.09 cm³ (0.03009 L)**\n  - **H⁺ added** = 0.03009 L × 0.1 M = **0.003009 mol**.\n  - **H⁺ required** = 0.002807 + (10⁻².⁶⁹ × 0.1) = 0.002807 + (0.002042 × 0.1) = 0.002807 + 0.0002042 = **0.0030112 mol**.\n  - The amount of acid added (0.003009 mol) is almost identical to the amount required by the system (0.003011 mol). This tiny discrepancy (<0.1%) is due to rounding in the problem's constants.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe analysis shows that only the values provided in option D are chemically consistent. The volume of acid (30.09 cm³) is sufficient to both neutralize the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ and establish the final pH of 2.69 in the 100 cm³ solution. The approaches leading to option B are flawed as they incorrectly disconnect the volume and pH calculations.\n\nThe reasoning in Candidate Answers 1, 5, 8, 10, 11, and 13 is the most sound, all performing the same consistency check and concluding that the values of pH=2.69 and V=30.09 cm³ align.\n\n<<<B) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Define the Chemical Process**\n\nThe core of the problem involves dissolving solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, which is a sparingly soluble base, using a strong acid. The overall chemical reaction is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThe acid added performs two distinct functions:\n*   **Stoichiometric Reaction:** It neutralizes the Fe(OH)₃ base according to the 1:3 mole ratio shown above.\n*   **Establishing Equilibrium:** It leaves an excess of H⁺ ions in the solution. This excess H⁺ keeps the pH low (and thus the hydroxide ion concentration, [OH⁻], very low), which prevents the newly formed Fe³⁺ from precipitating back out as Fe(OH)₃. The condition \"minimum volume\" implies the final solution is just saturated.\n\n**2. Calculate the Stoichiometric Requirement**\n\nFirst, we calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved.\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 (Fe) + 3 × (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) ≈ 106.87 g/mol.\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 mol.\n\nNext, we calculate the moles of H⁺ required just to react with this amount of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Moles H⁺ (for reaction) = 3 × Moles Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.0009357 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**3. Test the Options for Self-Consistency**\n\nSince we are given pairs of (pH, Volume), the most reliable method is to check if these pairs are chemically consistent. Let's create a balance sheet for the H⁺ ions:\nTotal Moles H⁺ Added = Moles H⁺ Reacted + Moles H⁺ Remaining in Excess\n\n*   **Total Moles H⁺ Added** = 0.1 M × V_acid (in Liters)\n*   **Moles H⁺ Reacted** = 0.002807 mol (calculated above)\n*   **Moles H⁺ Remaining in Excess** = [H⁺]_final × V_total = 10⁻ᵖᴴ × 0.1 L\n\nLet's test the options from the question.\n\n**Testing Option C: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n*   **Total Moles H⁺ Added** = 0.1 M × 0.02805 L = **0.002805 mol**.\n*   This amount (0.002805 mol) is slightly *less* than the amount required for the reaction (0.002807 mol). This means the Fe(OH)₃ would not fully dissolve. Furthermore, there would be no excess H⁺ from the acid to achieve the very acidic pH of 2.04. This option is inconsistent.\n\n**Testing Option A: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n*   **Total Moles H⁺ Added** = 0.1 M × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n    *   This is sufficient acid for the reaction.\n*   Let's see what the final pH should be with this amount of acid.\n    *   **Moles H⁺ Remaining in Excess** = (Total H⁺ Added) - (H⁺ Reacted) = 0.003009 mol - 0.002807 mol = **0.000202 mol**.\n    *   **Final [H⁺] Concentration** = (Moles in Excess) / (Total Volume) = 0.000202 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00202 M.\n    *   **Calculated pH** = -log₁₀(0.00202) ≈ **2.695**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated pH of 2.695 is a near-perfect match for the pH given in option A (2.69). This demonstrates that the values in option A are self-consistent and accurately represent the chemical reality of the system, accounting for both the stoichiometric reaction and the equilibrium requirements. The other options are not chemically consistent.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nThis problem requires a detailed analysis combining stoichiometry with chemical equilibrium. We must find the option where the volume of acid added is precisely enough to (1) react with the Fe(OH)₃ and (2) establish the final, given pH in the solution.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Calculate Moles of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    *   First, we determine the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃.\n        Molar Mass = M(Fe) + 3 × (M(O) + M(H)) = 55.845 + 3 × (15.999 + 1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n    *   Next, calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ in the 0.1 g sample.\n        Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol.\n\n2.  **Determine Stoichiometric H⁺ Requirement:**\n    *   The dissolution reaction with a strong acid (H⁺) is:\n        Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n    *   From the 1:3 stoichiometry, we calculate the moles of H⁺ that are consumed by the reaction.\n        Moles of H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol.\n\n3.  **Determine Excess H⁺ Requirement:**\n    *   In addition to the H⁺ that reacts, an excess amount of H⁺ must remain in the final 100 cm³ (0.1 L) solution to establish its final acidic pH.\n    *   The number of moles of this excess H⁺ is given by:\n        Moles of H⁺ (excess) = [H⁺]final × Total Volume = (10⁻ᵖᴴ) × 0.1 L.\n\n4.  **Test the Options for Consistency:**\n    *   The total moles of H⁺ added from the acid must equal the sum of the moles that reacted and the moles that remain in excess.\n        Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (excess)\n    *   We can calculate the \"Total Moles H⁺\" for each option from the given volume and concentration (0.1 M). We then compare this to the required amount calculated from the reaction and the given pH.\n\nLet's test Option D: **pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n\n*   **Total Moles of H⁺ Added (from volume):**\n    Volume = 30.09 cm³ = 0.03009 L\n    Total Moles Added = 0.1 mol/L × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of H⁺ Required (from reaction + pH):**\n    *   Moles H⁺ (reacted) = **0.002807 mol** (from Step 2).\n    *   Moles H⁺ (excess) = (10⁻².⁶⁹ M) × 0.1 L ≈ (0.002042 M) × 0.1 L = **0.000204 mol**.\n    *   Total Moles Required = 0.002807 mol + 0.000204 mol = **0.003011 mol**.\n\n*   **Comparison:**\n    The total moles of acid added (0.003009 mol) is virtually identical to the total moles required by the system to achieve the final state (0.003011 mol). The difference is negligible and due to rounding. This shows that the values in Option D are internally consistent.\n\nTesting any other option reveals a significant discrepancy. For example, in Option B, the volume of acid (28.05 cm³) provides almost exactly 0.002805 moles of H⁺, which is only enough for the reaction and leaves no excess H⁺ to lower the pH to 2.04.\n\nTherefore, the only chemically consistent option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\n**Detailed Step-by-Step Analysis of the Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum volume of a 0.1 M strong acid and the final pH required to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ into a final solution volume of 100 cm³. This is a chemistry problem that requires combining stoichiometry and equilibrium principles.\n\nThe most reliable way to solve a multiple-choice question of this nature is to check which of the given options is internally consistent. The correct pair of (Volume, pH) must satisfy the chemical mole balance of the system.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Reactions and Mole Balance**\n\nThere are two main processes the added acid (H⁺) contributes to:\n\n*   **Stoichiometric Neutralization:** The acid reacts with the solid iron(III) hydroxide to dissolve it.\n    Reaction: `Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)`\n    This equation shows that **3 moles of H⁺** are consumed for every **1 mole of Fe(OH)₃** that dissolves.\n\n*   **Establishing Final pH:** After the solid is dissolved, some excess H⁺ must remain in the 100 cm³ solution to keep the pH at its final acidic value. The \"minimum volume\" of acid implies that the solution is just saturated, preventing the Fe(OH)₃ from re-precipitating.\n\nThe overall mole balance for the H⁺ ions can be stated as:\n`(Total Moles of H⁺ Added) = (Moles of H⁺ Consumed in Reaction) + (Moles of H⁺ Remaining to set pH)`\n\n**2. Calculate the Constant Term: Moles of H⁺ Consumed in Reaction**\n\nThis value is the same regardless of which option we test.\n*   **Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃:**\n    M(Fe) + 3 * M(O) + 3 * M(H) = 55.845 + 3*(15.999) + 3*(1.008) = 106.866 g/mol.\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃ to be dissolved:**\n    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 mol.\n*   **Moles of H⁺ Consumed in Reaction:**\n    From the 1:3 stoichiometry:\n    Moles_reacted = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**3. Test Each Option for Self-Consistency**\n\nNow, we will test each option to see if the `(Total Moles Added)` from its given volume equals the `(Moles Reacted + Moles Remaining)` calculated from its given pH.\n\n**A) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n*   Total Moles Added = 0.1 M × (28.05 cm³ / 1000) = 0.002805 mol.\n*   The acid added (0.002805 mol) is less than the amount required just to react with the solid (0.002807 mol). Therefore, the solid would not even dissolve completely. This option is incorrect.\n\n**B) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n*   Total Moles Added = 0.1 M × (32.14 cm³ / 1000) = 0.003214 mol.\n*   Moles Remaining = (10⁻³.¹⁶ M) × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000069 mol.\n*   Check Balance: Moles Reacted + Moles Remaining = 0.002807 + 0.000069 = 0.002876 mol.\n*   This required amount (0.002876 mol) does not match the added amount (0.003214 mol). This option is incorrect.\n\n**C) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\n*   Total Moles Added = 0.1 M × (20.40 cm³ / 1000) = 0.002040 mol.\n*   The acid added (0.002040 mol) is significantly less than the amount required for the reaction (0.002807 mol). The solid would not dissolve. This option is incorrect.\n\n**D) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n*   **Total Moles Added:**\n    0.1 mol/L × (30.09 cm³ / 1000) = **0.003009 mol**.\n*   **Total Moles Required:**\n    *   Moles Remaining (to set pH) = [H⁺] × V_total = (10⁻².⁶⁹ M) × 0.1 L ≈ (0.002042 M) × 0.1 L ≈ 0.000204 mol.\n    *   Total Required = Moles Reacted + Moles Remaining = 0.002807 mol + 0.000204 mol = **0.003011 mol**.\n*   **Comparison:** The total moles of H⁺ added from the acid (0.003009 mol) is an almost perfect match for the total moles required by the system (0.003011 mol). The minor difference (<0.1%) is due to rounding in the problem's given values.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the values in option D are chemically and mathematically consistent with the conditions of the problem.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nThe problem asks for the minimum volume of a 0.1 M strong monobasic acid and the final pH required to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ into a final volume of 100 cm³.\n\nThis is a multi-step problem that involves both stoichiometry and chemical equilibrium. The correct approach is to test which of the given options is internally consistent with the chemical principles involved.\n\n**Step 1: Stoichiometry**\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃.**\n    *   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 (Fe) + 3 × (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) = 106.866 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ 0.00093575 mol.\n\n2.  **Determine the moles of H⁺ required for the reaction.**\n    The balanced equation for the dissolution of the base in a strong acid is:\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n    The stoichiometry is 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ to 3 moles of H⁺.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ consumed in the reaction (`n_reacted`) = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ 0.0028073 mol.\n\n**Step 2: Total Acid Requirement and Equilibrium**\n\nThe total amount of H⁺ added from the acid serves two purposes:\n1.  The amount consumed by the stoichiometric reaction (`n_reacted`).\n2.  The amount that remains in the final 100 cm³ solution (`n_excess`) to maintain an acidic pH and keep the iron ions from precipitating.\n\nThe total moles of H⁺ added (`n_total`) can be described by the equation:\n`n_total` = `n_reacted` + `n_excess`\n\nWe can test each option to see if its values satisfy this relationship.\n\n**Step 3: Test the Options for Internal Consistency**\n\nLet's use the equation: **`C_acid × V_acid` = `n_reacted` + (`10⁻ᵖᴴ × V_total`)**\nwhere:\n*   `C_acid` = 0.1 mol/L\n*   `V_acid` is the volume from the option (in Liters)\n*   `n_reacted` ≈ 0.0028073 mol\n*   `pH` is the pH from the option\n*   `V_total` = 0.1 L\n\n*   **Option A: pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³ (0.0204 L)**\n    *   H⁺ added = 0.1 M × 0.0204 L = 0.00204 mol.\n    *   This is less than `n_reacted` (0.0028073 mol), so the solid would not even dissolve completely.

This option is inconsistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOnly option C provides a pair of values (pH and acid volume) that are consistent with each other based on the principles of stoichiometry and equilibrium for this reaction.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Process**\n\nThe core of the problem involves dissolving solid iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, which is a base, into a solution using a strong acid (H⁺). The process involves two key components:\n*   **Stoichiometric Neutralization:** The acid must react with and neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ to break it down into ions.\n    `Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)`\n*   **Equilibrium Maintenance:** An excess of H⁺ ions must remain in the solution. This creates an acidic environment (a specific final pH) that prevents the newly formed Fe³⁺ ions from reacting with water and re-precipitating as Fe(OH)₃.\n\nThe total amount of acid added must account for both of these roles.\n\n**2. Perform the Foundational Calculations**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ that need to be dissolved.\n*   The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is: 55.845 (Fe) + 3 × (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) ≈ **106.866 g/mol**.\n*   The number of moles of Fe(OH)₃ in 0.1 g is:\n    Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.00093575 mol**.\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we know that 3 moles of H⁺ are needed to react with every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n*   Moles of H⁺ for reaction = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**3. Test the Options for Consistency**\n\nSince the problem provides paired values of pH and volume, the most reliable method is to check which pair is chemically consistent. For any given option, the total volume of acid added must equal the amount needed for the reaction *plus* the amount needed to create the final pH.\n\nThe relationship is:\n(Total Moles H⁺ Added) = (Moles H⁺ for Reaction) + (Moles H⁺ for pH)\n`(V_acid × M_acid) = (0.002807 mol) + ([H⁺]_final × V_solution)`\n\nLet's test each option with `V_solution` = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.\n\n*   **Option A: pH 3.16; 32.14 cm³**\n    *   Acid added = 0.03214 L × 0.1 M = **0.003214 mol**\n    *   Acid required = 0.002807 + (10⁻³.16 M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 + 0.000069 = **0.002876 mol**\n    *   `0.003214 ≠ 0.002876`. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n    *   Acid added = 0.03009 L × 0.1 M = **0.003009 mol**\n    *   Acid required = 0.002807 + (10⁻².⁶⁹ M × 0.1 L) = 0.002807 + 0.000204 = **0.003011 mol**\n    *   `0.003009 ≈ 0.003011`. **This is a match.** The minuscule difference is due to rounding in the problem's values.\n\n*   **Option C: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n    *   Acid added = 0.02805 L × 0.1 M = **0.002805 mol**\n    *   The acid added (0.002805 mol) is less than the amount required just to react with the Fe(OH)₃ (0.002807 mol). This means the solid would not even fully dissolve, making this option impossible. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D: pH 4.94; 20.40 cm³**\n    *   Acid added = 0.02040 L × 0.1 M = **0.002040 mol**\n    *   Similar to option C, the acid added is far less than what is needed for the initial reaction. **Incorrect.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only option that is stoichiometrically and chemically consistent is Option B. The provided volume of acid (30.09 cm³) is sufficient to both dissolve the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ and establish the final pH of 2.69 in the 100 cm³ solution.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemical Process**\n\nThe problem involves dissolving a sparingly soluble base, iron(III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)₃), in a strong acid. This is a multi-step process involving:\n*   A stoichiometric neutralization reaction.\n*   A solubility equilibrium (governed by Ksp).\n*   The hydrolysis of the resulting Fe³⁺ ion.\n\nThe overall reaction is:\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThe \"minimum volume\" of acid implies that just enough acid is added to dissolve the solid, meaning the final solution is saturated. This means the ion product Qsp ([Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³) will be equal to the solubility product constant, Ksp.\n\n**2. Stoichiometric Calculation: Moles of Reactants**\n\n*   First, we calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ in the 0.1 g sample.\n    *   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ ≈ 55.845 (Fe) + 3 × (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) = **106.866 g/mol**.\n    *   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.0009358 mol**.\n*   From the balanced equation, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ consumed by the reaction = 3 × 0.0009358 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**3. Total Acid Requirement**\n\nThe total acid added serves two functions:\n1.  **Reaction:** The amount calculated above (0.002807 mol) is consumed in the reaction.\n2.  **Maintaining Equilibrium:** An excess amount of H⁺ must remain in the 100 cm³ solution to keep the [OH⁻] low enough to prevent Fe(OH)₃ from precipitating. This excess H⁺ determines the final pH.\n\nTherefore, the following relationship must hold true:\n(Total Moles of H⁺ Added) = (Moles H⁺ Reacted) + (Moles H⁺ Remaining at Final pH)\n\n**4. Testing the Options for Consistency**\n\nThe most reliable way to solve this problem is to check which of the given options is internally consistent with the chemical principles. Let's use the relationship from Step 3.\n\n**Test Option A: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n\n*   **Calculate Total Moles of H⁺ Added:**\n    *   Volume of acid = 30.09 cm³ = 0.03009 L\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = Concentration × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n*   **Calculate Moles of H⁺ Remaining from Final pH:**\n    *   The final solution volume is 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.\n    *   If pH = 2.69, then [H⁺] = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n    *   Moles H⁺ Remaining = [H⁺] × Volume = 0.002042 mol/L × 0.1 L = **0.0002042 mol**.\n*   **Check Consistency:**\n    *   Let's see if the amounts balance: (Moles H⁺ Reacted) + (Moles H⁺ Remaining) = Total Moles H⁺ Added?\n    *   0.002807 mol + 0.0002042 mol = **0.0030112 mol**.\n*   **Compare:** The calculated total H⁺ required (0.0030112 mol) is almost identical to the amount of H⁺ added from the given volume (0.003009 mol). The difference is less than 0.1%, which is negligible and due to rounding. **This option is chemically consistent.**\n\n**Test Option D: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n\n*   **Calculate Total Moles of H⁺ Added:**\n    *   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.1 mol/L × 0.02805 L = **0.002805 mol**.\n*   **Compare to Reacted Moles:**\n    *   The amount of acid added (0.002805 mol) is slightly *less* than the amount required just to neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ (0.002807 mol). This means not all of the solid would dissolve. **This option is physically impossible.**\n\nTesting the other options would reveal similar inconsistencies. The only option where the volume of acid is sufficient to both dissolve the precipitate and establish the stated final pH is Option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis problem requires finding the minimum volume of a 0.1 M strong acid and the final pH needed to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ into a 100 cm³ solution. This is a multi-step problem that involves both stoichiometry and chemical equilibrium principles. The best way to solve such a problem with multiple-choice options is to test which option presents a chemically self-consistent scenario.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Calculate Moles and Stoichiometry**\n\n*   **Reaction:** The fundamental chemical reaction is the neutralization of the base Fe(OH)₃ by a strong acid (H⁺).\n    Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n    The stoichiometry is key: 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺.\n\n*   **Moles of Fe(OH)₃:** We first need the number of moles corresponding to 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃.\n    *   Molar Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 (Fe) + 3 × (15.999 (O) + 1.008 (H)) ≈ **106.866 g/mol**.\n    *   Moles = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol ≈ **0.00093575 mol**.\n\n*   **Moles of H⁺ for Reaction:** Based on the 1:3 stoichiometry, the moles of H⁺ required to *just react* with the solid are:\n    *   Moles H⁺ (reacted) = 3 × 0.00093575 mol ≈ **0.002807 mol**.\n\n**2. Analyze the Role of the Acid and the Final State**\n\nThe added acid must do two things:\n1.  **React:** Provide the 0.002807 moles of H⁺ needed to neutralize the Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  **Maintain pH:** Provide an additional, excess amount of H⁺ that remains in the final 100 cm³ solution to keep the pH low enough so the Fe(OH)₃ does not precipitate back out. The \"minimum\" volume refers to the smallest amount of acid that can achieve both of these tasks.\n\nThe total amount of acid added must therefore be:\n**Total Moles H⁺ = Moles H⁺ (reacted) + Moles H⁺ (excess)**\n\n**3. Test the Options for Consistency**\n\nWe can now check which option provides a (Volume, pH) pair that satisfies this balance. Let's test the options from the question.\n\n*   **Test Option B: pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³**\n\n    1.  **Calculate the total moles of H⁺ added from this volume:**\n        *   Volume = 30.09 cm³ = 0.03009 L\n        *   Total Moles H⁺ = Concentration × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.03009 L = **0.003009 mol**.\n\n    2.  **Calculate the moles of excess H⁺ that *should* be in the solution to produce the given pH:**\n        *   Final solution volume = 100 cm³ = 0.1 L\n        *   Final [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 0.002042 M.\n        *   Moles H⁺ (excess) = Final [H⁺] × Final Volume = 0.002042 mol/L × 0.1 L ≈ **0.000204 mol**.\n\n    3.  **Check if the balance holds:**\n        *   Does (Total Moles H⁺) equal (Moles H⁺ reacted + Moles H⁺ excess)?\n        *   Moles H⁺ reacted + Moles H⁺ excess = 0.002807 + 0.000204 = **0.003011 mol**.\n        *   Compare this required total (0.003011 mol) to the actual total added from the volume (0.003009 mol).\n\n    The values are nearly identical. The minuscule difference (0.000002 mol) is due to rounding in the problem's constants. This shows that the pair {pH 2.69; 30.09 cm³} is stoichiometrically self-consistent.\n\n*   **Test Option C: pH 2.04; 28.05 cm³**\n\n    1.  **Total Moles of H⁺ added:**\n        *   Volume = 28.05 cm³ = 0.02805 L\n        *   Total Moles H⁺ = 0.1 mol/L × 0.02805 L = **0.002805 mol**.\n\n    2.  This volume provides almost exactly the amount of acid needed for the reaction (0.002807 mol) and leaves virtually no excess acid from the strong acid itself. The pH would therefore be determined by the hydrolysis of the Fe³⁺ ion. Rigorous calculation of this hydrolysis (Fe³⁺ + H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)²⁺ + H⁺) gives a pH of ~2.29, which does not match the stated pH of 2.04. This option is inconsistent.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly the pair of values in option B is internally consistent. The volume of acid is sufficient to both neutralize the Fe(OH)₃ and establish the final required pH.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
