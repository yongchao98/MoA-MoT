The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks.

Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n*   **Observation:** The LC-MS analysis shows two distinct peaks in the chromatogram (LC), but both peaks give the *exact same mass spectrum*. This mass spectrum is also consistent with the expected product molecule.\n*   **Interpretation:** This is the most crucial piece of evidence. It proves two things:\n    1.  The two species are **isomers**—they have the same chemical formula and thus the same molecular weight.\n    2.  The sample is not contaminated with a precursor or a side-product of a different formula. This definitively **rules out option C (contamination with a precursor)** and **option D ('double coupling')**, as both would result in a species with a different molecular weight than the expected product.\n\n**2. Analyze the Liquid Chromatography (LC) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data:**\n*   **Observation:** The crude compound separates into two distinct peaks on the LC column. The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct signals for what should be a single proton.\n*   **Interpretation:** This tells us that the two isomers present in the sample are distinguishable by standard analytical techniques. We must now evaluate the two remaining types of isomers: enantiomers and diastereoisomers.\n    *   **Enantiomers (Option B):** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. A standard LC column and a standard NMR solvent are achiral. Therefore, a mixture of enantiomers would *not* separate on a standard LC column (it would show one peak) and would produce an *identical* NMR spectrum (it would show one signal for the alpha-proton). Since we observe two peaks in both LC and NMR, the species cannot be enantiomers. **This rules out option B.**\n    *   **Diastereoisomers (Option A):** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties. Because of these differences, they can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography, and they will produce different signals in an NMR spectrum. This explanation perfectly matches all the observations: two species with the same mass (isomers), separable by LC, and distinguishable by NMR.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of the provided analytical data (NMR, LC, and MS) leads to a single, unambiguous conclusion. The sample is a mixture of two species that have the same mass but different physical properties, which is the definition of diastereomers. This is a common occurrence in peptide synthesis, either due to racemization at a single chiral center (epimerization) or due to the presence of stable *cis-trans* isomers (rotamers) around a peptide bond.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most likely explanation for the observations.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Analytical Data**\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n        *   **Observation:** A single alpha-proton appears as two separate peaks.\n        *   **Quantification:** The peaks have roughly equal integrals, and the total integral correctly accounts for one proton (1H).\n        *   **Interpretation:** This indicates the presence of two distinct chemical species in the sample in an approximate 1:1 ratio. Since the peaks are distinct, the proton exists in a different chemical environment in each species. The exchange rate between these two species is slow on the NMR timescale.\n    *   **LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry):**\n        *   **LC Observation:** The liquid chromatography separates the sample into two distinct peaks with equal intensities.\n        *   **LC Interpretation:** This confirms the presence of two separate compounds that have different physical properties (e.g., polarity), which allows for their separation. The equal intensities corroborate the 1:1 ratio seen in the NMR.\n        *   **MS Observation:** Both separated LC peaks produce the exact same mass spectrum, and this mass is consistent with the expected product.\n        *   **MS Interpretation:** This is the most critical piece of evidence. It proves that the two species are **isomers**—they share the same chemical formula and molecular weight but have a different spatial arrangement of atoms. This definitively rules out impurities or side-products that would have a different mass.\n        *   **Elevated Temperature Condition:** The separation is successful even at elevated temperatures, suggesting the isomers are stable and have a significant energy barrier to interconversion.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Option Against the Evidence**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment.\n        *   In standard (achiral) NMR and standard (achiral) LC, enantiomers are indistinguishable. They would produce a *single* NMR peak and a *single* LC peak.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties. A common cause in peptide synthesis is epimerization (inversion of a chiral center) or the presence of stable *cis/trans* rotamers around an amide bond.\n        *   Because they are isomers, they have the **same mass**. This matches the MS data.\n        *   Because they have different physical properties, they are **separable by standard LC**. This matches the LC data.\n        *   Because their protons are in different chemical environments, they produce **distinct NMR spectra**. This matches the NMR data.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This explanation is perfectly consistent with all experimental observations.\n\n    *   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   A precursor is a starting material or an intermediate. It would have a different chemical formula and therefore a **different mass** from the final product.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This is contradicted by the MS data, which shows both peaks have the same, expected mass.\n\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:**\n        *   This implies a side reaction that added an extra chemical group (e.g., another amino acid). This would result in a product with a **different mass**.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This is contradicted by the MS data.\n\n**Final Determination:**\nThe evidence strongly points to the presence of two isomers that are not enantiomers. By definition, isomers that are not enantiomers are diastereomers. This is the only option that accounts for all the data: two distinct species separable by LC, giving different NMR signals, but possessing the identical mass of the expected product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to reach the final answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** LC-MS shows two peaks, but both have the *same mass spectrum*, and this mass is consistent with the *expected molecule*.\n    *   **Implication:** This is the most critical piece of information. It proves that the two species present are **isomers** of each other—they share the same chemical formula and molecular weight.\n    *   **Elimination:** This fact immediately rules out options that involve a different molecular weight.\n        *   **Option A (Precursor):** A precursor is a starting material or intermediate and would have a different (usually lower) mass. This is incorrect.\n        *   **Option D (Double Coupling):** This suggests a side reaction where an extra piece is added, which would result in a product with a different (higher) mass. This is incorrect.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and NMR Data with the Remaining Options:**\n    *   We are now left with two possibilities for the isomeric mixture: enantiomers or diastereoisomers.\n    *   **Observation:** The crude compound gives two separate peaks in both ¹H NMR (for the same proton) and standard Liquid Chromatography (LC).\n    *   **Evaluating Option B (Enantiomers):** Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. In an achiral (standard) environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **NMR:** In a standard NMR experiment (using an achiral solvent), enantiomers are indistinguishable and would produce a single, identical set of peaks. You would *not* see two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   **LC:** On a standard (achiral) chromatography column, enantiomers are not separated and would elute as a single peak.\n        *   Therefore, the observation of two distinct peaks in both NMR and LC directly contradicts the possibility of an enantiomeric mixture. Option B is incorrect.\n    *   **Evaluating Option C (Diastereoisomers):** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties even in an achiral environment.\n        *   **NMR:** Because they are chemically distinct molecules, they will have different NMR spectra. A specific proton in one diastereomer will be in a slightly different chemical environment than the corresponding proton in the other, resulting in two distinct peaks, as observed.\n        *   **LC:** Because they have different physical properties (e.g., polarity, shape), they can be separated by standard liquid chromatography, resulting in two separate peaks, as observed.\n        *   This explanation is perfectly consistent with all pieces of experimental evidence: two species that are isomers (same mass) but are separable and distinguishable by standard analytical techniques.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to the presence of two isomers that are not enantiomers. By definition, these must be diastereomers. This is a common phenomenon in peptide synthesis, often caused by epimerization at a chiral center or by the presence of stable cis/trans isomers (rotamers) around an amide bond.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the most likely explanation for the observations.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**:\n    *   **Observation**: The LC-MS analysis shows two distinct peaks in the chromatogram. Crucially, both peaks give the *exact same mass spectrum*, and this mass is consistent with the expected product.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This single piece of information is highly informative. It proves that the two species are **isomers**—they have the same chemical formula and molecular weight but differ in the spatial arrangement of their atoms. This immediately rules out any explanation involving impurities with a different mass.\n    *   **Ruling out options**:\n        *   Contamination with a precursor (B) is incorrect because a precursor would have a different (likely lower) molecular weight.\n        *   'Double coupling' (D) is incorrect because this would create a product with a different (likely higher) molecular weight.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data**:\n    *   **Observation**: The sample separates into two distinct peaks on the LC column. The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct signals for what should be a single proton.\n    *   **Conclusion**: These observations indicate that the two isomers are physically and chemically distinct. They have different physical properties (which allows for their separation by LC) and their atoms exist in different chemical environments (which causes them to have different signals in the NMR spectrum).\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Remaining Isomer Types**:\n    *   The remaining options are a mixture of diastereoisomers (A) or a mixture of enantiomers (C).\n    *   **Enantiomers (C)**: Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) analytical environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. They would **not** separate into two peaks on a standard LC column and would produce a **single, identical** NMR spectrum. Therefore, the observation of two peaks in both the LC and NMR decisively rules out enantiomers.\n    *   **Diastereoisomers (A)**: Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties in all environments (both chiral and achiral).\n        *   Because they have different physical properties, they are separable by standard LC, explaining the two peaks in the chromatogram.\n        *   Because they are chemically distinct, their NMR spectra are different, explaining why a single proton can give rise to two different signals.\n        *   This scenario is common in peptide synthesis, where racemization at one of the chiral centers can occur, creating a diastereomeric mixture.\n\n**Final Conclusion**:\nThe evidence collectively points to one conclusion: the crude compound is a mixture of two isomers that are separable by standard LC and distinguishable by standard NMR, but have the same mass. This is the definition of diastereomers.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:** The problem states that LC-MS analysis shows two peaks, but *both* peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. This is the most crucial piece of information. It means the two chemical species present in the sample are **isomers**—they have the identical chemical formula and molecular weight but differ in their spatial arrangement of atoms. This single fact allows us to immediately rule out any options that involve a change in molecular weight.\n    *   **Ruled out: D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor.** A precursor is a starting material or intermediate and would almost certainly have a different molecular weight than the final product.\n    *   **Ruled out: B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction.** This implies a side reaction, such as adding an extra amino acid, which would create a product with a different (higher) molecular weight.\n\n2.  **Analyze the NMR and LC Data to Differentiate Isomers:** Now we must distinguish between the two remaining options, which are both types of isomers: diastereoisomers (A) and enantiomers (C).\n    *   **Chromatography (LC) Data:** The LC trace shows two clearly defined, separate peaks. Standard liquid chromatography separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity, size, shape).\n    *   **NMR Data:** The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for what should be a single proton. Standard NMR distinguishes protons based on their unique chemical environments.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Remaining Options:**\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) analytical environment, they have **identical** physical properties. Therefore, they **cannot** be separated by a standard LC column (they would produce a single peak) and are **indistinguishable** by a standard NMR spectrometer (they would produce a single set of peaks). The observation of two separate peaks in both LC and NMR directly contradicts this explanation.\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are **not** mirror images. They have **different** physical and chemical properties, even in an achiral environment.\n        *   **Consistency with LC:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereoisomers can be separated by a standard LC column, which perfectly explains the two observed peaks.\n        *   **Consistency with NMR:** Because their atoms are arranged differently in 3D space, their protons experience different chemical environments. This leads to different NMR spectra, which perfectly explains why a single type of proton shows up as two distinct peaks.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe observation of two separable species (by LC) that have the same mass (by MS) but different NMR spectra is the classic analytical signature of a diastereomeric mixture. This is a common issue in peptide synthesis, often caused by the partial inversion (epimerization) of a chiral center or the presence of stable cis/trans isomers (rotamers) around a peptide bond.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental evidence:**\n    *   **¹H NMR Data**: The core observation is two distinct peaks for a single proton (an alpha-proton). The peaks have equal integrals and sum to the expected value of one proton. Spin-spin coupling has been ruled out. This means the sample contains two different chemical species in a 1:1 ratio, where the alpha-proton exists in a slightly different chemical environment in each species.\n    *   **LC-MS Data**: The Liquid Chromatography (LC) separates the sample into two distinct peaks of equal intensity. This confirms the presence of two different species that have different physical properties (allowing separation) and are present in a 1:1 ratio. The Mass Spectrometry (MS) data is the most critical piece of evidence: both separated peaks yield the *exact same mass spectrum*, and this mass corresponds to the expected product. This proves that the two species are isomers—they have the same chemical formula and mass but a different arrangement of atoms.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the options against the evidence:**\n    *   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor** and **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred...**: These options are incorrect. Both a precursor and a product of a side-reaction like \"double coupling\" would have a different chemical formula and therefore a different molecular weight. The MS data, which shows that both species have the same, expected mass, directly refutes these possibilities.\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**: This option is incorrect. Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) analytical environment, they have identical physical properties. Therefore, they would produce only a single peak in a standard NMR spectrum and would co-elute as a single peak on a standard LC column. The observation of two peaks in both techniques rules out enantiomers.\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**: This option is the only one that fits all the evidence. Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   Because they have different chemical properties, they produce distinct NMR spectra, which explains the two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   Because they have different physical properties, they can be separated by standard LC, which explains the two peaks in the chromatogram.\n        *   Because they are isomers, they have the same molecular formula and mass, which explains why both LC peaks give the same mass spectrum.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of two distinct signals in the NMR, two separable peaks in the LC, and identical mass spectra for both species is the classic analytical signature for a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n### Reasoning and Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Experimental Evidence**:\n    *   **Observation from ¹H NMR**: The spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. These peaks have roughly equal integrals, and the combined integral equals the expected one proton. Spin-spin coupling has been ruled out.\n        *   **Interpretation**: The sample contains two different chemical species in a roughly 1:1 ratio. Since the peaks arise from the same proton in the molecule, these two species must be isomers. The proton's local chemical environment is slightly different in each isomer, leading to different chemical shifts. The fact that two sharp peaks are seen (instead of one broad, coalesced peak) indicates that the interconversion between these two isomers is slow on the NMR timescale.\n    *   **Observation from LC-MS**: The Liquid Chromatography (LC) run at an elevated temperature shows two separate, well-defined peaks of equal intensity. The Mass Spectrometry (MS) for both peaks shows the exact same mass, which is consistent with the expected product.\n        *   **Interpretation**: The LC data confirms that there are two distinct species that can be physically separated due to having different physical properties (like polarity). The MS data is the most critical clue: since both species have the same mass as the expected product, they must be isomers. This definitively rules out contamination by precursors or byproducts with different molecular formulas (e.g., from 'double coupling' or incomplete reactions), which would have different masses.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Possible Explanations (The Options)**:\n\n    *   **Contamination with a precursor (C) or a product of 'double coupling' (B)**: These explanations are inconsistent with the mass spectrometry data. Both a precursor and a 'double-coupled' product would have a different molecular weight than the expected target molecule. The MS data clearly shows that both species have the same, correct mass.\n\n    *   **Mixture of Enantiomers (D)**: Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) analytical environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties.\n        *   In standard NMR (using an achiral solvent), enantiomers are indistinguishable and would produce only one set of peaks.\n        *   On a standard (achiral) LC column, enantiomers co-elute as a single peak.\n        *   Therefore, the observation of two peaks in both NMR and LC proves that the isomers are not enantiomers.\n\n    *   **Mixture of Diastereoisomers (A)**: Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. This occurs in molecules with at least two chiral centers when their configurations differ at some, but not all, of these centers.\n        *   Diastereoisomers have different physical and chemical properties, even in an achiral environment.\n        *   **NMR Consistency**: Because they are chemically distinct, they are expected to have different NMR spectra. It is very common for a 1:1 mixture of diastereomers to show two sets of peaks for various protons, which perfectly explains the NMR observation.\n        *   **LC-MS Consistency**: Because they have different physical properties, they can be separated on a standard LC column, explaining the two peaks in the chromatogram. As isomers, they have the same molecular formula and therefore the same mass, which perfectly explains why both LC peaks have the same, correct mass spectrum. This explanation is fully consistent with all the experimental data.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe collective evidence—the presence of two isomers with the same mass that are separable by standard chromatography and distinguishable by standard NMR—unambiguously points to a mixture of diastereoisomers. This is a common occurrence in peptide synthesis, often due to epimerization at a chiral alpha-carbon or the presence of stable cis/trans rotamers (atropisomers), which are themselves a type of diastereomer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**: The most critical piece of information is that the LC-MS analysis shows two distinct peaks in the chromatogram (LC), but *both peaks have the same mass spectrum*, and this mass is consistent with the expected product.\n    *   This fact immediately rules out any explanation involving a different molecular formula or molecular weight.\n    *   It rules out **(D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor**, because a precursor would have a different (usually lower) mass.\n    *   It rules out **(A) 'Double coupling' has occurred**, because this implies an extra amino acid or other group was added, resulting in a product with a different (higher) mass.\n    *   The MS data forces the conclusion that the two species detected are **isomers** of the target peptide—they have the same chemical formula and mass but a different arrangement of atoms.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and NMR Data for the Isomers**: Now that we know we have a mixture of isomers, we need to determine what kind of isomers they are.\n    *   **LC Data**: The two isomers are separable by standard liquid chromatography.

They would co-elute as a single LC peak and give only one set of NMR signals. This is in direct contradiction to the observed data.\n        *   **(C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**: Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are **not** mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties. This means they **are** separable by standard LC and **do** give different NMR spectra. This explanation is perfectly consistent with all the experimental data: two isomers (same mass) that can be separated and have distinct chemical signatures. In peptide synthesis, this is a common occurrence due to epimerization (inversion of a stereocenter) or cis/trans isomerism about an amide bond (rotamers).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe combined analytical data—two species that have the same mass but are separable by LC and distinguishable by NMR—is the classic signature of a diastereomeric mixture.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most likely explanation.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Experimental Observations**\n\n*   **Observation from ¹H NMR:** The presence of two distinct peaks for a single type of proton (an alpha-proton) means this proton exists in two different chemical environments. The fact that their integrals are roughly equal and sum to 1H indicates that two different molecular species are present in the sample in an approximate 1:1 ratio. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, this is not a simple J-coupling interaction.\n*   **Observation from LC-MS:**\n    *   The Liquid Chromatography (LC) data, showing two distinct and separable peaks, confirms that the sample is a mixture of two different compounds with different physical properties (e.g., polarity, size, shape). The equal intensities of the peaks corroborate the 1:1 ratio seen in the NMR.\n    *   The Mass Spectrometry (MS) data is the most crucial piece of evidence. Both separated peaks give the *exact same mass spectrum*, and this mass is consistent with the expected product. This proves that the two species are **isomers**—they have the same chemical formula and molecular weight but a different arrangement of atoms.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options Against the Evidence**\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In standard (achiral) analytical environments, they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they would produce only a *single* peak in a standard NMR spectrum and would co-elute as a *single* peak in a standard LC analysis. This contradicts both the NMR and LC data.\n\n*   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This implies a side reaction that has added an extra molecule or fragment to the peptide. The resulting product would have a different chemical formula and therefore a **different molecular weight**. This is directly contradicted by the MS data, which shows both species have the expected mass.\n\n*   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. This is a common occurrence in peptide chemistry, for instance, if one chiral amino acid undergoes epimerization (inversion of stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon) during synthesis.\n    *   **Consistency with Data:**\n        *   **Same Mass:** As isomers, they have the same molecular weight, which matches the MS data.\n        *   **Different Properties:** Diastereoisomers have different physical properties. This means they are separable by standard LC and will have different NMR spectra.\n    *   This explanation perfectly fits all the observations: two separable species (LC), with distinct chemical environments (NMR), that are isomers of each other (MS).\n\n*   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor from an earlier stage of synthesis would almost certainly have a different chemical formula and a **different molecular weight**. This is directly contradicted by the MS data.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to a mixture of two species that are isomers of each other but are not enantiomers.

It proves that the two species present in the mixture are **isomers** of the target compound (same chemical formula, same mass).\n*   **Elimination:** This single observation allows us to immediately rule out two options:\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would have a different chemical structure and, therefore, a different molecular weight. This contradicts the MS data.\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This implies a side reaction, such as the addition of an extra amino acid, which would create a product with a different (higher) molecular weight. This also contradicts the MS data.\n\n**2. Differentiate Between the Remaining Isomer Types (Enantiomers vs. Diastereoisomers):**\nNow we must choose between option B (enantiomers) and option C (diastereomers). We use the NMR and LC data to distinguish them.\n\n*   **Enantiomers (Option B):** These are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images.\n    *   In a standard (achiral) environment, enantiomers have identical physical and chemical properties.\n    *   A standard ¹H NMR experiment uses an achiral solvent, so enantiomers are indistinguishable and produce a **single, identical NMR spectrum**. This contradicts the observation of two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n    *   A standard LC column is achiral, so it **cannot separate enantiomers**. They would elute as a single peak. This contradicts the observation of two clearly defined LC peaks.\n    *   Therefore, the sample cannot be a mixture of enantiomers.\n\n*   **Diastereoisomers (Option C):** These are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. This is common in peptides if, for example, an L-amino acid center epimerizes to a D-amino acid during synthesis, creating a mix of L-L and D-L peptides.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical and chemical properties in all environments (both chiral and achiral).\n    *   Because they are chemically distinct, they are expected to produce **different NMR spectra**. The alpha-proton would exist in a different 3D environment in each diastereomer, explaining the two separate NMR peaks. The equal integrals indicate a 1:1 mixture.\n    *   Because they have different physical properties (e.g., shape, polarity), they can be **separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography**. This explains the two separate LC peaks.\n    *   This explanation is perfectly consistent with all experimental data: two isomers with the same mass but different NMR and LC properties.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to the crude compound existing as a mixture of diastereoisomers. The observation of two separable species (by LC) that are isomers (same mass by MS) and are distinguishable by NMR is the classic analytical signature of a diastereomeric mixture.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** There are two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, their integrals are roughly equal, and they sum to one proton equivalent.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The fact that a single proton appears as two signals indicates it exists in two different chemical environments. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, this means the sample contains a mixture of two distinct chemical species in approximately a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Implication:** The two species must be isomers. Enantiomers are chemically identical in an achiral environment (like a standard NMR solvent) and would produce a single signal. Therefore, the isomers must be diastereomers.\n\n2.  **Analyze the LC-MS Data:**\n    *   **Observation (LC):** The Liquid Chromatography separates the sample into two clearly defined peaks of equal intensity.\n    *   **Interpretation (LC):** This confirms the presence of two different species that can be physically separated due to differences in their properties (e.g., polarity). This further rules out enantiomers, which would not separate on a standard (achiral) LC column.\n    *   **Observation (MS):** The Mass Spectrometry shows that both species have the exact same mass, and this mass corresponds to the expected product.\n    *   **Interpretation (MS):** This is a critical piece of evidence. It proves that the two species are not impurities with different molecular weights (like a precursor or a side-product from double-coupling), but are in fact isomers of the target molecule.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Option Based on the Combined Evidence:**\n    *   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This side reaction would create a molecule with a higher molecular weight. The MS data, showing the expected mass, contradicts this.\n    *   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would have a different (usually lower) molecular weight. The MS data, showing the expected mass for both peaks, contradicts this.\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers have identical physical properties in achiral environments. They cannot be separated by standard LC and are indistinguishable by standard ¹H NMR. This option is contradicted by both the LC and NMR data, which clearly show two distinct species.\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have the same molecular formula (and thus the same mass) but different physical and chemical properties. This perfectly explains all observations:\n        *   They have the same mass (consistent with MS).\n        *   They are separable by standard LC (consistent with two LC peaks).\n        *   They are chemically distinct and thus have different NMR spectra (consistent with two NMR peaks for the alpha-proton).\n        *   This is a common issue in peptide synthesis where epimerization at a chiral center can occur, creating a diastereomeric mixture.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of two distinct signals in both NMR and LC, coupled with identical mass spectrometry data for both signals, is the classic signature of a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the NMR Data:** The <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum provides the first key piece of information. The presence of two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, with roughly equal integrals that sum to the expected 1H, indicates that the proton exists in two different chemical environments. Because spin-spin coupling is ruled out, this means the sample contains two different molecular species in a roughly 1:1 ratio. Since the chemical shifts are similar, the two species must be structurally very similar.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the LC-MS Data:** This analysis confirms and extends the NMR findings.\n    *   The Liquid Chromatography (LC) separates the sample into two distinct peaks of equal intensity. This confirms the presence of two different species in a 1:1 ratio, and crucially, demonstrates that these two species have different physical properties (e.g., polarity), which is why they can be separated.\n    *   The Mass Spectrometry (MS) data shows that both separated LC peaks have the *exact same mass spectrum*, and this mass is consistent with the expected product. This is a critical point: it proves the two species are **isomers**. They have the same chemical formula and molecular weight but differ in their spatial arrangement. This fact definitively rules out impurities like precursors or side products from 'double coupling', which would have different molecular weights.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Types of Isomers:** Based on the evidence, we know the sample is a 1:1 mixture of two isomers. We must decide which type.\n    *   **Enantiomers (Option D):** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they are *not* distinguishable by standard NMR spectroscopy (they give one set of peaks) and are *not* separable by a standard LC column (they co-elute as one peak). This directly contradicts both the NMR and LC data. Thus, option D is incorrect.\n    *   **Diastereoisomers (Option B):** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. This occurs in molecules with at least two stereocenters where the configuration differs at some, but not all, centers. A common example in peptide synthesis is epimerization, where an L-amino acid might invert to a D-amino acid, creating a diastereomeric peptide. Critically, diastereoisomers have **different physical and chemical properties**. This means they are expected to have different NMR spectra (as observed) and are separable by standard LC (as observed). This explanation perfectly fits all the experimental data.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:** The sample is a mixture of two species that are isomers (same mass), but not enantiomers (they are distinguishable by standard NMR and LC). By definition, isomers that are not enantiomers are diastereomers. This is a common and well-understood phenomenon in peptide synthesis.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the most likely explanation for the observations.\n\n**1. Deconstruction of the Experimental Evidence**\n\n*   **¹H NMR Data:** The key finding is two distinct peaks for a single type of proton (the alpha-proton).\n    *   **Interpretation:** This means the alpha-proton exists in two different, non-equivalent chemical environments.\n    *   **Integrals:** The roughly equal integrals, which sum to the expected 1H, indicate that the two species responsible for these environments are present in an approximately 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Coupling:** The exclusion of spin-spin coupling confirms the two peaks represent two distinct species, not splitting of a single signal.\n*   **LC-MS Data:** This provides two crucial pieces of information.\n    *   **LC (Liquid Chromatography):** The sample separates into two distinct peaks of equal intensity. This confirms the presence of two different compounds that can be physically separated based on their properties (like polarity or size). This aligns with the NMR data.\n    *   **MS (Mass Spectrometry):** Both separated peaks give the *exact same mass spectrum*, and this mass matches the expected product. This is a critical point: it proves the two species are **isomers**—they have the same chemical formula and mass but a different arrangement of atoms.\n\n**2. Evaluation of the Proposed Explanations**\n\nLet's evaluate each option against the combined experimental evidence.\n\n*   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor.**\n    *   A precursor is a starting material or intermediate. It would have a different chemical formula and therefore a **different mass** from the final product.\n    *   This is **inconsistent** with the MS data, which shows both species have the same, correct mass.\n\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers.**\n    *   Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical and chemical properties in achiral (standard) environments.\n    *   As a result, they are **indistinguishable** by standard ¹H NMR and **cannot be separated** by standard LC. They would show only a single peak in both experiments.\n    *   This is **inconsistent** with both the NMR and LC data, which each show two distinct peaks.\n\n*   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction.**\n    *   This implies a side reaction where an extra unit (e.g., another amino acid) has been added. This would create a new molecule with a **different mass**.\n    *   This is **inconsistent** with the MS data showing the expected mass for both components.\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.**\n    *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. This is common in peptide chemistry, often arising from the racemization (epimerization) of one of the amino acid's chiral centers during synthesis. For example, if a peptide contains two L-amino acids (L-L), epimerization could create the L-D version. L-L and L-D peptides are diastereomers.\n    *   Diastereoisomers have the **same mass**, which is **consistent** with the MS data.\n    *   Crucially, diastereoisomers have **different physical and chemical properties**. This means they have **different NMR spectra** and **can be separated by standard LC**.\n    *   This explanation is **perfectly consistent** with all observations: two isomers with the same mass, but separable by LC and distinguishable by NMR.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe observation of two separable species by standard chromatography that possess identical mass but give distinct NMR signals is the classic analytical signature of a mixture of diastereoisomers. This is the only explanation that fits all the experimental evidence provided.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental data**: The first step is to understand what each piece of analytical data tells us about the sample.\n    *   **<sup>1</sup>H NMR Data**: The presence of two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, with roughly equal integrals summing to one, indicates that there are two different chemical species present in the sample in a ~1:1 ratio. In each of these species, the alpha-proton has a slightly different chemical environment. The fact that this splitting is not from spin-spin coupling confirms that we are observing two different molecular forms.\n    *   **LC-MS Data**: This analysis provides two crucial pieces of information.\n        *   **Liquid Chromatography (LC)**: The separation of the sample into two peaks of equal intensity confirms that there are two distinct compounds that can be physically separated based on their properties (e.g., polarity). This corroborates the NMR data about a 1:1 mixture.\n        *   **Mass Spectrometry (MS)**: The finding that both separated peaks have the *exact same mass spectrum*, which is consistent with the *expected product*, is the most critical clue. It proves that the two species are not an impurity and a product, but rather they are **isomers** of each other – they have the same chemical formula and molecular weight but different three-dimensional arrangements.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the options against the data**: Now we test each possible explanation against our conclusions from the data.\n\n    *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor** and **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction**: Both of these options describe scenarios that would result in a second chemical species with a **different molecular weight** than the expected product. The mass spectrometry data directly contradicts this by showing that both species have the same, expected mass. Therefore, these options are incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**: Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical and chemical properties in a standard (achiral) environment. Consequently, they would not be separated by standard LC and would produce only a single peak. Similarly, they are indistinguishable by standard <sup>1</sup>H NMR and would show only a single set of signals. This explanation contradicts both the LC and NMR observations, so it is incorrect.\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**: Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. This is a common situation in peptide synthesis, often due to the inversion of a stereocenter (epimerization) at one of the alpha-carbons.\n        *   **Compatibility with NMR**: Diastereoisomers are distinct chemical compounds. Their corresponding protons are in different chemical environments and thus have different chemical shifts, which explains the two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   **Compatibility with LC-MS**: Diastereoisomers have different physical properties and can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography, explaining the two LC peaks. As isomers, they have the same chemical formula and therefore the same mass, which explains why both peaks have identical mass spectra. This explanation is perfectly consistent with all the provided data.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**: The observation of two species that are isomers (same mass) but can be separated by standard chromatography and distinguished by NMR is the classic signature of a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis is a classic problem in chemical analysis, particularly for molecules like peptides that have stereochemistry. To determine the correct answer, we must systematically evaluate each piece of evidence provided by the NMR and LC-MS analyses.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Experimental Observations:**\n    *   **Sample:** A small synthetic peptide. This is important because peptides are made of amino acids, which (except for glycine) are chiral. Therefore, stereoisomerism is a key consideration.\n    *   **¹H NMR Data:**\n        *   Two distinct peaks are observed for a single type of proton (the alpha-proton).\n        *   The peaks have roughly equal integrals, and the sum of their integrals equals the expected value (1H).\n        *   **Conclusion:** This indicates that the sample contains two different molecular species in an approximately 1:1 ratio. In each species, the alpha-proton has a slightly different chemical environment, causing the two separate signals. The slow exchange between these species on the NMR timescale is why two sharp peaks are seen instead of a single, broadened peak.\n    *   **LC-MS Data:**\n        *   **LC:** The liquid chromatograph separates the sample into two distinct peaks, again with equal intensities. This confirms the presence of two species that have different physical properties (e.g., polarity), which allows them to be separated by chromatography.\n        *   **MS:** The mass spectrometer shows that both separated species have the *exact same mass spectrum*, and this mass matches the expected molecular weight of the target molecule.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This is a crucial piece of information. The two species are not an impurity and a product, nor a precursor and a product. They are **isomers**—they share the same chemical formula and mass but have a different three-dimensional arrangement of atoms.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Candidate Options:**\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would have a different molecular formula and a different mass. The MS data shows both species have the same, expected mass. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) analytical environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. This means they cannot be separated by a standard LC column (they would elute as a single peak) and are indistinguishable by a standard NMR spectrometer (they would produce a single set of peaks). This directly contradicts both the LC and NMR observations. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This implies a side reaction that would add another chemical group (like a second amino acid), resulting in a product with a significantly different, higher mass. This contradicts the MS data showing the expected mass. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images. This can occur in peptides if one of the chiral amino acid centers epimerizes (inverts its stereochemistry) during synthesis, or due to the presence of stable *cis* and *trans* conformers (rotamers) around an amide bond.\n        *   **Consistency:**\n            *   Diastereoisomers have the same chemical formula and thus the **same mass**, which is consistent with the MS data.\n            *   They have **different physical properties** and are therefore **separable by standard LC**, explaining the two peaks.\n            *   They are chemically distinct molecules and thus have **different NMR spectra**, explaining the two signals for the alpha-proton.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This option is perfectly consistent with all the experimental data provided.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe observation of two separable species (by LC) that are isomers (same mass by MS) and are distinguishable by NMR is the classic analytical signature for a mixture of diastereoisomers.

Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n*   **Observation:** The LC-MS analysis shows two distinct peaks in the chromatogram (LC), but both peaks give the *exact same mass spectrum*. This mass spectrum is also consistent with the expected product molecule.\n*   **Interpretation:** This is the most crucial piece of evidence. It proves two things:\n    1.  The two species are **isomers**—they have the same chemical formula and thus the same molecular weight.\n    2.  The sample is not contaminated with a precursor or a side-product of a different formula. This definitively **rules out option C (contamination with a precursor)** and **option D ('double coupling')**, as both would result in a species with a different molecular weight than the expected product.\n\n**2. Analyze the Liquid Chromatography (LC) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data:**\n*   **Observation:** The crude compound separates into two distinct peaks on the LC column. The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct signals for what should be a single proton.\n*   **Interpretation:** This tells us that the two isomers present in the sample are distinguishable by standard analytical techniques. We must now evaluate the two remaining types of isomers: enantiomers and diastereoisomers.\n    *   **Enantiomers (Option B):** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. A standard LC column and a standard NMR solvent are achiral. Therefore, a mixture of enantiomers would *not* separate on a standard LC column (it would show one peak) and would produce an *identical* NMR spectrum (it would show one signal for the alpha-proton). Since we observe two peaks in both LC and NMR, the species cannot be enantiomers. **This rules out option B.**\n    *   **Diastereoisomers (Option A):** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties. Because of these differences, they can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography, and they will produce different signals in an NMR spectrum. This explanation perfectly matches all the observations: two species with the same mass (isomers), separable by LC, and distinguishable by NMR.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of the provided analytical data (NMR, LC, and MS) leads to a single, unambiguous conclusion. The sample is a mixture of two species that have the same mass but different physical properties, which is the definition of diastereomers. This is a common occurrence in peptide synthesis, either due to racemization at a single chiral center (epimerization) or due to the presence of stable *cis-trans* isomers (rotamers) around a peptide bond.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most likely explanation for the observations.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Analytical Data**\n    *   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n        *   **Observation:** A single alpha-proton appears as two separate peaks.\n        *   **Quantification:** The peaks have roughly equal integrals, and the total integral correctly accounts for one proton (1H).\n        *   **Interpretation:** This indicates the presence of two distinct chemical species in the sample in an approximate 1:1 ratio. Since the peaks are distinct, the proton exists in a different chemical environment in each species. The exchange rate between these two species is slow on the NMR timescale.\n    *   **LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry):**\n        *   **LC Observation:** The liquid chromatography separates the sample into two distinct peaks with equal intensities.\n        *   **LC Interpretation:** This confirms the presence of two separate compounds that have different physical properties (e.g., polarity), which allows for their separation. The equal intensities corroborate the 1:1 ratio seen in the NMR.\n        *   **MS Observation:** Both separated LC peaks produce the exact same mass spectrum, and this mass is consistent with the expected product.\n        *   **MS Interpretation:** This is the most critical piece of evidence. It proves that the two species are **isomers**—they share the same chemical formula and molecular weight but have a different spatial arrangement of atoms. This definitively rules out impurities or side-products that would have a different mass.\n        *   **Elevated Temperature Condition:** The separation is successful even at elevated temperatures, suggesting the isomers are stable and have a significant energy barrier to interconversion.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Option Against the Evidence**\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:**\n        *   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment.\n        *   In standard (achiral) NMR and standard (achiral) LC, enantiomers are indistinguishable. They would produce a *single* NMR peak and a *single* LC peak.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This is inconsistent with both the NMR and LC data.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:**\n        *   Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties. A common cause in peptide synthesis is epimerization (inversion of a chiral center) or the presence of stable *cis/trans* rotamers around an amide bond.\n        *   Because they are isomers, they have the **same mass**. This matches the MS data.\n        *   Because they have different physical properties, they are **separable by standard LC**. This matches the LC data.\n        *   Because their protons are in different chemical environments, they produce **distinct NMR spectra**. This matches the NMR data.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This explanation is perfectly consistent with all experimental observations.\n\n    *   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:**\n        *   A precursor is a starting material or an intermediate.

This would result in a product with a **different mass**.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This is contradicted by the MS data.\n\n**Final Determination:**\nThe evidence strongly points to the presence of two isomers that are not enantiomers. By definition, isomers that are not enantiomers are diastereomers. This is the only option that accounts for all the data: two distinct species separable by LC, giving different NMR signals, but possessing the identical mass of the expected product.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to reach the final answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:**\n    *   **Observation:** LC-MS shows two peaks, but both have the *same mass spectrum*, and this mass is consistent with the *expected molecule*.\n    *   **Implication:** This is the most critical piece of information. It proves that the two species present are **isomers** of each other—they share the same chemical formula and molecular weight.\n    *   **Elimination:** This fact immediately rules out options that involve a different molecular weight.\n        *   **Option A (Precursor):** A precursor is a starting material or intermediate and would have a different (usually lower) mass. This is incorrect.\n        *   **Option D (Double Coupling):** This suggests a side reaction where an extra piece is added, which would result in a product with a different (higher) mass. This is incorrect.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and NMR Data with the Remaining Options:**\n    *   We are now left with two possibilities for the isomeric mixture: enantiomers or diastereoisomers.\n    *   **Observation:** The crude compound gives two separate peaks in both ¹H NMR (for the same proton) and standard Liquid Chromatography (LC).\n    *   **Evaluating Option B (Enantiomers):** Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. In an achiral (standard) environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties.\n        *   **NMR:** In a standard NMR experiment (using an achiral solvent), enantiomers are indistinguishable and would produce a single, identical set of peaks. You would *not* see two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   **LC:** On a standard (achiral) chromatography column, enantiomers are not separated and would elute as a single peak.\n        *   Therefore, the observation of two distinct peaks in both NMR and LC directly contradicts the possibility of an enantiomeric mixture. Option B is incorrect.\n    *   **Evaluating Option C (Diastereoisomers):** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties even in an achiral environment.\n        *   **NMR:** Because they are chemically distinct molecules, they will have different NMR spectra. A specific proton in one diastereomer will be in a slightly different chemical environment than the corresponding proton in the other, resulting in two distinct peaks, as observed.\n        *   **LC:** Because they have different physical properties (e.g., polarity, shape), they can be separated by standard liquid chromatography, resulting in two separate peaks, as observed.\n        *   This explanation is perfectly consistent with all pieces of experimental evidence: two species that are isomers (same mass) but are separable and distinguishable by standard analytical techniques.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to the presence of two isomers that are not enantiomers. By definition, these must be diastereomers. This is a common phenomenon in peptide synthesis, often caused by epimerization at a chiral center or by the presence of stable cis/trans isomers (rotamers) around an amide bond.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the most likely explanation for the observations.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**:\n    *   **Observation**: The LC-MS analysis shows two distinct peaks in the chromatogram. Crucially, both peaks give the *exact same mass spectrum*, and this mass is consistent with the expected product.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This single piece of information is highly informative. It proves that the two species are **isomers**—they have the same chemical formula and molecular weight but differ in the spatial arrangement of their atoms. This immediately rules out any explanation involving impurities with a different mass.\n    *   **Ruling out options**:\n        *   Contamination with a precursor (B) is incorrect because a precursor would have a different (likely lower) molecular weight.\n        *   'Double coupling' (D) is incorrect because this would create a product with a different (likely higher) molecular weight.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data**:\n    *   **Observation**: The sample separates into two distinct peaks on the LC column. The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct signals for what should be a single proton.\n    *   **Conclusion**: These observations indicate that the two isomers are physically and chemically distinct. They have different physical properties (which allows for their separation by LC) and their atoms exist in different chemical environments (which causes them to have different signals in the NMR spectrum).\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Remaining Isomer Types**:\n    *   The remaining options are a mixture of diastereoisomers (A) or a mixture of enantiomers (C).\n    *   **Enantiomers (C)**: Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) analytical environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. They would **not** separate into two peaks on a standard LC column and would produce a **single, identical** NMR spectrum. Therefore, the observation of two peaks in both the LC and NMR decisively rules out enantiomers.\n    *   **Diastereoisomers (A)**: Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties in all environments (both chiral and achiral).\n        *   Because they have different physical properties, they are separable by standard LC, explaining the two peaks in the chromatogram.\n        *   Because they are chemically distinct, their NMR spectra are different, explaining why a single proton can give rise to two different signals.\n        *   This scenario is common in peptide synthesis, where racemization at one of the chiral centers can occur, creating a diastereomeric mixture.\n\n**Final Conclusion**:\nThe evidence collectively points to one conclusion: the crude compound is a mixture of two isomers that are separable by standard LC and distinguishable by standard NMR, but have the same mass. This is the definition of diastereomers.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:** The problem states that LC-MS analysis shows two peaks, but *both* peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. This is the most crucial piece of information. It means the two chemical species present in the sample are **isomers**—they have the identical chemical formula and molecular weight but differ in their spatial arrangement of atoms. This single fact allows us to immediately rule out any options that involve a change in molecular weight.\n    *   **Ruled out: D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor.** A precursor is a starting material or intermediate and would almost certainly have a different molecular weight than the final product.\n    *   **Ruled out: B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction.** This implies a side reaction, such as adding an extra amino acid, which would create a product with a different (higher) molecular weight.\n\n2.  **Analyze the NMR and LC Data to Differentiate Isomers:** Now we must distinguish between the two remaining options, which are both types of isomers: diastereoisomers (A) and enantiomers (C).\n    *   **Chromatography (LC) Data:** The LC trace shows two clearly defined, separate peaks. Standard liquid chromatography separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (e.g., polarity, size, shape).\n    *   **NMR Data:** The ¹H NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for what should be a single proton. Standard NMR distinguishes protons based on their unique chemical environments.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Remaining Options:**\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) analytical environment, they have **identical** physical properties. Therefore, they **cannot** be separated by a standard LC column (they would produce a single peak) and are **indistinguishable** by a standard NMR spectrometer (they would produce a single set of peaks). The observation of two separate peaks in both LC and NMR directly contradicts this explanation.\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are **not** mirror images. They have **different** physical and chemical properties, even in an achiral environment.\n        *   **Consistency with LC:** Because they have different physical properties, diastereoisomers can be separated by a standard LC column, which perfectly explains the two observed peaks.\n        *   **Consistency with NMR:** Because their atoms are arranged differently in 3D space, their protons experience different chemical environments. This leads to different NMR spectra, which perfectly explains why a single type of proton shows up as two distinct peaks.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe observation of two separable species (by LC) that have the same mass (by MS) but different NMR spectra is the classic analytical signature of a diastereomeric mixture. This is a common issue in peptide synthesis, often caused by the partial inversion (epimerization) of a chiral center or the presence of stable cis/trans isomers (rotamers) around a peptide bond.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental evidence:**\n    *   **¹H NMR Data**: The core observation is two distinct peaks for a single proton (an alpha-proton). The peaks have equal integrals and sum to the expected value of one proton. Spin-spin coupling has been ruled out. This means the sample contains two different chemical species in a 1:1 ratio, where the alpha-proton exists in a slightly different chemical environment in each species.\n    *   **LC-MS Data**: The Liquid Chromatography (LC) separates the sample into two distinct peaks of equal intensity. This confirms the presence of two different species that have different physical properties (allowing separation) and are present in a 1:1 ratio. The Mass Spectrometry (MS) data is the most critical piece of evidence: both separated peaks yield the *exact same mass spectrum*, and this mass corresponds to the expected product. This proves that the two species are isomers—they have the same chemical formula and mass but a different arrangement of atoms.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the options against the evidence:**\n    *   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor** and **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred...**: These options are incorrect. Both a precursor and a product of a side-reaction like \"double coupling\" would have a different chemical formula and therefore a different molecular weight. The MS data, which shows that both species have the same, expected mass, directly refutes these possibilities.\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**: This option is incorrect. Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) analytical environment, they have identical physical properties. Therefore, they would produce only a single peak in a standard NMR spectrum and would co-elute as a single peak on a standard LC column. The observation of two peaks in both techniques rules out enantiomers.\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**: This option is the only one that fits all the evidence. Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical and chemical properties.\n        *   Because they have different chemical properties, they produce distinct NMR spectra, which explains the two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   Because they have different physical properties, they can be separated by standard LC, which explains the two peaks in the chromatogram.\n        *   Because they are isomers, they have the same molecular formula and mass, which explains why both LC peaks give the same mass spectrum.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of two distinct signals in the NMR, two separable peaks in the LC, and identical mass spectra for both species is the classic analytical signature for a mixture of diastereomers.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\n### Reasoning and Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Experimental Evidence**:\n    *   **Observation from ¹H NMR**: The spectrum shows two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton. These peaks have roughly equal integrals, and the combined integral equals the expected one proton. Spin-spin coupling has been ruled out.\n        *   **Interpretation**: The sample contains two different chemical species in a roughly 1:1 ratio. Since the peaks arise from the same proton in the molecule, these two species must be isomers. The proton's local chemical environment is slightly different in each isomer, leading to different chemical shifts. The fact that two sharp peaks are seen (instead of one broad, coalesced peak) indicates that the interconversion between these two isomers is slow on the NMR timescale.\n    *   **Observation from LC-MS**: The Liquid Chromatography (LC) run at an elevated temperature shows two separate, well-defined peaks of equal intensity. The Mass Spectrometry (MS) for both peaks shows the exact same mass, which is consistent with the expected product.\n        *   **Interpretation**: The LC data confirms that there are two distinct species that can be physically separated due to having different physical properties (like polarity). The MS data is the most critical clue: since both species have the same mass as the expected product, they must be isomers. This definitively rules out contamination by precursors or byproducts with different molecular formulas (e.g., from 'double coupling' or incomplete reactions), which would have different masses.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Possible Explanations (The Options)**:\n\n    *   **Contamination with a precursor (C) or a product of 'double coupling' (B)**: These explanations are inconsistent with the mass spectrometry data. Both a precursor and a 'double-coupled' product would have a different molecular weight than the expected target molecule. The MS data clearly shows that both species have the same, correct mass.\n\n    *   **Mixture of Enantiomers (D)**: Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) analytical environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties.\n        *   In standard NMR (using an achiral solvent), enantiomers are indistinguishable and would produce only one set of peaks.\n        *   On a standard (achiral) LC column, enantiomers co-elute as a single peak.\n        *   Therefore, the observation of two peaks in both NMR and LC proves that the isomers are not enantiomers.\n\n    *   **Mixture of Diastereoisomers (A)**: Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. This occurs in molecules with at least two chiral centers when their configurations differ at some, but not all, of these centers.\n        *   Diastereoisomers have different physical and chemical properties, even in an achiral environment.\n        *   **NMR Consistency**: Because they are chemically distinct, they are expected to have different NMR spectra. It is very common for a 1:1 mixture of diastereomers to show two sets of peaks for various protons, which perfectly explains the NMR observation.\n        *   **LC-MS Consistency**: Because they have different physical properties, they can be separated on a standard LC column, explaining the two peaks in the chromatogram. As isomers, they have the same molecular formula and therefore the same mass, which perfectly explains why both LC peaks have the same, correct mass spectrum. This explanation is fully consistent with all the experimental data.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe collective evidence—the presence of two isomers with the same mass that are separable by standard chromatography and distinguishable by standard NMR—unambiguously points to a mixture of diastereoisomers. This is a common occurrence in peptide synthesis, often due to epimerization at a chiral alpha-carbon or the presence of stable cis/trans rotamers (atropisomers), which are themselves a type of diastereomer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data**: The most critical piece of information is that the LC-MS analysis shows two distinct peaks in the chromatogram (LC), but *both peaks have the same mass spectrum*, and this mass is consistent with the expected product.\n    *   This fact immediately rules out any explanation involving a different molecular formula or molecular weight.\n    *   It rules out **(D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor**, because a precursor would have a different (usually lower) mass.\n    *   It rules out **(A) 'Double coupling' has occurred**, because this implies an extra amino acid or other group was added, resulting in a product with a different (higher) mass.\n    *   The MS data forces the conclusion that the two species detected are **isomers** of the target peptide—they have the same chemical formula and mass but a different arrangement of atoms.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Chromatography (LC) and NMR Data for the Isomers**: Now that we know we have a mixture of isomers, we need to determine what kind of isomers they are.\n    *   **LC Data**: The two isomers are separable by standard liquid chromatography.

They would co-elute as a single LC peak and give only one set of NMR signals. This is in direct contradiction to the observed data.\n        *   **(C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**: Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are **not** mirror images. They have different physical and chemical properties. This means they **are** separable by standard LC and **do** give different NMR spectra. This explanation is perfectly consistent with all the experimental data: two isomers (same mass) that can be separated and have distinct chemical signatures. In peptide synthesis, this is a common occurrence due to epimerization (inversion of a stereocenter) or cis/trans isomerism about an amide bond (rotamers).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe combined analytical data—two species that have the same mass but are separable by LC and distinguishable by NMR—is the classic signature of a diastereomeric mixture.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most likely explanation.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Experimental Observations**\n\n*   **Observation from ¹H NMR:** The presence of two distinct peaks for a single type of proton (an alpha-proton) means this proton exists in two different chemical environments. The fact that their integrals are roughly equal and sum to 1H indicates that two different molecular species are present in the sample in an approximate 1:1 ratio. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, this is not a simple J-coupling interaction.\n*   **Observation from LC-MS:**\n    *   The Liquid Chromatography (LC) data, showing two distinct and separable peaks, confirms that the sample is a mixture of two different compounds with different physical properties (e.g., polarity, size, shape). The equal intensities of the peaks corroborate the 1:1 ratio seen in the NMR.\n    *   The Mass Spectrometry (MS) data is the most crucial piece of evidence. Both separated peaks give the *exact same mass spectrum*, and this mass is consistent with the expected product. This proves that the two species are **isomers**—they have the same chemical formula and molecular weight but a different arrangement of atoms.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Options Against the Evidence**\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In standard (achiral) analytical environments, they have identical physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they would produce only a *single* peak in a standard NMR spectrum and would co-elute as a *single* peak in a standard LC analysis. This contradicts both the NMR and LC data.\n\n*   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This implies a side reaction that has added an extra molecule or fragment to the peptide. The resulting product would have a different chemical formula and therefore a **different molecular weight**. This is directly contradicted by the MS data, which shows both species have the expected mass.\n\n*   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. This is a common occurrence in peptide chemistry, for instance, if one chiral amino acid undergoes epimerization (inversion of stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon) during synthesis.\n    *   **Consistency with Data:**\n        *   **Same Mass:** As isomers, they have the same molecular weight, which matches the MS data.\n        *   **Different Properties:** Diastereoisomers have different physical properties. This means they are separable by standard LC and will have different NMR spectra.\n    *   This explanation perfectly fits all the observations: two separable species (LC), with distinct chemical environments (NMR), that are isomers of each other (MS).\n\n*   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor from an earlier stage of synthesis would almost certainly have a different chemical formula and a **different molecular weight**. This is directly contradicted by the MS data.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to a mixture of two species that are isomers of each other but are not enantiomers.

This contradicts the MS data.\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This implies a side reaction, such as the addition of an extra amino acid, which would create a product with a different (higher) molecular weight. This also contradicts the MS data.\n\n**2. Differentiate Between the Remaining Isomer Types (Enantiomers vs. Diastereoisomers):**\nNow we must choose between option B (enantiomers) and option C (diastereomers). We use the NMR and LC data to distinguish them.\n\n*   **Enantiomers (Option B):** These are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images.\n    *   In a standard (achiral) environment, enantiomers have identical physical and chemical properties.\n    *   A standard ¹H NMR experiment uses an achiral solvent, so enantiomers are indistinguishable and produce a **single, identical NMR spectrum**. This contradicts the observation of two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n    *   A standard LC column is achiral, so it **cannot separate enantiomers**. They would elute as a single peak. This contradicts the observation of two clearly defined LC peaks.\n    *   Therefore, the sample cannot be a mixture of enantiomers.\n\n*   **Diastereoisomers (Option C):** These are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. This is common in peptides if, for example, an L-amino acid center epimerizes to a D-amino acid during synthesis, creating a mix of L-L and D-L peptides.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical and chemical properties in all environments (both chiral and achiral).\n    *   Because they are chemically distinct, they are expected to produce **different NMR spectra**. The alpha-proton would exist in a different 3D environment in each diastereomer, explaining the two separate NMR peaks. The equal integrals indicate a 1:1 mixture.\n    *   Because they have different physical properties (e.g., shape, polarity), they can be **separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography**. This explains the two separate LC peaks.\n    *   This explanation is perfectly consistent with all experimental data: two isomers with the same mass but different NMR and LC properties.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to the crude compound existing as a mixture of diastereoisomers.

Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, this means the sample contains a mixture of two distinct chemical species in approximately a 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Implication:** The two species must be isomers. Enantiomers are chemically identical in an achiral environment (like a standard NMR solvent) and would produce a single signal. Therefore, the isomers must be diastereomers.\n\n2.  **Analyze the LC-MS Data:**\n    *   **Observation (LC):** The Liquid Chromatography separates the sample into two clearly defined peaks of equal intensity.\n    *   **Interpretation (LC):** This confirms the presence of two different species that can be physically separated due to differences in their properties (e.g., polarity). This further rules out enantiomers, which would not separate on a standard (achiral) LC column.\n    *   **Observation (MS):** The Mass Spectrometry shows that both species have the exact same mass, and this mass corresponds to the expected product.\n    *   **Interpretation (MS):** This is a critical piece of evidence. It proves that the two species are not impurities with different molecular weights (like a precursor or a side-product from double-coupling), but are in fact isomers of the target molecule.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Option Based on the Combined Evidence:**\n    *   **A) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This side reaction would create a molecule with a higher molecular weight. The MS data, showing the expected mass, contradicts this.\n    *   **B) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would have a different (usually lower) molecular weight. The MS data, showing the expected mass for both peaks, contradicts this.\n    *   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers have identical physical properties in achiral environments. They cannot be separated by standard LC and are indistinguishable by standard ¹H NMR. This option is contradicted by both the LC and NMR data, which clearly show two distinct species.\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have the same molecular formula (and thus the same mass) but different physical and chemical properties. This perfectly explains all observations:\n        *   They have the same mass (consistent with MS).\n        *   They are separable by standard LC (consistent with two LC peaks).\n        *   They are chemically distinct and thus have different NMR spectra (consistent with two NMR peaks for the alpha-proton).\n        *   This is a common issue in peptide synthesis where epimerization at a chiral center can occur, creating a diastereomeric mixture.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of two distinct signals in both NMR and LC, coupled with identical mass spectrometry data for both signals, is the classic signature of a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the NMR Data:** The <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum provides the first key piece of information. The presence of two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, with roughly equal integrals that sum to the expected 1H, indicates that the proton exists in two different chemical environments. Because spin-spin coupling is ruled out, this means the sample contains two different molecular species in a roughly 1:1 ratio. Since the chemical shifts are similar, the two species must be structurally very similar.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the LC-MS Data:** This analysis confirms and extends the NMR findings.\n    *   The Liquid Chromatography (LC) separates the sample into two distinct peaks of equal intensity. This confirms the presence of two different species in a 1:1 ratio, and crucially, demonstrates that these two species have different physical properties (e.g., polarity), which is why they can be separated.\n    *   The Mass Spectrometry (MS) data shows that both separated LC peaks have the *exact same mass spectrum*, and this mass is consistent with the expected product. This is a critical point: it proves the two species are **isomers**. They have the same chemical formula and molecular weight but differ in their spatial arrangement. This fact definitively rules out impurities like precursors or side products from 'double coupling', which would have different molecular weights.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Types of Isomers:** Based on the evidence, we know the sample is a 1:1 mixture of two isomers. We must decide which type.\n    *   **Enantiomers (Option D):** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they are *not* distinguishable by standard NMR spectroscopy (they give one set of peaks) and are *not* separable by a standard LC column (they co-elute as one peak). This directly contradicts both the NMR and LC data. Thus, option D is incorrect.\n    *   **Diastereoisomers (Option B):** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images of each other. This occurs in molecules with at least two stereocenters where the configuration differs at some, but not all, centers. A common example in peptide synthesis is epimerization, where an L-amino acid might invert to a D-amino acid, creating a diastereomeric peptide. Critically, diastereoisomers have **different physical and chemical properties**. This means they are expected to have different NMR spectra (as observed) and are separable by standard LC (as observed). This explanation perfectly fits all the experimental data.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:** The sample is a mixture of two species that are isomers (same mass), but not enantiomers (they are distinguishable by standard NMR and LC). By definition, isomers that are not enantiomers are diastereomers. This is a common and well-understood phenomenon in peptide synthesis.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the most likely explanation for the observations.\n\n**1. Deconstruction of the Experimental Evidence**\n\n*   **¹H NMR Data:** The key finding is two distinct peaks for a single type of proton (the alpha-proton).\n    *   **Interpretation:** This means the alpha-proton exists in two different, non-equivalent chemical environments.\n    *   **Integrals:** The roughly equal integrals, which sum to the expected 1H, indicate that the two species responsible for these environments are present in an approximately 1:1 ratio.\n    *   **Coupling:** The exclusion of spin-spin coupling confirms the two peaks represent two distinct species, not splitting of a single signal.\n*   **LC-MS Data:** This provides two crucial pieces of information.\n    *   **LC (Liquid Chromatography):** The sample separates into two distinct peaks of equal intensity. This confirms the presence of two different compounds that can be physically separated based on their properties (like polarity or size). This aligns with the NMR data.\n    *   **MS (Mass Spectrometry):** Both separated peaks give the *exact same mass spectrum*, and this mass matches the expected product. This is a critical point: it proves the two species are **isomers**—they have the same chemical formula and mass but a different arrangement of atoms.\n\n**2. Evaluation of the Proposed Explanations**\n\nLet's evaluate each option against the combined experimental evidence.\n\n*   **C) The compound is contaminated with a precursor.**\n    *   A precursor is a starting material or intermediate. It would have a different chemical formula and therefore a **different mass** from the final product.\n    *   This is **inconsistent** with the MS data, which shows both species have the same, correct mass.\n\n*   **D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers.**\n    *   Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical and chemical properties in achiral (standard) environments.\n    *   As a result, they are **indistinguishable** by standard ¹H NMR and **cannot be separated** by standard LC. They would show only a single peak in both experiments.\n    *   This is **inconsistent** with both the NMR and LC data, which each show two distinct peaks.\n\n*   **B) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction.**\n    *   This implies a side reaction where an extra unit (e.g., another amino acid) has been added. This would create a new molecule with a **different mass**.\n    *   This is **inconsistent** with the MS data showing the expected mass for both components.\n\n*   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.**\n    *   Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. This is common in peptide chemistry, often arising from the racemization (epimerization) of one of the amino acid's chiral centers during synthesis. For example, if a peptide contains two L-amino acids (L-L), epimerization could create the L-D version. L-L and L-D peptides are diastereomers.\n    *   Diastereoisomers have the **same mass**, which is **consistent** with the MS data.\n    *   Crucially, diastereoisomers have **different physical and chemical properties**. This means they have **different NMR spectra** and **can be separated by standard LC**.\n    *   This explanation is **perfectly consistent** with all observations: two isomers with the same mass, but separable by LC and distinguishable by NMR.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe observation of two separable species by standard chromatography that possess identical mass but give distinct NMR signals is the classic analytical signature of a mixture of diastereoisomers. This is the only explanation that fits all the experimental evidence provided.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the experimental data**: The first step is to understand what each piece of analytical data tells us about the sample.\n    *   **<sup>1</sup>H NMR Data**: The presence of two distinct peaks for a single alpha-proton, with roughly equal integrals summing to one, indicates that there are two different chemical species present in the sample in a ~1:1 ratio. In each of these species, the alpha-proton has a slightly different chemical environment. The fact that this splitting is not from spin-spin coupling confirms that we are observing two different molecular forms.\n    *   **LC-MS Data**: This analysis provides two crucial pieces of information.\n        *   **Liquid Chromatography (LC)**: The separation of the sample into two peaks of equal intensity confirms that there are two distinct compounds that can be physically separated based on their properties (e.g., polarity). This corroborates the NMR data about a 1:1 mixture.\n        *   **Mass Spectrometry (MS)**: The finding that both separated peaks have the *exact same mass spectrum*, which is consistent with the *expected product*, is the most critical clue. It proves that the two species are not an impurity and a product, but rather they are **isomers** of each other – they have the same chemical formula and molecular weight but different three-dimensional arrangements.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the options against the data**: Now we test each possible explanation against our conclusions from the data.\n\n    *   **D) The compound is contaminated with a precursor** and **C) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction**: Both of these options describe scenarios that would result in a second chemical species with a **different molecular weight** than the expected product. The mass spectrometry data directly contradicts this by showing that both species have the same, expected mass. Therefore, these options are incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**: Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical and chemical properties in a standard (achiral) environment. Consequently, they would not be separated by standard LC and would produce only a single peak. Similarly, they are indistinguishable by standard <sup>1</sup>H NMR and would show only a single set of signals. This explanation contradicts both the LC and NMR observations, so it is incorrect.\n\n    *   **A) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**: Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. This is a common situation in peptide synthesis, often due to the inversion of a stereocenter (epimerization) at one of the alpha-carbons.\n        *   **Compatibility with NMR**: Diastereoisomers are distinct chemical compounds. Their corresponding protons are in different chemical environments and thus have different chemical shifts, which explains the two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   **Compatibility with LC-MS**: Diastereoisomers have different physical properties and can be separated by standard (achiral) liquid chromatography, explaining the two LC peaks. As isomers, they have the same chemical formula and therefore the same mass, which explains why both peaks have identical mass spectra. This explanation is perfectly consistent with all the provided data.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**: The observation of two species that are isomers (same mass) but can be separated by standard chromatography and distinguished by NMR is the classic signature of a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis is a classic problem in chemical analysis, particularly for molecules like peptides that have stereochemistry. To determine the correct answer, we must systematically evaluate each piece of evidence provided by the NMR and LC-MS analyses.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Experimental Observations:**\n    *   **Sample:** A small synthetic peptide. This is important because peptides are made of amino acids, which (except for glycine) are chiral. Therefore, stereoisomerism is a key consideration.\n    *   **¹H NMR Data:**\n        *   Two distinct peaks are observed for a single type of proton (the alpha-proton).\n        *   The peaks have roughly equal integrals, and the sum of their integrals equals the expected value (1H).\n        *   **Conclusion:** This indicates that the sample contains two different molecular species in an approximately 1:1 ratio. In each species, the alpha-proton has a slightly different chemical environment, causing the two separate signals. The slow exchange between these species on the NMR timescale is why two sharp peaks are seen instead of a single, broadened peak.\n    *   **LC-MS Data:**\n        *   **LC:** The liquid chromatograph separates the sample into two distinct peaks, again with equal intensities. This confirms the presence of two species that have different physical properties (e.g., polarity), which allows them to be separated by chromatography.\n        *   **MS:** The mass spectrometer shows that both separated species have the *exact same mass spectrum*, and this mass matches the expected molecular weight of the target molecule.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This is a crucial piece of information. The two species are not an impurity and a product, nor a precursor and a product. They are **isomers**—they share the same chemical formula and mass but have a different three-dimensional arrangement of atoms.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Candidate Options:**\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** A precursor would have a different molecular formula and a different mass. The MS data shows both species have the same, expected mass. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In a standard (achiral) analytical environment, they have identical physical and chemical properties. This means they cannot be separated by a standard LC column (they would elute as a single peak) and are indistinguishable by a standard NMR spectrometer (they would produce a single set of peaks). This directly contradicts both the LC and NMR observations. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This implies a side reaction that would add another chemical group (like a second amino acid), resulting in a product with a significantly different, higher mass. This contradicts the MS data showing the expected mass. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are *not* mirror images. This can occur in peptides if one of the chiral amino acid centers epimerizes (inverts its stereochemistry) during synthesis, or due to the presence of stable *cis* and *trans* conformers (rotamers) around an amide bond.\n        *   **Consistency:**\n            *   Diastereoisomers have the same chemical formula and thus the **same mass**, which is consistent with the MS data.\n            *   They have **different physical properties** and are therefore **separable by standard LC**, explaining the two peaks.\n            *   They are chemically distinct molecules and thus have **different NMR spectra**, explaining the two signals for the alpha-proton.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This option is perfectly consistent with all the experimental data provided.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe observation of two separable species (by LC) that are isomers (same mass by MS) and are distinguishable by NMR is the classic analytical signature for a mixture of diastereoisomers. This is a common phenomenon in peptide synthesis.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
