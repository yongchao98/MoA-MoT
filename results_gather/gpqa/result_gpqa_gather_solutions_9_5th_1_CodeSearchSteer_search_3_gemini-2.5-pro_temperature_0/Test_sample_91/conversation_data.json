Determine the Molecular Formula and Bond Count**\n\nFirst, we must accurately determine the composition of the molecule `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`.\n*   **Atom Count:** By summing the atoms in each part of the structure, we find there are 12 Carbon (C) atoms and 22 Hydrogen (H) atoms. The molecular formula is **C₁₂H₂₂**.\n*   **Bond Count:**\n    *   There are **22 C-H bonds** (one for each hydrogen atom).\n    *   There are **2 C=C double bonds** explicitly shown in the structure.\n    *   For an acyclic (non-ring) molecule, the total number of bonds in the carbon skeleton is one less than the number of carbon atoms (12 - 1 = 11). Since two of these are double bonds, the number of **C-C single bonds** is 11 - 2 = **9**.\n\n**2. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f°) corresponds to the reaction `12 C(s) + 11 H₂(g) → C₁₂H₂₂(g)`. We must calculate the energy required to convert the reactants from their standard states into gaseous atoms (`12 C(g) + 22 H(g)`).\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ.\n*   Energy to break 11 moles of H-H bonds = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ.\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants** = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Product**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the product, calculated by summing all its bond energies.\n*   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ.\n*   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ.\n*   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ.\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Product** = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f°)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the energy input to atomize the reactants minus the energy released when forming the product's bonds.\n*   ΔH_f° = [Enthalpy of atomization of reactants] - [Enthalpy of atomization of product]\n*   ΔH_f° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**5. Convert Units and Select the Final Answer**\n\nThe calculated value is 1900 kJ/mol. We must compare this to the given options and perform a unit conversion if necessary.\n*   **Molar Mass of C₁₂H₂₂:** (12 × 12.0 g/mol) + (22 × 1.0 g/mol) = 166 g/mol.\n*   **Convert ΔH_f° to kJ/g:** (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.4457 kJ/g**.\n\nComparing our calculated values to the options:\n*   **A) 11.44 kJ/g:** This matches our calculated value.\n*   B) 67.4 kJ/mol: Incorrect value.\n*   C) 11200 kJ/mol: Incorrect. This is the enthalpy of atomization of the product, not its enthalpy of formation.\n*   D) 1900 kJ/g: Incorrect units. This is a distractor using the correct numerical value for kJ/mol.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Accurate Bond Counting:** The most common source of error in such problems is an incorrect count of the bonds, especially the C-C single bonds. Using the `(n-1)` rule for the carbon framework is a reliable method for acyclic molecules.\n*   **Distinguishing Enthalpies:** It is critical not to confuse the enthalpy of atomization of the product (11200 kJ/mol, Option C) with the final enthalpy of formation. This is a very common distractor.\n*   **Attention to Units:** The final step of checking and converting units is essential. The correct numerical value for the molar enthalpy (1900) is presented with incorrect units (kJ/g) in Option D, another common trick in multiple-choice questions.\n*   **Final Unit Conversion:** The correct answer can only be identified after converting the molar enthalpy of formation (kJ/mol) into specific enthalpy (kJ/g) by dividing by the molar mass.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers, a clear and unanimous consensus on the calculation methodology is evident.

Since two of these are double bonds, the number of **C-C single bonds** is 11 - 2 = **9**.\n\n**2. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation (ΔH_f°) corresponds to the reaction `12 C(s) + 11 H₂(g) → C₁₂H₂₂(g)`. We must calculate the energy required to convert the reactants from their standard states into gaseous atoms (`12 C(g) + 22 H(g)`).\n*   Energy to atomize 12 moles of Carbon = 12 mol × 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ.\n*   Energy to break 11 moles of H-H bonds = 11 mol × 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ.\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Reactants** = 12000 kJ + 1100 kJ = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Product**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the product, calculated by summing all its bond energies.\n*   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 × 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ.\n*   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 × 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ.\n*   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 × 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ.\n*   **Total Enthalpy of Atomization of Product** = 8800 + 1800 + 600 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f°)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the energy input to atomize the reactants minus the energy released when forming the product's bonds.\n*   ΔH_f° = [Enthalpy of atomization of reactants] - [Enthalpy of atomization of product]\n*   ΔH_f° = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**5.

This is the enthalpy of atomization of the product, not its enthalpy of formation.\n*   D) 1900 kJ/g: Incorrect units. This is a distractor using the correct numerical value for kJ/mol.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Accurate Bond Counting:** The most common source of error in such problems is an incorrect count of the bonds, especially the C-C single bonds. Using the `(n-1)` rule for the carbon framework is a reliable method for acyclic molecules.\n*   **Distinguishing Enthalpies:** It is critical not to confuse the enthalpy of atomization of the product (11200 kJ/mol, Option C) with the final enthalpy of formation. This is a very common distractor.\n*   **Attention to Units:** The final step of checking and converting units is essential. The correct numerical value for the molar enthalpy (1900) is presented with incorrect units (kJ/g) in Option D, another common trick in multiple-choice questions.\n*   **Final Unit Conversion:** The correct answer can only be identified after converting the molar enthalpy of formation (kJ/mol) into specific enthalpy (kJ/g) by dividing by the molar mass.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided candidate answers, a clear and unanimous consensus on the calculation methodology is evident.
