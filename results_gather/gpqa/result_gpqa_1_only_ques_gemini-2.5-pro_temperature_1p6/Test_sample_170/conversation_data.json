    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct order:\n\n**1. Classify the Substituents**\n\nFirst, we need to classify each substituent on the benzene ring based on its effect on electrophilic aromatic substitution. Substituents can be either activating or deactivating, and they direct incoming groups to specific positions (ortho/para or meta).\n\n*   **Ortho, Para-Directors:** These groups direct the incoming bromine to the ortho and para positions. They generally lead to a high yield of the para-isomer.\n    *   -CH3 (Toluene, 1): Activating group (+I effect, hyperconjugation).\n    *   -C2H5 (Ethylbenzene, 5): Activating group (+I effect, hyperconjugation).\n    *   -Cl (Chlorobenzene, 3): Deactivating group (-I > +M effect) but is an ortho, para-director due to the +M effect (resonance from lone pairs).\n\n*   **Meta-Directors:** These groups are deactivating and direct the incoming bromine primarily to the meta position. They will produce very low yields of the para-isomer.\n    *   -COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate, 2): Deactivating group (-M effect).\n    *   -NO2 (Nitrobenzene, 4): Strongly deactivating group (-I, -M effects).\n    *   -COOH (Benzoic acid, 6): Deactivating group (-M effect).\n\n**2. Separate into Two Groups**\n\nBased on the directing effects, we can split the substances into two groups. The meta-directors will have the lowest para-isomer yields, and the ortho/para-directors will have the highest.\n\n*   **Low Para Yield:** 2, 4, 6\n*   **High Para Yield:** 1, 3, 5\n\nThe final order will look like: (2, 4, 6 in some order) < (1, 3, 5 in some order).\n\n**3. Order the Meta-Directors (2, 4, 6)**\n\nFor meta-directors, the yield of the para-isomer is inversely related to the strength of the deactivating effect. The more strongly deactivating a group is, the more selectively it directs to the meta position, resulting in a lower yield of the para-isomer.\n\nLet's rank the deactivating strength:\n*   -NO2 is one of the strongest deactivating groups.\n*   -COOH is a strong deactivating group.\n*   -COOC2H5 is also deactivating, but the electron-donating nature of the -C2H5 group (+I effect) slightly reduces the overall deactivating strength compared to -COOH.\n\nSo, the deactivating strength is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOC2H5.\nThis means the yield of the para-isomer will be in the reverse order:\n-NO2 (4) < -COOH (6) < -COOC2H5 (2).\n\n**4. Order the Ortho, Para-Directors (1, 3, 5)**\n\nFor ortho, para-directors, we need to compare the ratio of the para product to the ortho product. A higher para/ortho ratio means a higher yield of the para-isomer.\n\n*   **Comparing -CH3 (1) and -C2H5 (5):** The primary factor here is steric hindrance. The ethyl group (-C2H5) is bulkier than the methyl group (-CH3). This increased bulk hinders the approach of the bromine electrophile to the adjacent ortho positions more significantly. As a result, substitution at the less hindered para position is more favored for ethylbenzene than for toluene. Therefore, the percentage of the para-isomer is higher for ethylbenzene.\n    *   Order: Toluene (1) < Ethylbenzene (5).\n\n*   **Comparing with -Cl (3):** The chlorine atom in chlorobenzene has a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I), which deactivates the entire ring. This effect is strongest at the closest positions (ortho) and weaker at the more distant para position. The electron-donating resonance effect (+M) activates the ortho and para positions. The interplay of these effects results in a very high preference for substitution at the para position. The para-isomer yield for the halogenation of halobenzenes is typically very high (around 85-90%). This is generally higher than the para-yield for alkylbenzenes.\n    *   Order: Ethylbenzene (5) < Chlorobenzene (3).\n\nCombining these, the order of increasing para-isomer yield for this group is:\n-CH3 (1) < -C2H5 (5) < -Cl (3).\n\n**5. Combine All Substances**\n\nNow, we combine the two ordered groups:\n(4 < 6 < 2) < (1 < 5 < 3)\n\nThe final order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is:\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
