    "This problem requires the use of the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\nLet's define our frames of reference:\n1.  **S:** The stationary laboratory frame where the observer is located.\n2.  **S':** The moving frame of the glass, which moves at a velocity `v` relative to the laboratory frame S.\n\nNow let's identify the velocities involved:\n*   The velocity of the glass frame (S') relative to the lab frame (S) is `v`.\n*   The speed of light *within* the glass (in its own rest frame S') is `u'`. The speed of light in a medium with a refractive index `n` is given by `c/n`. Since the problem states `c=1`, the speed of light in the rest frame of the glass is `u' = 1/n`. The problem specifies that the light beam and the glass are moving in the same direction.\n*   We need to find the speed of the light beam as measured by the observer in the laboratory frame (S). Let's call this `u`.\n\nThe relativistic velocity addition formula for velocities in the same direction is:\n`u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v / c^2)`\n\nNow, we substitute the values we know into this formula, with `c=1`:\n*   `u' = 1/n`\n*   `v = v`\n*   `c = 1`\n\n`u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + (1/n)*v / 1^2 )`\n\n`u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n)`\n\nTo simplify this expression, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by `n`:\n`u = n * (1/n + v) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n`u = (n * (1/n) + n*v) / (n*1 + n*(v/n))`\n`u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)`\n\nThis result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
