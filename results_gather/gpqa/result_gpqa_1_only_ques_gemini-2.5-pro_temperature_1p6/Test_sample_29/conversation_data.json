    "Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **Calculate the wavelength of the emitted light.**\n    The relationship between energy (E) and wavelength (λ) is given by the equation:\n    E = hc / λ\n    where h is Planck's constant, and c is the speed of light. A convenient form of this equation is:\n    λ (in nm) = 1240 eV·nm / E (in eV)\n\n    Given the energy of the emitted light is E_emitted = 2.3393 eV.\n    λ_emitted = 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 530 nm\n\n2.  **Determine the color of the emitted light.**\n    A wavelength of 530 nm falls into the **green** region of the visible light spectrum. So, the dye emits green light.\n\n3.  **Relate emitted light to absorbed light.**\n    For a substance to emit light (a process called fluorescence or phosphorescence), it must first absorb light to move to an excited energy state. After absorbing a photon, the molecule typically loses a small amount of energy through non-radiative processes (like vibrations/heat) before emitting a new photon to return to the ground state.\n\n    This means the absorbed photon must have *more* energy than the emitted photon. This phenomenon is known as the Stokes shift.\n    *   E_absorbed > E_emitted\n    *   Since energy is inversely proportional to wavelength (E ∝ 1/λ), the wavelength of the absorbed light must be *shorter* than the wavelength of the emitted light.\n    *   λ_absorbed < λ_emitted\n\n4.  **Determine the color of the absorbed light.**\n    We know the emitted wavelength is ~530 nm (green). Therefore, the absorbed wavelength must be shorter than 530 nm. Let's examine the options based on their typical wavelengths:\n    *   A) Red: ~620-750 nm (longer than 530 nm)\n    *   B) Violet: ~400-450 nm (shorter than 530 nm)\n    *   C) Yellow: ~570-590 nm (longer than 530 nm)\n    *   D) Blue: ~450-495 nm (shorter than 530 nm)\n\n    Both blue and violet have wavelengths shorter than green light. However, the Stokes shift is usually relatively small, meaning the absorption peak is spectrally close to the emission peak. The color with the next shorter wavelength to green is blue. Therefore, the compound most likely absorbs blue light to cause the green emission.\n\n<<<D>>>"
