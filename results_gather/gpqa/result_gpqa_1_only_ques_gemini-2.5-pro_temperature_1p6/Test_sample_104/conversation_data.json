    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of the Problem**\n\nThe problem asks us to compare two phenomena that cause a dip in a star's observed brightness:\n*   **Rotational Modulation:** A star with an uneven surface brightness (due to dark starspots) will appear to change in brightness as it rotates. The brightness is at a minimum when the most heavily spotted region faces the observer.\n*   **Exoplanet Transit:** A planet passing in front of its star blocks a small fraction of the starlight, causing a temporary dip in brightness.\n\nWe need to find the size of a hypothetical planet that would cause the same brightness dip as the given starspot configuration.\n\n**2. Calculate the Brightness Dip from Starspots**\n\nThe flux (energy per unit area) emitted by a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: $F = \\sigma T^4$, where $T$ is the temperature and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The total power we observe is proportional to this flux multiplied by the projected area of the star's disk.\n\n*   **Star's Parameters:**\n    *   Photosphere temperature, $T_{eff} = 6000$ K\n    *   Spot temperature, $T_{spot} = 6000 \\text{ K} - 1000 \\text{ K} = 5000$ K\n    *   Spot filling factor on one hemisphere, $f = 20\\% = 0.20$\n\n*   **Maximum Brightness ($F_{max}$):** This occurs when the clean, unspotted hemisphere faces the observer. The observed flux is proportional to $T_{eff}^4$.\n    $F_{max} \\propto \\sigma T_{eff}^4$\n\n*   **Minimum Brightness ($F_{min}$):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. A fraction $f$ of the disk is at temperature $T_{spot}$ and the remaining fraction $(1-f)$ is at temperature $T_{eff}$. The total observed flux is the sum from both parts.\n    $F_{min} \\propto (1-f)\\sigma T_{eff}^4 + f\\sigma T_{spot}^4$\n\n*   **Amplitude of Variation:** The amplitude is the fractional change in brightness. The question asks to compare this to an exoplanet transit of an *unspotted* star, so we normalize the change by the maximum (unspotted) flux, $F_{max}$.\n\n    Amplitude = $\\frac{F_{max} - F_{min}}{F_{max}}$\n\n    Substitute the expressions for flux:\n    Amplitude = $\\frac{\\sigma T_{eff}^4 - [(1-f)\\sigma T_{eff}^4 + f\\sigma T_{spot}^4]}{\\sigma T_{eff}^4}$\n\n    Cancel $\\sigma$ and simplify the numerator:\n    Amplitude = $\\frac{T_{eff}^4 - T_{eff}^4 + f T_{eff}^4 - f T_{spot}^4}{T_{eff}^4} = \\frac{f T_{eff}^4 - f T_{spot}^4}{T_{eff}^4}$\n\n    Amplitude = $f \\left(1 - \\frac{T_{spot}^4}{T_{eff}^4}\\right) = f \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{T_{spot}}{T_{eff}}\\right)^4\\right)$\n\n*   **Plug in the numbers:**\n    Amplitude = $0.20 \\times \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{5000}{6000}\\right)^4\\right)$\n    Amplitude = $0.20 \\times \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^4\\right)$\n    Amplitude = $0.20 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{625}{1296}\\right)$\n    Amplitude = $0.20 \\times \\left(\\frac{1296 - 625}{1296}\\right)$\n    Amplitude = $0.20 \\times \\left(\\frac{671}{1296}\\right) \\approx 0.20 \\times 0.51775$\n    Amplitude $\\approx 0.10355$\n\nSo, the starspots cause a periodic brightness dip of about 10.36%.\n\n**3. Calculate the Equivalent Exoplanet Radius**\n\nThe dip in brightness caused by a transiting exoplanet (the transit depth) is equal to the ratio of the planet's disk area to the star's disk area.\n\nTransit Depth = $\\frac{\\text{Area}_{planet}}{\\text{Area}_{star}} = \\frac{\\pi R_{pl}^2}{\\pi R_{star}^2} = \\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2$\n\nWe need to find the planet-to-star radius ratio ($R_{pl}/R_{star}$) that produces a transit depth equal to the amplitude from the starspots.\n\n$\\left(\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}}\\right)^2 = 0.10355$\n\nNow, take the square root to find the ratio:\n\n$\\frac{R_{pl}}{R_{star}} = \\sqrt{0.10355} \\approx 0.3218$\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nThe relative radius of the hypothetical exoplanet ($R_{pl}/R_{star}$) would be approximately 0.32 to produce the same amplitude signal as the rotational modulation from the spots.\n\n<<<A>>>"
