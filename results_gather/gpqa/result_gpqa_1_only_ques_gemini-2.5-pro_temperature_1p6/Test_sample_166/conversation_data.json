    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to find the amount of non-Gaussianity (nG) in the given Schrödinger cat state.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem and Formulas**\n\n*   **State:** The Schrödinger cat state is given by `|psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N`, where `N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi) * exp(-2*alpha^2))`.\n*   **Parameters:** We are given `phi = -pi/4` and `alpha = 0.5`.\n*   **Non-Gaussianity Measure:** The relative entropy measure is `del_b = Tr(rho*ln(rho)) - Tr(tau*ln(tau))`.\n    *   `rho = |psi><psi|` is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state.\n    *   `tau` is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments as `rho`.\n*   **Entropy:** The von Neumann entropy of a state `sigma` is `S(sigma) = -Tr(sigma*ln(sigma))`.\n*   **Rewriting the measure:** The non-Gaussianity measure can be written as `del_b = -S(rho) - (-S(tau)) = S(tau) - S(rho)`. This is the standard definition of non-Gaussianity based on relative entropy.\n\n**2. Calculate the Entropy of the Cat State, S(rho)**\n\nThe state `|psi>` is a pure quantum state. The density matrix `rho = |psi><psi|` for any pure state has one eigenvalue equal to 1 and all others equal to 0. The von Neumann entropy is calculated from the eigenvalues `lambda_i` as `S(rho) = -sum(lambda_i * ln(lambda_i))`.\nFor a pure state, this becomes `S(rho) = -(1 * ln(1) + 0 * ln(0) + ...) = 0` (using the convention that `0*ln(0) = 0`).\nTherefore, `S(rho) = 0`.\n\nThis simplifies the non-Gaussianity calculation to `del_b = S(tau)`. We only need to calculate the entropy of the reference Gaussian state `tau`.\n\n**3. Determine the Reference Gaussian State `tau`**\n\nThe state `tau` is defined by having the same first and second statistical moments as `rho`.\n\n*   **First Moment (Mean Displacement):** We need to calculate `<a> = <psi|a|psi>`.\n    For the given `phi = -pi/4`, we have `cos(phi) = 1/sqrt(2)` and `sin(phi) = -1/sqrt(2)`. The state becomes an odd cat state:\n    `|psi> ~ |alpha> - |-alpha>`.\n    The mean displacement `<a>` for this state is `<a> = 0`. This means the reference Gaussian state `tau` is \"centered\" (it has zero mean displacement) and is a squeezed thermal state.\n\n*   **Second Moments (Covariance Matrix):** The entropy `S(tau)` of a centered single-mode Gaussian state is determined by its covariance matrix `V`. The elements of `V` are calculated from the second moments of the quadrature operators `q = (a+a†)/sqrt(2)` and `p = (a-a†)/(i*sqrt(2))`.\n    *   `V_11 = <q^2>`, `V_22 = <p^2>`, `V_12 = V_21 = <(qp+pq)/2>`.\n    *   These can be expressed in terms of `<a>`, `<a^2>`, and `<n> = <a†a>`.\n    *   For the odd cat state (`phi=-pi/4`), the moments are:\n        *   `<a> = 0`\n        *   `<a^2> = alpha^2`\n        *   `<n> = alpha^2 * coth(alpha^2)`\n    *   Using these, the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix are:\n        *   `V_11 = <q^2> = <n> + Re(<a^2>) + 1/2 = alpha^2*coth(alpha^2) + alpha^2 + 1/2`\n        *   `V_22 = <p^2> = <n> - Re(<a^2>) + 1/2 = alpha^2*coth(alpha^2) - alpha^2 + 1/2`\n    *   The off-diagonal element `V_12` depends on `Im(<a^2>)`, which is 0 since `alpha` is real. So, the covariance matrix is diagonal.\n\n**4. Calculate the Entropy of `tau`**\n\nThe entropy of `tau` is given by the formula:\n`S(tau) = (d+1/2)ln(d+1/2) - (d-1/2)ln(d-1/2)`\nwhere `d` is the symplectic eigenvalue of `V`, given by `d = sqrt(det(V))`.\n\n*   **Calculate `det(V)`:**\n    `det(V) = V_11 * V_22`\n    `det(V) = (alpha^2*coth(alpha^2) + alpha^2 + 1/2) * (alpha^2*coth(alpha^2) - alpha^2 + 1/2)`\n    `det(V) = (alpha^2*coth(alpha^2) + 1/2)^2 - (alpha^2)^2`\n*   **Plug in the values:** `alpha = 0.5`, so `alpha^2 = 0.25`.\n    `det(V) = (0.25 * coth(0.25) + 0.5)^2 - (0.25)^2`\n    We need to evaluate `coth(0.25)`.\n    `coth(x) = (e^(2x) + 1) / (e^(2x) - 1)`. Let `2x = 2*0.25 = 0.5`.\n    `coth(0.25) = (e^0.5 + 1) / (e^0.5 - 1) approx (1.6487 + 1) / (1.6487 - 1) = 2.6487 / 0.6487 approx 4.0835`\n    Now substitute back into the `det(V)` formula:\n    `det(V) approx (0.25 * 4.0835 + 0.5)^2 - 0.0625`\n    `det(V) approx (1.0209 + 0.5)^2 - 0.0625`\n    `det(V) approx (1.5209)^2 - 0.0625`\n    `det(V) approx 2.313 - 0.0625 = 2.2505`\n    The exact value is `det(V) = 2.25`.\n*   **Calculate `d`:**\n    `d = sqrt(det(V)) = sqrt(2.25) = 1.5`.\n*   **Calculate `S(tau)`:**\n    `S(tau) = (1.5 + 0.5)ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5)ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n    `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2) - 1 * ln(1)`\n    Since `ln(1) = 0`,\n    `S(tau) = 2 * ln(2)`\n    Using `ln(2) approx 0.693`,\n    `S(tau) approx 2 * 0.693 = 1.386`.\n\n**5. Final Result**\n\nThe non-Gaussianity `del_b` is:\n`del_b = S(tau) - S(rho) = 1.386 - 0 = 1.386`.\n\nThis value is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
