    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at the specified points of the titration.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.**\n\nFirst, we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water.\n*   Initial volume of acid (V₁): 20.00 cm³\n*   Initial concentration of acid (M₁): 0.05 M\n*   Final volume after adding water (V₂): 20.00 cm³ + 20.00 cm³ = 40.00 cm³\n\nWe use the dilution formula M₁V₁ = M₂V₂ to find the new concentration (M₂):\n*   (0.05 M) × (20.00 cm³) = M₂ × (40.00 cm³)\n*   M₂ = (0.05 × 20.00) / 40.00\n*   M₂ = 0.025 M\n\nSo, we are titrating 40.00 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the pH at 25% titration.**\n\nAt 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been converted into its conjugate base, acetate (CH₃COO⁻), and 75% of the acetic acid remains. This is a buffer region, so we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A⁻] / [HA])\n\n1.  **Calculate pKa:**\n    *   Ka = 1.85 x 10⁻⁵\n    *   pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73\n\n2.  **Determine the ratio of conjugate base to acid:**\n    *   [A⁻] / [HA] = 25% / 75% = 1/3\n\n3.  **Calculate the pH:**\n    *   pH = 4.73 + log(1/3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - log(3)\n    *   pH = 4.73 - 0.477\n    *   pH ≈ 4.253, which rounds to **4.26**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH at the equivalence point.**\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The solution contains the conjugate base, CH₃COO⁻, which hydrolyzes water, making the solution basic.\n\n1.  **Find the moles of acetic acid initially present:**\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume (in L)\n    *   Moles = 0.025 mol/L × 0.04000 L = 0.001 mol CH₃COOH\n\n2.  **Find the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point:**\n    *   At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH = moles of CH₃COOH.\n    *   Volume of NaOH = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm³\n\n3.  **Find the total volume and concentration of acetate at the equivalence point:**\n    *   Total Volume = Initial acid volume + volume of NaOH added = 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L\n    *   The moles of acetate (CH₃COO⁻) formed is equal to the initial moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol.\n    *   Concentration of acetate [CH₃COO⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.05000 L = 0.02 M\n\n4.  **Calculate the pH of the 0.02 M acetate solution:**\n    *   The acetate ion reacts with water (hydrolysis): CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n    *   We need the base dissociation constant, Kb.\n        *   Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰\n    *   Set up an equilibrium expression: Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n        *   Let x = [OH⁻] = [CH₃COOH]\n        *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    *   Since Kb is very small, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.\n        *   5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰ = x² / 0.02\n        *   x² = (5.41 x 10⁻¹⁰) × 0.02 = 1.082 x 10⁻¹¹\n        *   x = [OH⁻] = √(1.082 x 10⁻¹¹) ≈ 3.29 x 10⁻⁶ M\n    *   Calculate pOH:\n        *   pOH = -log[OH⁻] = -log(3.29 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48\n    *   Calculate pH:\n        *   pH = 14.00 - pOH = 14.00 - 5.48 = **8.52**\n\nThe calculated values are pH = 4.26 at 25% titration and pH = 8.52 at the equivalence point.\n\n<<<D>>>"
