    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, we need to check two main criteria for each star:\n1.  **Location:** The star must be visible from both the Paranal Observatory (in Chile, Southern Hemisphere) and the Keck Observatory (in Hawaii, Northern Hemisphere).\n2.  **Brightness:** The star's apparent V magnitude must be brighter than the limit for *both* instruments.\n\n### **Step 1: Define the Observability Criteria**\n\n**Location:**\n*   Paranal Observatory is at a latitude of approximately 24° South. It can observe the entire southern celestial sphere and a portion of the northern one, up to a declination (DEC) of roughly +66°.\n*   Keck Observatory is at a latitude of approximately 20° North. It can observe the entire northern celestial sphere and a portion of the southern one, down to a declination of roughly -70°.\n*   Therefore, for a star to be visible from both observatories, its declination must be roughly between **-70° and +66°**.\n\n**Brightness:**\n*   ESPRESSO limit: Apparent V magnitude < 17 mag.\n*   HIRES limit: Apparent V magnitude < 16 mag.\n*   To be detected by *both*, a star must satisfy the stricter limit, meaning its apparent V magnitude must be **< 16 mag**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Each Star**\n\nWe will now apply these two criteria to each star. For stars where the absolute magnitude (M_V) is given, we will first calculate the apparent magnitude (V) using the formula:\nV = M_V + 5 * log₁₀(d/10pc) + A_V\nwhere d is the distance in parsecs (pc) and A_V is the interstellar absorption in the V band.\n\n---\n\n**Star 1**\n*   **Location:** DEC = -75°. This declination is too far south to be visible from the Keck Observatory (limit ≈ -70°).\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n**Star 2**\n*   **Location:** DEC = +55°. This is within the observable range for both observatories (-70° < +55° < +66°). Location is OK.\n*   **Brightness:** Apparent V magnitude = 16.5 mag. This does not meet the HIRES requirement of V < 16 mag.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n**Star 3**\n*   **Location:** DEC = +48°. This is within the observable range for both observatories (-70° < +48° < +66°). Location is OK.\n*   **Brightness:** Apparent V magnitude = 15.5 mag.\n    *   Is 15.5 < 16 (HIRES limit)? Yes.\n    *   Is 15.5 < 17 (ESPRESSO limit)? Yes.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Can be observed by both.**\n\n**Star 4**\n*   **Location:** DEC = -48°. This is within the observable range for both observatories (-70° < -48° < +66°). Location is OK.\n*   **Brightness:** We need to calculate the apparent magnitude.\n    *   M_V = 15.5 mag\n    *   d = 10 pc\n    *   A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag\n    *   V = 15.5 + 5 * log₁₀(10/10) + 1.24 = 15.5 + 0 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n    *   This does not meet the HIRES requirement of V < 16 mag.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n**Star 5**\n*   **Location:** DEC = +60°. This is within the observable range for both observatories (-70° < +60° < +66°). Location is OK.\n*   **Brightness:** We need to calculate the apparent magnitude.\n    *   M_V = 16.5 mag\n    *   d = 5 pc\n    *   A_V = 0 (not mentioned)\n    *   V = 16.5 + 5 * log₁₀(5/10) = 16.5 + 5 * log₁₀(0.5) = 16.5 + 5 * (-0.301) ≈ 16.5 - 1.5 = 15.0 mag.\n    *   Is 15.0 < 16 (HIRES limit)? Yes.\n    *   Is 15.0 < 17 (ESPRESSO limit)? Yes.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Can be observed by both.**\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe stars that meet the criteria for observation by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are Star 3 and Star 5.\n\n<<<A>>>"
