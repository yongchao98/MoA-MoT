    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Relating Observed Wavelength Shift to Stellar Velocity:**\n    The Radial Velocity (RV) method relies on the Doppler effect. The shift in wavelength (Δλ) of a spectral line is proportional to the star's radial velocity (v_r) relative to the observer. The maximum observed wavelength shift, Δλ_max, corresponds to the maximum radial velocity of the star as it orbits the system's barycenter. This maximum velocity is known as the velocity semi-amplitude, K.\n\n    The relationship is: Δλ_max / λ = K / c\n    where λ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line and c is the speed of light.\n    Since we are observing the same spectral line for both stars, λ is the same. Thus, the velocity semi-amplitude K is directly proportional to the maximum wavelength shift Δλ_max.\n    K ∝ Δλ_max\n\n    This means the ratio of the velocity semi-amplitudes for the two stars is:\n    K₂ / K₁ = Δλ_max₂ / Δλ_max₁ = 7 mÅ / 5 mÅ = 7/5\n\n2.  **Relating Stellar Velocity to Orbital Period:**\n    The velocity semi-amplitude K is determined by the properties of the star-planet system. For a planet in a circular orbit, the formula is:\n    K = ( (2πG) / P )^(1/3) * ( M_p * sin(i) / (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )\n    where:\n    *   P is the orbital period.\n    *   M_p is the planet's mass.\n    *   M_star is the star's mass.\n    *   i is the orbital inclination (the angle between our line of sight and the normal to the orbital plane).\n    *   G is the gravitational constant.\n\n    The term M_p * sin(i) is the \"minimum mass\" of the planet, which is what the RV method actually measures.\n\n3.  **Applying the Given Information:**\n    The problem states:\n    *   The stars have the same mass: M_star₁ = M_star₂.\n    *   The planets have similar masses: M_p₁ ≈ M_p₂. Since the RV method measures M_p * sin(i), it is standard to assume that this measured quantity is what is \"similar\" between the two systems, or that the inclinations are similar. So we can assume M_p₁ * sin(i₁) ≈ M_p₂ * sin(i₂).\n    *   Since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune vs. Sun), the (M_star + M_p) term is dominated by M_star.\n\n    Given these conditions, most terms in the formula for K are constant or the same for both systems. The relationship simplifies to:\n    K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n    This means that the velocity semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.\n\n4.  **Combining the Relationships and Solving for the Period Ratio:**\n    We have two key proportionalities:\n    *   K ∝ Δλ_max\n    *   K ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n    Combining them, we get:\n    Δλ_max ∝ P^(-1/3)\n\n    Now we can set up a ratio for our two planets:\n    Δλ_max₂ / Δλ_max₁ = (P₂)^(-1/3) / (P₁)^(-1/3) = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    We are given the values for Δλ_max, so we can substitute them:\n    7 / 5 = (P₁ / P₂)^(1/3)\n\n    To find the ratio of the periods, we first cube both sides of the equation:\n    (7 / 5)³ = P₁ / P₂\n    343 / 125 = P₁ / P₂\n    2.744 = P₁ / P₂\n\n    The question asks for \"How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?\", which is the ratio P₂ / P₁. We need to invert the result:\n    P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³ = 125 / 343\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    P₂ / P₁ ≈ 0.3644\n\n    This value matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
