    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the 1H NMR data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the Total Number of Protons:**\nFirst, let's sum the integrations from the 1H NMR data:\n1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons.\n\nNow, let's determine the number of protons in each of the possible compounds:\n*   Propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂): Has 8 protons.\n*   Butenyl acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂): Has 10 protons.\n\nSince the experimental data shows a total of 8 protons, we can immediately eliminate both **Cis-butenyl acetate (D)** and **Trans-butenyl acetate (B)**. This leaves us with Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n**2. Analyze the Chemical Shifts and Splitting Patterns:**\n\nLet's break down each signal:\n\n*   **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** A singlet integrating to 3 protons around 2 ppm is characteristic of an acetate methyl group (CH₃-C=O). The singlet multiplicity indicates it has no adjacent protons, which is consistent with this assignment.\n    *   Fragment: -O-C(=O)-CH₃\n\n*   **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz) & 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** These two signals are in the vinylic region (protons on a C=C double bond).\n    *   The key piece of information here is the coupling constant (J value) of **16.0 Hz** for the doublet at 7.0 ppm. For vinylic protons, the coupling constant is highly dependent on their stereochemistry:\n        *   **J_trans** (protons on opposite sides of the double bond) is typically large, around **12-18 Hz**.\n        *   **J_cis** (protons on the same side of the double bond) is smaller, around **6-12 Hz**.\n    *   The observed J value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates a **trans** relationship between the two vinylic protons. This rules out the *cis* isomer.\n\n*   **Let's confirm the remaining signals with the Trans-propenyl acetate structure:**\n    *   **Structure:**\n         \n    *   **Ha (7.0 ppm):** This proton is on a carbon attached to the electron-withdrawing oxygen atom, so it is highly deshielded (shifted downfield). It is coupled only to Hb, so it appears as a doublet. This matches the signal at 7.0 ppm (1H, d).\n    *   **Hb (5.5 ppm):** This proton is coupled to Ha (giving a doublet) and the three protons of the methyl group (Hc) (giving a quartet). Therefore, its signal is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. This matches the signal at 5.5 ppm.\n    *   **Hc (1.6 ppm):** This is the methyl group attached to the double bond. It is coupled to the single proton Hb, so it appears as a **doublet (d)**. This matches the signal at 1.6 ppm (3H, d).\n    *   **Hd (2.1 ppm):** This is the acetate methyl group. It has no adjacent protons, so it is a **singlet (s)**. This matches the signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe proton count (8H) eliminates the butenyl acetate options. The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) indicates a trans-alkene. All signals and splitting patterns perfectly match the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
