    "This is a problem of special relativity, specifically involving time dilation.\n\nHere's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Galaxy Frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame from which we want to measure the distance traveled.\n    *   **Ejecta Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame. The clock in this frame measures the proper time.\n\n2.  **List the Given Information:**\n    *   The relative velocity between the frames, **v** = 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's frame (the proper time), **Δt'** = 50 s.\n    *   The speed of light, **c** ≈ 300,000 km/s.\n\n3.  **Determine the Goal:**\n    *   We need to find the distance **d** traveled by the ejecta as measured in the Galaxy's frame (S). The formula for distance in this frame is:\n        d = v * Δt\n        where **Δt** is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (S).\n\n4.  **Apply Time Dilation:**\n    *   According to the theory of special relativity, time passes differently in frames that are in relative motion. An observer in the Galaxy frame (S) will measure a longer time interval (Δt) than the time interval measured in the moving ejecta's frame (Δt'). This phenomenon is called time dilation.\n    *   The formula for time dilation is:\n        Δt = γ * Δt'\n    *   Here, **γ** (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n        γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    *   First, find the ratio of the ejecta's speed to the speed of light:\n        v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n    *   Now, calculate γ:\n        γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.2)²)\n        γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.04)\n        γ = 1 / √(0.96)\n\n6.  **Calculate the Time in the Galaxy's Frame (Δt):**\n    *   Substitute the values into the time dilation formula:\n        Δt = (1 / √(0.96)) * 50 s\n        Δt ≈ (1 / 0.9798) * 50 s\n        Δt ≈ 51.03 s\n    *   This means that while 50 seconds pass for the ejecta, an observer in the Galaxy frame measures that about 51.03 seconds have passed.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame (d):**\n    *   Now use the distance formula with the time calculated for the Galaxy frame:\n        d = v * Δt\n        d = 60,000 km/s * (50 s / √(0.96))\n        d = 3,000,000 km / √(0.96)\n        d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798\n        d ≈ 3,061,862 km\n\n8.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   Our calculated distance is approximately 3,061,862 km.\n    *   The given options are:\n        A) 2,880,000 km\n        B) 2,940,000 km\n        C) 3,000,000 km (This would be the non-relativistic answer: 60,000 km/s * 50 s)\n        D) 3,060,000 km\n    *   The value 3,061,862 km is closest to option D. The small difference is due to rounding in the problem's options.\n\nTherefore, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame is approximately 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<D>>>"
