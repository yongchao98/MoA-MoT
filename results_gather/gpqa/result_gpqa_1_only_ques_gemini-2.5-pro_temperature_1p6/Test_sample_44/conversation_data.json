    "Here is the step-by-step calculation of the energies for the system.\n\n### 1. Single-Particle Energy Levels\n\nThe system consists of particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. The energy levels for a single particle in this well are given by:\n$E_n = n^2 \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$\nwhere n = 1, 2, 3, ... is the principal quantum number.\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$.\nSo, the single-particle energy levels can be expressed as:\n$E_n = n^2 E$\n\nThe first few energy levels are:\n*   $E_1 = 1^2 E = 1E$\n*   $E_2 = 2^2 E = 4E$\n*   $E_3 = 3^2 E = 9E$\n*   $E_4 = 4^2 E = 16E$\n*   ...and so on.\n\n### 2. Applying the Pauli Exclusion Principle\n\nThe particles are identical spin-1/2 particles, which means they are fermions. Fermions must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n\nFor a particle in this potential well, a quantum state is defined by its spatial quantum number 'n' and its spin quantum number 'ms' (which can be +1/2 for spin-up or -1/2 for spin-down). This means that each spatial energy level $E_n$ can hold a maximum of **two** particles: one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Ground State Energy (E_GS)\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the lowest available energy levels with the four particles, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\n*   **n=1 level (Energy = 1E):** We can place two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n*   **n=2 level (Energy = 4E):** We can place the remaining two particles here (one spin-up, one spin-down).\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\n$E_{GS} = (2 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2)$\n$E_{GS} = (2 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E)$\n$E_{GS} = 2E + 8E = 10E$\n\n### 4. Calculating the First Excited State Energy (E_1st)\n\nThe first excited state is the configuration with the lowest possible energy above the ground state. We achieve this by promoting one particle from the highest occupied energy level (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n\nThe new configuration is:\n*   **n=1 level (Energy = 1E):** 2 particles\n*   **n=2 level (Energy = 4E):** 1 particle\n*   **n=3 level (Energy = 9E):** 1 particle\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times E_1) + (1 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n$E_{1st} = (2 \\times 1E) + (1 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E)$\n$E_{1st} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E$\n\n### 5. Calculating the Second Excited State Energy (E_2nd)\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest energy. We need to consider the possible low-energy promotions from the ground state.\n*   **Ground State Energy:** 10E\n*   **First Excitation:** Promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3 gives an energy of 15E. (This is the first excited state).\n*   **Next Lowest Excitation:** We consider other ways to promote particles. Another possibility is to promote a particle from the n=1 level to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3).\n\nThe configuration for this next excited state is:\n*   **n=1 level (Energy = 1E):** 1 particle\n*   **n=2 level (Energy = 4E):** 2 particles\n*   **n=3 level (Energy = 9E):** 1 particle\n\nLet's check the energy of this state:\n$E_{2nd} = (1 \\times E_1) + (2 \\times E_2) + (1 \\times E_3)$\n$E_{2nd} = (1 \\times 1E) + (2 \\times 4E) + (1 \\times 9E)$\n$E_{2nd} = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E$\n\nThis energy (18E) is higher than the first excited state (15E) but lower than other possibilities (e.g., promoting two particles from n=2 to n=3, which would give $2E_1 + 2E_3 = 2E + 18E = 20E$). Therefore, 18E is the energy of the second excited state.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated energies are:\n*   Ground State: **10E**\n*   First Excited State: **15E**\n*   Second Excited State: **18E**\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
