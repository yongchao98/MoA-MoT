    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the final product structure.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br₂)**\nThis is the alpha-halogenation of a ketone. Cyclohexanone reacts with bromine to form 2-bromocyclohexanone. The bromine atom adds to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the α-carbon).\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Cyclohexanone\n*   **Reagent:** Br₂\n*   **Product 1:** 2-bromocyclohexanone\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH)**\nThis reaction involves an α-halo ketone treated with a strong base (NaOH). These are the classic conditions for the **Favorskii rearrangement**. The base removes the other α-proton (from C6) to form an enolate, which then undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction to displace the bromide, forming a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate. This intermediate is then attacked by hydroxide (OH⁻) at the carbonyl carbon. The resulting tetrahedral intermediate collapses, leading to the cleavage of the three-membered ring to form the most stable carbanion, which is then protonated. The overall result is a ring contraction. The six-membered ring of cyclohexanone becomes a five-membered ring with a carboxylic acid group.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 2-bromocyclohexanone (Product 1)\n*   **Reagent:** NaOH, heat\n*   **Product 2:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (after an implicit acidic workup, which is standard, or its sodium salt, sodium cyclopentanecarboxylate, which reacts similarly in the next step).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and pyridine**\nThis is a standard procedure to convert a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride. The hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by a chlorine atom (-Cl).\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (Product 2)\n*   **Reagents:** SOCl₂ and pyridine\n*   **Product 3:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃)**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride is a bulky, mild reducing agent. It is particularly effective at reducing acyl chlorides to aldehydes, stopping the reaction at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to the primary alcohol.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride (Product 3)\n*   **Reagent:** LiAlH(OtBu)₃\n*   **Product 4:** Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde\n\n**Analysis of Product 4: Cyclopentanecarbaldehyde**\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. \"Chemically distinct\" means the hydrogens are in non-equivalent chemical environments and would give separate signals in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde:\nIt consists of a five-membered cyclopentane ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached to one of the carbons.\n\n1.  **Symmetry:** The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group (C=O and H), the carbon it's attached to (C1), the hydrogen on C1, and bisects the C3-C4 bond.\n\n2.  **Counting the distinct hydrogens:**\n    *   **Aldehyde H:** The hydrogen attached to the carbonyl carbon (-C**H**O) is unique. It lies on the plane of symmetry. This is **1** type of hydrogen.\n    *   **C1-H:** The hydrogen on the carbon of the ring that is bonded to the aldehyde group is also unique. It also lies on the plane of symmetry. This is a **2nd** type of hydrogen.\n    *   **C2/C5-H:** Due to the plane of symmetry, the carbons C2 and C5 are chemically equivalent. Each of these carbons is a -CH₂- group. The two hydrogens on C2 are diastereotopic because one is *cis* to the aldehyde group and the other is *trans*. They are not chemically equivalent. The same applies to C5. The *cis*-hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the *cis*-hydrogen on C5, and the *trans*-hydrogen on C2 is equivalent to the *trans*-hydrogen on C5. This gives **2** more distinct types of hydrogens.\n    *   **C3/C4-H:** Similarly, the carbons C3 and C4 are chemically equivalent. The two hydrogens on C3 are diastereotopic due to their different spatial relationships with the aldehyde group on C1. The same applies to C4. The hydrogens on C3 are equivalent to the corresponding hydrogens on C4. This gives another **2** distinct types of hydrogens.\n\nIn summary, the distinct types of hydrogen atoms are:\n1.  The aldehyde proton (1H)\n2.  The proton on C1 (1H)\n3.  The two protons on C2/C5 that are *cis* to the aldehyde group (2H total)\n4.  The two protons on C2/C5 that are *trans* to the aldehyde group (2H total)\n5.  One set of corresponding protons on C3/C4 (2H total)\n6.  The other set of corresponding protons on C3/C4 (2H total)\n\nTotal number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n\n<<<D>>>"
