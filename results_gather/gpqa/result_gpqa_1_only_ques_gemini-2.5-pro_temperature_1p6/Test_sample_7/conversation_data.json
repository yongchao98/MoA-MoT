  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nB) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\nC) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nD) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>",

    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the genetic interactions based on the experimental results:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Single Mutants:**\n    *   The wild-type (WT) plant has 100% resistance.\n    *   `g1` mutant (75% resistance): The loss of gene G1 causes a partial loss of resistance (25% loss). This means G1 contributes to resistance but is not absolutely essential on its own.\n    *   `g2` mutant (0% resistance): The loss of gene G2 completely eliminates resistance. This indicates that G2 is an essential gene for this resistance pathway.\n    *   `g3` mutant (50% resistance): The loss of gene G3 causes a significant loss of resistance (50% loss), more than G1. It is important but also not solely responsible for the entire resistance.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Double Mutants (Epistasis Analysis):** Epistasis is a genetic interaction where one gene's mutation masks the effect of another gene's mutation. We determine which gene is epistatic by seeing which single-mutant phenotype the double-mutant resembles.\n    *   `g1g2` (0% resistance): The phenotype of the double mutant is identical to the `g2` single mutant (0%), not the `g1` mutant (75%). This means the `g2` mutation masks the `g1` mutation. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G1**.\n    *   `g2g3` (0% resistance): Similarly, the phenotype of this double mutant is identical to the `g2` single mutant (0%), not the `g3` mutant (50%). This means the `g2` mutation also masks the `g3` mutation. Therefore, **G2 is epistatic to G3**.\n    *   The fact that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, combined with the knowledge that one gene is a transcription factor (TF) acting upstream, strongly suggests **G2 is the transcription factor**. In a regulatory cascade, a mutation in the master regulator (the TF) will prevent the downstream genes (G1 and G3) from being expressed, leading to the most severe phenotype which cannot be rescued by the status of the other genes.\n\n3.  **Analyze the G1 and G3 Interaction:**\n    *   `g1` loss of resistance: 25%\n    *   `g3` loss of resistance: 50%\n    *   Expected additive loss for `g1g3`: 25% + 50% = 75% loss (i.e., 25% remaining resistance).\n    *   Observed resistance for `g1g3`: 10%, which is a 90% loss.\n    *   Since the observed effect in the double mutant (90% loss) is much greater than the sum of the individual effects (75% loss), this points to a synergistic interaction. This type of interaction, where two genes have overlapping functions and their combined loss is more severe than expected, is known as **gene redundancy** (or partial redundancy). G1 and G3 work in parallel, and both are needed for a high level of resistance.\n    *   Based on the `g1g3` data, there is no classic epistasis *between* G1 and G3, because the double mutant phenotype (10%) is different from both the `g1` (75%) and `g3` (50%) phenotypes.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** The first two statements (\"G2 is a transcription factor\" and \"G1 and G3 show gene redundancy\") are strongly supported by the data. The third statement (\"G1 is epistatic towards G3\") is incorrect, as the `g1g3` phenotype does not match the `g1` phenotype. However, this option is the most accurate overall.\n    *   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\" is incorrect. While having the same promoter is possible, it's a mechanistic speculation, not a direct conclusion like \"gene redundancy\".\n    *   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** \"Pleiotropy\" is the incorrect term. Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple unrelated traits, which is not what the data shows.\n    *   **D) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** \"G1 is a transcription factor\" is incorrect. The data points to G2 being the essential upstream regulator.\n\n**Conclusion:** Option A correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor and correctly describes the relationship between G1 and G3 as gene redundancy. Despite the inaccuracy of the final clause about epistasis between G1 and G3, it remains the best-fit answer because the other options contain more significant errors.\n\n<<<A>>>"
