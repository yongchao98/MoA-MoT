    "To determine the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene in high yield, we must analyze the directing effects of the substituents and the conditions required for each reaction.\n\nThe target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: an acetyl group (-COCH3), a bromo group (-Br), and a nitro group (-NO2) at positions 1, 3, and 5, respectively. This means all three groups are *meta* to each other.\n\nLet's evaluate the directing effects of these groups in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS):\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-directing.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** Weakly deactivating, *ortho, para*-directing.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** Strongly deactivating, *meta*-directing.\n\nA key reaction in many of these sequences is the Friedel-Crafts acylation (e.g., using CH3COCl/AlCl3). This reaction fails on rings that are moderately or strongly deactivated. This means it will not work if a nitro group (-NO2) or an acyl group is already on the ring (though acylation of acetophenone is possible, it's difficult).\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**B) i) Br2/FeBr3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   i) Benzene -> Bromobenzene.\n*   ii) Bromobenzene is *o,p*-directing. Nitration yields a mixture of 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene and 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene (major).\n*   iii) Friedel-Crafts acylation of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene will fail because the ring is strongly deactivated by the nitro group. So, **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n**D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   i) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Friedel-Crafts acylation of nitrobenzene fails because the ring is strongly deactivated. So, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n**C) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ...**\n*   i) Benzene -> Nitrobenzene.\n*   ii) Nitrobenzene is reduced to Aniline.\n*   iii) Friedel-Crafts acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) on aniline fails. The Lewis acid (AlCl3) reacts with the basic lone pair of the amino group, forming a positively charged anilinium complex (-NH3+), which is extremely deactivating and prevents the reaction on the ring. Even if this step intended N-acylation (forming acetanilide), the subsequent steps do not lead to the target molecule. (Acetanilide -> 4-bromoacetanilide -> 4-bromo-2-nitroacetanilide -> deamination -> m-bromonitrobenzene). This path does not introduce the required acetyl group on the ring. So, **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n**A) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2**\nThis sequence is more complex and appears to use a \"blocking/directing group\" strategy followed by its removal. Let's trace the steps:\n\n*   **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 -> Acetophenone.** This is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n*   **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 -> 3-Bromoacetophenone.** The acetyl group is a *meta*-director, so bromination occurs at the meta position.\n*   **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 3-Bromo-2-nitroacetophenone.** Here we have competing directors: -COCH3 (at C1, *meta*-directing) and -Br (at C3, *o,p*-directing). The -Br group directs to C2, C4, C6. The -COCH3 group directs to C5. Although the directors are in conflict, studies show that the major product of this reaction is the 2-nitro isomer (3-bromo-2-nitroacetophenone).\n*   **iv) 3-Bromo-2-nitroacetophenone + Fe/HCl -> 2-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone.** The nitro group is selectively reduced to an amino group.\n*   **v) 2-Amino-3-bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 -> 2-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone.** Now we nitrate again. In the strong acidic medium, the amino group is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+). The directing groups are: -COCH3 (C1, *meta*), -NH3+ (C2, *meta*), and -Br (C3, *o,p*). The -COCH3 group directs to C5. The -Br group also directs to C5 (*para* position). The -NH3+ group directs away from C5 (to C4, C6). Since two groups strongly favor position 5, nitration occurs there with high selectivity.\n*   **vi) 2-Amino-3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone + NaNO2/HCl -> Diazonium salt.** The primary amino group is converted into a diazonium salt.\n*   **vii) Diazonium salt + H3PO2 -> 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.** The diazonium group is removed and replaced by a hydrogen atom (deamination).\n\nThis entire sequence is chemically sound and each step is regioselective (or produces the desired isomer as the major product), leading to a high-yield synthesis of the target molecule. The sequence cleverly uses an amino group as a temporary directing group, which is then removed in the final step.\n\nTherefore, sequence A is the correct pathway.\n\n<<<A>>>"
