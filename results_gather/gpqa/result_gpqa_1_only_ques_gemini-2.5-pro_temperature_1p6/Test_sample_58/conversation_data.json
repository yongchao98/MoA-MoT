    "Here is the step-by-step determination of the pH of the final solution.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of all acidic and basic species.**\n\n*   **Moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):**\n    Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    Moles = Concentration × Volume = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.050 mol CH3COOH**\n\n*   **Moles of H+ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    HCl is a strong acid and dissociates completely (HCl → H+ + Cl-).\n    Volume = 400 mL = 0.400 L\n    Moles of H+ = Concentration × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = **0.080 mol H+**\n\n*   **Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (strong base):**\n    Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and dissociates completely, producing two moles of OH- for every mole of Ba(OH)2 (Ba(OH)2 → Ba2+ + 2OH-).\n    Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n    Moles of OH- = 2 × Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 2 × 0.090 mol = **0.180 mol OH-**\n\n**Step 2: Perform the neutralization reactions.**\n\nIt's best to react the strong acid and strong base first, and then react any remainder with the weak species.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: Strong Acid vs. Strong Base (HCl vs. Ba(OH)2)**\n    The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.\n    Initial moles of H+ (from HCl) = 0.080 mol\n    Initial moles of OH- = 0.180 mol\n    The H+ is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed.\n    Moles of OH- remaining = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = **0.100 mol OH-**\n\n*   **Reaction 2: Remaining Strong Base vs. Weak Acid (OH- vs. CH3COOH)**\n    The reaction is CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O.\n    Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n    Moles of OH- available for this reaction = 0.100 mol\n    The CH3COOH is the limiting reactant. It will be completely consumed by the excess strong base.\n    Moles of OH- remaining = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = **0.050 mol OH-**\n    This is the final amount of excess strong base in the solution.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the concentration of the excess OH- ions.**\n\nFirst, find the total volume of the final solution.\n*   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.200 L**\n\nNow, calculate the molar concentration of the excess OH- ions.\n*   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n*   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.200 L = **0.04167 M**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the pOH and then the pH.**\n\nThe pH of the solution is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base. The contribution from the hydrolysis of the conjugate base (CH3COO-) formed is negligible in the presence of a much larger concentration of OH- from the strong base.\n\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    pOH = -log[OH-]\n    pOH = -log(0.04167)\n    pOH ≈ **1.38**\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    At 25°C, pH + pOH = 14.\n    pH = 14 - pOH\n    pH = 14 - 1.38\n    pH = **12.62**\n\nThe final pH of the solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>"
