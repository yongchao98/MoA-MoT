    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Chemistry**\n\nThe dissolution of the sparingly soluble iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, is enhanced by the addition of a strong acid. The acid neutralizes the hydroxide ions (OH⁻), driving the dissolution equilibrium to the right. The overall reaction is:\n\nFe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺(aq) → Fe³⁺(aq) + 3H₂O(l)\n\nThe minimum amount of acid required is the amount that will just manage to dissolve all the solid. This occurs when the ion product of the species in solution is equal to the solubility product constant (Ksp) for Fe(OH)₃.\n\nFe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\nKsp = [Fe³⁺][OH⁻]³\n\nThe total amount of H⁺ added from the strong acid serves two purposes:\n1.  To react stoichiometrically with the Fe(OH)₃.\n2.  To remain in the solution as \"excess\" H⁺, establishing the final acidic pH required to keep the Fe(OH)₃ dissolved.\n\nWe will ignore the hydrolysis of the Fe³⁺ ion in the final H⁺ balance, as is common for this type of problem. The final pH itself is what accounts for preventing re-precipitation.\n\n**2. Calculate Moles of Fe(OH)₃**\n\n*   Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.845 + 3 * (15.999 + 1.008) ≈ 106.87 g/mol\n*   Mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g\n*   Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = Mass / Molar Mass = 0.1 g / 106.87 g/mol = 9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n**3. Calculate Moles of H⁺ Required for Reaction**\n\nFrom the stoichiometry of the overall reaction (Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺), 3 moles of H⁺ are required for every 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃.\n\n*   Moles of H⁺ for reaction (n_react) = 3 * Moles of Fe(OH)₃\n*   n_react = 3 * (9.357 x 10⁻⁴ mol) = 2.807 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n**4. Test the Options**\n\nSince we don't know the Ksp value intended for this problem, we cannot directly calculate the final pH and volume. Instead, we can test each multiple-choice option to see which one is consistent with the chemical principles. We will calculate the required volume of acid based on the pH given in the option and see if it matches the volume given in that same option.\n\nLet's test Option B: pH = 2.69; V_acid = 30.09 cm³\n\n*   **Step 4a: Calculate moles of H⁺ remaining in solution (n_final) from the given pH.**\n    *   pH = 2.69\n    *   [H⁺]_final = 10⁻ᵖᴴ = 10⁻².⁶⁹ M ≈ 2.042 x 10⁻³ M\n    *   The total volume of the solution is 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.\n    *   n_final = [H⁺]_final * V_total = (2.042 x 10⁻³ mol/L) * (0.1 L) = 2.042 x 10⁻⁴ mol\n\n*   **Step 4b: Calculate the total moles of H⁺ that must be added.**\n    *   Total H⁺ needed (n_total) = n_react + n_final\n    *   n_total = (2.807 x 10⁻³) + (2.042 x 10⁻⁴) = 3.0112 x 10⁻³ mol\n\n*   **Step 4c: Calculate the required volume of 0.1 M strong acid.**\n    *   Concentration of acid (C_acid) = 0.1 M = 0.1 mol/L\n    *   Volume = Total Moles / Concentration\n    *   V_acid = (3.0112 x 10⁻³ mol) / (0.1 mol/L) = 0.030112 L\n    *   Converting to cm³: V_acid = 0.030112 L * 1000 cm³/L = 30.11 cm³\n\n*   **Step 4d: Compare the calculated volume with the volume in the option.**\n    *   Calculated Volume = 30.11 cm³\n    *   Volume in Option B = 30.09 cm³\n    *   These values are extremely close. The minor difference is due to rounding of molar masses or constants.\n\nThis consistency check shows that option B provides the correct pair of values for pH and volume. For completeness, testing the other options would show significant mismatches between the calculated volume and the given volume. For instance, for option A, the calculated volume is ~37.2 cm³, which does not match the given 28.05 cm³.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe minimum volume of the 0.1 M strong acid needed is 30.09 cm³, and the pH of the resulting solution is 2.69.\n\n<<<B>>>"
