    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic to solve this chemistry riddle:\n\n1.  **Identify Substance B and Gas W:**\n    *   The prompt states that the melting point of substance B is very close to 277 K (277 - 273.15 = 3.85 °C).\n    *   The melting point of normal water (H₂O) is 0 °C (273.15 K).\n    *   The melting point of heavy water (D₂O, where D is the isotope Deuterium, ²H) is 3.82 °C (276.97 K). This is a perfect match. Therefore, **B is heavy water (D₂O)**.\n    *   The reaction releases a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of protons and neutrons. Let's analyze some small gas molecules:\n        *   H₂ (Hydrogen): 2 protons, 0 neutrons.\n        *   N₂ (Nitrogen): 14 protons, 14 neutrons.\n        *   O₂ (Oxygen): 16 protons, 16 neutrons.\n        *   CO (Carbon Monoxide): 14 protons, 14 neutrons.\n        *   D₂ (Deuterium gas): 2 protons (one from each D), 2 neutrons (one from each D).\n    *   Since Substance X contains a heavier isotope and the reaction involves D₂O, the most logical gas produced is D₂. Therefore, **W is Deuterium gas (D₂)**.\n\n2.  **Identify Substance X:**\n    *   Substance X contains a heavier isotope (Deuterium, D).\n    *   It reacts violently with a liquid (Y) to produce D₂ gas and a precipitate (G). To produce D₂ gas, both X and Y must be sources of deuterium. Therefore, the liquid Y must be D₂O (heavy water).\n    *   The reaction is: X + D₂O → G (precipitate) + D₂ (gas). This is characteristic of a metal deuteride or a complex metal deuteride reacting with heavy water.\n    *   The precipitate G releases B (D₂O) upon heating. This means G is a deuterated metal hydroxide, which decomposes to a metal oxide and D₂O. For G to be a precipitate, the metal hydroxide must be insoluble. Aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)₃) is a well-known gelatinous precipitate.\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that X is a complex aluminum deuteride, such as Lithium Aluminum Deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n        *   **Reaction:** LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD(aq) + Al(OD)₃(s) + 4D₂(g).\n        *   This reaction is notoriously violent. (Matches)\n        *   It produces D₂ gas (W). (Matches)\n        *   It produces a precipitate, Aluminum deuteroxide (G = Al(OD)₃). (Matches)\n        *   Heating G (Al(OD)₃) would yield Al₂O₃ and D₂O (B). (Matches: 2Al(OD)₃ → Al₂O₃ + 3D₂O).\n\n3.  **Confirm with the final clues:**\n    *   \"The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\" A keto acid contains both a ketone (>C=O) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. A strong reducing agent like LiAlD₄ would reduce both groups to alcohols, resulting in a diol (a molecule with two -OH groups, hence 2 oxygen atoms). This confirms X is a powerful reducing agent like LiAlD₄.\n    *   \"The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.\" X is LiAlD₄. Its \"very close analog\" is Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄), which is one of the most common and powerful reducing agents in organic chemistry. LiAlD₄ is used specifically for introducing deuterium into molecules.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** All clues point to **Substance X being LiAlD₄**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the final answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the **lightest** and **heaviest** elements present within Substance X (LiAlD₄).\n    *   The elements in LiAlD₄ are Lithium (Li, Z=3), Aluminum (Al, Z=13), and Hydrogen (H, Z=1, present as the isotope Deuterium, D).\n    *   The lightest element (by atomic number) is Hydrogen.\n    *   The heaviest element (by atomic number) is Aluminum.\n    *   We need to sum the masses of all atoms of these two elements in the formula LiAlD₄. We use the integer mass numbers for the specific isotopes involved.\n    *   The mass of Deuterium (D, or ²H) is 2 amu. There are 4 D atoms. Total mass = 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   The mass of the most stable isotope of Aluminum (²⁷Al) is 27 amu. There is 1 Al atom. Total mass = 1 × 27 = 27.\n    *   Cumulative sum = (Mass of 4 D atoms) + (Mass of 1 Al atom) = 8 + 27 = 35.\n\n<<<A>>>"
