    "This is a common piece of slang in a synthetic chemistry lab. The phrase \"on top of each other\" almost always refers to the results of a chromatography experiment, most commonly thin-layer chromatography (TLC).\n\nIn TLC, a mixture of compounds is spotted on a plate coated with silica gel (a very polar stationary phase). The plate is then placed in a solvent (the mobile phase), which travels up the plate by capillary action, carrying the compounds with it.\n\nCompounds separate based on their polarity. More polar compounds \"stick\" more strongly to the polar silica gel and travel a shorter distance. Less polar compounds interact less with the silica gel and are carried further up the plate by the solvent. The result is a series of separated spots.\n\nIf two compounds have very similar polarities, they will travel at nearly the same rate up the TLC plate. This results in their spots being very close together or even overlapping completely. Visually, they look like they are \"on top of each other.\" This indicates that separating them by column chromatography (which works on the same principle) will be very difficult or impossible.\n\nTherefore, the chemist is lamenting that their desired product and a contaminant (like the starting material or a byproduct) have very similar polarities, making purification a challenge.\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on this understanding:\n*   A) The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations. Optical rotation is a physical property used for characterization, not separation. This is incorrect.\n*   B) The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points. This would be a problem for separation by distillation, but the phrase \"on top of each other\" is much more specific to the visual result of chromatography.\n*   C) The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions. While these forces are the basis of polarity, the phrase refers to the *result* of a failed separation, not the direct interaction between the compounds themselves.\n*   D) The compounds they are working with have similar polarities. This is the direct cause of poor separation in chromatography, which is what the phrase \"on top of each other\" refers to.\n\n<<<D>>>"
