    "To determine which mutation will most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to analyze how each change affects the protein that will be synthesized from the gene. The goal is to find a mutation that creates a non-functional protein. We do this by translating the DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence, starting from the start codon `ATG`. The sequence is read in triplets, called codons.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Intact Gene:**\n    *   Sequence: 5’-**ATG**-**TTT**-**CTC**-**GCT**-GGT-ACT-…-TGA-3’\n    *   Translation: The first few codons translate to:\n        *   `ATG`: Methionine (Start codon)\n        *   `TTT`: Phenylalanine\n        *   `CTC`: Leucine\n        *   `GCT`: Alanine\n    *   The resulting protein starts with: Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-... This protein is responsible for creating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Mutant:**\n\n    *   **Mutant 1:**\n        *   Sequence: 5’-**ATG**-**TTC**-**TAC**-**GCT**-GGT-ACT-...TGA-3’\n        *   Change: The original `TTT CTC` has been changed to `TTC TAC`.\n        *   Translation:\n            *   `ATG`: Methionine (Met)\n            *   `TTC`: Phenylalanine (Phe). This is a *silent mutation* as `TTT` and `TTC` both code for Phenylalanine.\n            *   `TAC`: Tyrosine (Tyr). The original `CTC` (Leucine) has been changed to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a *missense mutation*.\n        *   Effect: The protein sequence is changed from Met-Phe-**Leu**-Ala-... to Met-Phe-**Tyr**-Ala-... This changes only one amino acid. While this could potentially inactivate the protein, it might also have little to no effect. It is not the most reliable way to eliminate function.\n\n    *   **Mutant 2:**\n        *   Sequence: 5’-**ATG**-**TTC**-**TAA**-**GCT**-GGT-ACT-...TGA-3’\n        *   Change: The original `TTT CTC` has been changed to `TTC TAA`.\n        *   Translation:\n            *   `ATG`: Methionine (Met)\n            *   `TTC`: Phenylalanine (Phe)\n            *   `TAA`: **STOP codon**. `TAA`, `TAG`, and `TGA` are stop codons that terminate translation.\n        *   Effect: This is a *nonsense mutation*. The cell's machinery will read Met, then Phe, and then encounter a stop signal. Translation will halt, producing only a tiny, two-amino-acid peptide (Met-Phe). A protein this short is guaranteed to be non-functional. This is a very strong candidate for eliminating the compound.\n\n    *   **Mutant 3:**\n        *   Sequence: 5’-ATGTTT**T**ACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n        *   Change: Comparing to the intact gene, an extra `T` has been inserted after the second codon (`TTT`).\n        *   Original: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...`\n        *   Mutant: `ATG TTT T AC GCT GGT...` -> `ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT...`\n        *   Effect: This insertion of a single base causes a *frameshift mutation*. The entire three-base reading frame is shifted from this point forward. The sequence of amino acids after the insertion will be completely different from the original, and a premature stop codon is likely to be encountered shortly downstream. This also almost certainly results in a non-functional protein.\n\n    *   **Mutant 4:**\n        *   Sequence: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCT--ACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n        *   Change: Comparing to the intact gene, it appears the codon `GGT` has been deleted.\n        *   Original: `ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...`\n        *   Mutant: `ATG TTT CTC GCT --- ACT...`\n        *   Effect: This is a deletion of three bases, which corresponds to one full codon. This is an *in-frame deletion*. The protein will be produced but will be missing the amino acid Glycine at position 5. While this might affect the protein's function, the rest of the protein is unchanged, so there's a chance it could still be functional.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth the nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) and the frameshift mutation (Mutant 3) are very likely to create a non-functional protein and thus eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. However, the nonsense mutation in Mutant 2 introduces a stop codon at the very beginning of the gene (the third codon). This leads to the production of an extremely short and unequivocally non-functional dipeptide. This is the most certain and direct way among the given options to ensure the gene is knocked out.\n\n<<<C>>>"
