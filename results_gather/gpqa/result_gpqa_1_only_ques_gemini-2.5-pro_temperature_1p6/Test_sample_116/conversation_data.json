    "To determine which of the given compounds show optical isomerism, we need to identify which ones are chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common reasons for chirality are the presence of a chiral center (an atom bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality (due to restricted rotation, as seen in some biphenyls).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**\n    *   This is a substituted biphenyl compound. Biphenyls can exhibit a special type of stereoisomerism called **atropisomersm**, which is a form of axial chirality.\n    *   This occurs when there is a significant energy barrier to rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings. This barrier is created by bulky groups at the *ortho* positions (positions 2, 2', 6, and 6').\n    *   In this molecule, all four *ortho* positions are substituted: two nitro groups (-NO2) at positions 6 and 6', and two dimethyl carboxylate groups (-COOCH3) at positions 2 and 2'. These groups are bulky enough to prevent free rotation.\n    *   Because rotation is restricted, the molecule is forced into a twisted, non-planar conformation. This conformation lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, making it chiral. Its mirror image is a non-superimposable enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n    *   This molecule is an ester commonly known as methyl lactate. Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the central carbon atom (carbon-2), which is bonded to the hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    *   This carbon atom is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n        2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n        4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   A carbon atom bonded to four different groups is a **chiral center** (or stereocenter). Molecules with a single chiral center are always chiral.\n    *   Therefore, this compound exists as a pair of enantiomers and shows optical isomerism.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**\n    *   The structure of benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂C=O. It is a symmetrical ketone with two phenyl groups attached to a carbonyl carbon.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the C=O bond and the angle between the two phenyl rings.\n    *   It has no chiral centers.\n    *   Due to the presence of a plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral and superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**\n    *   This is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid.\n    *   The structure is a planar molecule with a carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   The molecule is symmetrical. It possesses a **center of inversion** (a point of symmetry in the middle of the C=C double bond) and a **plane of symmetry** (the plane of the molecule itself).\n    *   Any molecule with a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism. (Note: It does show geometric isomerism with its *cis*-isomer, dimethyl maleate).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nCompounds 1 and 2 are chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism. Compounds 3 and 4 are achiral and will not. Thus, the correct option includes only 1 and 2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
