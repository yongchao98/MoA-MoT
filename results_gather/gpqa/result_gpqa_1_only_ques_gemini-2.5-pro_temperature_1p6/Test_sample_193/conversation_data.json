    "Here is the step-by-step derivation of the partition function.\n\n**1. Understand the System and its States**\nThe system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can take a value of +1 or -1. This means there are a total of $2^3 = 8$ possible configurations (microstates) for the system.\n\nThe energy of any given state is defined by the Hamiltonian:\nE = -J[ S1*S2 + S1*S3 + S2*S3 ]\n\n**2. List all Possible States and Calculate their Energies**\nWe need to list all 8 possible microstates and compute the energy for each one. Let's denote a state by the triplet (S1, S2, S3).\n\n*   **Case 1: All spins are aligned.**\n    *   State 1: (+1, +1, +1)\n        E1 = -J[ (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) ] = -J[ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = **-3J**\n    *   State 2: (-1, -1, -1)\n        E2 = -J[ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J[ 1 + 1 + 1 ] = **-3J**\n\n*   **Case 2: Two spins are aligned, one is anti-aligned.**\n    *   Let's consider two spins up (+1) and one spin down (-1). There are three such states:\n        *   State 3: (+1, +1, -1)\n            E3 = -J[ (+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) ] = -J[ 1 - 1 - 1 ] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n        *   State 4: (+1, -1, +1)\n            E4 = -J[ (+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) ] = -J[ -1 + 1 - 1 ] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n        *   State 5: (-1, +1, +1)\n            E5 = -J[ (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) ] = -J[ -1 - 1 + 1 ] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n    *   Let's consider one spin up (+1) and two spins down (-1). There are three such states:\n        *   State 6: (+1, -1, -1)\n            E6 = -J[ (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) ] = -J[ -1 - 1 + 1 ] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n        *   State 7: (-1, +1, -1)\n            E7 = -J[ (-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) ] = -J[ -1 + 1 - 1 ] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n        *   State 8: (-1, -1, +1)\n            E8 = -J[ (-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) ] = -J[ 1 - 1 - 1 ] = -J[-1] = **+J**\n\n**3. Summarize Energy Levels and their Degeneracies**\nWe have found two distinct energy levels:\n*   Energy E_1 = -3J. This energy level has a degeneracy (number of states) g_1 = 2.\n*   Energy E_2 = +J. This energy level has a degeneracy g_2 = 6.\n\nThe total number of states is g_1 + g_2 = 2 + 6 = 8, which is correct.\n\n**4. Calculate the Partition Function (Z)**\nThe partition function Z is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all possible states. It can be written as:\nZ = Σ_i g_i * e^(-βE_i)\nwhere the sum is over the unique energy levels, g_i is the degeneracy of the energy level E_i, and β = 1/(kT).\n\nSubstituting the values we found:\nZ = g_1 * e^(-βE_1) + g_2 * e^(-βE_2)\nZ = 2 * e^(-β(-3J)) + 6 * e^(-β(+J))\nZ = 2e^(3Jβ) + 6e^(-Jβ)\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
