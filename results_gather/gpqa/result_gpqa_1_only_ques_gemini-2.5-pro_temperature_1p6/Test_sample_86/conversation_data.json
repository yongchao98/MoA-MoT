    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Determine the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   **Parent Structure:** The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, which is a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents.\n    *   **Total Carbons:** The molecule contains 8 carbon atoms in total. The benzene ring accounts for 6 carbons, so the two substituents must contain a total of 2 carbons.\n    *   **Functional Groups:** The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X). This means one substituent is a halogen atom (e.g., -Cl, -Br) attached directly to the ring, and the other substituent contains the C=O group and the remaining two carbon atoms.\n    *   **Identify Substituents:**\n        *   Substituent 1: A halogen (-X).\n        *   Substituent 2: Must contain 2 carbons and a C=O group. The most common and stable group that fits this description is an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n    *   **Putting it together:** The compound is a haloacetophenone. The molecular formula is C8H7XO.\n\n2.  **Consider Isomers and Predict the 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The two substituents (-X and -COCH3) can be arranged in ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions on the benzene ring.\n    *   **Protons to expect:** The molecule has 4 protons on the aromatic ring and 3 protons on the methyl group of the acetyl function. Total protons = 7H.\n    *   **Signal Predictions:**\n        *   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** The three methyl protons are not adjacent to any other protons, so they will appear as a **singlet (s)**. Due to the deshielding effect of the carbonyl group, this signal will be around **2.2-2.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Aromatic protons (Ar-H):** There are 4 such protons. Their splitting pattern depends on the substitution pattern:\n            *   *ortho* and *meta* isomers would produce complex, overlapping multiplets because of the lack of symmetry.\n            *   *para* (1,4-disubstituted) isomer is highly symmetrical. This symmetry results in a simple and characteristic pattern. The 4 aromatic protons are chemically divided into two sets of two equivalent protons. This leads to **two doublets (d)** in the aromatic region (typically 7.0-8.0 ppm), with each doublet integrating to 2H. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing acetyl group will be further downfield (higher ppm value) than the protons ortho to the halogen.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Given Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum lacks any signals in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm). This is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde (-CHO), not a methyl ketone (-COCH3). This describes a different molecule.\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   **Integration:** 2H + 2H + 3H = 7H. This matches the expected number of protons.\n        *   **Signals:**\n            *   `7.8 (2H, d)` and `7.6 (2H, d)`: This is the classic pattern for a para-substituted benzene ring.\n            *   `2.3 (3H, s)`: This is a singlet for 3 protons, consistent with a methyl group. Its chemical shift is in the expected range for an acetyl group (-COCH3).\n        *   This data perfectly matches the predicted spectrum for a **para-haloacetophenone**.\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum is inconsistent with an aromatic structure like haloacetophenone. The number of aromatic protons and their splitting pattern is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe provided information points to a para-haloacetophenone. Option C is the only one that presents a 1H NMR spectrum consistent with this structure, showing two doublets for the para-substituted aromatic ring and a singlet for the acetyl methyl group.\n\n<<<C>>>"
