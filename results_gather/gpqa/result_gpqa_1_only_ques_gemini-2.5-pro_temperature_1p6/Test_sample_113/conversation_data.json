    "The user wants me to identify the reagents A and B for two separate chemical reactions.\n\n**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** This reaction starts with a ketone (butan-2-one) and adds a cyanide group (-CN) and a hydroxyl group (-OH) across the carbonyl double bond. This is a classic **cyanohydrin formation**.\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:**\n    *   The cyanide ion (CN⁻), from the dissociation of NaCN, is a strong nucleophile. It attacks the electrophilic carbon of the carbonyl group in butan-2-one.\n    *   This nucleophilic attack breaks the C=O pi bond and forms an alkoxide intermediate: CH₃C(O⁻)(CN)CH₂CH₃.\n    *   To get the final product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, this negatively charged oxygen atom must be protonated (gain a H⁺).\n3.  **Determine Reagent A:** Reagent A must be a source of protons (H⁺).\n    *   `H₃O⁺` (hydronium ion) represents an acidic solution (e.g., dilute HCl or H₂SO₄), which is a standard source of protons to complete the reaction by protonating the alkoxide intermediate. This step is often done as an acidic workup after the initial addition of cyanide.\n    *   `NaHSO₃` (sodium bisulfite) undergoes a different reaction with ketones (bisulfite addition) and is not the correct reagent to complete the cyanohydrin formation.\n    *   Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** The starting material has a nitrile group (-C≡N) and the product has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is a **nitrile hydrolysis**. The reaction is performed in the presence of water (H₂O).\n2.  **Analyze the mechanism:** The conversion of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid requires harsh conditions, either strong acid or strong base catalysis, usually with heating.\n3.  **Determine Reagent B:** Reagent B acts as the catalyst for the hydrolysis.\n    *   `HCl` (hydrochloric acid) is a strong acid. Heating a nitrile with aqueous strong acid is a standard and effective method for hydrolysis. The nitrile is converted first to an amide intermediate, which is then further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid.\n    *   `CH₃COOH` (acetic acid) is a weak acid. It is generally not strong enough to effectively catalyze the complete hydrolysis of a stable nitrile to a carboxylic acid.\n    *   Therefore, **B = HCl**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Reagent A is **H₃O⁺**.\n*   Reagent B is **HCl**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
