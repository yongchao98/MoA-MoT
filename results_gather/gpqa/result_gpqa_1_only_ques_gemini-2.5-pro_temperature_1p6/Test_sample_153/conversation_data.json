    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M⁺) is at m/z = 156. This represents the molecular weight of the molecule with the most common isotopes.\n*   There is a significant peak at m/z = 158 (M⁺+2) with a relative abundance of about 32% compared to the M⁺ peak (100%). This 3:1 ratio (100:32) is a characteristic isotopic pattern for a compound containing **one chlorine atom** (³⁵Cl:³⁷Cl ratio is approximately 75:25 or 3:1).\n*   Let's check the molecular weights of the options with ³⁵Cl:\n    *   The molecular formula for all four options (A, B, C, D) is C₇H₅ClO₂.\n    *   Molecular Weight = (7 × 12) + (5 × 1) + (1 × 35) + (2 × 16) = 84 + 5 + 35 + 32 = 156 g/mol.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** All four compounds have the correct molecular weight and contain one chlorine atom, so all are consistent with the mass spectrometry data.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   A **very broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹** is the classic signature of an O-H stretch in a **carboxylic acid**. The extreme broadness is due to hydrogen bonding dimerization.\n*   A **strong, sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a C=O (carbonyl) stretch. This frequency is right in the range for a conjugated carboxylic acid.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The combination of these two peaks strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH). This allows us to eliminate options A and D.\n    *   A) Phenyl chloroformate is an acyl chloride/ester, which lacks the O-H group and would show a C=O stretch at a higher frequency (around 1780 cm⁻¹).\n    *   D) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde has an aldehyde C=O and a phenolic O-H. A phenolic O-H is typically broad but usually not as broad as a carboxylic acid's O-H (it wouldn't extend down to 2700 cm⁻¹).\n    *   This leaves **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** and **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** as the most likely candidates.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A singlet integrating to one proton at a very downfield chemical shift (>10 ppm). This is the characteristic signal for the acidic proton of a **carboxylic acid**. This further confirms our conclusion from the IR data.\n*   The remaining signals are in the aromatic region (7-8.5 ppm). We see two distinct signals:\n    *   **8.02 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet integrating to two protons.\n    *   **7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** A doublet integrating to two protons.\n*   This pattern of two doublets, each representing two protons, is a classic fingerprint for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The symmetry of a para-substituted ring makes the protons at positions 2 and 6 equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 equivalent.\n    *   **Let's check our remaining candidates:**\n        *   **B) 2-chlorobenzoic acid** is ortho-substituted. It has four unique aromatic protons, so it would show four different signals (or a complex multiplet) in the aromatic region, each integrating to 1H. This does not match the observed spectrum.\n        *   **C) 4-chlorobenzoic acid** is para-substituted. This structure has a plane of symmetry, leading to two sets of equivalent protons in the aromatic ring, exactly as observed. The protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxyl group are deshielded and appear as a 2H doublet (at 8.02 ppm), while the protons ortho to the chlorine atom appear as another 2H doublet (at 7.72 ppm). This structure perfectly matches the ¹H NMR data.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBased on the combined evidence from MS, IR, and especially the distinct ¹H NMR pattern, the unknown compound is **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
