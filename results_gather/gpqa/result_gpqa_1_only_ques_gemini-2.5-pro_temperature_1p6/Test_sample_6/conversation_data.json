    "This problem asks for the threshold energy of a high-energy gamma-ray ($\\gamma$) that can interact with a photon from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to produce an electron-positron pair ($e^+e^-$). The process is called pair production:\n\n$\\gamma_{HE} + \\gamma_{CMB} \\rightarrow e^+ + e^-$\n\nTo solve this, we will use the principles of special relativity, specifically the conservation of four-momentum and the Lorentz invariance of the squared four-momentum.\n\n1.  **Four-Momentum Conservation:**\n    Let the four-momenta of the high-energy gamma-ray, the CMB photon, the electron, and the positron be $p_{HE}$, $p_{CMB}$, $p_{e^-}$, and $p_{e^+}$, respectively. The conservation of four-momentum states:\n    $p_{HE} + p_{CMB} = p_{e^-} + p_{e^+}$\n\n2.  **Invariant Mass:**\n    The square of the total four-momentum, known as the Mandelstam variable $s$, is a Lorentz invariant. We can calculate it in both the lab frame (before the collision) and the center-of-mass (CM) frame (after the collision).\n    $s = (p_{HE} + p_{CMB})^2 = (p_{e^-} + p_{e^+})^2$\n\n3.  **Threshold Condition in the CM frame:**\n    The threshold energy is the minimum energy required for the reaction to occur. At this threshold, the electron and positron are created with zero kinetic energy in the CM frame; they are produced at rest.\n    In the CM frame, the four-momentum of the electron is $(m_e c^2, \\vec{0})$ and for the positron is $(m_e c^2, \\vec{0})$. The total four-momentum of the final state is $(2m_e c^2, \\vec{0})$.\n    So, the invariant squared mass at threshold is:\n    $s = (p_{e^-} + p_{e^+})^2 = (2m_e c^2)^2 = 4(m_e c^2)^2$\n\n4.  **Threshold Condition in the Lab frame:**\n    Now we calculate $s$ in the lab frame.\n    $s = (p_{HE} + p_{CMB})^2 = p_{HE}^2 + p_{CMB}^2 + 2 p_{HE} \\cdot p_{CMB}$\n    For photons, which are massless, the square of the four-momentum is zero ($p^2 = E^2 - (|\\vec{p}|c)^2 = 0$). So, $p_{HE}^2 = 0$ and $p_{CMB}^2 = 0$.\n    The expression simplifies to:\n    $s = 2 p_{HE} \\cdot p_{CMB}$\n    The dot product of the two four-momenta is $p_{HE} \\cdot p_{CMB} = E_{HE} E_{CMB} - \\vec{p}_{HE} \\cdot \\vec{p}_{CMB}$. Since photons travel at the speed of light $c$, we have $|\\vec{p}| = E/c$.\n    $p_{HE} \\cdot p_{CMB} = E_{HE} E_{CMB} - |\\vec{p}_{HE}||\\vec{p}_{CMB}|\\cos\\theta = E_{HE} E_{CMB} (1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    where $\\theta$ is the angle between the directions of the two photons.\n    So, $s = 2 E_{HE} E_{CMB} (1 - \\cos\\theta)$.\n\n5.  **Finding the Threshold Energy:**\n    Equating the expressions for $s$ from the CM and lab frames:\n    $4(m_e c^2)^2 = 2 E_{HE} E_{CMB} (1 - \\cos\\theta)$\n    Solving for the high-energy photon's energy $E_{HE}$:\n    $E_{HE} = \\frac{2(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB} (1 - \\cos\\theta)}$\n    The threshold energy ($E_{th}$) is the *minimum* possible value for $E_{HE}$. This occurs when the denominator is maximized. The term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is maximum when $\\cos\\theta = -1$, which corresponds to $\\theta = 180^\\circ$. This represents a head-on collision.\n    The maximum value is $(1 - (-1)) = 2$.\n    Plugging this in gives the threshold energy:\n    $E_{th} = \\frac{2(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB} \\cdot 2} = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\n6.  **Calculation:**\n    Now we use the given values:\n    *   Rest mass energy of an electron: $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\n    *   Average photon energy of the CMB: $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3} \\text{ eV}$.\n\n    $E_{th} = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}} = \\frac{0.2611 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n    $E_{th} = 0.2611 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV} = 2.611 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}$\n\n    The question asks for the answer in Giga-electron-volts (GeV), where $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$.\n    $E_{th} = \\frac{2.611 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 2.611 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n    This value is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV. Comparing this to the options:\n    A) 2.6*1e5 GeV\n    B) 3.9*1e5 GeV\n    C) 9.5*1e4 GeV\n    D) 1.8*1e5 GeV\n\n    Our calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
