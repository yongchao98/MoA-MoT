    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.\n\n**Step 1: Formula for Equilibrium Temperature**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is the temperature it would have if it were a perfect blackbody heated only by its parent star. The formula is:\nT_eq = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star is the star's effective temperature.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n\n**Step 2: Find the Ratio of Equilibrium Temperatures**\n\nWe want to find the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2.\nT_eq1 = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_1))^(1/2) * (1 - A_1)^(1/4)\nT_eq2 = T_star * (R_star / (2 * a_2))^(1/2) * (1 - A_2)^(1/4)\n\nWhen we take the ratio (T_eq1 / T_eq2), the terms for the star (T_star, R_star) cancel out. The problem also states that both planets have the same albedo (A_1 = A_2), so the (1 - A)^(1/4) terms also cancel.\n\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = [ (1/a_1)^(1/2) ] / [ (1/a_2)^(1/2) ]\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = (a_2 / a_1)^(1/2) = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\n\nTo find the temperature ratio, we first need to determine the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes, a_2 / a_1.\n\n**Step 3: Relate Orbital Distance to Radial Velocity Data**\n\nThe problem provides data from the radial velocity (RV) method. For a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by:\nK = M_p * sqrt(G / (a * M_star))\n\nHere, M_p is the planet's mass, M_star is the star's mass, G is the gravitational constant, and `a` is the semi-major axis. This formula assumes the planet's mass is much less than the star's mass and the orbit is viewed edge-on (inclination i=90°), which is a valid assumption for a system also detected via the transit method.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis, `a`:\nK^2 = M_p^2 * (G / (a * M_star))\na = (M_p^2 * G) / (K^2 * M_star)\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\n\nNow we can find the ratio a_2 / a_1:\na_2 / a_1 = [ (M_p2^2 * G) / (K_2^2 * M_star) ] / [ (M_p1^2 * G) / (K_1^2 * M_star) ]\n\nThe terms G and M_star are the same for both planets and cancel out:\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2^2 / K_2^2) * (K_1^2 / M_p1^2)\na_2 / a_1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K_1 / K_2)^2\n\nNow we need the ratios M_p2 / M_p1 and K_1 / K_2.\n*   **Mass Ratio:**\n    M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n    M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n    M_p2 / M_p1 = 5 / 7\n\n*   **RV Semi-Amplitude Ratio:**\n    The Doppler shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the radial velocity (K = c * Δλ / λ₀). Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is equal to the ratio of the maximum Doppler shifts.\n    Δλ_1 = 0.03 Å\n    Δλ_2 = 0.04 Å\n    K_1 / K_2 = Δλ_1 / Δλ_2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3 / 4\n\nNow substitute these ratios back into the equation for a_2 / a_1:\na_2 / a_1 = (5 / 7)^2 * (3 / 4)^2\na_2 / a_1 = (25 / 49) * (9 / 16)\na_2 / a_1 = 225 / 784\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Temperature Ratio**\n\nWe can now calculate the equilibrium temperature ratio using the result from Step 2:\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(a_2 / a_1)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225 / 784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt(225) / sqrt(784)\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28\nT_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\nComparing our result to the given options:\nA) ~ 0.98\nB) ~ 1.30\nC) ~ 1.05\nD) ~ 0.53\n\nThe calculated ratio matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
