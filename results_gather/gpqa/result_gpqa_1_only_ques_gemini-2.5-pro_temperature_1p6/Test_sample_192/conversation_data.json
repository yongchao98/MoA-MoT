    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the relationship between the number of stars per unit distance and the distance itself.\n\n1.  **Define the variables:**\n    *   `r` is the distance to a star.\n    *   `plx` is the parallax of a star.\n    *   `n(r)` is the number of stars per unit range of distance, which is what we want to find. Mathematically, `n(r) = dN/dr`, where `N` is the number of stars.\n    *   `n(plx)` is the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Mathematically, `n(plx) = dN/d(plx)`.\n\n2.  **Interpret the given information:**\n    The problem states that \"the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5\". In physics and astronomy, this phrasing typically refers to the differential distribution, or number density. Therefore, we interpret this statement as:\n    `n(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\n3.  **Relate parallax and distance:**\n    The parallax (`plx`) and distance (`r`) are related by the simple inverse formula (when `r` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds):\n    `plx = 1/r`\n\n4.  **Use the chain rule for distributions (change of variables):**\n    The number of stars `dN` in a small range must be conserved, whether we describe that range in terms of distance `dr` or parallax `d(plx)`.\n    `dN = n(r) |dr| = n(plx) |d(plx)|`\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for `n(r)`:\n    `n(r) = n(plx) * |d(plx)/dr|`\n\n5.  **Calculate the derivative `d(plx)/dr`:**\n    We differentiate the relationship from step 3 with respect to `r`:\n    `d(plx)/dr = d/dr(1/r) = -1/r^2`\n\n    The absolute value of this derivative (called the Jacobian of the transformation) is:\n    `|d(plx)/dr| = 1/r^2`\n\n6.  **Substitute the components back into the transformation equation:**\n    From step 4, we have `n(r) = n(plx) * |d(plx)/dr|`.\n    Substitute the derivative from step 5:\n    `n(r) ∝ n(plx) * (1/r^2)`\n\n7.  **Express `n(plx)` in terms of `r`:**\n    We were given `n(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`. Using `plx = 1/r`, we can write `n(plx)` as a function of `r`:\n    `n(plx) ∝ 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5`\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Now substitute this expression for `n(plx)` into the equation from step 6:\n    `n(r) ∝ (r^5) * (1/r^2)`\n    `n(r) ∝ r^(5-2)`\n    `n(r) ∝ r^3`\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of distance, `n(r)`, changes with distance as `r^3`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
