    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n**1. Define the initial state and operators**\n\n*   The initial state of the system is given by the column matrix (ket vector):\n    `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]`ᵀ\n*   The operator for observable P is:\n    `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n*   The operator for observable Q is:\n    `Q = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\n**2. Normalize the initial state**\n\nFirst, we need to normalize the initial state vector `|ψ⟩`. The norm squared is:\n`⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\nThe normalization constant is `1/√6`. So, the normalized state `|ψ_norm⟩` is:\n`|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]`ᵀ\n\n**3. Measurement of P: Find the probability of getting 0**\n\nThe possible outcomes of measuring P are its eigenvalues. The state after the measurement collapses to the corresponding eigenvector. We need to find the eigenvector of P for the eigenvalue 0.\n\n*   **Find eigenvalues of P:**\n    The characteristic equation is `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n    `det([[ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ], [ 1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ], [ 0, 1/√2, -λ ]]) = 0`\n    `-λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = 0`\n    `-λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = 0`\n    `-λ³ + λ = 0`\n    `λ(1 - λ²) = 0`\n    The eigenvalues are `λ = 0, 1, -1`.\n\n*   **Find the eigenvector for eigenvalue λ = 0:**\n    Let the eigenvector be `|p_0⟩ = [x, y, z]`ᵀ.\n    `P|p_0⟩ = 0 * |p_0⟩`\n    `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] [x, y, z]`ᵀ `= [0, 0, 0]`ᵀ\n    This gives the equations:\n    1.  `y/√2 = 0`  => `y = 0`\n    2.  `x/√2 + z/√2 = 0` => `x = -z`\n    The eigenvector is of the form `[x, 0, -x]`ᵀ. Normalizing this vector:\n    `x² + 0² + (-x)² = 1` => `2x² = 1` => `x = 1/√2`.\n    So, the normalized eigenvector for `P=0` is `|p_0⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]`ᵀ.\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring P=0:**\n    The probability is `Prob(P=0) = |⟨p_0|ψ_norm⟩|²`.\n    `⟨p_0|ψ_norm⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2] * (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]`ᵀ\n    `= (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1)`\n    `= (1/√12) * (-2) = -2 / (2√3) = -1/√3`\n    `Prob(P=0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`\n\n**4. State collapse after measuring P=0**\n\nAfter measuring P and getting the value 0, the system's state collapses to the corresponding eigenvector `|p_0⟩`.\nThe new state of the system is `|ψ'⟩ = |p_0⟩ = [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]`ᵀ.\n\n**5. Measurement of Q: Find the probability of getting -1**\n\nNow we measure the observable Q on the new state `|ψ'⟩`. We want the probability of getting the result -1.\n\n*   **Find eigenvalues and eigenvector of Q:**\n    Since Q is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements: `λ = 1, 0, -1`.\n    We need the eigenvector for the eigenvalue `λ = -1`. Let it be `|q_-1⟩ = [x, y, z]`ᵀ.\n    `Q|q_-1⟩ = -1 * |q_-1⟩`\n    `[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]] [x, y, z]`ᵀ `= [-x, -y, -z]`ᵀ\n    `[x, 0, -z]`ᵀ `= [-x, -y, -z]`ᵀ\n    This gives `x=0` and `y=0`. `z` can be any non-zero value.\n    The normalized eigenvector for `Q=-1` is `|q_-1⟩ = [0, 0, 1]`ᵀ.\n\n*   **Calculate the probability of measuring Q=-1:**\n    This probability is calculated using the collapsed state `|ψ'⟩`.\n    `Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = |⟨q_-1|ψ'⟩|²`\n    `⟨q_-1|ψ'⟩ = [0, 0, 1] * [1/√2, 0, -1/√2]`ᵀ\n    `= 0*(1/√2) + 0*0 + 1*(-1/√2) = -1/√2`\n    `Prob(Q=-1 after P=0) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2`\n\n**6. Calculate the total probability**\n\nThe probability of the sequence of events (measuring P=0 and then measuring Q=-1) is the product of the individual probabilities.\n`Total Probability = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 after P=0)`\n`Total Probability = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6`\n\n<<<B>>>"
