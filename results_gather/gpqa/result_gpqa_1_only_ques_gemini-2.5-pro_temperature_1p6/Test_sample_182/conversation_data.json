    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product.\n\n**1. Understand the Starting Material**\n\n*   **Name:** 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid\n*   **Structure:**\n    *   It has a `cyclohexene` ring, which is a six-membered ring containing one double bond (`-3-ene`). This accounts for an IHD of 1 (for the ring) + 1 (for the double bond).\n    *   It has a `carboxylic acid` group (-COOH). This group contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), which contributes 1 to the IHD.\n    *   It has a `formyl` group (-CHO, an aldehyde). This group also contains a carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O), contributing another 1 to the IHD.\n    *   It has a `vinyl` group (-CH=CH2). This group contains a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), contributing yet another 1 to the IHD.\n\n*   **Total IHD of the starting material:**\n    IHD = (1 for ring) + (1 for C=C in ring) + (1 for C=O in acid) + (1 for C=O in aldehyde) + (1 for C=C in vinyl group) = 5.\n\n**2. Understand the Reaction**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus and excess of hydroiodic acid (Red P + excess HI).\n*   **Function:** This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It performs a complete reduction on almost all oxygen-containing functional groups and multiple bonds. Specifically:\n    *   It reduces carboxylic acids (-COOH) all the way to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   It reduces aldehydes (-CHO) all the way to methyl groups (-CH3).\n    *   It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n    *   It does *not* open stable cycloalkane rings.\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Product**\n\nThe reaction will reduce all the sites of unsaturation except for the ring itself.\n*   The `carboxylic acid` group gets reduced to a methyl group. The C=O bond is gone.\n*   The `formyl` group gets reduced to a methyl group. The C=O bond is gone.\n*   The `vinyl` group's double bond gets reduced. -CH=CH2 becomes an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The C=C bond is gone.\n*   The double bond within the `cyclohexene` ring gets reduced, turning the ring into a saturated `cyclohexane` ring. The C=C bond is gone.\n\nThe final product is a saturated cycloalkane with alkyl substituents (specifically, 1-ethyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexane).\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD) of the Product**\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, is calculated by the formula:\nIHD = (Number of Rings) + (Number of π bonds)\n\nLet's analyze the product structure:\n*   **Number of π bonds:** The reaction with Red P + HI reduces all C=C and C=O bonds. Therefore, the product has zero π bonds.\n*   **Number of Rings:** The original six-membered ring is not broken during the reaction. Therefore, the product contains one ring.\n\nSo, the IHD of the product is:\nIHD = 1 (for the ring) + 0 (for π bonds) = 1\n\nTherefore, the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is 1.\n\nThe correct option is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
