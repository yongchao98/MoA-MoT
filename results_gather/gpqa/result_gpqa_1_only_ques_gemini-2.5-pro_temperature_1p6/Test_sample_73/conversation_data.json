    "This is a classic problem involving the memoryless property of radioactive decay. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n### 1. Understanding Radioactive Decay\n\nThe key principle for this problem is that radioactive decay is a **memoryless process**. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval does not depend on how long it has already existed. The atom does not \"get old.\" The probability of it decaying in the next minute is the same whether it was just created or has already survived for an hour.\n\nThis process is described by an exponential decay law. Let P_decay(t) be the probability that the atom decays within a time interval of length *t*, and let P_survive(t) be the probability it survives for that time *t*.\n\n*   P_decay(t) + P_survive(t) = 1\n*   P_survive(t) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.\n*   P_decay(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n### 2. Finding the Decay Constant (λ)\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n*   P_decay(100) = 0.32\n\nFrom this, we can find the probability of survival for 100 minutes:\n*   P_survive(100) = 1 - P_decay(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\nNow we can use the survival formula to find the decay constant λ:\n*   P_survive(100) = e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\nTo solve for λ, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides, but it's often easier to leave the `e^(-100λ)` term as is and use it directly.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Final Probability\n\nThe question asks for the probability that the atom will decay in the *next* 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n\nBecause of the **memoryless property**, the fact that it has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay. The question is equivalent to asking: \"What is the probability a newly observed atom will decay in a 150-minute interval?\"\n\nSo, we need to calculate P_decay(150).\n*   P_decay(150) = 1 - P_survive(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nWe can rewrite the exponent:\n*   -λ * 150 = (-λ * 100) * (150 / 100) = (-λ * 100) * 1.5\n\nNow we can substitute the value we found earlier:\n*   e^(-λ * 150) = e^((-λ * 100) * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5\n*   Since e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68, we have:\n*   e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5\n\nLet's calculate (0.68)^1.5:\n*   (0.68)^1.5 = (0.68) * sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607\n\nThis is the probability of survival for 150 minutes. The probability of decay is:\n*   P_decay(150) = 1 - P_survive(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393\n\nConverting this to a percentage gives approximately 43.93%.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is about 44%.\n\nComparing this to the options:\nA) 44%\nB) 52%\nC) 40%\nD) 48%\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
