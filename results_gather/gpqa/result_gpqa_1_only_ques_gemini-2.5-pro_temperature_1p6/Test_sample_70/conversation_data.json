    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the Equilibrium Temperature Formula**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates away. The formula is:\n\nT_eq = T_star * ( (1 - A) / 4 )^(1/4) * √(R_star / a)\n\nWhere:\n*   T_star is the star's temperature.\n*   R_star is the star's radius.\n*   A is the planet's albedo (reflectivity).\n*   a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (its average distance from the star).\n\n**2. Simplify the Formula for a Ratio**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 (T₄) and Planet_2 (T₂).\n\nT₄ / T₂ = [T_star * ((1 - A₄)/4)^(1/4) * √(R_star / a₄)] / [T_star * ((1 - A₂)/4)^(1/4) * √(R_star / a₂)]\n\nThe problem states that the planets orbit the same star (so T_star and R_star are constant) and have the same albedo (A₄ = A₂). Therefore, most terms cancel out:\n\nT₄ / T₂ = √(1 / a₄) / √(1 / a₂)\nT₄ / T₂ = √(a₂ / a₄)\n\nThis shows that the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is inversely proportional to the square root of the ratio of their orbital distances.\n\n**3. Use Kepler's Third Law**\n\nKepler's Third Law relates a planet's orbital period (P) to its semi-major axis (a). For planets orbiting the same star, the law can be written as:\n\nP² ∝ a³  or  a ∝ P^(2/3)\n\nWe can write this as a ratio for Planet_2 and Planet_4:\n\na₂ / a₄ = (P₂ / P₄)^(2/3)\n\n**4. Combine the Formulas**\n\nNow, substitute the expression for (a₂ / a₄) from Kepler's Third Law into our simplified temperature ratio formula:\n\nT₄ / T₂ = √[ (P₂ / P₄)^(2/3) ]\nT₄ / T₂ = (P₂ / P₄)^((2/3) * (1/2))\nT₄ / T₂ = (P₂ / P₄)^(1/3)\n\n**5. Plug in the Given Values**\n\nThe problem gives the ratio of orbital periods as P₁:P₂:P₃:P₄:P₅ = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.\n*   The ratio value for Planet_2 (P₂) is 2.\n*   The ratio value for Planet_4 (P₄) is 3.5.\n\nNow, we can calculate the temperature ratio:\n\nT₄ / T₂ = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3)\nT₄ / T₂ = (4 / 7)^(1/3)\nT₄ / T₂ ≈ (0.5714)^(1/3)\nT₄ / T₂ ≈ 0.8298\n\n**6. Match to the Closest Answer**\n\nThe calculated ratio of ~0.83 corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
