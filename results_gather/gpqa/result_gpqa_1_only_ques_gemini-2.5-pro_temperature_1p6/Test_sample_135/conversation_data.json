    "This problem asks for the evaluation of the volume integral of the divergence of a given vector field $\\mathbf{f}$ within a sphere of radius $R$.\n$I = \\int_V (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f}) \\, dV$\n\n**1. Define the Vector Field**\nThe problem states that the vector field $\\mathbf{f}$ has a magnitude $f(r) = 1/r^2$ and is directed radially outwards from the origin. In spherical coordinates $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$, this can be written as:\n$\\mathbf{f}(r, \\theta, \\phi) = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$\nwhere $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$ is the unit vector in the radial direction.\n\n**2. Identify the Volume of Integration**\nThe volume $V$ is a sphere of radius $R$ centered at the origin. The boundary of this volume is a spherical surface $S$ of radius $R$.\n\n**3. Choose a Method for Evaluation**\nWe can evaluate the integral in two ways: by directly calculating the divergence and then integrating, or by using the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem). The Divergence Theorem is particularly well-suited for this problem.\n\n**Method: Using the Divergence Theorem**\n\nThe Divergence Theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume $V$ is equal to the surface integral of the field over the boundary surface $S$ of that volume:\n$\\int_V (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f}) \\, dV = \\oint_S (\\mathbf{f} \\cdot d\\mathbf{S})$\n\nHere, $S$ is the surface of the sphere of radius $R$. We need to evaluate the surface integral (the flux) on the right side.\n\n*   **The vector field on the surface S:** On the surface of the sphere, the radius $r$ is constant and equal to $R$. So, the field is $\\mathbf{f}|_S = \\frac{1}{R^2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$.\n*   **The differential surface element dS:** For a spherical surface, the differential surface area element vector $d\\mathbf{S}$ points in the direction of the outward normal. For a sphere centered at the origin, the outward normal is in the radial direction, $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$. The magnitude of the surface element in spherical coordinates is $dS = R^2 \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi$.\n    Therefore, $d\\mathbf{S} = (R^2 \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi) \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$.\n\n*   **Calculate the dot product f ⋅ dS:**\n    $\\mathbf{f} \\cdot d\\mathbf{S} = \\left(\\frac{1}{R^2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\right) \\cdot \\left((R^2 \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi) \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\right)$\n    Since $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} = 1$:\n    $\\mathbf{f} \\cdot d\\mathbf{S} = \\frac{R^2}{R^2} \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi = \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi$\n\n*   **Evaluate the surface integral:** The integral is taken over the entire surface of the sphere, which means $\\theta$ ranges from $0$ to $\\pi$, and $\\phi$ ranges from $0$ to $2\\pi$.\n    $\\oint_S (\\mathbf{f} \\cdot d\\mathbf{S}) = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi$\n\n    We can separate the integrals:\n    $\\oint_S (\\mathbf{f} \\cdot d\\mathbf{S}) = \\left(\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\phi\\right) \\left(\\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta\\right)$\n\n    Evaluate each part:\n    $\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\phi = [\\phi]_0^{2\\pi} = 2\\pi$\n    $\\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta = [-\\cos\\theta]_0^{\\pi} = -(\\cos\\pi - \\cos 0) = -(-1 - 1) = 2$\n\n    Multiply the results:\n    $\\oint_S (\\mathbf{f} \\cdot d\\mathbf{S}) = (2\\pi) \\times (2) = 4\\pi$\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to this surface integral.\n$\\int_V (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{f}) \\, dV = 4\\pi$\n\nA note on the singularity: The field $\\mathbf{f} = \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}/r^2$ is singular at the origin ($r=0$), and its divergence is actually a Dirac delta function: $\\nabla \\cdot (\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}/r^2) = 4\\pi\\delta^{(3)}(\\mathbf{r})$. Integrating this over a volume containing the origin gives $4\\pi$. The use of the Divergence Theorem correctly handles this singularity and is the standard method for this type of problem.\n\nComparing the result to the given options:\nA) 1\nB) 4/3 π R\nC) 0\nD) 4 π\n\nThe calculated answer is $4\\pi$, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
