    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the starting material, Compound X, from its spectroscopic data.**\n\n*   **IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad signal is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n    *   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n    *   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks indicate C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** A very downfield, broad singlet for one proton is definitive for a carboxylic acid proton (-COO**H**).\n    *   **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to two protons, is a classic pattern for a *para* (1,4)-disubstituted benzene ring. The downfield shift of the doublet at 8.0 ppm indicates it is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (the -COOH group), while the upfield doublet at 7.2 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating group (an alkyl group).\n    *   **Alkyl Group Analysis:** Let's piece together the remaining signals:\n        *   **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** A multiplet for one proton, likely a CH group attached to the benzene ring (benzylic position) and also connected to other protons.\n        *   **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** A doublet for three protons, which must be a methyl group (-CH₃) attached to a CH group. This CH group is the one at 2.9 ppm.\n        *   **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** A multiplet for two protons, likely a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n        *   **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet for three protons, which must be a methyl group (-CH₃) attached to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This -CH₂- group is the one at 1.7 ppm.\n    *   **Assembling the alkyl group:**\n        *   The CH at 2.9 ppm is attached to the ring.\n        *   The CH₃ at 1.4 ppm is attached to this CH.\n        *   The CH₂ at 1.7 ppm is also attached to the CH at 2.9 ppm.\n        *   The CH₃ at 0.9 ppm is attached to the CH₂.\n        *   The complete group is -CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃), which is a **sec-butyl** group.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Compound X:** Combining all the pieces, Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This matches option (B).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the outcome of the reaction.**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents is a powerful reducing agent. It is well-known for the complete reduction of carbonyl-containing functional groups, including carboxylic acids, to the corresponding alkane.\n*   **Applying the reaction to Compound X:**\n    *   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) on the benzene ring will be reduced all the way to a methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   The aromatic ring and the sec-butyl group will not be affected by these reagents under typical conditions.\n    *   Starting Material: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n    *   Final Product: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene\n\n**Step 3: Match the final product with the given options.**\n\n*   A) **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene:** This matches our predicted final product.\n*   B) **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid:** This is the starting material, Compound X.\n*   C) **2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid:** This is structurally incorrect.\n*   D) **1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene:** This has the incorrect alkyl isomer (isobutyl instead of sec-butyl).\n\nThe final product is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
