    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product and the number of its chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactant 1:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. This is a norbornadiene (NBD) derivative, which will act as a dienophile. It possesses two equivalent C=C double bonds.\n*   **Reactant 2:** 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. This is a tetrabromide.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium iodide (NaI) at elevated temperature.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction of 1,2-bis(dihalomethyl) compounds with sodium iodide is a known method to generate highly reactive dienes in situ. In this case, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene undergoes a four-fold elimination of bromine (as 2 Br2, which reacts with I-) to form 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene. Let's call this reactive diene **D**.\n    *   The structure of **D** is a C8H8 isomer. Its IUPAC name implies a cyclohexa-1,3-diene ring where carbons C5 and C6 bear exocyclic methylene (=CH2) groups.\n*   The generated diene **D** is immediately trapped in a Diels-Alder reaction with the dienophile, 7-(tert-butoxy)norbornadiene.\n*   Since the problem states that 2 equivalents of the tetrabromide precursor are used, and the norbornadiene derivative has two double bonds, a double Diels-Alder reaction occurs. One molecule of **D** adds to each of the two double bonds of the norbornadiene.\n*   **Product 1** is the resulting bis-adduct, which is a large, complex polycyclic molecule with a tert-butoxy group.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1.\n*   **Reagents:** Aqueous sulfuric acid (H2SO4, H2O).\n*   **Reaction:** These are standard conditions for the acid-catalyzed cleavage of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group (-O-tBu) is removed, and an alcohol (-OH) is formed.\n*   **Product 2** is the same polycyclic molecule as Product 1, but with the C7-OtBu group converted to a C7-OH group.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2 (the alcohol).\n*   **Reagents:** SO3 and pyridine in DMSO (Parikh-Doering oxidation).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a mild oxidation that converts secondary alcohols to ketones.\n*   **Product 3** is the ketone corresponding to Product 2. The C7-OH group is oxidized to a carbonyl group (C7=O).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Final Product 4**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3 (the ketone).\n*   **Reagents:** Heating at 150°C.\n*   **Reaction:** Heating a complex Diels-Alder adduct typically induces a retro-Diels-Alder reaction.\n    1.  Product 3, the bis-adduct, will undergo two sequential retro-Diels-Alder reactions. Each reaction will release one molecule of the diene **D**.\n    2.  After the extrusion of two molecules of **D**, the central core of the molecule is regenerated. This core is **bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one**.\n    3.  This intermediate, bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one, is known to be thermally unstable. It readily undergoes a cheletropic elimination (a type of pericyclic reaction) to extrude carbon monoxide (CO).\n    4.  The loss of CO from bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one results in the formation of **benzene**.\n\n    *Reaction Summary:*\n    Product 3 → 2 × (Diene **D**) + bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one\n    bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one → **Benzene** + CO\n\n*   The final stable organic products of this thermal decomposition are Benzene (C6H6) and the diene **D** (5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene, C8H8).\n\n**Analysis of the \"Final Product 4\"**\n\nThe question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms on the final product 4. The reaction pot contains two organic products: benzene and diene **D**.\n\n*   **Benzene (C6H6):** Due to its high D6h symmetry, all six hydrogen atoms in benzene are chemically equivalent. It would show only **1** signal in a proton NMR spectrum. This is not among the options (A) 8, (B) 4, (C) 10, (D) 7.\n*   This suggests that \"Product 4\" refers to the other organic product, the diene **D**.\n\n**Number of Distinct Hydrogens in Diene D**\n\n*   **Structure:** The diene **D** is 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene. It has 4 hydrogen atoms on the six-membered ring (on C1, C2, C3, C4) and 4 hydrogen atoms in the two exocyclic methylene groups. Total hydrogens = 8.\n*   **Symmetry:** The number of distinct hydrogens (NMR signals) depends on the molecule's symmetry. The six-membered ring is composed entirely of sp2 hybridized carbons, which would favor a planar structure. However, this would create an 8 π-electron system, which is anti-aromatic and highly unstable. To avoid this, the ring will pucker into a non-planar conformation.\n    *   This puckered conformation might possess some symmetry (e.g., a C2 axis), which would reduce the number of distinct hydrogens to 4. This would correspond to option (B).\n    *   However, it is also very likely that the puckered conformation has no symmetry elements (C1 symmetry). In the absence of symmetry, all atoms that are not constitutionally identical are chemically distinct.\n*   **Counting for C1 Symmetry:** If we assume the molecule has no symmetry (the most general case):\n    1.  The four hydrogen atoms on the ring (H1, H2, H3, H4) would all be in different chemical environments. (4 signals)\n    2.  In each of the two exocyclic =CH2 groups, the two hydrogens are diastereotopic and thus chemically distinct.\n    3.  Furthermore, the two =CH2 groups themselves are in different environments in an asymmetric molecule.\n    4.  Therefore, all four methylene hydrogens would be distinct from one another. (4 signals)\n    *   Total distinct hydrogens = 4 (ring) + 4 (methylene) = **8**.\n\nThis count of 8 matches option (A). Given that this result is an option and relies on a reasonable (though not guaranteed) assumption about the molecule's lack of symmetry, it is the most probable intended answer. Another interpretation is that the question is poorly phrased and is simply asking for the total number of hydrogens in product D (C8H8), which is 8.\n\nFinal conclusion: The product of interest is 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene (D), which has 8 hydrogen atoms. Assuming a lack of symmetry, all 8 are chemically distinct.\n\n<<<A>>>"
