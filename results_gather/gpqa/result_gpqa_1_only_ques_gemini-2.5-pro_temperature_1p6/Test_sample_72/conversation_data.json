    "Here is the step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### 1. Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)\n\nTo find the relative speed between the two astronauts, we use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. Let the lab frame be S. The velocities of the two astronauts in this frame are $v_1 = 0.6c$ and $v_2 = 0.5c$. We want to find the velocity of the first astronaut as observed from the second astronaut's frame of reference.\n\nThe formula for relativistic velocity subtraction (when both objects move in the same direction) is:\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n$v_1 = 0.6c$\n$v_2 = 0.5c$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2}}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7}$\n\n$v_{rel} = \\frac{1}{7}c \\approx 0.1428c$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is **0.14c**.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Total Energy of the System (E)\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of each astronaut, measured in the lab frame. The total energy (E) of a particle with rest mass $m_0$ moving at a velocity $v$ is given by the formula:\n$E = \\gamma m_0 c^2$\nwhere $\\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$.\n\n**Energy of the first astronaut ($E_1$):**\n*   Rest mass $m_{0,1} = 2m$\n*   Velocity $v_1 = 0.6c$\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_1$:\n$\\gamma_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (\\frac{0.6c}{c})^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$\n\nNow, calculate the energy $E_1$:\n$E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_{0,1} c^2 = 1.25 \\times (2m) c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n**Energy of the second astronaut ($E_2$):**\n*   Rest mass $m_{0,2} = 3m$\n*   Velocity $v_2 = 0.5c$\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_2$:\n$\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (\\frac{0.5c}{c})^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n\nNow, calculate the energy $E_2$:\n$E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_{0,2} c^2 = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times (3m) c^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\nUsing the approximation $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$:\n$E_2 \\approx 2 \\times 1.732 \\times mc^2 = 3.464 mc^2$\n\n**Total Energy of the System ($E_{total}$):**\nThe total energy is the sum of the individual energies:\n$E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n$E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2$\n$E_{total} \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the total energy is **5.96 mc²**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately **0.14c**, and the total energy is approximately **5.96 mc²**. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
