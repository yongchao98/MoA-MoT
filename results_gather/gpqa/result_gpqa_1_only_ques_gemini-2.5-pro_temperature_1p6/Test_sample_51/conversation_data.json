    "This problem requires us to compare the ratio of the populations of two energy levels of neutral Titanium (Ti) under two different stellar conditions: with and without spots. We are given that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so we can use the Boltzmann equation to describe the population ratio.\n\n**1. The Boltzmann Equation**\n\nThe ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (level 2, $n_2$) to the number of atoms in a lower energy state (level 1, $n_1$) is given by the Boltzmann equation:\n\n$\\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T)}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $g_2$ and $g_1$ are the statistical weights of the levels.\n*   $\\Delta E = E_2 - E_1$ is the energy difference between the levels.\n*   $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   $T$ is the temperature of the photosphere.\n\n**2. Calculating the Energy Difference ($\\Delta E$)**\n\nWe are given that the transition between the two energy levels corresponds to a wavelength of $\\lambda = 1448 \\, \\text{Å} = 1448 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\text{m}$. The energy difference is related to the wavelength by the formula $\\Delta E = hc/\\lambda$, where $h$ is the Planck constant and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nFor convenience in the Boltzmann equation, we can calculate the term $\\Delta E/k_B$:\n\n$\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B} = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda k_B}$\n\nUsing the value of the physical constant $hc/k_B \\approx 1.4388 \\times 10^{-2} \\text{ m·K}$:\n\n$\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B} = \\frac{1.4388 \\times 10^{-2} \\text{ m·K}}{1448 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}} \\approx 99365 \\text{ K}$\n\n**3. Identifying the Temperatures**\n\nWe need to compare the population ratio under two scenarios:\n*   **Scenario 1: No Spots.** The star's effective temperature is given as $T_{no\\_spots} = 6000 \\, K$.\n*   **Scenario 2: With Spots.** The star's *overall* photospheric effective temperature decreases to $T_{with\\_spots} = 5500 \\, K$. While the photosphere is not isothermal (it has hotter parts and cooler spots), the overall effective temperature is the appropriate single temperature to characterize the integrated light from the star. Thus, we will use this temperature for the \"with spots\" case.\n\n**4. Calculating the Factor**\n\nThe question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes, comparing the no-spot case to the with-spot case. Let's define the population ratio as $R(T) = n_2/n_1(T)$. We want to find the factor $F$:\n\n$F = \\frac{R(T_{no\\_spots})}{R(T_{with\\_spots})} = \\frac{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_{no\\_spots})}}{\\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_{with\\_spots})}}$\n\nThe statistical weights $g_2/g_1$ cancel out:\n\n$F = \\frac{e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B \\cdot 6000 \\, \\text{K})}}{e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B \\cdot 5500 \\, \\text{K})}}$\n\nUsing the rules of exponents, $e^a / e^b = e^{a-b}$:\n\n$F = e^{\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B \\cdot 6000}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B \\cdot 5500}\\right)} = e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B} \\left(\\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000}\\right)}$\n\nNow, we substitute the value of $\\Delta E/k_B$:\n\n$F = e^{99365 \\left(\\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000}\\right)}$\n\nFirst, calculate the difference in the parentheses:\n\n$\\frac{1}{5500} - \\frac{1}{6000} = \\frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \\times 6000} = \\frac{500}{33,000,000} = \\frac{1}{66000}$\n\nNow, calculate the exponent:\n\n$99365 \\times \\frac{1}{66000} \\approx 1.5055$\n\nFinally, calculate the factor F:\n\n$F = e^{1.5055} \\approx 4.506$\n\nThis value is very close to 4.5.\n\nNote that the other information given (stellar radius, mass, and spot coverage percentage) is contextual and consistent with the temperature drop but not needed for the final calculation as long as we use the given effective temperatures.\n\nThe factor by which the ratio changes is approximately 4.5.\n\n<<<B>>>"
