    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statements to determine the correct one:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The scientist wants to create a polyethylene chain with regular branches using only ethylene. This requires a dual-catalyst system in a single reactor.\n    *   **Catalyst 1:** Polymerizes ethylene to form the linear backbone of the polymer (e.g., -(CH2-CH2)n-). This creates High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE).\n    *   **Catalyst 2:** Needs to convert ethylene into a short alpha-olefin (a comonomer). This process is called oligomerization. For example, it could convert three ethylene molecules into one 1-hexene molecule (C6H12).\n    *   **Combined Action:** Catalyst 1 then incorporates the *in situ* generated 1-hexene into the growing polyethylene chain. This creates a polymer with uniform butyl branches (-C4H9), transforming the HDPE into Linear Low-Density Polyethylene (LLDPE). This is known as tandem catalysis or *in situ* comonomer generation.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Statement A: \"One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.\"**\n    *   The key to the process described is the selective oligomerization of ethylene. The most famous and industrially successful catalysts for this transformation (e.g., ethylene trimerization to 1-hexene) are based on **chromium (Cr)**.\n    *   Chromium (Cr) is a transition metal in **Group 6**, which corresponds to the older **Group VIa** designation.\n    *   These chromium-based catalysts require specific ligands (e.g., certain phosphines) and activators to be highly selective for oligomerization rather than polymerization.\n    *   Therefore, this statement is a precise and accurate description of the key chemical technology used to achieve the desired outcome. This statement is **correct**.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Statement B: \"Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.\"**\n    *   The \"essential additional reaction step\" is the oligomerization of ethylene.\n    *   The chromium-based oligomerization catalysts mentioned above are typically activated by organoaluminum compounds, such as methylaluminoxane (MAO), modified MAO (MMAO), or various trialkylaluminum compounds. These activators are crucial for generating the active catalytic species.\n    *   The statement claims that aluminum-based activators \"do not work,\" which is factually incorrect. They are essential components of many such systems. This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Statement C: \"Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.\"**\n    *   Technologies that use a dual-catalyst system in a single reactor to polymerize ethylene while simultaneously generating the comonomer (like 1-hexene) *in situ* are indeed in commercial use.\n    *   For example, Chevron Phillips Chemical operates such a process on a large industrial scale at its facilities in Texas, USA.\n    *   Therefore, this statement about the commercial implementation of the technology is also **correct**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Statement D: \"Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.\"**\n    *   Noble metals include ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum. Research in academia has shown that certain catalysts based on these metals (e.g., iridium) can perform ethylene oligomerization.\n    *   However, these metals are exceptionally expensive compared to chromium or titanium, making them economically unviable for producing commodity polymers like polyethylene.\n    *   So, the statement that they \"can be used\" (in principle) and are \"too expensive\" (for industrial application) is factually **correct**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion: Identifying the Best Answer.**\n    *   We have identified three factually correct statements (A, C, and D) and one incorrect statement (B). In a multiple-choice question, there is typically only one best answer. We must select the one that is most relevant and fundamental to the scientific problem posed.\n    *   The scientist is in a lab and \"intends to add a second catalyst system.\" He is asking for technical advice on *how* to do this.\n    *   Statement A provides the key piece of chemical information: what type of catalyst to use (Group VIa). This is the most direct and scientifically central answer to the problem.\n    *   Statement C provides commercial context, and statement D provides information about a less practical alternative. While true, they are not as fundamental to solving the chemical problem as statement A.\n    *   Therefore, statement A is the most appropriate and informative correct answer in this context. It describes the specific chemical tool required for the essential transformation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
