    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the relationship.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Assumptions:**\n    *   Stars are uniformly distributed in 3D space. This means the number density of stars, let's call it `ρ` (stars per unit volume), is a constant.\n    *   Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (r). The relationship is `plx = 1/r` (where `r` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds). We can also write this as `r = 1/plx`.\n\n2.  **Number of Stars as a Function of Distance:**\n    *   Let's consider the total number of stars, `N(r)`, within a sphere of radius `r` centered on the Sun.\n    *   The volume of this sphere is `V = (4/3)πr³`.\n    *   Since the density `ρ` is constant, the number of stars within this sphere is `N(r) = ρ * V = ρ * (4/3)πr³`.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of stars up to a distance `r` is proportional to the cube of the distance: `N(r) ∝ r³`.\n\n3.  **Number of Stars in a Thin Shell:**\n    *   We are interested in the \"number of stars per unit range,\" which implies a derivative. Let's first find the number of stars per unit range of *distance*, which is `dN/dr`. This represents the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance `r`.\n    *   Differentiating `N(r)` with respect to `r`:\n        `dN/dr = d/dr [ρ * (4/3)πr³] = ρ * 4πr²`\n    *   This shows that the number of stars per unit distance interval increases with the square of the distance: `dN/dr ∝ r²`. This makes sense, as the surface area of the shell grows as `r²`.\n\n4.  **Converting from Distance to Parallax:**\n    *   We want to find the number of stars per unit range of *parallax*, which is `dN/d(plx)`. We can find this using the chain rule:\n        `dN/d(plx) = (dN/dr) * (dr/d(plx))`\n    *   We already have `dN/dr ∝ r²`.\n    *   Now we need `dr/d(plx)`. We know `r = 1/plx = plx⁻¹`. Differentiating `r` with respect to `plx`:\n        `dr/d(plx) = d/d(plx) [plx⁻¹] = -1 * plx⁻² = -1/plx²`\n    *   We are interested in the magnitude or proportionality, so we can ignore the negative sign (it just indicates that as parallax increases, distance decreases). Thus, `|dr/d(plx)| ∝ 1/plx²`.\n\n5.  **Putting It All Together:**\n    *   Now substitute the proportionalities back into the chain rule equation:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ (dN/dr) * |dr/d(plx)|`\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ (r²) * (1/plx²)`\n    *   This expression has both `r` and `plx`. We need to express it solely in terms of `plx`. Substitute `r = 1/plx`:\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ (1/plx)² * (1/plx²)`\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ (1/plx²) * (1/plx²)`\n        `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThe number of stars per unit range of parallax changes as the inverse fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<A>>>"
