    "This is a multi-step problem that involves cosmology and astrophysics. Here is a step-by-step breakdown to arrive at the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the redshift (z) of the observed object.**\n\nThe observed structure is at a cosmological distance, so its light is redshifted due to the expansion of the universe. We can estimate the redshift using the Hubble-Lemaître Law, which relates the recessional velocity (v) of a galaxy to its distance (d).\n\n*   **Hubble-Lemaître Law:** v = H₀ * d\n*   **Distance (d):** 2.1 Gpc = 2100 Mpc\n*   **Hubble Constant (H₀):** We will use a standard approximate value, H₀ ≈ 70 km/s/Mpc.\n\nFirst, calculate the recessional velocity:\nv = (70 km/s/Mpc) * (2100 Mpc) = 147,000 km/s\n\nNext, calculate the redshift (z). For velocities that are a significant fraction of the speed of light (c ≈ 300,000 km/s), the simple formula z = v/c is a good approximation.\nz ≈ v / c = 147,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.49\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the rest-frame energy of the absorption line.**\n\nThe energy of photons from a distant object is reduced (redshifted) by a factor of (1 + z). The relationship between the observed energy (E_obs) and the energy in the object's rest frame (E_rest) is:\n\nE_rest = E_obs * (1 + z)\n\n*   **Observed Energy (E_obs):** 3.9 µeV = 3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV\n*   **Redshift (z):** ≈ 0.49\n\nNow, calculate the rest-frame energy:\nE_rest = (3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV) * (1 + 0.49)\nE_rest = (3.9 * 10⁻⁶ eV) * 1.49\nE_rest ≈ 5.81 * 10⁻⁶ eV\n\n**Step 3: Identify the transition corresponding to this rest-frame energy.**\n\nWe need to find a well-known absorption line in the interstellar medium of the Milky Way that has an energy of approximately 5.81 * 10⁻⁶ eV.\n\nLet's identify the most famous low-energy transition in the interstellar medium: the **21 cm line**. This line is due to the hyperfine splitting of the ground state of neutral atomic hydrogen (H I).\n\nLet's calculate the energy of the 21 cm line:\n*   **Frequency (f):** 1420.4 MHz = 1.4204 * 10⁹ Hz\n*   **Planck's Constant (h):** 4.1357 * 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s\n\nEnergy (E) = h * f\nE = (4.1357 * 10⁻¹⁵ eV·s) * (1.4204 * 10⁹ s⁻¹)\nE ≈ 5.87 * 10⁻⁶ eV\n\nThis value is an excellent match for our calculated rest-frame energy of 5.81 * 10⁻⁶ eV. Therefore, the observed feature is the redshifted 21 cm line of neutral atomic hydrogen.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the phase of the interstellar medium.**\n\nThe question asks what this absorption line is associated with in the Milky Way. We have identified the line as the 21 cm line, which comes from **atomic hydrogen**. This immediately eliminates options B and C, which refer to a molecular medium.\n\nWe are left to choose between:\nA) Warm atomic interstellar medium.\nD) Cold atomic interstellar medium.\n\nNeutral atomic hydrogen exists in two main phases:\n*   The **Cold Neutral Medium (CNM)** is dense and has temperatures around 50-100 K.\n*   The **Warm Neutral Medium (WNM)** is diffuse and has temperatures around 6000-8000 K.\n\nWhile both phases contain atomic hydrogen, **strong 21 cm absorption lines are characteristic tracers of the Cold Neutral Medium.** This is because a strong absorption feature requires a significant population difference between the lower and upper energy states, which only occurs at very low temperatures (low spin temperature). The WNM is too hot to produce significant absorption; it is primarily observed via its 21 cm emission. An observation of an absorption line, especially one strong enough to be detected from a cosmological distance, points definitively to cold gas.\n\nTherefore, the absorption line is associated with the cold atomic interstellar medium.\n\n<<<D>>>"
