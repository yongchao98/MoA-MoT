    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to determine the enthalpy of neutralization.\n\n**1. Understand the Concept**\nThe enthalpy of neutralization is the heat evolved when one mole of H+ ions from an acid reacts with one mole of OH- ions from a base to form one mole of water. For the reaction between any strong acid and a strong base, this value is approximately constant.\nThe core reaction is:\nH⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → H₂O(l)\nThe standard enthalpy change (ΔH) for this reaction is approximately **-13.6 kcal/mol** or **-57.1 kJ/mol**.\n\n**2. Calculate the Moles of H⁺ Ions (from the acids)**\n*   **From HCl:**\n    *   Volume = 500 mL = 0.500 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.2 M\n    *   Moles of HCl = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.1 mol\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid (HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻), moles of H⁺ from HCl = **0.1 mol**.\n\n*   **From H₂SO₄:**\n    *   Volume = 300 mL = 0.300 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.3 M\n    *   Moles of H₂SO₄ = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.09 mol\n    *   Since H₂SO₄ is a strong diprotic acid (H₂SO₄ → 2H⁺ + SO₄²⁻), it releases two H⁺ ions per molecule.\n    *   Moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = 2 × 0.09 mol = **0.18 mol**.\n\n*   **Total Moles of H⁺:**\n    *   Total moles of H⁺ = (moles from HCl) + (moles from H₂SO₄) = 0.1 mol + 0.18 mol = **0.28 mol**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Moles of OH⁻ Ions (from the base)**\n*   **From Ba(OH)₂:**\n    *   Volume = 200 mL = 0.200 L\n    *   Molarity = 0.5 M\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = Molarity × Volume = 0.5 mol/L × 0.200 L = 0.1 mol\n    *   Since Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻), it releases two OH⁻ ions per formula unit.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ = 2 × 0.1 mol = **0.2 mol**.\n\n**4. Identify the Limiting Reactant**\nThe neutralization reaction consumes H⁺ and OH⁻ ions in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   Moles of H⁺ available = 0.28 mol\n*   Moles of OH⁻ available = 0.2 mol\nSince we have fewer moles of OH⁻, the **OH⁻ ion is the limiting reactant**. This means only 0.2 mol of H⁺ will react, and 0.2 mol of water will be formed.\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Neutralization**\nThe total heat released is determined by the number of moles of the limiting reactant that react.\n*   Moles of water formed = 0.2 mol\n*   Enthalpy of neutralization per mole = -13.6 kcal/mol\n\nTotal enthalpy change (ΔH) = Moles of water formed × Enthalpy of neutralization per mole\nΔH = 0.2 mol × (-13.6 kcal/mol)\nΔH = -2.72 kcal\n\n**Note:** The reaction between Ba²⁺ and SO₄²⁻ to form BaSO₄ precipitate also releases heat. However, the question specifically asks for the \"enthalpy of neutralization,\" which refers to the H⁺ and OH⁻ reaction. The value calculated matches one of the options perfectly, indicating this is the intended method.\n\nThe calculated enthalpy of neutralization is -2.72 kcal.\n\n<<<C>>>"
