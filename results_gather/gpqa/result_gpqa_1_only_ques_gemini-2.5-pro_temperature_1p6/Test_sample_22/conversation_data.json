    "**1. Analyze the Reactant and Reagent**\n\n*   **Reactant:** ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene.\n    *   Let's draw the structure based on the name:\n        *   The base is a benzene ring attached to an oxygen atom (an ether): Ph-O-\n        *   The group attached to the oxygen is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl).\n        *   This is a 4-carbon chain ('but').\n        *   There is a double bond between C3 and C4 ('3-en').\n        *   The chain is attached to the oxygen at C1 ('1-yl').\n        *   There are two methyl groups at C2 ('2,2-dimethyl').\n    *   The structure is: Ph-O-CH₂(¹)-C(CH₃)₂(²)-CH(³)=CH₂(⁴).\n    *   This molecule is a phenyl ether with an alkene functional group in the alkyl chain.\n\n*   **Reagent:** Hydrogen bromide (HBr).\n    *   HBr is a strong acid and will provide H⁺ ions (protons) and bromide ions (Br⁻).\n\n**2. Identify Possible Reaction Pathways**\n\nThe reactant has two main reactive sites: the alkene double bond and the ether linkage. HBr can react at either site.\n\n*   **Ether Cleavage:** HBr can cleave ethers. However, cleavage of the Phenyl-Oxygen bond is difficult. Cleavage of the Alkyl-Oxygen bond is possible but usually requires harsh conditions.\n*   **Addition to Alkene:** The double bond of the alkene is electron-rich and will readily react with the electrophile H⁺. This is the most likely initial step.\n\n**3. Detailed Mechanism: Addition to Alkene and Subsequent Steps**\n\n*   **Step 1: Protonation of the Alkene**\n    *   The H⁺ from HBr adds to the double bond. According to Markovnikov's rule, the proton adds to the carbon with more hydrogens (C4) to form the more stable carbocation.\n    *   Ph-O-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-CH=CH₂ + H⁺ → Ph-O-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-C⁺H-CH₃\n    *   This creates a **secondary carbocation** at position C3 of the chain (Intermediate A).\n\n*   **Step 2: Fate of the Secondary Carbocation (Intermediate A)**\n    Intermediate A can either react directly or rearrange to a more stable carbocation.\n\n    *   **Pathway I: Direct Reaction of Intermediate A**\n        *   **Intramolecular Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** The carbocation is an electrophile, and the electron-rich phenyl ring (activated by the -O- group) is a nucleophile. The ring can attack the carbocation in an intramolecular reaction. Attack at the ortho position is sterically favored for forming stable rings.\n        *   Let's trace the ring formation: The ortho-carbon of the phenyl ring attacks C3⁺. The atoms forming the new heterocyclic ring will be: O - C1 - C2 - C3 - C(ortho) - C(ipso). This is a **6-membered ring**.\n        *   The resulting structure is a substituted chromane. The substituents will be two methyl groups at C3 (from the original C2 of the chain) and one methyl group at C4 (from the methyl group on the original C3 of the chain).\n        *   Product 1: **3,3,4-trimethylchromane**. This matches the first structure in option C.\n\n    *   **Pathway II: Rearrangement of Intermediate A**\n        *   The secondary carbocation (Intermediate A) can rearrange to a more stable carbocation. A **1,2-methyl shift** from C2 to C3 will occur.\n        *   Ph-O-CH₂-C(CH₃)₂-C⁺H-CH₃  → Ph-O-CH₂-C⁺(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)₂\n        *   This forms a **tertiary carbocation** at C2 (Intermediate B), which is more stable. The -CH(CH₃)₂ group is an isopropyl group.\n\n*   **Step 3: Fate of the Tertiary Carbocation (Intermediate B)**\n    This more stable carbocation can also undergo intramolecular cyclization.\n\n    *   **Intramolecular Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** The ortho-carbon of the phenyl ring attacks the tertiary carbocation at C2⁺.\n    *   Let's trace this ring formation: The ortho-carbon attacks C2⁺. The atoms forming the new heterocyclic ring are: O - C(ipso) - C(ortho) - C2 - C1. This is a **5-membered ring**.\n    *   The resulting structure is a substituted 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran. C2 of the new ring comes from C1 (a CH₂ group). C3 of the new ring comes from C2 of the chain, which has a methyl group and an isopropyl group attached.\n    *   Product 2: **3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran**. This matches the second structure in option C.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **A) 2-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol and 4-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol:** These products would require cleavage of the C-O ether bond and reduction of the double bond, which is not expected under these conditions.\n*   **B) (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene:** The first product is an anti-Markovnikov addition product, which requires radical conditions (not mentioned). The second is a plausible elimination product, but the combination with an anti-M product is unlikely.\n*   **C) 3,3,4-trimethylchromane and 3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran:** These two products are perfectly explained by the established mechanism of protonation followed by two competing intramolecular cyclization pathways (one from the initial secondary carbocation, one from the rearranged tertiary carbocation). The formation of two products is consistent with the TLC data. In this intramolecular reaction, HBr acts as a catalyst as H⁺ is consumed and then regenerated.\n*   **D) (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene:** This option suggests a mixture of anti-Markovnikov and Markovnikov addition of HBr. Getting both is highly unusual, and the anti-Markovnikov product is unexpected in an ionic reaction. A more likely mixture of bromo-ethers would be the Markovnikov product and a rearranged bromo-ether, which is not what is offered.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe most chemically sound explanation for the formation of two products is the intramolecular Friedel-Crafts alkylation pathway, which yields a mixture of a 6-membered ring product (from the initial carbocation) and a 5-membered ring product (from the more stable rearranged carbocation).\n\n<<<C>>>"
