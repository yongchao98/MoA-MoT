    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine which planet has a higher transit probability.\n\n**1. Understand Transit Probability**\n\nThe geometric probability of a planet transiting its star is the ratio of the star's radius (Rₛ) to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (a). For a circular orbit, the formula is:\n\n*   *p* = Rₛ / a\n\nA higher probability means the planet is more likely to pass in front of its star from our point of view.\n\n**2. Relate Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis**\n\nWe are not given the semi-major axis (a) directly, but we are given the orbital period (P) and information about the stellar mass (Mₛ). We can connect these using Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion. The simplified version (since the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's) is:\n\n*   P² ∝ a³ / Mₛ\n\nWe need to solve for 'a' to plug it into our probability formula:\n\n*   a³ ∝ Mₛ * P²\n*   a ∝ (Mₛ * P²)^(1/3)\n*   a ∝ Mₛ^(1/3) * P^(2/3)\n\n**3. Combine Formulas to Find the Relationship**\n\nNow, substitute the expression for 'a' back into the transit probability formula:\n\n*   *p* ∝ Rₛ / (Mₛ^(1/3) * P^(2/3))\n\nThis formula tells us that the transit probability is:\n*   Directly proportional to the star's radius (Rₛ).\n*   Inversely proportional to the cube root of the star's mass (Mₛ).\n*   Inversely proportional to the orbital period to the power of 2/3 (P).\n\n**4. Compare the Two Systems**\n\nLet's denote the parameters for Planet_1's system with a subscript '1' and for Planet_2's system with a subscript '2'. We want to find the ratio of the probabilities: p₁ / p₂.\n\n*   p₁ / p₂ = [ Rₛ₁ / (Mₛ₁^(1/3) * P₁^(2/3)) ] / [ Rₛ₂ / (Mₛ₂^(1/3) * P₂^(2/3)) ]\n\nWe can rearrange this as:\n\n*   p₁ / p₂ = (Rₛ₁ / Rₛ₂) * (Mₛ₂ / Mₛ₁)^(1/3) * (P₂ / P₁)^(2/3)\n\n**5. Plug in the Given Information**\n\nNow, we use the relationships provided in the problem:\n*   The stars have the same radii: Rₛ₁ = Rₛ₂, so Rₛ₁ / Rₛ₂ = 1.\n*   Star 1's mass is twice Star 2's mass: Mₛ₁ = 2 * Mₛ₂, so Mₛ₂ / Mₛ₁ = 1/2.\n*   Planet 1's period is three times shorter than Planet 2's: P₁ = P₂ / 3, so P₂ / P₁ = 3.\n\nSubstitute these values into the ratio equation:\n\n*   p₁ / p₂ = (1) * (1/2)^(1/3) * (3)^(2/3)\n*   p₁ / p₂ = 3^(2/3) / 2^(1/3)\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Value**\n\nLet's calculate the numerical value of this expression:\n\n*   3^(2/3) ≈ 2.080\n*   2^(1/3) ≈ 1.260\n*   p₁ / p₂ ≈ 2.080 / 1.260 ≈ 1.65\n\nThe probability of Planet_1 transiting is approximately 1.65 times higher than the probability of Planet_2 transiting. Therefore, the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
