    "The \"impulse approximation\" is a foundational concept in nuclear physics for describing high-energy scattering off a nucleus. It simplifies a complex many-body problem into a more manageable one. Let's break down the assumptions to see which ones are essential for this approximation.\n\nThe core idea of the impulse approximation is that a high-energy probe (like an electron or a neutrino) interacts with a single nucleon inside the nucleus so quickly that the nucleon behaves as if it were a free particle during the interaction.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.** This is a prerequisite for the impulse approximation. The model assumes the probe interacts with one nucleon at a time. If the probe could interact with pairs of nucleons simultaneously (these are called \"two-body currents\" or \"meson-exchange currents\"), the whole picture of scattering off a single \"free\" nucleon would break down. So, this assumption is necessary.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.** This refers to what happens before and after the main interaction. It assumes that the incoming probe and the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the struck nucleon) do not interact with the other \"spectator\" nucleons. This is known as the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA). While more sophisticated versions (like the Distorted Wave Impulse Approximation, DWIA) relax this assumption by accounting for these \"final-state interactions,\" the basic, defining version of the impulse approximation includes this for maximum simplicity. It is a key part of making the nucleon behave entirely like a free particle from start to finish. So, this assumption is part of the approximation.\n\n3.  **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.** The impulse approximation treats the nucleon as the fundamental particle. It is largely unconcerned with the nucleon's internal structure (quarks and gluons). The details of the quark dynamics within the nucleon affect the nucleon's form factors, but not the validity of the impulse approximation itself, which operates at the nucleon level. Therefore, this assumption is not relevant to the impulse approximation.\n\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.** This is the very essence of the \"impulse\" concept. The name comes from the idea of an impulse in classical mechanics (a large force applied over a very short time). The assumption is that the interaction time is so short that the relatively weak and slow-acting nuclear binding forces have no time to act or influence the interaction. The nucleon is effectively \"frozen\" in its instantaneous state and responds as a free particle. This assumption is the heart of the impulse approximation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe impulse approximation relies on the interaction being with a single nucleon (1), that this nucleon acts as if it is not bound during the interaction (4), and in its simplest form, that the rest of the nucleus is transparent to the incoming and outgoing particles (2). Assumption (3) is about a different level of physics (sub-nucleon structure) and is not a component of the impulse approximation.\n\nTherefore, the assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
