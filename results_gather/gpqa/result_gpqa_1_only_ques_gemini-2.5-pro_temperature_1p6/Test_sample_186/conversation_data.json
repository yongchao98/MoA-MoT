    "To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable by ESPRESSO, we need to check two main criteria for each star:\n1.  **Brightness:** The star must be bright enough to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 in a 1-hour exposure.\n2.  **Visibility:** The star must be visible in the sky from the Paranal Observatory in Chile.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Limiting Magnitude for Detection\n\nThe problem states that a star is detectable if an S/N of at least 10 is achieved in a 1-hour exposure with ESPRESSO on a single 8m VLT.\n\n1.  **Consult ESPRESSO Documentation:** The provided ESO link has a performance table showing the expected S/N for a 15-minute integration time.\n2.  **Scale for Exposure Time:** The signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) scales with the square root of the exposure time. The required exposure is 1 hour (60 minutes), while the table is for 15 minutes. The time is 4 times longer.\n    *   S/N scaling factor = sqrt(60 minutes / 15 minutes) = sqrt(4) = 2.\n3.  **Find Required 15-min S/N:** To achieve an S/N of 10 in 1 hour, the star must provide an S/N of at least 10 / 2 = 5 in 15 minutes.\n4.  **Find Limiting Magnitude:** We now look at the performance table for the 1-UT mode (single telescope). For detectability, we should assume the more sensitive Medium Resolution (MR) mode.\n    *   For a star with V magnitude = 18, the S/N is 5.2 in 15 minutes.\n    *   For a star with V magnitude = 19, the S/N is 2.9 in 15 minutes.\n    Since an S/N of 5.2 (for V=18) is greater than our required S/N of 5, a star with an apparent V magnitude of 18 is detectable. The actual limit is slightly fainter than 18.0, but for our purposes, we can set the threshold at **V ≈ 18**. A star is detectable if its apparent magnitude `m_V ≤ 18`.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Each Star\n\nWe will now calculate the apparent V magnitude (`m_V`) for each star and check its visibility from Paranal (Latitude ≈ -24.6° S).\n\n**a) Canopus**\n*   **Brightness:** Canopus is the second-brightest star in the sky, with an apparent V magnitude `m_V` of **-0.74**. This is much brighter than our V=18 limit.\n*   **Visibility:** Canopus has a declination of approximately -53°. It is a prominent star in the southern sky and is easily observable from Paranal.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable.**\n\n**b) Polaris**\n*   **Brightness:** Polaris has an apparent V magnitude `m_V` of **+1.98**, which is well within our brightness limit.\n*   **Visibility:** Polaris is the North Star, with a declination of approximately +89°. It is only visible from the Northern Hemisphere. Paranal Observatory, being in the Southern Hemisphere, cannot see Polaris as it is always below the horizon.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Not Detectable.**\n\n**c) Star with RA=0, DEC=0, Absolute V mag (M_V) = 15, at 10 pc distance**\n*   **Brightness:** We calculate the apparent magnitude `m_V` using the distance modulus formula: `m_V = M_V + 5 * log10(d) - 5`, where `d` is the distance in parsecs.\n    *   `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(10) - 5 = 15 + 5*(1) - 5 = 15.0`.\n    *   Since `m_V` = 15.0 ≤ 18, it is bright enough.\n*   **Visibility:** The star is on the celestial equator (Declination = 0°), which is easily visible from Paranal.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable.**\n\n**d) Star with RA=0, DEC=0, M_V = 15, at 200 pc distance**\n*   **Brightness:** We use the distance modulus formula again.\n    *   `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(200) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * (2.30) - 5 = 15 + 11.5 - 5 = 21.5`.\n    *   Since `m_V` = 21.5 > 18, the star is too faint to be detected under the specified conditions.\n*   **Visibility:** Declination is 0°, so it would be visible if it were bright enough.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Not Detectable.**\n\n**e) Star with RA=0, DEC=0, M_V = 15, at 5 pc distance**\n*   **Brightness:** `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(5) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * (0.70) - 5 = 15 + 3.5 - 5 = 13.5`.\n    *   Since `m_V` = 13.5 ≤ 18, it is bright enough.\n*   **Visibility:** Declination is 0°, visible from Paranal.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Detectable.**\n\n**f) Star with RA=0, DEC=0, M_V = 15, at 50 pc distance**\n*   **Brightness:** `m_V = 15 + 5 * log10(50) - 5 ≈ 15 + 5 * (1.70) - 5 = 15 + 8.5 - 5 = 18.5`.\n    *   Since `m_V` = 18.5 > 18, the star is just slightly too faint.\n*   **Visibility:** Declination is 0°, visible from Paranal.\n*   **Conclusion:** **Not Detectable.**\n\n### Summary\n\n*   a) Canopus: **Detectable**\n*   b) Polaris: **Not Detectable** (not visible)\n*   c) Star at 10 pc: **Detectable**\n*   d) Star at 200 pc: **Not Detectable** (too faint)\n*   e) Star at 5 pc: **Detectable**\n*   f) Star at 50 pc: **Not Detectable** (too faint)\n\nThere are a total of **3** detectable stars.\n\n<<<D>>>"
