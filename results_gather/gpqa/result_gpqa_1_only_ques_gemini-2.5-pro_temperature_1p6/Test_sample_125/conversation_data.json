    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction I and its products.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. This is a chiral molecule with one stereocenter at C5, and its configuration is specified as (S).\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent that reduces the ketone at C3 to an alcohol.\n*   **Reaction:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since C3 is a prochiral center, the hydride can attack from two different faces, leading to two possible configurations at C3: (R) and (S).\n*   **Products:** The original stereocenter at C5 is unaffected by the reaction. Therefore, the reaction produces two products which are diastereomers of each other:\n    1.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    2.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated by standard chromatographic techniques. So, Reaction I produces **two** distinct, separable compounds.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction II and its products.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione. This is a symmetrical and achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** Excess sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), followed by an acidic workup. NaBH₄ is a reducing agent that will reduce both ketone groups to alcohols.\n*   **Product:** The product is pentane-2,4-diol. This reduction creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4.\n*   **Stereoisomers:** Let's analyze the possible stereoisomers of pentane-2,4-diol:\n    1.  **(2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    2.  **(2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n    3.  **(2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol**\n*   **Relationships between stereoisomers:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are enantiomers. Since they are formed from an achiral starting material using an achiral reagent, they will be produced in a 1:1 ratio, forming a racemic mixture.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has a plane of symmetry passing through the central CH₂ group, making it a meso compound. The (2S, 4R) configuration is identical to the (2R, 4S) configuration (they are superimposable).\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) isomers.\n*   So, Reaction II produces a mixture of **three** distinct stereoisomers: a pair of enantiomers ((2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)) and a meso compound.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the combined mixture with HPLC.**\n\nThe final mixture contains five different compounds: the two diastereomers from Reaction I and the three stereoisomers from Reaction II.\n\n**Analysis on Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column):**\n\n*   Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties (like polarity).\n*   It can separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers because they have different physical properties.\n*   It **cannot** separate enantiomers because they have identical physical properties in an achiral environment.\n*   Let's count the peaks:\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I ((3S, 5S)- and (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will co-elute and appear as a **1 peak**.\n    *   The meso-pentane-2,4-diol is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different retention time. This gives another **1 peak**.\n    *   The products from Reaction I (C₇H₁₆O₂) are constitutionally different from the products of Reaction II (C₅H₁₂O₂) and will have different retention times. Assuming no accidental co-elution between the different products.\n*   Total peaks on normal-phase HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 1 (from racemate of Rxn II) + 1 (from meso of Rxn II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n**Analysis on Chiral HPLC:**\n\n*   A chiral HPLC column has a chiral stationary phase, which allows for the separation of enantiomers. It can also separate diastereomers and constitutional isomers.\n*   It will resolve all five distinct compounds in the mixture.\n*   Let's count the peaks:\n    *   The two diastereomers from Reaction I will be separated. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The two enantiomers from Reaction II ((2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol) will be separated by the chiral column. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   The meso compound from Reaction II is a distinct molecule and will have its own retention time. This gives **1 peak**.\n*   Total peaks on chiral HPLC = 2 (from Rxn I) + 2 (from enantiomers of Rxn II) + 1 (from meso of Rxn II) = **5 peaks**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis predicts 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
