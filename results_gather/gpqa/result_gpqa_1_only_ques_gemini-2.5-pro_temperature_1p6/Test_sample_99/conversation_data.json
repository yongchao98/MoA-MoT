    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence to identify each compound:\n\n1.  **Compound A to Compound B:**\n    *   Compound A has the molecular formula C3H6, which can be propene (CH3-CH=CH2) or cyclopropane.\n    *   The reaction is bromination in carbon tetrachloride (Br2/CCl4). This is a characteristic electrophilic addition reaction for alkenes.\n    *   A (Propene) + Br2/CCl4 → B\n    *   CH3-CH=CH2 + Br2 → CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br)\n    *   So, **Compound B** is **1,2-Dibromopropane**.\n\n2.  **Compound B to Compound C:**\n    *   Compound B (1,2-Dibromopropane) reacts with alcoholic KOH. This reagent causes dehydrohalogenation. Since there are two halogen atoms, a double elimination occurs.\n    *   CH3-CH(Br)-CH2(Br) + 2 KOH (alc.) → CH3-C≡CH + 2 KBr + 2 H2O\n    *   So, **Compound C** is **Propyne**.\n\n3.  **Compound C to Compound D:**\n    *   Compound C (Propyne) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. This is a cyclotrimerization reaction. Three molecules of propyne polymerize to form a substituted benzene.\n    *   3 CH3-C≡CH → 1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene\n    *   So, **Compound D** is **1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene (Mesitylene)**.\n\n4.  **Compound D to Compound E:**\n    *   Compound D (Mesitylene) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids, which is the nitrating mixture (conc. HNO3 + conc. H2SO4). This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (nitration).\n    *   Mesitylene + HNO3/H2SO4 → 2-Nitromesitylene\n    *   So, **Compound E** is **1,3,5-trimethyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n\n5.  **Compound E to Compound F:**\n    *   Compound E (2-Nitromesitylene) reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (Fe/HCl). This is a standard method for the reduction of a nitro group to an amino group.\n    *   2-Nitromesitylene + Fe/HCl → 2,4,6-Trimethylaniline\n    *   So, **Compound F** is **2,4,6-Trimethylaniline (Mesidine)**.\n\n6.  **Compound F to Compound G:**\n    *   Compound F (2,4,6-Trimethylaniline) reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2, typically from NaNO2/HCl at 0-5 °C). This is a diazotization reaction.\n    *   2,4,6-Trimethylaniline + HNO2 → 2,4,6-Trimethylbenzenediazonium salt\n    *   So, **Compound G** is **2,4,6-Trimethylbenzenediazonium chloride**.\n\n7.  **Compound G to Compound H:**\n    *   Compound G (diazonium salt) reacts with sodium hydroxide (and is typically warmed). The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl group.\n    *   2,4,6-Trimethylbenzenediazonium chloride + H2O/NaOH → 2,4,6-Trimethylphenol\n    *   So, **Compound H** is **2,4,6-Trimethylphenol (Mesitol)**.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given statements:\n\n*   **A) C is a flammable gas.**\n    *   Compound C is propyne. It is a gas at room temperature (boiling point -23.2 °C) and, like all small hydrocarbons, is highly flammable. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **B) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**\n    *   Compound D is 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene). Due to its symmetry, the nine protons of the three equivalent methyl groups give one singlet, and the three protons on the aromatic ring give another singlet. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **C) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n    *   Compound F is 2,4,6-trimethylaniline. Aromatic amines (anilines) are classic precursors for the synthesis of azo dyes. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **D) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n    *   Compound H is 2,4,6-trimethylphenol. The ferric chloride test is used to detect phenols, typically producing a violet, blue, or green color. However, phenols with bulky groups at both ortho positions (like the methyl groups in H) are sterically hindered and do not form the colored complex. Therefore, they give a negative test. A negative test means no color change occurs, and the solution remains the color of the ferric chloride reagent, which is yellow. The statement implies a positive reaction producing a yellow color, which is incorrect. A yellow color in this context signifies a negative result. Thus, this statement is **incorrect**.\n\n<<<D>>>"
