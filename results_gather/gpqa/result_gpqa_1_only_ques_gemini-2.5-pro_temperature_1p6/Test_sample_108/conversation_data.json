    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which transition is not permitted.\n\n**1. Analyze the Initial State**\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state. Let's determine its quantum numbers.\n*   The term symbol is `(2S+1)L(J)`.\n*   For `1S0`:\n    *   `2S_i + 1 = 1` implies the total spin is `S_i = 0`.\n    *   The letter `S` corresponds to the total orbital angular momentum `L_i = 0`.\n    *   The subscript `0` gives the total angular momentum `J_i = 0`.\n*   The parity of the initial state `P_i` is given by `P_i = (-1)^(L_i)`. With `L_i = 0`, the initial parity is `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n**2. Analyze the Final State and Conservation Laws**\n\nThe final state consists of a new two-nucleon state (`NN_f`) and a particle `X`. We must apply the conservation of total angular momentum and parity to the transition.\n\n*   **Final State Components:**\n    *   `NN_f`: Described by a term symbol `(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`. Its parity is `P(NN_f) = (-1)^(L_f)`.\n    *   `Particle X`: Has intrinsic parity `P_X = -1`. It is emitted in a partial wave with orbital angular momentum `l_X` (where `s, p, d, f` correspond to `l_X = 0, 1, 2, 3` respectively). The orbital motion contributes a parity of `(-1)^(l_X)`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Total Angular Momentum (J):**\n    *   `J_initial = J_final`.\n    *   The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum `J_final` is the vector sum of the `NN_f` angular momentum `J_f` and the orbital angular momentum of particle X, `l_X`.\n    *   For `J_final = J_i = 0`, the magnitudes must be equal: `J_f = l_X`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Parity (P):**\n    *   `P_initial = P_final`.\n    *   `P_i = +1`.\n    *   The total final parity `P_final` is the product of the parities of all components: `P_final = P(NN_f) * P_X * P_orbital(X) = (-1)^(L_f) * (-1) * (-1)^(l_X) = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n    *   So, we must have `+1 = -(-1)^(L_f + l_X)`.\n    *   This implies `(-1)^(L_f + l_X) = -1`, which means the sum `L_f + l_X` must be an **odd** integer.\n\n**3. Apply the Pauli Exclusion Principle**\n\nThe problem states that for the final NN state, Pauli statistics require `T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)`. We are also given that the final NN state has isospin `T(NN) = 0`.\n\n*   Substituting `T(NN) = 0` into the formula:\n    `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This equation holds if and only if `S_f + L_f` is an **odd** integer.\n\n**Summary of Conditions for a Permitted Transition**\n\nA transition `1S0 -> (2S_f+1)L_f(J_f) + [l_X wave]` is permitted only if all three of the following conditions are met:\n1.  `J_f = l_X` (from J conservation)\n2.  `L_f + l_X` is odd (from P conservation)\n3.  `S_f + L_f` is odd (from Pauli principle for `T_f = 0`)\n\n**4. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's check each of the given transitions against these three conditions.\n\n**A) `1S0 -> 3S1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state `3S1`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=0`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `l_X=1`.\n1.  `J_f = l_X`? `1 = 1`. **(OK)**\n2.  `L_f + l_X` odd? `0 + 1 = 1`. **(OK)**\n3.  `S_f + L_f` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. **(OK)**\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**B) `1S0 -> 7D1 + p`**\n*   Final NN state `7D1`: `2S_f+1=7` => `S_f=3`. This state is unphysical for a two-nucleon system since the maximum total spin for two spin-1/2 particles is S=1. While this already forbids the transition, for completeness, we check the given rules. `L_f=2`, `J_f=1`.\n*   Particle X state `p`: `l_X=1`.\n1.  `J_f = l_X`? `1 = 1`. **(OK)**\n2.  `L_f + l_X` odd? `2 + 1 = 3`. **(OK)**\n3.  `S_f + L_f` odd? `3 + 2 = 5`. **(OK)**\n*   This transition would be permitted by the specific conservation and Pauli rules listed, but is forbidden because the final NN state `7D1` is physically impossible.\n\n**C) `1S0 -> 3D3 + f`**\n*   Final NN state `3D3`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=2`, `J_f=3`.\n*   Particle X state `f`: `l_X=3`.\n1.  `J_f = l_X`? `3 = 3`. **(OK)**\n2.  `L_f + l_X` odd? `2 + 3 = 5`. **(OK)**\n3.  `S_f + L_f` odd? `1 + 2 = 3`. **(OK)**\n*   This transition is **permitted**.\n\n**D) `1S0 -> 3P0 + s`**\n*   Final NN state `3P0`: `S_f=1`, `L_f=1`, `J_f=0`.\n*   Particle X state `s`: `l_X=0`.\n1.  `J_f = l_X`? `0 = 0`. **(OK)**\n2.  `L_f + l_X` odd? `1 + 0 = 1`. **(OK)**\n3.  `S_f + L_f` odd? `1 + 1 = 2`. This is **even**. **(FAIL)**\n*   This transition violates the Pauli principle condition for a final state with `T(NN) = 0`. Therefore, this transition is **not permitted**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe transition `1S0 -> 3P0 + s` is forbidden because the final NN state `3P0` (`S_f=1, L_f=1`) has `S_f + L_f = 2` (even), which is inconsistent with the Pauli principle requirement that a `T=0` state must have `S_f + L_f` be odd.\n\n<<<D>>>"
