    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the energy spectrum.\n\n**1. Express the Potential in Cartesian Coordinates**\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ):\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 * k * r^2 + 3/2 * k * r^2 * cos^2(θ)\n\nTo simplify the problem, we convert the potential to Cartesian coordinates (x, y). The transformation rules are:\nx = r * cos(θ)\ny = r * sin(θ)\nr^2 = x^2 + y^2\n\nFrom these relations, we can see that x^2 = r^2 * cos^2(θ).\nNow substitute these into the potential expression:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 * k * (x^2 + y^2) + 3/2 * k * (x^2)\n\nLet's group the terms with x^2 and y^2:\nV(x, y) = (1/2 * k * x^2 + 3/2 * k * x^2) + 1/2 * k * y^2\nV(x, y) = (4/2 * k * x^2) + 1/2 * k * y^2\nV(x, y) = 2 * k * x^2 + 1/2 * k * y^2\n\n**2. Recognize the Separable Potential**\n\nThe potential is now in the form of a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator. It is a sum of two independent potentials, one for the x-coordinate and one for the y-coordinate:\nV(x, y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y)\nwhere:\nV_x(x) = 2 * k * x^2\nV_y(y) = 1/2 * k * y^2\n\n**3. Solve the Separable Schrödinger Equation**\n\nThe time-independent Schrödinger equation for the system is:\nHψ = Eψ\nwhere the Hamiltonian H is:\nH = - (ħ^2 / 2m) * (∂^2/∂x^2 + ∂^2/∂y^2) + V(x, y)\n\nSince the potential is separable, the Hamiltonian can be written as H = H_x + H_y, and the total energy E is the sum of the energies for the x and y directions, E = E_x + E_y. We can solve for each dimension independently.\n\n**4. Find the Energy Spectrum for the x-direction**\n\nThe potential for the x-direction is V_x(x) = 2 * k * x^2. This is the potential of a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator, whose general form is V(x) = 1/2 * m * ω^2 * x^2.\nBy comparing the two forms, we can find the angular frequency ω_x:\n1/2 * m * ω_x^2 = 2 * k\nm * ω_x^2 = 4k\nω_x^2 = 4k / m\nω_x = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 * sqrt(k / m)\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator are given by E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω. So, for the x-direction:\nE_nx = (n_x + 1/2) * ħ * ω_x = (n_x + 1/2) * ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m))\n\n**5. Find the Energy Spectrum for the y-direction**\n\nThe potential for the y-direction is V_y(y) = 1/2 * k * y^2.\nAgain, we compare this to the general form V(y) = 1/2 * m * ω^2 * y^2 to find the angular frequency ω_y:\n1/2 * m * ω_y^2 = 1/2 * k\nm * ω_y^2 = k\nω_y^2 = k / m\nω_y = sqrt(k / m)\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for the y-direction are:\nE_ny = (n_y + 1/2) * ħ * ω_y = (n_y + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\n**6. Calculate the Total Energy Spectrum**\n\nThe total energy E is the sum of the energies from the x and y motions:\nE = E_nx + E_ny\nE = (n_x + 1/2) * ħ * (2 * sqrt(k/m)) + (n_y + 1/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression by factoring out the common term ħ * sqrt(k/m):\nE = [ (n_x + 1/2) * 2 + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nHere, n_x and n_y are the quantum numbers for the x and y oscillators, respectively, and can take any non-negative integer value (n_x, n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) E = (3n_x+2n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nB) E = (2n_x+n_y+3/2)ℏ*sqrt(k/m)\nC) E = (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\nD) E = (n_x+3*n_y+3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m))\n\nOur derived energy spectrum matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
