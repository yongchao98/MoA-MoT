    "This problem requires a multi-step synthesis. Let's break down the transformation from the starting material to the final product.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material and Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Ethynylcyclohexane. Its structure is a cyclohexane ring attached to a C≡CH group (Cy-C≡CH). It has 8 carbon atoms (6 in the ring, 2 in the ethynyl group).\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let's dissect this name to determine its structure:\n    *   The parent molecule is **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde**. This is a cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde (-CHO) group attached.\n    *   The prefix \"1-\" indicates the position of a substituent on the cyclohexane ring, at the same carbon atom that bears the -CHO group.\n    *   The substituent is **(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)**. This group consists of a methyl group (-CH3) that is substituted with both a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a cyclohexyl group (-C6H11). So, the substituent is -CH(OH)-Cy.\n    *   Putting it all together, the final product has a cyclohexane ring. On one carbon (C1), there is a -CHO group and a -CH(OH)-Cy group.\n\n*   This final product structure is the result of an **aldol addition reaction** between two molecules of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (Cy-CHO). In this reaction, the enolate of one molecule of Cy-CHO attacks the carbonyl group of a second molecule.\n\n**2. Outline the Overall Synthetic Strategy**\n\nThe overall plan must be:\nEthynylcyclohexane → Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde → 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde\n\nSo, the first part of the synthesis is to convert ethynylcyclohexane into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let's compare the structures:\n*   Ethynylcyclohexane (Cy-C≡CH) has 8 carbons.\n*   Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (Cy-CHO) has 7 carbons.\n\nWe need a sequence that results in a net loss of one carbon atom. A common way to achieve this is to modify the two-carbon side chain and then cleave it. The sequence of reactions presented in the options suggests a path:\n1.  Add a carbon to the alkyne.\n2.  Reduce the alkyne to an alkene.\n3.  Cleave the alkene via ozonolysis to get the desired aldehyde.\n\nThe final step will be the aldol reaction.\n\n**3. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nLet's analyze the reaction sequence in each option to see if it correctly executes this strategy.\n\n**A) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**\n*   **Step 1:** `NaNH2, methyl chloride` on Cy-C≡CH gives 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne (Cy-C≡C-CH3). This is a correct first step for our strategy.\n*   **Step 2:** `H2/Pd` is a full hydrogenation catalyst. It would reduce the alkyne to an alkane: 1-propylcyclohexane (Cy-CH2CH2CH3). This alkane is unreactive towards the subsequent reagents. This sequence is incorrect because full reduction happens too early.\n\n**B) 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH**\n*   **Step 1:** `NaNH2, ethyl chloride` on Cy-C≡CH gives 1-cyclohexylbut-1-yne (Cy-C≡C-CH2CH3).\n*   **Step 2:** `Li/liq. NH3` reduces the alkyne to a trans-alkene: (E)-1-cyclohexylbut-1-ene (Cy-CH=CH-CH2CH3).\n*   **Step 3:** `O3/H2O` is an **oxidative** ozonolysis. It cleaves the double bond and forms carboxylic acids (or ketones). This would yield cyclohexanecarboxylic acid (Cy-COOH) and propanoic acid (CH3CH2COOH). This does not produce the required aldehyde precursor for the aldol reaction. This option is incorrect.\n\n**C) 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH**\n*   **Step 1:** `NaNH2` is a strong base, and `methanol (CH3OH)` is a weak acid. The acetylide formed by NaNH2 (Cy-C≡C⁻) would be immediately protonated by methanol, regenerating the starting material (Cy-C≡CH). This step is chemically unproductive. This option is incorrect as written.\n\n**D) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2**\n*   **Step 1:** `NaNH2, methyl chloride` on Cy-C≡CH correctly forms 1-cyclohexylprop-1-yne (Cy-C≡C-CH3).\n*   **Step 2:** `H2/Pd-calcium carbonate` is Lindlar's catalyst. It performs a partial, syn-hydrogenation of the alkyne to a cis-alkene: (Z)-1-cyclohexylprop-1-ene ((Z)-Cy-CH=CH-CH3). This is a standard and correct transformation.\n*   **Step 3:** `O3/(CH3)2S` is a **reductive** ozonolysis. It cleaves the double bond to form aldehydes and/or ketones. It cleaves (Z)-Cy-CH=CH-CH3 to yield **cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (Cy-CHO)** and acetaldehyde (CH3CHO). This step successfully produces the key aldehyde precursor.\n*   **Step 4:** `Ba(OH)2` is a strong base, which is a suitable catalyst for an aldol addition reaction. When added to the mixture from step 3, it will catalyze the aldol reaction. Although a mixture of aldol products would form (due to the presence of both cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and acetaldehyde), the desired self-aldol product of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde will be among them.\n\n**Conclusion**\nSequence D is the only chemically logical and viable pathway among the choices to synthesize the target molecule. It correctly prepares the necessary precursor (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde) through a series of standard reactions and then employs an appropriate reagent (Ba(OH)2) for the final aldol addition step.\n\n<<<D>>>"
