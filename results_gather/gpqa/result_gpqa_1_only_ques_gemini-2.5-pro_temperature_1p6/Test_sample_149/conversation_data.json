    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the starting material from the molecular formula (C8H9NO) and 1H-NMR data.**\n\n    *   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 8 + 1 - 9/2 + 1/2 = 5.\n        *   A benzene ring accounts for 4 DBEs (3 double bonds + 1 ring). This strongly suggests the presence of an aromatic ring.\n        *   The remaining 1 DBE likely corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O) or a C=N bond.\n\n    *   **Analyze the 1H-NMR signals:**\n        *   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** This chemical shift is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO). The triplet multiplicity (t) indicates that it is coupled to an adjacent methylene group (-CH2-), according to the n+1 rule (2+1=3 peaks).\n        *   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** This signal corresponds to the methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the aldehyde. The doublet multiplicity (d) confirms its coupling to the single aldehyde proton (1+1=2 peaks). This confirms the presence of a **-CH2-CHO** fragment (an acetaldehyde moiety).\n        *   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 protons, are a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The upfield shifts (especially 6.51 ppm) suggest the presence of a strong electron-donating group attached to the ring.\n        *   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet (bs) for 2 protons is characteristic of a primary amine group (-NH2). The broadness is due to quadrupole relaxation of the nitrogen atom and chemical exchange. An -NH2 group is a strong electron-donating group, consistent with the upfield aromatic signals.\n\n    *   **Assemble the structure:**\n        *   The fragments are a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring, a -CH2-CHO group, and an -NH2 group.\n        *   Let's check the formula: C6H4 (ring) + C2H3O (-CH2CHO) + NH2 = **C8H9NO**. The formula matches.\n        *   The two substituents on the para-disubstituted ring are -NH2 and -CH2-CHO.\n        *   The starting material is **4-aminophenylacetaldehyde**. The amino group (-NH2) causes the ortho protons to be shielded (appearing at 6.51 ppm) and the meta protons to be deshielded relative to them (appearing at 6.98 ppm).\n\n2.  **Analyze the sequence of reactions.**\n\n    *   **Reactant:** 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde\n    *   **Step 1: NaNO2 + HCl (Diazotization):** This set of reagents converts a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) into a diazonium salt (-N2+Cl-).\n        *   Product: 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride ([N2+Cl-]-C6H4-CH2-CHO).\n\n    *   **Step 2: H2O (Hydrolysis/Sandmeyer-type reaction):** The diazonium salt is unstable and reacts with water upon gentle warming, replacing the diazonium group with a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n        *   Product: **4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde** (HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO).\n\n    *   **Step 3: aq. KOH, Heat (Aldol Condensation):** This is a base-catalyzed self-aldol condensation. 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde has both a carbonyl group (aldehyde) and acidic α-protons (on the -CH2- group).\n        *   **Mechanism:**\n            a.  An hydroxide ion (OH-) from KOH removes an α-proton from one molecule to form a nucleophilic enolate.\n            b.  The enolate attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of a second molecule of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, forming a β-hydroxy aldehyde (the aldol addition product). The addition product is 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal (structure in option B).\n            c.  The presence of **heat** promotes the dehydration (loss of a water molecule) of the β-hydroxy aldehyde. The acidic α-proton (now on C2) is removed, and the β-hydroxyl group (on C3) is eliminated, forming a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n    *   **Determine the structure of the final product:**\n        *   Starting molecule for this step: HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO (Let R = HO-C6H4-)\n        *   Addition product: R-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(R)-CHO\n        *   Dehydration (-H2O): This removes the -OH from C3 and an -H from C2.\n        *   Final condensation product: **R-CH2-CH=C(R)-CHO**\n        *   Substituting R back: (HO-C6H4)-CH2-CH=C(C6H4-OH)-CHO\n        *   **IUPAC Name:** Numbering the chain from the aldehyde carbon (C1), we have a but-2-enal backbone. The substituents are a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group at C2 and a (4-hydroxyphenyl) group attached to C4.\n        *   The name is **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**.\n\n3.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    *   A) 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal - Incorrect structure and substituents.\n    *   B) 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal - This is the intermediate aldol addition product, not the final product under heating conditions.\n    *   C) 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal - Incorrect structure, would not be formed from this reaction.\n    *   D) 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal - This matches our derived final product from the aldol condensation.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\n<<<D>>>"
