    "An optically active compound must be chiral and not a racemic mixture. A compound is chiral if its structure is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicators of chirality are the absence of a plane of symmetry (σ) and a center of inversion (i). Let's analyze each compound.\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n    *   The structure is `Cl-CH=C(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)`.\n    *   The molecule has a double bond. All atoms directly attached to the C=C bond lie in a single plane. Since the entire molecule is planar (or very close to it), it possesses a plane of symmetry (the plane of the molecule itself).\n    *   Molecules with a plane of symmetry are achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **not optically active**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n    *   This is a complex bicyclic molecule, a derivative of a Diels-Alder adduct.\n    *   The key information is the stereochemical descriptors in the name: `(3aR,7aS,E)`. This specifies a single, unique stereoisomer.\n    *   The parent structure, the adduct of cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride, is a meso compound (achiral) because it has a plane of symmetry. However, in this molecule, the bridge `CH₂` group is replaced by a `C=CHCl` group.\n    *   The `C=CHCl` group is not symmetric and breaks the plane of symmetry that existed in the parent molecule.\n    *   The molecule is therefore chiral. Since a specific enantiomer is named, it is not a racemic mixture.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   The structure is `HOOC-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-COOH`.\n    *   It has two stereocenters, at C2 and C3.\n    *   The specified configuration is `(2R, 3S)`. This describes a specific stereoisomer known as the meso form.\n    *   Meso compounds have stereocenters but are achiral overall due to an internal element of symmetry. This molecule has a center of inversion.\n    *   Because it is achiral, it is **not optically active**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n    *   This is another stereoisomer of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.\n    *   The configuration `(2R, 3R)` describes one of a pair of enantiomers (the other being `(2S, 3S)`).\n    *   This molecule lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion, so it is chiral.\n    *   The name specifies a single enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n    *   This is a six-membered ring with a double bond and a hydroxyl group.\n    *   The carbon atom C1, attached to the OH group, is a stereocenter. It is bonded to four different groups: -OH, -H, -CH=CH-CH₂-, and -CH₂-CH=CH-.\n    *   The molecule does not have a plane of symmetry or center of inversion. It is chiral.\n    *   The name specifies the `(R)` enantiomer.\n    *   Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n    *   This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups. The `1s,3s,5s` notation, though non-standard, most commonly refers to the isomer where all three substituents are on the same side of the ring (all-cis).\n    *   The all-cis isomer of 1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol is a highly symmetric molecule. It possesses a C₃ axis of rotation and three vertical planes of symmetry. Each plane of symmetry passes through one C-OH group and the opposite CH₂ group.\n    *   Since it has planes of symmetry, the molecule is achiral, despite having three stereocenters.\n    *   Therefore, it is **not optically active**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n    *   The structure is `(Cyclopentyl)-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`.\n    *   Let's check for chiral centers. The carbon `CH(CH₃)₂` is attached to two identical methyl groups, so it's not a chiral center. No other carbon is a chiral center.\n    *   The molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the cyclopentyl ring, the C=O group, the CH₂, and the CH, and bisects the two terminal methyl groups.\n    *   Since the molecule possesses a plane of symmetry, it is achiral.\n    *   Therefore, it is **not optically active**.\n\nCounting the compounds that will exhibit optical activity:\n1.  No\n2.  **Yes**\n3.  No\n4.  **Yes**\n5.  **Yes**\n6.  No\n7.  No\n\nThere are a total of 3 optically active compounds.\n\n<<<C>>>"
