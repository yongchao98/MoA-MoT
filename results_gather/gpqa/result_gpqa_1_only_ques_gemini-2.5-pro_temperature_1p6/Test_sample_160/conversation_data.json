    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the physics to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.\n\n1.  **Define Mean Free Path (MFP):** The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. The general formula is λ = 1 / (nσ), where `n` is the number density of the target particles and `σ` is the collision cross-section (the effective \"area\" that the particle presents for a collision).\n\n2.  **Analyze λ1 (Gas Molecule - Gas Molecule Collisions):**\n    *   This is the mean free path of a gas molecule moving among other gas molecules.\n    *   In this case, both the projectile particle and the target particles are gas molecules, and they are all moving with thermal velocities.\n    *   Because the target molecules are also moving, the effective collision rate is higher than if they were stationary. Kinetic theory accounts for this with a factor of √2.\n    *   The formula for λ1 is: **λ1 = 1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas)**\n        *   `n` is the number density of the gas molecules.\n        *   `σ_gas-gas` is the kinetic collision cross-section between two gas molecules, which is determined by their physical size.\n\n3.  **Analyze λ2 (Electron - Gas Molecule Collisions):**\n    *   This is the mean free path of an electron from the beam as it travels through the remaining gas molecules.\n    *   The electrons are accelerated to 1000 kV, making them highly relativistic and moving much, much faster than the gas molecules.\n    *   From the perspective of the ultra-fast electron, the gas molecules are essentially stationary targets. Therefore, the √2 correction factor is not used.\n    *   The formula for λ2 is: **λ2 = 1 / (n * σ_e-gas)**\n        *   `n` is the same number density of gas molecules as before.\n        *   `σ_e-gas` is the scattering cross-section for a high-energy electron colliding with a gas molecule.\n\n4.  **Compare λ1 and λ2:**\n    Let's find the ratio λ2 / λ1:\n    λ2 / λ1 = [1 / (n * σ_e-gas)] / [1 / (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas)]\n    λ2 / λ1 = (√2 * n * σ_gas-gas) / (n * σ_e-gas)\n    **λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (σ_gas-gas / σ_e-gas)**\n\n5.  **Compare the Cross-Sections (σ_gas-gas vs. σ_e-gas):**\n    *   **σ_gas-gas:** This is the kinetic cross-section, related to the physical size of the gas molecule's electron cloud. Think of it as the collision of two fuzzy balls of a certain diameter.\n    *   **σ_e-gas:** This is the scattering cross-section for a very high-energy (1000 keV) electron. An electron is a point-like particle. At such high energies, it is very penetrating and less likely to be significantly deflected by a gas molecule. It can pass through the molecule's electron cloud with minimal interaction. For a \"collision\" to occur (a significant scattering event), the electron must pass very close to the atomic nucleus or an inner-shell electron. Therefore, the effective target area for a high-energy electron is significantly **smaller** than the physical, kinetic cross-section of the molecule.\n    *   Conclusion: **σ_gas-gas > σ_e-gas**. This means the ratio (σ_gas-gas / σ_e-gas) is a number greater than 1.\n\n6.  **Final Result:**\n    *   We have λ2 / λ1 = √2 * (a number > 1).\n    *   Since √2 ≈ 1.414, the ratio λ2 / λ1 must be greater than 1.414.\n    *   This leads to the conclusion: **λ2 > 1.414 * λ1**.\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation (Incorrect)\n    *   B) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1 (Incorrect, as λ2 must be greater than 1.414 * λ1)\n    *   C) λ2 < λ1 (Incorrect)\n    *   D) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 (Correct). Our derived condition, λ2 > 1.414 * λ1, satisfies this inequality. An electron travels a much longer distance on average than a gas molecule before a collision.\n\n<<<D>>>"
