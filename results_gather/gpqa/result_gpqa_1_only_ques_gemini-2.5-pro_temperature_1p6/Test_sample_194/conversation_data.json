    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the maximum orbital period of the second planet.\n\n**1. Understand the Geometry and Key Relationships**\n\n*   **Transit and Occultation:** A planet transits when it passes in front of its star, and it is occulted (a secondary eclipse) when it passes behind its star. For a planet in a circular orbit, if a transit occurs, an occultation will also occur half an orbit later. Therefore, the condition for both events is simply the condition for a transit.\n*   **Impact Parameter (b):** The impact parameter is the projected distance between the planet's center and the star's center at mid-transit, measured in units of the stellar radius ($R_s$). It is given by the formula:\n    $b = \\frac{a \\cos i}{R_s}$\n    where $a$ is the semi-major axis of the orbit and $i$ is the orbital inclination (the angle between the orbital plane and the plane of the sky).\n*   **Shared Orbital Plane:** The problem states that both planets share the same orbital plane. This is a crucial piece of information because it means they have the same orbital inclination, $i$.\n*   **Kepler's Third Law:** For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period ($P$) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis ($a$).\n    $P^2 \\propto a^3 \\implies a \\propto P^{2/3}$\n\n**2. Relate the Parameters of the Two Planets**\n\nSince both planets share the same inclination ($i$) and orbit the same star (same $R_s$), we can establish a relationship between their impact parameters, periods, and semi-major axes.\n\nFrom the impact parameter formula, we can write $\\cos i = \\frac{b R_s}{a}$. Because $\\cos i$ and $R_s$ are the same for both planets, we can write:\n$\\frac{b_1 R_s}{a_1} = \\frac{b_2 R_s}{a_2}$\n$\\frac{b_1}{a_1} = \\frac{b_2}{a_2}$\n\nNow, using Kepler's Third Law ($a \\propto P^{2/3}$), we can write the ratio of the semi-major axes as:\n$\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{2/3}$\n\nSubstitute this into the previous equation:\n$\\frac{b_1}{a_1} = \\frac{b_2}{a_1 \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{2/3}}$\n\nSolving for $b_2$ gives us the key relationship:\n$b_2 = b_1 \\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)^{2/3}$\n\n**3. Determine the Condition for Maximum Period**\n\nThe question asks for the *maximum* orbital period ($P_2$) for the second planet.\nFrom the relationship derived above, a larger period $P_2$ corresponds to a larger impact parameter $b_2$. Therefore, to find the maximum period, we need to use the maximum possible impact parameter for a transit to occur.\n\nA transit is generally defined as an event where the center of the planet passes over the stellar disk. The limiting case for this is when the planet's center passes just over the edge (limb) of the star. In this case, the impact parameter is $b = 1$. So, the condition for a transit is $b \\le 1$.\nThe maximum impact parameter for planet 2 is $b_{2,max} = 1$.\n\n(Note: A more generous definition allows for grazing transits where any part of the planet overlaps the star, giving a limit of $b \\le 1 + R_p/R_s$. However, using $b \\le 1$ is a standard convention and, as we will see, leads directly to one of the answer choices.)\n\n**4. Calculate the Maximum Period**\n\nNow we use our key relationship with the maximum condition for planet 2.\n$b_{2,max} = b_1 \\left(\\frac{P_{2,max}}{P_1}\\right)^{2/3}$\n\nWe are given:\n*   Period of planet 1, $P_1 = 3$ days\n*   Impact parameter of planet 1, $b_1 = 0.2$\n*   Maximum impact parameter for planet 2, $b_{2,max} = 1$\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation:\n$1 = 0.2 \\left(\\frac{P_{2,max}}{3}\\right)^{2/3}$\n\nNow, we solve for $P_{2,max}$:\n$\\frac{1}{0.2} = \\left(\\frac{P_{2,max}}{3}\\right)^{2/3}$\n$5 = \\left(\\frac{P_{2,max}}{3}\\right)^{2/3}$\n\nTo isolate the term with $P_{2,max}$, we raise both sides to the power of $3/2$:\n$5^{3/2} = \\frac{P_{2,max}}{3}$\n\nFinally, solve for $P_{2,max}$:\n$P_{2,max} = 3 \\times 5^{3/2}$\n$P_{2,max} = 3 \\times 5 \\sqrt{5} = 15 \\sqrt{5}$\n\nUsing the approximation $\\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.236$:\n$P_{2,max} \\approx 15 \\times 2.236 = 33.54$ days.\n\nThis value is approximately 33.5 days. Comparing this to the options:\nA) ~ 12.5\nB) ~ 33.5\nC) ~ 37.5\nD) ~ 7.5\n\nThe calculated value matches option B. The information about the radii of the star and planets is not needed for this solution, assuming the standard transit condition $b \\le 1$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
