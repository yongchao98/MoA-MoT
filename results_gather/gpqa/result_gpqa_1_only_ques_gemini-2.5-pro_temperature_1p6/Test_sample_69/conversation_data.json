    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to identify the compounds and answer the question.\n\n**1.  Analyzing the Hydrolysis Reaction (Clue 3)**\n*   **C + H₂O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)**\n*   This is the most revealing clue. The reaction produces the starting material **A** (a solid) along with two different acids.\n*   The formation of two acids from the hydrolysis of **C** (which is made from **A** and **B**) implies that **C** contains element A and at least two other elements, which come from gas **B**.\n*   The regeneration of the elemental form of **A** upon hydrolysis strongly suggests a disproportionation reaction.\n*   Let's consider **A = Sulfur (S₈)**. It is a solid. Let's see if a simple sulfur compound fits the description for C.\n*   Consider **C = Sulfur Dichloride (SCl₂) or Sulfur Monochloride (S₂Cl₂) **. These are formed from sulfur and chlorine. Let's assume **B = Chlorine (Cl₂) **, which is a gas.\n*   Let's test the hydrolysis of sulfur chlorides: They are known to disproportionate in water. A representative reaction for SCl₂ is:\n    **2SCl₂(l) + 2H₂O(l) → S(s) + SO₂(aq) + 4HCl(aq)**\n*   This reaction fits the clue perfectly:\n    *   It regenerates solid sulfur (**A = S₈**).\n    *   It produces hydrochloric acid (**F = HCl**), which is a strong acid.\n    *   It produces sulfur dioxide (SO₂), which dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid (**G = H₂SO₃**), a weak acid.\n*   This set of identities seems highly plausible:\n    *   **A = S₈** (Sulfur)\n    *   **C = SCl₂** (Sulfur Dichloride)\n    *   **F = HCl** (Hydrochloric acid)\n    *   **G = H₂SO₃** (Sulfurous acid)\n\n**2.  Verifying the Formation of C (Clue 1)**\n*   **solid A + 8 equivalents of gas B → bright red product C**\n*   With our identities: S₈(s) + 8Cl₂(g) → product C.\n*   This reaction would produce 8 SCl₂. So, **C = SCl₂**.\n*   SCl₂ is described as a cherry-red liquid. \"Bright red product\" is a reasonable description. The stoichiometry (1 mole of S₈ molecule reacts with 8 moles of Cl₂ molecules to make 8 moles of SCl₂) fits the clue.\n\n**3.  Identifying D and H (Clue 4)**\n*   **D(g) + B(g) → H(solvent) (1:1 ratio)**\n*   We identified **B = Cl₂**. So, D(g) + Cl₂(g) → H(solvent).\n*   A common reaction that fits this is the addition of chlorine to ethene:\n    **C₂H₄(g) + Cl₂(g) → C₂H₄Cl₂(l)** (1,2-dichloroethane)\n*   1,2-dichloroethane is a liquid and is widely used as a solvent.\n*   So, we can identify:\n    *   **D = C₂H₄** (Ethene)\n    *   **H = C₂H₄Cl₂** (1,2-dichloroethane)\n\n**4.  Identifying the Hazardous Product E (Clue 2)**\n*   **C + 2 equivalents of gas D → extremely hazardous product E**\n*   Substituting our identified compounds:\n    **SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E**\n*   This is the well-known Levinstein process for the synthesis of **mustard gas**:\n    **SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**\n*   Mustard gas, or bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide, is an extremely hazardous chemical warfare agent. This fits the description perfectly.\n*   So, **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂** (Mustard Gas).\n\n**5.  Determining the Molecular Symmetry Group of E**\n*   The question asks for the molecular symmetry group of **E = S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂**.\n*   The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two chloroethyl groups: Cl-CH₂-CH₂-S-CH₂-CH₂-Cl.\n*   The molecule is not planar. The C-S-C bond is bent due to the lone pairs on the sulfur atom. The ethyl chains are flexible and can adopt various conformations.\n*   We need to consider the symmetry of the most stable, idealized conformation. In this conformation, the molecule can possess a two-fold rotational axis (C₂) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle. This requires the two -(CH₂)₂Cl arms to be conformationally equivalent but related by a 180° rotation.\n*   The molecule does not have any mirror planes (σ) or a center of inversion (i).\n*   A molecule that has only a single C₂ axis of symmetry (and the identity element E) belongs to the **C₂** point group. Molecules in this group are chiral.\n\n**Conclusion**\nAll clues consistently point to the final product E being mustard gas, S(CH₂CH₂Cl)₂, which has a C₂ symmetry.\n\nFinal Answer check:\n*   A) D4h: High symmetry (e.g., square planar with inversion). Does not fit mustard gas.\n*   B) D∞h: Linear with an inversion center (e.g., CO₂). Does not fit.\n*   C) C2v: Planar or tetrahedral-like with two mirror planes (e.g., H₂O, SO₂Cl₂). Does not fit the twisted structure of mustard gas.\n*   D) C2: Chiral with a single 2-fold rotation axis. This perfectly describes the symmetry of the most stable conformation of mustard gas.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of E is C₂.\n\n<<<D>>>"
