    "This problem is solved using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\n1.  **Understand the Principle:** The energy-time uncertainty principle states that for a quantum state with a finite lifetime (Δt), there is an inherent uncertainty or \"spread\" in its energy (ΔE). The relationship is given by:\n    ΔE ⋅ Δt ≥ ħ / 2\n    For order-of-magnitude calculations, we can approximate this as ΔE ≈ ħ / τ, where τ is the lifetime of the state and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s). This energy uncertainty ΔE is also known as the natural linewidth of the energy level.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Energy Linewidth for Each State:**\n    *   **State 1:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n    *   **State 2:**\n        *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n        *   Energy width ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\n3.  **Determine the Condition for Resolution:** For two energy levels to be \"clearly resolved\" or distinguished, the difference in their energies, |E₂ - E₁|, must be larger than their energy widths. A common criterion is that the energy difference should be at least as large as the larger of the two linewidths.\n\n    The larger linewidth is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. Therefore, for the levels to be clearly resolved, the energy difference must satisfy:\n    |E₂ - E₁| > 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   A) 10⁻⁴ eV > 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This energy difference is much larger than the linewidth, so the levels can be clearly resolved.\n    *   B) 10⁻⁸ eV < 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This difference is smaller than the linewidth of State 1, so the levels would overlap and not be resolved.\n    *   C) 10⁻⁹ eV < 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This difference is much smaller than the linewidths, so the levels would overlap significantly.\n    *   D) 10⁻¹¹ eV < 6.6 x 10⁻⁷ eV. This difference is far too small for the levels to be resolved.\n\nThe only option that provides a large enough energy separation is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<A>>>"
