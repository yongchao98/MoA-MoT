    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to find the enthalpy of formation.\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula and Structure**\nThe compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\nLet's count the number of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms:\n*   (CH3)2C= contributes 3 C and 6 H.\n*   =CH- contributes 1 C and 1 H.\n*   -CH2- contributes 1 C and 2 H.\n*   -CH(CH3)- contributes 2 C and 4 H.\n*   -CH2- contributes 1 C and 2 H.\n*   -CH= contributes 1 C and 1 H.\n*   =C(CH3)2 contributes 3 C and 6 H.\n\nTotal Carbon atoms = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12 C.\nTotal Hydrogen atoms = 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22 H.\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Bonds**\nTo calculate the total bond energy of the molecule, we need to count each type of bond from its structure.\n*   **C=C bonds:** There are two double bonds in the structure: (CH3)2**C=C**H- and -**C**H=**C**(CH3)2. So, there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds:**\n    *   Bonds connecting the main chain carbons: -C=CH-**CH2**-CH(CH3)-**CH2**-CH=C- (4 bonds, but we need to count C-C single bonds only).\n    *   Let's count from the structure segments: (CH3)2C= (2 C-C), =CH-CH2- (1 C-C), -CH2-CH(CH3)- (1 C-C), -CH(CH3)- (1 C-C to the methyl), -CH(CH3)-CH2- (1 C-C), -CH2-CH= (1 C-C), =C(CH3)2 (2 C-C).\n    *   Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n*   **C-H bonds:** The number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, which is **22 C-H bonds**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\nThe enthalpy of atomization of the compound is the sum of the bond energies of all the bonds in one mole of the gaseous molecule.\nGiven bond energies:\n*   BE(C=C) = 300 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-C) = 200 kJ/mol\n*   BE(C-H) = 400 kJ/mol\n\nSum of bond energies (ΔH_atomization_compound) = [2 × BE(C=C)] + [9 × BE(C-C)] + [22 × BE(C-H)]\nΔH_atomization_compound = [2 × 300] + [9 × 200] + [22 × 400]\nΔH_atomization_compound = 600 + 1800 + 8800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n(Note: This value corresponds to option A, which is an intermediate calculation and not the final answer).\n\n**4. Calculate the Sum of Enthalpies of Atomization of the Elements**\nThe formation of the compound C12H22 is from its elements in their standard states:\n12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → C12H22(g)\n\nWe need the enthalpy change to convert the reactants into gaseous atoms:\n12 C(s) + 11 H2(g) → 12 C(g) + 22 H(g)\n\nThis enthalpy change is the sum of the enthalpies of atomization of the elements.\nGiven data:\n*   Enthalpy of atomization of carbon, ΔH_atom(C) = 1000 kJ/mol [for C(s) → C(g)]\n*   Bond energy of H-H, BE(H-H) = 100 kJ/mol [for H2(g) → 2H(g)]\n\nThe total enthalpy of atomization of elements (ΔH_atomization_elements) is for creating 12 moles of C(g) and 22 moles of H(g).\nΔH_atomization_elements = [12 × ΔH_atom(C)] + [11 × BE(H-H)]\nΔH_atomization_elements = [12 × 1000] + [11 × 100]\nΔH_atomization_elements = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\nThe enthalpy of formation is given by the formula:\nΔH_f = (Sum of enthalpies of atomization of elements) - (Sum of bond energies of the compound)\nΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol\nΔH_f = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**6. Analyze the Options**\nThe calculated enthalpy of formation is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's look at the given options:\nA) 11200 kJ/mol (This is the enthalpy of atomization of the compound, not the enthalpy of formation)\nB) 1900 kJ/g (The numerical value matches our result, but the unit is kJ/g, not kJ/mol. As written, this value is physically implausible for a chemical enthalpy change.)\nC) 67.4 kJ/mol (This value appears to be the enthalpy of atomization per gram but with incorrect units.)\nD) 11.44 kJ/g (This is the enthalpy of formation in units of kJ/g.)\n\nLet's convert our calculated enthalpy of formation from kJ/mol to kJ/g to check option D.\nFirst, we need the molar mass of C12H22. Using integer atomic masses (C≈12 g/mol, H≈1 g/mol):\nMolar Mass (M) = (12 × 12) + (22 × 1) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\nNow, convert ΔH_f to kJ/g:\nΔH_f (kJ/g) = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ 11.4457... kJ/g.\n\nThis value, when rounded to two decimal places, is 11.45 kJ/g, which is very close to option D's value of 11.44 kJ/g. The minor difference can be attributed to rounding or the use of slightly different atomic masses in the problem's design.\n\nComparing options B and D, option D is the most plausible answer. It represents the correctly calculated quantity with consistent units, whereas option B is physically nonsensical as written (1900 kJ/g is an extremely large value for specific enthalpy).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is the specific enthalpy of formation (enthalpy per gram).\n\n<<<D>>>"
