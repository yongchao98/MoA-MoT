    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\nThis problem can be solved using the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum from the theory of special relativity.\n\nLet $m$ be the rest mass of both the electron and the positron, and $c$ be the speed of light. The horizontal axis is the x-axis. The electron moves in the +x direction, and the positron moves in the -x direction.\n\n### 1. Initial State (Before Collision)\n\nWe first calculate the energy and momentum of the electron and the positron before they collide.\n\n*   **For a particle with rest mass $m$ and Lorentz factor $\\gamma$:**\n    *   Total energy is $E = \\gamma m c^2$.\n    *   Momentum magnitude is $p = \\sqrt{E^2/c^2 - m^2 c^2} = \\sqrt{(\\gamma m c^2)^2/c^2 - m^2 c^2} = \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 m^2 c^2 - m^2 c^2} = m c \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\n\n*   **Electron:**\n    *   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_e = 4$.\n    *   Energy: $E_e = 4 m c^2$.\n    *   Momentum: $p_e = m c \\sqrt{4^2 - 1} = m c \\sqrt{15}$. Since it moves from the left, its momentum is in the positive x-direction: $p_{ex} = +\\sqrt{15} m c$.\n\n*   **Positron:**\n    *   Lorentz factor $\\gamma_p = 2$.\n    *   Energy: $E_p = 2 m c^2$.\n    *   Momentum: $p_p = m c \\sqrt{2^2 - 1} = m c \\sqrt{3}$. Since it moves from the right, its momentum is in the negative x-direction: $p_{px} = -\\sqrt{3} m c$.\n\n*   **Total Initial System:**\n    *   Total Energy: $E_{initial} = E_e + E_p = 4 m c^2 + 2 m c^2 = 6 m c^2$.\n    *   Total Momentum (x-component): $P_{x, initial} = p_{ex} + p_{px} = \\sqrt{15} m c - \\sqrt{3} m c = (\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m c$.\n    *   Total Momentum (y-component): $P_{y, initial} = 0$, as both particles move along the horizontal axis.\n\n### 2. Final State (After Annihilation)\n\nThe final state consists of two photons.\n\n*   **For a photon:**\n    *   Energy: $E_\\gamma$.\n    *   Momentum: $p_\\gamma = E_\\gamma / c$.\n\nWe are told the two photons have the same energy, let's call it $E_\\gamma$.\nPhoton 1 moves in the upper-right direction at an angle $\\theta$ with the horizontal axis.\nPhoton 2 moves in the lower-right direction. Due to the symmetry of the problem (initial y-momentum is zero and final photon energies are equal), its angle must be $-\\theta$ with the horizontal axis.\n\n*   **Photon 1:**\n    *   Momentum components: $p_{\\gamma 1, x} = (E_\\gamma / c) \\cos\\theta$, $p_{\\gamma 1, y} = (E_\\gamma / c) \\sin\\theta$.\n*   **Photon 2:**\n    *   Momentum components: $p_{\\gamma 2, x} = (E_\\gamma / c) \\cos(-\\theta) = (E_\\gamma / c) \\cos\\theta$, $p_{\\gamma 2, y} = (E_\\gamma / c) \\sin(-\\theta) = -(E_\\gamma / c) \\sin\\theta$.\n\n*   **Total Final System:**\n    *   Total Energy: $E_{final} = E_\\gamma + E_\\gamma = 2 E_\\gamma$.\n    *   Total Momentum (x-component): $P_{x, final} = p_{\\gamma 1, x} + p_{\\gamma 2, x} = 2 (E_\\gamma / c) \\cos\\theta$.\n    *   Total Momentum (y-component): $P_{y, final} = p_{\\gamma 1, y} + p_{\\gamma 2, y} = (E_\\gamma / c) \\sin\\theta - (E_\\gamma / c) \\sin\\theta = 0$.\n\n### 3. Applying Conservation Laws\n\nNow we equate the initial and final total energy and momentum.\n\n*   **Conservation of Energy:**\n    *   $E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n    *   $6 m c^2 = 2 E_\\gamma$\n    *   $E_\\gamma = 3 m c^2$.\n    Each photon has an energy of $3 m c^2$.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum (y-component):**\n    *   $P_{y, initial} = P_{y, final}$\n    *   $0 = 0$. This is consistent with our assumption of symmetric angles.\n\n*   **Conservation of Momentum (x-component):**\n    *   $P_{x, initial} = P_{x, final}$\n    *   $(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m c = 2 (E_\\gamma / c) \\cos\\theta$.\n\n### 4. Solving for the Angle\n\nSubstitute the value of $E_\\gamma$ we found from energy conservation into the momentum conservation equation:\n$(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m c = 2 ((3 m c^2) / c) \\cos\\theta$\n$(\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}) m c = 6 m c \\cos\\theta$\n\nWe can cancel the $mc$ term from both sides:\n$\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3} = 6 \\cos\\theta$\n\nNow, solve for $\\cos\\theta$:\n$\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{15} - \\sqrt{3}}{6}$\n\nLet's calculate the numerical value:\n$\\sqrt{15} \\approx 3.8730$\n$\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.7321$\n\n$\\cos\\theta \\approx \\frac{3.8730 - 1.7321}{6} = \\frac{2.1409}{6} \\approx 0.3568$\n\nNow we find the angle $\\theta$:\n$\\theta = \\arccos(0.3568) \\approx 69.09^\\circ$\n\nThe question asks for the angle **between** the directions of the two photons. This angle is $2\\theta$.\nAngle between photons = $2\\theta \\approx 2 \\times 69.09^\\circ = 138.18^\\circ$.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 96\nB) 74\nC) 172\nD) 138\n\nThe calculated value of $138.18^\\circ$ is closest to 138.\n\n<<<D>>>"
