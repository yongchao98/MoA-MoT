    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Basic Structure:**\n    *   The compound is a **di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring**. This means we start with a benzene ring that has two substituents, giving a core formula of `C6H4`. The four protons on the ring account for the aromatic signals. The presence of two signals for these four protons suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern, likely para (1,4) substitution.\n    *   The **FTIR spectrum indicates an ester group**. An ester has the functional group `-COO-`, which contains two oxygen atoms.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Vinyl-H signals:** There are two signals for vinyl protons (protons on a C=C double bond).\n        *   One is a **doublet**. This means it is coupled to only one other proton.\n        *   One is a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. The \"doublet\" part means it is coupled to one proton (the other vinyl proton). The \"quartet\" part means it is also coupled to three equivalent protons, which must be a methyl (-CH3) group.\n        *   This specific splitting pattern is characteristic of a **propenyl group**, `-CH=CH-CH3`. The proton on the central carbon is the doublet of quartets, and the proton on the terminal carbon (next to the ring) is the doublet. This fragment has the formula `C3H5`.\n\n    *   **-CH3 group signals:** There are two signals for methyl groups.\n        *   One of these signals corresponds to the methyl group in the propenyl fragment (`-CH=CH-CH3`). This methyl group is adjacent to a vinyl proton, so its signal would be a doublet.\n        *   The second methyl signal must come from another `-CH3` group elsewhere in the molecule. Given the presence of an ester, this is very likely the methyl part of a methyl ester (`-COOCH3`). A methyl group in this position is not adjacent to any protons, so its signal would be a singlet. This fragment contributes `C1H3`.\n\n    *   **Absence of -CH2 signals:** This is a crucial constraint, confirming there are no ethyl, propyl, or other alkyl chains containing a `-CH2-` unit. Our deduced fragments (propenyl, methyl) are consistent with this.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Fragments and Determine the Formula:**\n    Now, let's combine the identified fragments to build the whole molecule and find its formula.\n    *   Aromatic Ring: `C6H4`\n    *   Propenyl Group: `C3H5`\n    *   Ester group (with its methyl): This would be a methyl ester group `-COOCH3`. The formula for this fragment is `C2H3O2`.\n\n    Let's sum the atoms from these fragments:\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (from C6H4) + 3 (from C3H5) + 2 (from C2H3O2) = 11 carbons\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 (from C6H4) + 5 (from C3H5) + 3 (from C2H3O2) = 12 hydrogens\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from C2H3O2)\n\n    The resulting molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n    The structure is likely methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate (or its ortho/meta isomer). This structure is fully consistent with all the provided data.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   **A) C11H12O2:** This matches our derived formula.\n    *   B) C12H14O2: This formula contains an extra C and two extra H's (`CH2`) compared to our derived formula. The problem states there are no `-CH2-` signals.\n    *   C) C11H14O2: This formula contains two extra H's, which would imply the absence of the C=C double bond (and thus no vinyl-H signals).\n    *   D) C12H12O2: This formula contains an extra carbon atom, which cannot be reconciled with the fragments identified from the NMR spectrum.\n\nThe only formula that fits all the spectroscopic evidence is C11H12O2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
