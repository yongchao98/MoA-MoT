    "To solve this problem, we need to use the normalization condition from quantum mechanics. The normalization condition states that the total probability of finding the particle anywhere it can exist must be equal to 1.\n\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n∫ |ψ(x)|² dx = 1\n\nWhere the integral is taken over all space where the particle can be found.\n\nHere's the step-by-step calculation:\n\n**1. Define the Wave Function and its domain**\nThe wave function is given as:\nψ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nWe are told the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3. This means our integration limits will be from 1 to 3.\n\n**2. Calculate the Probability Density, |ψ(x)|²**\nThe probability density is the wave function multiplied by its complex conjugate.\nThe complex conjugate, ψ*(x), is found by changing the sign of the imaginary part:\nψ*(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i\n\nNow, we calculate |ψ(x)|² = ψ*(x) * ψ(x):\n|ψ(x)|² = [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i ] * [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i ]\n\nUsing the formula (A + Bi)(A - Bi) = A² + B², where A = a / sqrt(1 + x) and B = 0.5:\n|ψ(x)|² = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) )² + (0.5)²\n|ψ(x)|² = a² / (1 + x) + 0.25\n\n**3. Set up the Normalization Integral**\nNow we plug the probability density into the normalization equation with the given limits:\n∫[from 1 to 3] ( a² / (1 + x) + 0.25 ) dx = 1\n\n**4. Solve the Integral**\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n∫[from 1 to 3] ( a² / (1 + x) ) dx + ∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = 1\n\n*   **First part:**\n    ∫[from 1 to 3] ( a² / (1 + x) ) dx = a² * [ln(1 + x)] from 1 to 3\n    = a² * [ln(1 + 3) - ln(1 + 1)]\n    = a² * [ln(4) - ln(2)]\n    Using the logarithm rule ln(A) - ln(B) = ln(A/B):\n    = a² * ln(4/2)\n    = a² * ln(2)\n\n*   **Second part:**\n    ∫[from 1 to 3] 0.25 dx = [0.25x] from 1 to 3\n    = 0.25 * (3 - 1)\n    = 0.25 * 2\n    = 0.5\n\n**5. Solve for \"a\"**\nNow, substitute the results back into the equation:\n(a² * ln(2)) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nUsing the value ln(2) ≈ 0.6931:\na² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931\na² ≈ 0.7214\na = sqrt(0.7214)\na ≈ 0.849\n\nThis value is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<C>>>"
