    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n*   The molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as:\n    DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) - (X/2)\n    DoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) - (0/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n*   A DoU of 5 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 DoU) and one additional double bond (e.g., C=O), which accounts for 1 DoU.\n\n**2. IR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** This pair of absorptions in the N-H stretching region is highly characteristic of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong band is in the carbonyl (C=O) stretching region. This value is typical for an ester, especially one that is conjugated with a double bond or an aromatic ring. It is too high for a typical amide (~1650 cm⁻¹) and fits an ester better than other carbonyl compounds in this context.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n    *   These signals are in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm).\n    *   The presence of two doublets, each integrating to 2H, is a classic pattern for a **para-disubstituted** (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring.\n    *   The significant chemical shift difference between the doublets indicates that one substituent is strongly electron-donating and the other is strongly electron-withdrawing. The electron-donating group shields the ortho protons (lower ppm), while the electron-withdrawing group deshields its ortho protons (higher ppm).\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n    *   This is a triplet integrating to 3H, indicating a methyl (-CH3) group adjacent to a methylene (-CH2) group.\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n    *   This is a quartet integrating to 2H, indicating a methylene (-CH2) group adjacent to a methyl (-CH3) group.\n    *   The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm is the signature pattern for an **ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**.\n    *   The very downfield chemical shift of the quartet (4.5 ppm) shows that the -CH2 group is attached to a highly electronegative atom, specifically the oxygen of an ester (-C(=O)O-CH2-).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n    *   This broad singlet integrating to 2H is consistent with the two protons of the primary amine (-NH2) group identified in the IR spectrum. The broadness is due to quadrupole relaxation and potential chemical exchange. Its chemical shift is within the expected range for aromatic amine protons.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure:**\n*   From the DoU and NMR, we have a **para-disubstituted benzene ring**.\n*   From the IR and NMR (4.0 ppm peak), we have a **primary amine (-NH2) group**.\n*   From the IR, NMR (ethyl pattern), and high chemical shift of the quartet, we have an **ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3)**.\n\nCombining these fragments, the only logical structure is an ethyl benzoate molecule with an amino group. Given the para-substitution pattern, the groups must be at the 1 and 4 positions.\n\nThe structure is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.\n\nLet's check this proposed structure against the data:\n*   **Structure:** Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (also known as Benzocaine).\n*   **Formula:** C9H11NO2 (matches).\n*   **IR:** -NH2 group gives two peaks (~3400 cm⁻¹), and a conjugated ester C=O gives a peak ~1720 cm⁻¹ (matches).\n*   **¹H NMR:**\n    *   -NH2 at position 4 is an electron-donating group.\n    *   -COOCH2CH3 at position 1 is an electron-withdrawing group.\n    *   The protons ortho to the -NH2 group (at positions 3 and 5) would be shielded, appearing at a lower chemical shift (~7.0 ppm).\n    *   The protons ortho to the -COOCH2CH3 group (at positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded, appearing at a higher chemical shift (~8.0 ppm).\n    *   The ethyl group (-OCH2CH3) would show a quartet and a triplet.\n    *   The amine protons (-NH2) would show a broad signal.\n    *   This all perfectly matches the provided NMR data.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options:**\n*   A) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Incorrect NMR. The ethyl group is part of a propionate, so the -CH2- would be next to the C=O, appearing at ~2.5 ppm, not 4.5 ppm.\n*   B) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Incorrect substitution (meta, not para) and incorrect functional group (amide C=O at ~1650 cm⁻¹, not ester C=O at 1720 cm⁻¹).\n*   **C) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Matches all data perfectly.**\n*   D) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Incorrect functional groups. This is a secondary amide, which would show only one N-H peak in the IR, and has a formyl proton (H-C=O) signal in the NMR that is absent in the data.\n\nThe correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
