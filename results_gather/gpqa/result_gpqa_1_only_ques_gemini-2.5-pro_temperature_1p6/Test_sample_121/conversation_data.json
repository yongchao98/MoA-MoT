    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence and the structure of the final product, followed by an analysis of its 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n**Step 1: Synthesis of Product 1**\n*   **Reactants:** Acetic acid (CH3COOH), bromine (Br2), pyridine, acetic anhydride ((CH3CO)2O), heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is an α-bromination of acetic acid. Although the reagents are not the classic Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky (HVZ) conditions (PBr3/Br2), the outcome is the same. The reaction replaces one of the α-hydrogens of acetic acid with a bromine atom.\n*   CH3COOH + Br2 → BrCH2COOH + HBr\n*   **Product 1:** Bromoacetic acid (BrCH2COOH).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesis of Product 2**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 1 (Bromoacetic acid), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, catalyst), heating.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Fischer esterification. The carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol under acidic catalysis to form an ester.\n*   BrCH2COOH + CH3CH2OH --(H+)--> BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + H2O\n*   **Product 2:** Ethyl bromoacetate (BrCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis of Product 3**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 2 (Ethyl bromoacetate), sodium cyanide (NaCN).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The cyanide ion (CN-), a good nucleophile, attacks the α-carbon and displaces the bromide ion.\n*   BrCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaCN → NCCH2COOCH2CH3 + NaBr\n*   **Product 3:** Ethyl cyanoacetate (NCCH2COOCH2CH3).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesis of Product 4**\n*   **Reactants:** Product 3 (Ethyl cyanoacetate), excess sodium hydride (NaH), 1,5-dibromopentane (Br-(CH2)5-Br).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a two-step process:\n    1.  **Deprotonation:** Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base that deprotonates the α-carbon of ethyl cyanoacetate. This carbon is acidic because it is flanked by two electron-withdrawing groups (CN and COOEt).\n        NCCH2COOEt + NaH → [NCCHCOOEt]- Na+ + H2\n    2.  **Alkylation and Cyclization:** The resulting enolate is a nucleophile. It reacts with 1,5-dibromopentane in an SN2 reaction.\n        [NCCHCOOEt]- + Br(CH2)5Br → NCCH(COOEt)(CH2)5Br + Br-\n        The problem states that **excess** NaH is used. This means the newly formed product, which still has one acidic α-proton, is deprotonated again.\n        NCCH(COOEt)(CH2)5Br + NaH → [NCC(COOEt)(CH2)5Br]- Na+ + H2\n        This new carbanion then undergoes a rapid intramolecular SN2 reaction, attacking the carbon at the other end of the pentyl chain and displacing the second bromide ion to form a stable 6-membered ring.\n*   **Product 4:** The final product is **Ethyl 1-cyanocyclohexane-1-carboxylate**.\n\n**1H NMR Analysis of Product 4**\n\nTo determine the number of distinct hydrogen signals, we must analyze the symmetry of the molecule.\nThe structure is a cyclohexane ring substituted at C1 with a cyano (-CN) group and an ethoxycarbonyl (-COOCH2CH3) group.\n\n1.  **Symmetry of the Molecule:**\n    *   Let's check for chirality at C1. The four groups attached are -CN, -COOEt, and the two paths around the ring (-C2-C3-... and -C6-C5-...). Since the two paths around the ring are identical, C1 is **not a stereocenter**.\n    *   A molecule without a stereocenter is typically achiral. Achiral molecules must possess a plane of symmetry, a center of inversion, or an axis of improper rotation.\n    *   Assuming fast conformational averaging (rapid chair-flipping and bond rotation) at room temperature, the molecule has an effective **plane of symmetry**. This plane passes through C1, C4, the linear cyano group, and the atoms of the ester group (assuming a planar conformation).\n    *   This plane of symmetry makes the two halves of the ring mirror images of each other. Therefore, C2 is equivalent to C6, and C3 is equivalent to C5.\n\n2.  **Counting the Signals:**\n\n    *   **Ring Protons:**\n        *   We have three distinct sets of methylene (CH2) groups in the ring: the C2/C6 pair, the C3/C5 pair, and the unique C4.\n        *   On each of these carbons, the two protons (the axial-like and equatorial-like protons in the time-averaged structure) are **diastereotopic**. They are in chemically different environments relative to the substituents on C1 and are not interchangeable by the plane of symmetry.\n        *   Protons on C2/C6: 2 distinct signals.\n        *   Protons on C3/C5: 2 distinct signals.\n        *   Protons on C4: 2 distinct signals.\n        *   Total ring proton signals = 2 + 2 + 2 = **6 signals**.\n\n    *   **Ethyl Group Protons (-OCH2CH3):**\n        *   **Methyl (-CH3):** The three protons of the methyl group are equivalent due to free rotation. This gives **1 signal**.\n        *   **Methylene (-OCH2-):** The plane of symmetry of the molecule contains the O-CH2 bond. The plane bisects the H-C-H angle. This makes the two methylene protons **enantiotopic**. Enantiotopic protons are chemically equivalent in a standard (achiral) NMR solvent. Therefore, they give rise to **1 signal**.\n        *   Total ethyl group signals = 1 + 1 = **2 signals**.\n\n3.  **Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Total signals = (Ring signals) + (Ethyl signals) = 6 + 2 = **8 signals**.\n\nTherefore, there will be 8 distinct hydrogen signals observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4.\n\n<<<D>>>"
