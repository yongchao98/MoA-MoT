    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical species and their roles.**\n    *   The solution contains KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O dissolved in water.\n    *   KH₂PO₄ dissolves to form K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻ (dihydrogen phosphate). H₂PO₄⁻ acts as a weak acid in this context.\n    *   Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O dissolves to form 2 Na⁺ and HPO₄²⁻ (hydrogen phosphate). HPO₄²⁻ is the conjugate base of H₂PO₄⁻.\n    *   Together, H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ form a buffer solution. The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is the conjugate base of HPO₄²⁻.\n\n2.  **Calculate the molar amounts of the buffer components.**\n    *   Molar mass of KH₂PO₄ = 136.09 g/mol\n    *   Molar mass of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = 177.99 g/mol\n    *   Volume of solution = 200.00 cm³ = 0.20000 L\n\n    *   Moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of HPO₄²⁻ = mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n3.  **Calculate the initial concentrations of the buffer components.**\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = Moles / Volume = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = Moles / Volume = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n4.  **Calculate the hydrogen ion concentration, [H⁺].**\n    The [H⁺] is determined by the buffer equilibrium involving the second dissociation of phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄):\n    H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ HPO₄²⁻ + H⁺, with Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸\n\n    The equilibrium expression is:\n    Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n\n    Rearranging to solve for [H⁺] and using the initial concentrations as a good approximation for the equilibrium concentrations in a buffer:\n    [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    [H⁺] = 8.11x10⁻⁸ M\n\n5.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration, [PO₄³⁻].**\n    The orthophosphate ion concentration is determined by the third dissociation equilibrium:\n    HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ PO₄³⁻ + H⁺, with Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹²\n\n    The equilibrium expression is:\n    Ka₃ = [PO₄³⁻][H⁺] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\n    Rearranging to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n    [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n\n    Now, substitute the known values. The concentration of HPO₄²⁻ is its initial concentration, and [H⁺] is the value we just calculated, which is controlled by the main buffer equilibrium.\n    [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11x10⁻⁸ M)\n    [PO₄³⁻] = 6.236x10⁻⁷ M\n\n    Rounding to three significant figures, the concentration is 6.24x10⁻⁷ M.\n\nComparing this result to the given options:\nA) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\nB) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\nC) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\nD) 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
