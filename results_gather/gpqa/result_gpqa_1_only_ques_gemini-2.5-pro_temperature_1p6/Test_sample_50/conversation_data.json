    "To solve this problem, we will use the method of images.\n\n### 1. The Method of Images\n\nThe system of a point charge `q` at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` can be replaced by an equivalent electrostatic problem. This equivalent problem consists of the original charge `q` and an \"image charge\" `q'`. The image charge is placed inside the sphere at a position such that the potential on the surface of the sphere (at r=R) is zero.\n\nThe properties of the image charge `q'` are:\n*   **Magnitude:** `q' = -q * (R/d)`\n*   **Position:** It is located on the line connecting the center of the sphere and the charge `q`, at a distance `b` from the center, where `b = R^2 / d`.\n\nThe electric field and potential *outside* the sphere in the original problem are identical to those produced by the charge `q` and the image charge `q'` in the equivalent problem.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Potential Energy\n\nThe net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its final position at distance `d`. There are two common ways to calculate this.\n\n#### Method 1: Using the definition of potential energy from work done\n\nThe potential energy `U` is the work done `W` to assemble the system. Let's calculate the work done by an external agent to bring the charge `q` from infinity to a distance `d` from the center of the sphere.\n\n`U = W = - ∫_∞^d F(x) dx`\n\nHere, `F(x)` is the electric force on the charge `q` when it is at a distance `x` from the center of the sphere. This force is due to the induced charges on the grounded sphere. In our image charge model, this is the attractive force exerted by the image charge `q'`.\n\nWhen the charge `q` is at a distance `x` from the center:\n*   The image charge is `q'(x) = -q * R / x`.\n*   The position of the image charge is `b(x) = R^2 / x`.\n*   The distance between `q` and `q'` is `x - b(x) = x - R^2/x`.\n\nThe force on `q` is:\n`F(x) = k * q * q'(x) / (x - b(x))^2`\n`F(x) = k * q * (-qR/x) / (x - R^2/x)^2`\n`F(x) = - (k * q^2 * R / x) / ((x^2 - R^2)/x)^2`\n`F(x) = - (k * q^2 * R / x) * (x^2 / (x^2 - R^2)^2)`\n`F(x) = -k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2`\n\nNow we integrate this force to find the work done (potential energy):\n`U = - ∫_∞^d F(x) dx = - ∫_∞^d [-k * q^2 * R * x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * ∫_∞^d [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx`\n\nTo solve the integral, we use the substitution `u = x^2 - R^2`, which means `du = 2x dx`, or `x dx = du / 2`.\n`∫ [x / (x^2 - R^2)^2] dx = ∫ (1/u^2) (du/2) = (1/2) * (-1/u) = -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2))`\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral:\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(x^2 - R^2)) ]_∞^d`\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ (-1 / (2(d^2 - R^2))) - (-1 / (2(∞^2 - R^2))) ]`\nSince `1/∞ -> 0`, the second term vanishes.\n`U = k * q^2 * R * [ -1 / (2(d^2 - R^2)) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n#### Method 2: Using the electrostatic energy formula\n\nThe potential energy of a system consisting of a point charge `q` and conductors is given by:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n\nwhere `V_induced` is the potential at the location of the charge `q` created by all other charges (in this case, the induced charges on the sphere). The factor of 1/2 arises because the induced charges are built up as the charge `q` is brought in.\n\nThe potential `V_induced` at distance `d` is, by the method of images, the potential created by the image charge `q'` at that point.\n*   The image charge `q' = -qR/d` is at position `b = R^2/d`.\n*   The distance from the image charge `q'` to the real charge `q` is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n\nThe potential `V_induced` at position `d` is:\n`V_induced = k * q' / (d - b)`\n`V_induced = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n`V_induced = - k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nNow, we plug this into the energy formula:\n`U = (1/2) * q * V_induced`\n`U = (1/2) * q * [ -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2) ]`\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same result for the net potential energy of the system.\n`U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) `U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)`\nB) `U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)`\nC) `U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)`\nD) `U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)`\n\nThe calculated result matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
