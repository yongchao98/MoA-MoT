    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the correct equation.\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant physical law:** The problem deals with the population of atomic energy levels in stellar photospheres, which are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The appropriate formula to describe this situation is the **Boltzmann Equation**:\n    \n    $\\frac{N_b}{N_a} = \\frac{g_b}{g_a} e^{(-(E_b - E_a))/(k_B T)}$\n    \n    Where:\n    *   $N_b$ and $N_a$ are the number of atoms in an excited state (b) and a lower energy state (a), respectively.\n    *   $g_b$ and $g_a$ are the statistical weights of the states.\n    *   $\\Delta E = E_b - E_a$ is the energy difference between the states.\n    *   $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant ($k_B \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K).\n    *   T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n2.  **Apply the Boltzmann Equation to each star:**\n    Let's write the equation for star_1 (temperature $T_1$) and star_2 (temperature $T_2$). The ratio of statistical weights ($g_b/g_a$) and the energy difference ($\\Delta E$) are properties of the iron atom and are the same for both stars.\n    \n    For star_1:\n    $(\\frac{N_b}{N_a})_1 = \\frac{g_b}{g_a} e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_1)}$\n    \n    For star_2:\n    $(\\frac{N_b}{N_a})_2 = \\frac{g_b}{g_a} e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_2)}$\n\n3.  **Use the information given in the problem:**\n    We are told that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. This means the ratio of atoms in the excited state to the lower state is twice as large for star_1:\n    \n    $(\\frac{N_b}{N_a})_1 = 2 \\times (\\frac{N_b}{N_a})_2$\n\n4.  **Combine the equations:**\n    Substitute the Boltzmann expressions into the relationship from step 3:\n    \n    $\\frac{g_b}{g_a} e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_1)} = 2 \\times (\\frac{g_b}{g_a} e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_2)})$\n    \n    The term $\\frac{g_b}{g_a}$ cancels out from both sides:\n    \n    $e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_1)} = 2 \\cdot e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_2)}$\n\n5.  **Solve for the temperatures:**\n    To solve this equation, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    \n    $ln(e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_1)}) = ln(2 \\cdot e^{-\\Delta E / (k_B T_2)})$\n    \n    Using the logarithm properties ($ln(ab) = ln(a) + ln(b)$ and $ln(e^x) = x$):\n    \n    $-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T_1} = ln(2) + (-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T_2})$\n    \n    Rearrange the terms to isolate $ln(2)$:\n    \n    $\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T_2} - \\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T_1} = ln(2)$\n    \n    Factor out the common term $\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B}$:\n    \n    $\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B} (\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1}) = ln(2)$\n    \n    Combine the fractions in the parenthesis:\n    \n    $\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B} (\\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}) = ln(2)$\n\n6.  **Incorporate the given numerical values:**\n    The problem states that the energy difference is $\\Delta E \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J. The Boltzmann constant is $k_B \\approx 1.38 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K.\n    \n    Therefore, the pre-factor is:\n    \n    $\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B} = \\frac{1.38 \\times 10^{-23} J}{1.38 \\times 10^{-23} J/K} = 1 K$\n    \n    Substituting this value into our equation:\n    \n    $1 \\cdot (\\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}) = ln(2)$\n    \n    This simplifies to:\n    \n    $ln(2) = \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}$\n\n7.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The derived equation matches option B.\n\n    A) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n    B) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n    C) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n    D) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n\nThe correct equation is option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
