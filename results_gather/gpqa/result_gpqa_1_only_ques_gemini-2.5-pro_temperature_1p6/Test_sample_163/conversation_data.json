    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics**\n\nThe problem involves two double-lined spectroscopic binary star systems that are also eclipsing. This provides us with key information:\n*   **Double-lined spectroscopic binary:** We have the radial velocity (RV) amplitudes ($K_1$, $K_2$) for both stars in each system.\n*   **Eclipsing binary:** This means we are viewing the systems nearly edge-on. Therefore, we can assume the inclination angle $i$ is approximately 90 degrees, which means $\\sin(i) \\approx 1$.\n*   **Sinusoidal RV variations:** This suggests the orbits are approximately circular, allowing us to use simplified formulas.\n\nThe total mass ($M_{total} = m_1 + m_2$) of a double-lined spectroscopic binary can be determined using a formula derived from Kepler's Third Law:\n\n$M_{total} = \\frac{P(K_1 + K_2)^3}{2\\pi G \\sin^3 i}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $M_{total}$ is the sum of the masses of the two stars.\n*   $P$ is the orbital period.\n*   $K_1$ and $K_2$ are the amplitudes of the radial velocities for the two stars.\n*   $G$ is the gravitational constant.\n*   $i$ is the orbital inclination.\n\nSince the systems are eclipsing, we assume $i = 90^\\circ$, so $\\sin^3(i) = 1$. The formula simplifies to:\n\n$M_{total} = \\frac{P(K_1 + K_2)^3}{2\\pi G}$\n\n**2. List the Given Data**\n\n*   **System 1:**\n    *   Period, $P_1 = 2$ years\n    *   RV amplitude of star 1, $K_{1,1} = 10$ km/s\n    *   RV amplitude of star 2, $K_{1,2} = 5$ km/s\n    *   Total RV amplitude, $K_{total,1} = K_{1,1} + K_{1,2} = 10 + 5 = 15$ km/s\n\n*   **System 2:**\n    *   Period, $P_2 = 1$ year\n    *   RV amplitude of star 1, $K_{2,1} = 15$ km/s\n    *   RV amplitude of star 2, $K_{2,2} = 10$ km/s\n    *   Total RV amplitude, $K_{total,2} = K_{2,1} + K_{2,2} = 15 + 10 = 25$ km/s\n\n**3. Set up the Mass Ratio**\n\nWe want to find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2. This means we need to calculate the ratio of their total masses, $M_{total,1} / M_{total,2}$.\n\n$\\frac{M_{total,1}}{M_{total,2}} = \\frac{\\frac{P_1 (K_{total,1})^3}{2\\pi G}}{\\frac{P_2 (K_{total,2})^3}{2\\pi G}}$\n\nThe constant term $2\\pi G$ cancels out from the numerator and the denominator, leaving a simpler expression:\n\n$\\frac{M_{total,1}}{M_{total,2}} = \\frac{P_1 (K_{total,1})^3}{P_2 (K_{total,2})^3} = \\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_{total,1}}{K_{total,2}}\\right)^3$\n\n**4. Calculate the Ratio**\n\nNow, substitute the values into the simplified ratio formula. We can use the periods in years and the velocities in km/s, as the units will cancel out in the ratio.\n\n$\\frac{M_{total,1}}{M_{total,2}} = \\left(\\frac{2 \\text{ years}}{1 \\text{ year}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{15 \\text{ km/s}}{25 \\text{ km/s}}\\right)^3$\n\n$\\frac{M_{total,1}}{M_{total,2}} = 2 \\times \\left(\\frac{15}{25}\\right)^3$\n\nSimplify the fraction $\\frac{15}{25}$ by dividing both numbers by 5:\n\n$\\frac{M_{total,1}}{M_{total,2}} = 2 \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^3$\n\nNow, calculate the cube:\n\n$\\frac{M_{total,1}}{M_{total,2}} = 2 \\times \\frac{3^3}{5^3} = 2 \\times \\frac{27}{125}$\n\nFinally, perform the multiplication:\n\n$\\frac{M_{total,1}}{M_{total,2}} = \\frac{54}{125} = 0.432$\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated factor is 0.432. This value is closest to the option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
