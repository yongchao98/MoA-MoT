    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the outcome of the experiments.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Reaction 1\n\n*   **Reaction:** (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Starting Material:** (E)-oct-4-ene is a *trans*-alkene. It is an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** This two-step process (epoxidation followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis) results in the *anti*-dihydroxylation of the alkene. The two hydroxyl (-OH) groups are added to opposite faces of the double bond.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for this type of reaction is:\n    *   *trans*-alkene + *anti*-addition → meso compound (if the product structure allows for it).\n*   **Product Analysis:** The product is octane-4,5-diol. Let's determine the stereochemistry. The substituents on C4 and C5 are identical (H, OH, and propyl group). This symmetry allows for the formation of a meso compound. The product of this reaction is the meso isomer of octane-4,5-diol, which can be designated as (4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Since it is meso, it is a single, achiral compound. (Note: (4R, 5S) is identical to (4S, 5R) for a meso compound).\n\n**Product of Reaction 1:** (4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol (a single meso compound).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2\n\n*   **Reaction:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid (H₃O⁺).\n*   **Starting Material:** (Z)-oct-4-ene is a *cis*-alkene. It is also an achiral molecule.\n*   **Reagents:** This is also an *anti*-dihydroxylation.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:** The stereochemical rule for this reaction is:\n    *   *cis*-alkene + *anti*-addition → racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n*   **Product Analysis:** The products are the two enantiomers of octane-4,5-diol. These are (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol. Since the reaction starts with an achiral precursor and uses achiral reagents, the two enantiomers are formed in equal amounts, creating a racemic mixture.\n\n**Products of Reaction 2:** A 1:1 racemic mixture of (4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Combined Product Mixture\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three different stereoisomers:\n1.  **(4R, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound)\n2.  **(4R, 5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (enantiomer A)\n3.  **(4S, 5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (enantiomer B)\n\nLet's examine the relationship between these isomers:\n*   (4R, 5R)-diol and (4S, 5S)-diol are **enantiomers**.\n*   The meso (4R, 5S)-diol is a **diastereomer** of both the (4R, 5R)-diol and the (4S, 5S)-diol.\n\n### Step 4: Predict the HPLC Chromatograms\n\nNow we analyze this three-component mixture using two types of HPLC.\n\n**1. Standard (Achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n*   An achiral HPLC column cannot distinguish between enantiomers. Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore have the same retention time.\n*   Diastereomers have different physical properties and will have different retention times, allowing for their separation.\n*   In our mixture:\n    *   The enantiomeric pair, (4R, 5R)-diol and (4S, 5S)-diol, will co-elute and appear as a **single peak**.\n    *   The meso compound, (4R, 5S)-diol, is a diastereomer to the other two and will have a different retention time, appearing as a **second, separate peak**.\n*   **Observation:** The chemist will observe **2 peaks** in the standard HPLC chromatogram.\n\n**2. Chiral HPLC:**\n*   A chiral HPLC column contains a chiral stationary phase designed to interact differently with enantiomers, allowing for their separation.\n*   It can also separate diastereomers.\n*   In our mixture:\n    *   The enantiomers (4R, 5R)-diol and (4S, 5S)-diol will be resolved into **two separate peaks**.\n    *   The meso compound (4R, 5S)-diol is a distinct chemical entity (a diastereomer of the others) and will elute as its own **separate, third peak**.\n*   **Observation:** The chemist will observe **3 peaks** in the chiral HPLC chromatogram.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Standard HPLC will show 2 peaks.\n*   Chiral HPLC will show 3 peaks.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
