    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Stefan-Boltzmann Law:** The luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    L = 4πR²σT⁴\n    where R is the star's radius, T is its surface temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Luminosity Ratio:** We need to find the ratio of the luminosity of Star_1 (L₁) to that of Star_2 (L₂):\n    L₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n    The constants cancel out, leaving:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n\n3.  **Radius Ratio:** The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times the radius of Star_2.\n    R₁ / R₂ = 1.5\n    So, (R₁ / R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25.\n\n4.  **Temperature Ratio (Wien's Law and Doppler Shift):**\n    *   Wien's Displacement Law relates a star's temperature to the peak wavelength at which it *emits* radiation (λ_em_max): T = b / λ_em_max, where 'b' is Wien's constant.\n    *   Therefore, the temperature ratio is: T₁ / T₂ = λ_em_max,₂ / λ_em_max,₁.\n    *   However, the problem states that the *observed* peak wavelengths (λ_obs_max) are the same. We must correct for the Doppler effect caused by the stars' radial velocities (v_r).\n    *   The observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength by: λ_obs = λ_em * (1 + v_r/c), where c is the speed of light. Rearranging gives: λ_em = λ_obs / (1 + v_r/c).\n\n5.  **Calculate Emitted Wavelengths:**\n    *   For Star_1: v_r₁ = 0 km/s. Its Doppler shift is zero.\n        λ_em_max,₁ = λ_obs_max,₁ / (1 + 0/c) = λ_obs_max,₁.\n    *   For Star_2: v_r₂ = 700 km/s.\n        λ_em_max,₂ = λ_obs_max,₂ / (1 + v_r₂/c).\n    *   We are given that λ_obs_max,₁ = λ_obs_max,₂. Let's call this λ_obs.\n        So, λ_em_max,₁ = λ_obs and λ_em_max,₂ = λ_obs / (1 + v_r₂/c).\n\n6.  **Calculate Temperature Ratio:** Now we can find the ratio of the emitted wavelengths:\n    λ_em_max,₂ / λ_em_max,₁ = [λ_obs / (1 + v_r₂/c)] / λ_obs = 1 / (1 + v_r₂/c).\n    Since T₁/T₂ = λ_em_max,₂ / λ_em_max,₁, the temperature ratio is:\n    T₁ / T₂ = 1 / (1 + v_r₂/c)\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Now we substitute everything back into the luminosity ratio equation:\n    L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = (1.5)² * [1 / (1 + v_r₂/c)]⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + v_r₂/c)⁴\n\n    Now, plug in the values:\n    *   v_r₂ = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s\n    *   c ≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s\n    *   v_r₂/c = 700,000 / (3.00 x 10⁸) ≈ 0.002333\n\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1 + 0.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / (1.002333)⁴\n    L₁ / L₂ = 2.25 / 1.00937\n    L₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.2291\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23. The information about the mass of the stars is not needed for this calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
