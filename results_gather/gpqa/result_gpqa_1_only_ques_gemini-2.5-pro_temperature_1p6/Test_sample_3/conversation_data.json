    "Here's a breakdown of why the specific equations change:\n\n1.  **Standard Maxwell's Equations:** Let's first recall what the relevant equations state in our universe.\n    *   **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** This law is written as ∇ ⋅ **B** = 0. In simple terms, the \"divergence\" (∇ ⋅) of the magnetic field (**B**) is zero. This is the mathematical statement that there are no magnetic monopoles—magnetic field lines always form closed loops and never start or end at a single point.\n    *   **Faraday's Law of Induction:** This law is written as ∇ × **E** = -∂**B**/∂t. It describes the \"curl\" or \"circulation\" (∇ ×) of the electric field (**E**). It states that a changing magnetic field creates a circulating electric field.\n\n2.  **Introducing Magnetic Monopoles:** Now, let's introduce an isolated North or South pole (a magnetic monopole).\n\n    *   **Change to Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** If a magnetic monopole exists, it would be a source (like a North pole) or a sink (like a South pole) for magnetic field lines. This means the divergence of the magnetic field would no longer be zero at the location of the monopole. The equation must be modified to account for this new magnetic \"charge,\" changing from ∇ ⋅ **B** = 0 to something like ∇ ⋅ **B** = ρ_m (where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density). So, the equation for the **divergence of the magnetic field** must change.\n\n    *   **Change to Faraday's Law:** In our universe, moving electric charges create an electric current, which in turn generates a circulating magnetic field (part of the Ampère-Maxwell law). By symmetry, if magnetic monopoles exist and can move, they would create a *magnetic current*. This magnetic current would, in turn, generate a circulating **electric field**. To account for this, a new term for the magnetic current must be added to Faraday's Law. So, the equation for the **circulation of the electric field** must also change.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the two equations that change are the one describing the divergence of the magnetic field and the one describing the circulation of the electric field.\n\n<<<A>>>"
