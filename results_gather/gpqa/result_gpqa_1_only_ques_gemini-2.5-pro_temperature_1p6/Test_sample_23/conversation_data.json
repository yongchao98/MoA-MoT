    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify Hydrocarbon Z:**\n    *   Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%.\n    *   The general formula for a saturated alkane is CnH(2n+2). The mass fraction of hydrogen would be (2n+2)/(14n+2). Setting this to 0.1428 gives a negative value for n, so it's not an alkane.\n    *   The general formula for a cycloalkane is CnH2n. The mass fraction of hydrogen is 2n/14n = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857, which matches 14.28%. So, Z is a cycloalkane.\n    *   The problem states that Z is a widely used solvent. A very common cycloalkane solvent is cyclohexane, C6H12.\n    *   Let's verify: For C6H12, the molar mass is (6 * 12) + (12 * 1) = 84 g/mol. The mass of hydrogen is 12 g/mol. The mass fraction is 12/84 = 1/7 ≈ 14.28%. This confirms that **Z is cyclohexane (C6H12)**.\n    *   The fact that Z does not react further with hydrogen confirms it is a saturated hydrocarbon like cyclohexane.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hydrogenation Reactions:**\n    *   Both mixture X and mixture Y, when hydrogenated under severe conditions, yield only cyclohexane (Z). This is a crucial clue: it means that all components of both mixtures have a six-carbon ring as their basic structure.\n\n3.  **Identify the Components of Mixture Y:**\n    *   Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from the disproportionation of X.\n    *   Y does not decolorize bromine water. This means its components are saturated or aromatic (which are much less reactive to bromine water than alkenes).\n    *   One component of Y is Z, which is cyclohexane (C6H12). Cyclohexane is saturated and fits this condition.\n    *   Let the other component be Y₂. Since hydrogenation of Y₂ also gives cyclohexane, Y₂ must have a C6 ring structure. For Y₂ not to decolorize bromine water, it must be either another saturated C6 isomer (not possible if it's a different liquid) or an aromatic compound. The most stable C6 aromatic compound is **benzene (C6H6)**.\n    *   Hydrogenation of benzene (C6H6 + 3H₂ → C6H12) yields cyclohexane. Benzene's relative unreactivity with bromine water also fits the description.\n    *   Therefore, **mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6)**.\n\n4.  **Identify the Components of Mixture X:**\n    *   Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids.\n    *   The reaction is a disproportionation: X → Y.\n        Mixture X (2 components) → Mixture Y (cyclohexane + benzene)\n    *   Since the reactants and products are in equimolar amounts, the reaction can be written as:\n        X₁ + X₂ → C6H12 + C6H6\n    *   This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. By conservation of atoms, the two components of X (X₁ and X₂) must have a total of 12 carbon atoms and 12 + 6 = 18 hydrogen atoms. Since both have a C6 ring skeleton, they must be of the form C6Ha and C6Hb, where **a + b = 18**.\n    *   Mixture X decolorizes bromine water, meaning both X₁ and X₂ are unsaturated (they contain C=C double bonds). Their hydrogen counts (a and b) must be less than 12.\n    *   The problem also states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the components of X.\n    *   Let's consider possible C6 cyclic alkenes:\n        *   Cyclohexene: C6H10 (one double bond, no conjugation).\n        *   Cyclohexadienes: C6H8 (two double bonds). The isomers are 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (not conjugated).\n    *   The condition \"no conjugated multiple bonds\" rules out 1,3-cyclohexadiene.\n    *   Let's test the pair: X₁ = **cyclohexene (C6H10)** and X₂ = **1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)**.\n    *   Let's check the hydrogen atom sum: a + b = 10 + 8 = 18. This matches our requirement.\n    *   The disproportionation reaction is:\n        C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)\n        In this reaction, cyclohexene is reduced (gains 2H) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene is oxidized (loses 2H). This is a classic catalytic hydrogen transfer and fits all the conditions.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   The two liquids in mixture X are cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. This means the sum of the hydrogen atoms in one molecule of each component.\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = (H atoms in C6H10) + (H atoms in C6H8)\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms = 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
