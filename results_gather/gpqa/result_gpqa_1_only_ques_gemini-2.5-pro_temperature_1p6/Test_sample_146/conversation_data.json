    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Physics of the Process**\n\nThe problem describes the annihilation of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) into four new particles (two $A^+$ and two $A^-$). In such a process, the total energy and momentum must be conserved.\n\n*   **Initial State:** A proton and an antiproton.\n*   **Final State:** Four particles of type A (2 positive, 2 negative).\n\nThe statement that the antiproton is \"slowly moving\" implies that its initial kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. To conserve momentum, we can analyze the collision in the center-of-mass frame, where the total initial momentum is zero. In this frame, the proton and antiproton are essentially at rest before annihilation.\n\n**2. Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe total energy before the annihilation must equal the total energy after.\n\n*   **Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):**\n    The initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton, as we are neglecting their kinetic energy.\n    $E_{initial} = E_p + E_{\\bar{p}} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$\n    The mass of a proton ($m_p$) and an antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}}$) are identical. The rest mass energy of a proton is approximately $m_p c^2 \\approx 938 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    $E_{initial} = 2 \\times m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938 \\text{ MeV} = 1876 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n*   **Final Energy ($E_{final}$):**\n    The final state consists of four particles of mass $m_A$. Since the initial momentum was zero, the four final particles must move in such a way that their total vector momentum is also zero. By symmetry, they will all have the same speed, $v$, and therefore the same relativistic energy, $E_A$.\n    The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A-particles.\n    The energy of a single A-particle is given by the relativistic formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    We are given $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    So, $E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2 = 4 \\gamma (300 \\text{ MeV}) = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n**3. Equate Initial and Final Energies to Solve for Velocity**\n\nNow, we set the initial energy equal to the final energy:\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n$1876 \\text{ MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\nFirst, solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876}{1200} \\approx 1.5633$\n\nNow, use the definition of $\\gamma$ to find the velocity, $v$. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta^2}$\n$1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the value of $\\gamma$:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.444}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4091} = \\sqrt{0.5909}$\n$\\beta \\approx 0.7687$\n\nSo, the velocity of particle A is $v = 0.7687c$, which is approximately $0.77c$.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated velocity $v \\approx 0.77c$ matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
