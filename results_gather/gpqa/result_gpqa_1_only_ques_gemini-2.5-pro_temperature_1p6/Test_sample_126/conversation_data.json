    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the product formed when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated.\n\n1.  **Draw the structure of the starting material.**\n    The name is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene.\n    *   \"nona\" indicates a 9-carbon parent chain.\n    *   \"-2,6-diene\" indicates double bonds starting at carbon 2 and carbon 6.\n    *   \"5-butyl\" indicates a butyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃) attached to carbon 5.\n\n    The structure is:\n    ```\n                     CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃ (Butyl group)\n                     |\n      CH₃-CH=CH-CH₂-CH-CH=CH-CH₂-CH₃\n      ¹   ²  ³   ⁴   ⁵  ⁶  ⁷   ⁸   ⁹\n    ```\n\n2.  **Identify the type of reaction.**\n    The starting material contains two double bonds separated by three single bonds (`C=C-C-C-C=C`). This structural motif is known as a 1,5-diene system (counting from one double bond to the other). When 1,5-dienes are heated, they undergo a pericyclic reaction called the **Cope rearrangement**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Cope rearrangement mechanism.**\n    The Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. This means a new sigma bond forms between atoms at position 3 of two interacting allyl fragments, while the original sigma bond between the fragments breaks.\n\n    Let's identify the two interacting allylic systems and the bonds that change:\n    *   The core system is `C²=C³-C⁴-C⁵-C⁶=C⁷`.\n    *   **Allyl system 1:** `C²=C³-C⁴`.\n    *   **Allyl system 2:** `C⁷=C⁶-C⁵`.\n    *   The sigma bond connecting these two systems is **`C⁴-C⁵`**. This is the bond that will **break**.\n    *   A new sigma bond will form between the \"ends\" of the two original allyl systems, which are **`C²`** and **`C⁷`**.\n    *   The double bonds will shift positions:\n        *   The `C²=C³` double bond moves to `C³=C⁴`.\n        *   The `C⁶=C⁷` double bond moves to `C⁵=C⁶`.\n\n4.  **Determine the structure of the product.**\n    Let's trace the connectivity of the atoms and their substituents after the rearrangement.\n\n    *   **Initial atoms and their substituents:**\n        *   `C²` is bonded to a methyl group (`-CH₃`, which is `C¹`) and a hydrogen.\n        *   `C³` is bonded to a hydrogen.\n        *   `C⁴` is bonded to two hydrogens (`-CH₂-`).\n        *   `C⁵` is bonded to a hydrogen and a butyl group (`-C₄H₉`).\n        *   `C⁶` is bonded to a hydrogen.\n        *   `C⁷` is bonded to an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`, which is `C⁸-C⁹`) and a hydrogen.\n\n    *   **New connectivity:**\n        *   A new `C³=C⁴` double bond is formed.\n        *   A new `C⁵=C⁶` double bond is formed.\n        *   A new `C²-C⁷` single bond is formed.\n\n    Let's assemble the product structure based on this new connectivity:\n    The core of the new molecule is `C⁴=C³-C²-C⁷-C⁶=C⁵`.\n    Now, let's attach the substituents to their respective atoms:\n    ```\n       =CH₂       -CH(CH₃)-        -CH=\n       |          |                 |\n      (C⁴)       (C²)              (C⁶)\n                  |                 |\n       -CH-       -CH(CH₂CH₃)-      =CH(CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃)\n       |          |                 |\n      (C³)       (C⁷)              (C⁵)\n    ```\n    Connecting these pieces according to the new backbone `C⁴=C³-C²-C⁷-C⁶=C⁵`, we get the following structure:\n    ```\n                CH₃      CH₂CH₃\n                |        |\n        CH₂=CH - CH - - - CH - - CH = CH - CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n    This is one continuous molecule. Let's draw it more cleanly:\n    ```\n                CH₃      CH₂CH₃\n                |        |\n        CH₂=CH - CH  -  CH  -  CH=CH - CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃\n    ```\n\n5.  **Name the product according to IUPAC rules.**\n    *   **Find the longest carbon chain** that contains the maximum number of double bonds. The main chain is the horizontal one drawn above.\n    *   **Count the carbons in the main chain.** `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 10` carbons. The parent alkane is **decane**.\n    *   **Identify the functional groups.** There are two double bonds, so it is a **decadiene**.\n    *   **Number the chain.** We number the chain to give the double bonds the lowest possible locants.\n        *   Numbering from left to right: `CH₂(1)=CH(2)-...-CH(5)=CH(6)-...`. The double bonds start at C1 and C5. Locants: (1, 5).\n        *   Numbering from right to left: `...-CH(6)=CH(5)-...-CH(2)=CH(1)`. The double bonds start at C5 and C9. Locants: (5, 9).\n        *   Since (1, 5) is lower than (5, 9), we number from left to right.\n    *   **Identify and name the substituents.**\n        *   A methyl group (`-CH₃`) is on carbon 3. -> **3-methyl**\n        *   An ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`) is on carbon 4. -> **4-ethyl**\n    *   **Assemble the full name.** List substituents alphabetically.\n        **4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene**\n\n6.  **Compare the result with the given options.**\n    *   A) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\n    *   B) 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene\n    *   C) 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene\n    *   D) 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene (duplicate of A)\n\n    Our derived name, `4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene`, matches option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>"
