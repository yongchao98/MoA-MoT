    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Hypothetical Scenario:** The question states that the pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Since neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, and the Earth is about 8.3 light-minutes from the Sun, this means we on Earth are just now observing the consequences of this change. The pp-III branch is the sequence of reactions that produces Boron-8 (`⁸B`). The decay of `⁸B` is the source of the high-energy `⁸B` neutrinos. Therefore, in this scenario, the flux of `⁸B` neutrinos reaching Earth becomes zero. All other neutrino-producing reactions (`pp`, `pep`, `⁷Be`, CNO cycle) are said to \"remain as they were,\" meaning their fluxes are at their normal, standard levels.\n\n2.  **Identify Neutrino Sources in Each Energy Band:** We need to find the ratio of neutrino flux in two energy bands:\n    *   **Band 1 (700-800 keV):** Under normal conditions, both `⁸B` and CNO-cycle neutrinos contribute to this band. With the `⁸B` flux gone, the **only remaining source in this band is the CNO cycle neutrinos** (`¹³N` and `¹⁵O`).\n    *   **Band 2 (800-900 keV):** Under normal conditions, `⁸B`, CNO, and `⁷Be` neutrinos contribute. With the `⁸B` flux gone, the remaining sources are **CNO-cycle neutrinos** and the **`⁷Be` neutrinos**. The `⁷Be` neutrinos are mono-energetic, with the vast majority (about 90%) having an energy of 861 keV, which falls directly within this band.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Ratio:**\n    The ratio we need to calculate is:\n    Ratio = Flux(700-800 keV) / Flux(800-900 keV)\n    Ratio = Flux_CNO(in Band 1) / (Flux_CNO(in Band 2) + Flux_⁷Be(861 keV))\n\n4.  **Compare the Magnitudes of the Fluxes:** Now we use our knowledge of the Standard Solar Model to compare the sizes of these fluxes:\n    *   **`⁷Be` Flux:** The flux of the 861 keV `⁷Be` line is very large, approximately **5 x 10⁹ neutrinos / (cm²·s)**.\n    *   **CNO Flux:** The *total* flux of all CNO neutrinos is much smaller, around **5-7 x 10⁸ neutrinos / (cm²·s)**. Crucially, this flux is spread out over a continuous energy spectrum up to ~1.7 MeV.\n    *   **Comparison for the Denominator:** The CNO flux within the narrow 100 keV range of Band 2 is only a small fraction of its total flux. It is completely negligible compared to the massive, concentrated flux of the `⁷Be` line.\n    *   Therefore, we can approximate the denominator as being equal to the `⁷Be` flux:\n        **Denominator ≈ Flux_⁷Be(861 keV) ≈ 5 x 10⁹ cm⁻²s⁻¹**\n\n5.  **Estimate the Numerator:** The numerator is the CNO flux in the 700-800 keV band. We can estimate this by taking a fraction of the total CNO flux.\n    *   Total CNO Flux ≈ 5 x 10⁸ cm⁻²s⁻¹ (using a rounded value for easier calculation).\n    *   The energy of these neutrinos is spread over an effective range of about 1 MeV (the spectra are not uniform, but this is a good approximation for an order-of-magnitude estimate).\n    *   The energy width of Band 1 is 100 keV, which is 0.1 MeV.\n    *   The fraction of the total CNO flux in this band is approximately the ratio of the energy widths: 0.1 MeV / 1 MeV = 0.1 (or 10%).\n    *   So, the numerator is roughly 10% of the total CNO flux:\n        **Numerator ≈ 0.1 * (5 x 10⁸) = 5 x 10⁷ cm⁻²s⁻¹**\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:**\n    Ratio ≈ Numerator / Denominator\n    Ratio ≈ (5 x 10⁷) / (5 x 10⁹)\n    Ratio ≈ 1 x 10⁻²\n    Ratio ≈ 0.01\n\nThis matches one of the options perfectly.\n\n<<<C>>>"
