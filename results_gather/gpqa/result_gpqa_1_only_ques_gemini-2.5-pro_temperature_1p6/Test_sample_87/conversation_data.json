    "The scenario describes an active immune response in the Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the gut, following oral administration of a viral antigen.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key elements and how they point to the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Antigen Presentation:** The GFP-tagged rotavirus proteins act as antigens. They successfully reach the Peyer's patches, the primary site for initiating immune responses to intestinal pathogens.\n2.  **Proliferating Cells:** The identification of a proliferating cell population indicates that lymphocytes (in this case, B cells) that recognize the antigen have been activated and are undergoing clonal expansion. This process occurs in specialized structures called germinal centers within the Peyer's patches.\n3.  **Variable Heavy Chain Gene:** This part of the B cell's DNA codes for the antigen-binding site of the antibody. The fact that this specific gene is being analyzed points to a process involving B cells and antibody production.\n4.  **High Variability:** The key finding is the high variability in the sequences of the variable heavy chain gene *among the proliferating cells*. This is the hallmark of somatic hypermutation.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\n*   **A) Somatic hypermutation (SHM):** This is a process that occurs in activated B cells within germinal centers. It intentionally introduces point mutations into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes. This creates a pool of B cells with slightly different antibodies, allowing for the selection of those that bind the antigen with the highest affinity. This perfectly explains the \"high variability\" observed in the variable heavy chain gene of the proliferating cell population.\n*   **B) V(D)J recombination:** This process generates the initial diversity of B cell receptors. It occurs in the bone marrow during B cell development, *before* the B cell ever encounters an antigen. The process described in the question is happening *after* antigen exposure in a secondary lymphoid organ.\n*   **C) Complement activation:** This is part of the innate immune system, involving a cascade of serum proteins. It does not involve the genetic modification of B cell genes.\n*   **D) Class switching recombination (CSR):** This process also occurs in B cells within germinal centers. However, it changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain (e.g., from IgM to IgG or IgA), which alters the antibody's function but does not change the antigen-binding variable region itself. While CSR is likely happening in this scenario, it doesn't explain the high variability observed in the *variable* gene.\n\nThe process that directly accounts for the high variability in the variable heavy chain gene of an activated, proliferating B cell population is somatic hypermutation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
