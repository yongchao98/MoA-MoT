    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the shape of the aperture as N approaches infinity.**\nThe aperture is described as an N-sided regular polygon where all apothems have the same length 'a'. The apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of any side. This is also the radius of the inscribed circle (the inradius).\n\nAs the number of sides, N, of a regular polygon increases infinitely (N → ∞), the polygon approaches the shape of a circle. The radius of this limiting circle will be equal to the apothem 'a'.\n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture of radius **r = a**.\n\n**Step 2: Recall the formula for Fraunhofer diffraction by a circular aperture.**\nThe diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. The intensity I as a function of the diffraction angle θ is given by:\n\nI(θ) = I₀ [ (2 * J₁(k * a * sinθ)) / (k * a * sinθ) ]²\n\nWhere:\n*   I₀ is the intensity at the center (the peak of the central maximum).\n*   J₁(x) is the Bessel function of the first kind, of order one.\n*   k is the wave number, k = 2π/λ.\n*   'a' is the radius of the circular aperture.\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   θ is the angular position from the central axis.\n\n**Step 3: Find the angular positions of the intensity minima.**\nThe intensity minima occur when the numerator of the intensity formula is zero, which means J₁(k * a * sinθ) = 0, while the denominator is not zero. The minima correspond to the non-zero roots of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n\nLet the roots of J₁(x) = 0 be denoted by z₁, z₂, z₃, ...\nFrom mathematical tables, the first few roots are approximately:\n*   z₁ ≈ 3.8317\n*   z₂ ≈ 7.0156\n*   z₃ ≈ 10.1735\n\nThe condition for the m-th minimum is:\nk * a * sin(θₘ) = zₘ\n(2π/λ) * a * sin(θₘ) = zₘ\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the angular positions of the first two minima.**\nWe are given the small angle approximation, so we can state sinθ ≈ θ.\n\n*   **For the first minimum (m=1):**\n    (2π/λ) * a * θ₁ ≈ z₁ = 3.8317\n    θ₁ ≈ (z₁ * λ) / (2π * a)\n    θ₁ ≈ (3.8317 / (2π)) * (λ/a) ≈ 0.610 * (λ/a)\n\n*   **For the second minimum (m=2):**\n    (2π/λ) * a * θ₂ ≈ z₂ = 7.0156\n    θ₂ ≈ (z₂ * λ) / (2π * a)\n    θ₂ ≈ (7.0156 / (2π)) * (λ/a) ≈ 1.1166 * (λ/a)\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the angular distance between the first two minima.**\nThe angular distance Δθ is the difference between the positions of the second and first minima.\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁\nΔθ ≈ [1.1166 * (λ/a)] - [0.610 * (λ/a)]\nΔθ ≈ (1.1166 - 0.610) * (λ/a)\nΔθ ≈ 0.5066 * (λ/a)\n\n**Step 6: Compare the result with the given options.**\nThe calculated value is Δθ ≈ 0.5066 * (λ/a). This matches option D very closely.\n\nA) 1.220 λ / a  (This is 2 * θ₁, the angular width of the central maximum)\nB) 0.610 λ / a  (This is θ₁, the angular position of the first minimum)\nC) 0.500 λ / a  (This is the result for a square aperture of side length 2a)\nD) 0.506 λ / a  (This matches our calculation for a circular aperture of radius a)\n\nThus, the correct answer is 0.506 λ / a.\n\n<<<D>>>"
