    "This problem requires us to determine the comoving distance to a quasar based on its observed spectrum and a given cosmological model. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n### Step 1: Interpret the Spectral Observation\n\nThe key piece of information is the observation of a peak at a wavelength of 790 nm, with a significant drop in flux at shorter wavelengths. In astrophysics, this spectral feature is the characteristic signature of the **Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line** from a high-redshift object.\n\nThe light from the distant quasar travels through the intergalactic medium. Neutral hydrogen gas clouds along the line of sight absorb photons with enough energy to excite their electrons from the ground state. This absorption creates a dense series of absorption lines at wavelengths shorter than the quasar's redshifted Lyα emission line, known as the \"Lyman-alpha forest.\" At very high redshifts, this absorption becomes so severe that it almost completely suppresses the flux, creating a \"Gunn-Peterson trough.\" The peak at 790 nm is the Lyα emission line itself, seen just before this sharp drop.\n\nTherefore, we can assume that the observed wavelength of the Lyα line is λ_obs = 790 nm.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Redshift (z)\n\nThe redshift `z` relates the observed wavelength (λ_obs) of a spectral line to its rest-frame wavelength (λ_rest). The rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line is **λ_rest ≈ 121.6 nm** (or 1215.67 Å).\n\nThe formula for redshift is:\n1 + z = λ_obs / λ_rest\n\nPlugging in the values:\n1 + z = 790 nm / 121.6 nm ≈ 6.50\nz = 6.50 - 1 = 5.5\n\nSo, the redshift of the quasar is **z = 5.5**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Comoving Distance (D_c)\n\nThe problem specifies a flat Lambda-CDM (ΛCDM) universe with the following parameters:\n*   Hubble constant, H₀ = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n*   Matter density parameter, Ω_m,0 = 0.3\n*   Dark energy density parameter, Ω_Λ,0 = 0.7\n*   Curvature density parameter, Ω_k,0 = 0 (since the universe is flat)\n\nThe comoving distance to an object at redshift `z` is calculated using the following integral:\n\nD_c = (c / H₀) * ∫[from 0 to z] dz' / E(z')\n\nwhere `c` is the speed of light, and E(z) is the function describing the evolution of the Hubble parameter:\n\nE(z) = √[Ω_m,0(1+z)³ + Ω_k,0(1+z)² + Ω_Λ,0]\n\nSince the universe is flat (Ω_k,0 = 0), this simplifies to:\nE(z) = √[Ω_m,0(1+z)³ + Ω_Λ,0]\n\n### Step 4: Perform the Calculation\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Hubble distance, D_H = c / H₀:\n*   c ≈ 3.00 x 10⁵ km/s\n*   H₀ = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n*   D_H = (3.00 x 10⁵) / 70 ≈ 4286 Mpc\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral with our values (z=5.5, Ω_m,0=0.3, Ω_Λ,0=0.7):\nD_c = 4286 Mpc * ∫[from 0 to 5.5] dz' / √[0.3(1+z')³ + 0.7]\n\nThis integral does not have a simple analytical solution and must be calculated numerically. Performing the numerical integration (e.g., using computational software or an online cosmology calculator):\n\n∫[from 0 to 5.5] dz' / √[0.3(1+z')³ + 0.7] ≈ 1.906\n\nNow, we can find the comoving distance:\nD_c ≈ 4286 Mpc * 1.906\nD_c ≈ 8170 Mpc\nD_c ≈ 8.17 Gpc\n\n### Step 5: Select the Correct Option\n\nThe calculated comoving distance is approximately 8.17 Gpc. Comparing this value to the given options:\nA) 7 Gpc\nB) 8 Gpc\nC) 9 Gpc\nD) 6 Gpc\n\nThe closest answer is 8 Gpc.\n\n<<<B>>>"
