    "The decay of a Hydrogen atom from the initial state $|i\\rangle = |3,0,0\\rangle$ to the final state $|f\\rangle = |1,0,0\\rangle$ involves a change in the principal quantum number $\\Delta n = -2$ and no change in the angular momentum quantum numbers, $\\Delta l = 0$ and $\\Delta m = 0$.\n\nAccording to the selection rules for electric dipole transitions, we must have:\n1.  $\\Delta l = l_{final} - l_{initial} = \\pm 1$\n2.  $\\Delta m = m_{final} - m_{initial} = 0, \\pm 1$\n\nThe direct transition $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$ is forbidden because $\\Delta l = 0$. Therefore, this decay must occur via a two-step process, known as a cascade, through an intermediate state $|k\\rangle = |n_k, l_k, m_k\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 1: First Dipole Transition**\nThe first transition is from $|3,0,0\\rangle$ to an intermediate state $|n_k, l_k, m_k\\rangle$.\n*   Applying the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule to the initial state with $l=0$, the intermediate state must have $l_k=1$.\n*   For a decay (emission of a photon), the energy of the intermediate state must be lower than the initial state, so $n_k < 3$. The possible value is $n_k=2$ (since $n=1$ states have $l=0$).\n*   Applying the $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule to the initial state with $m=0$, the intermediate state can have $m_k = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\nSo, the possible intermediate states are $|2,1,-1\\rangle$, $|2,1,0\\rangle$, and $|2,1,1\\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Second Dipole Transition**\nThe second transition is from the intermediate state $|2,1,m_k\\rangle$ to the final state $|1,0,0\\rangle$.\n*   Applying the $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$ rule, with $l_k=1$ and $l_{final}=0$, we get $\\Delta l = -1$. This transition is allowed.\n*   Applying the $\\Delta m = 0, \\pm 1$ rule, with $m_{final}=0$, we need $0 - m_k = 0, \\pm 1$. This condition is satisfied for all possible values of $m_k \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$.\n\nThus, all three routes are possible:\n1.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n2.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n3.  $|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,-1\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle$\n\n**Calculating the Probability**\n\nThe probability of a particular decay route is determined by the product of the branching ratios of each step.\n\n*   **Branching ratio for Step 1:** The initial state $|3,0,0\\rangle$ is spherically symmetric (an s-orbital). In the absence of any external fields, there is no preferred direction in space. Therefore, the atom will decay with equal probability into each of the three possible magnetic sublevels of the $|2,1\\rangle$ state. Since these are the only available channels for the first decay step, the total probability is divided equally among them. The branching ratio for decaying into any specific state $|2,1,m_k\\rangle$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n*   **Branching ratio for Step 2:** From any of the intermediate states $|2,1,m_k\\rangle$, the only possible electric dipole transition to a lower energy level is to the $|1,0,0\\rangle$ state. Therefore, the branching ratio for this second step is 1.\n\nThe total probability for any specific route is the product of these branching ratios. For the route passing through $|2,1,0\\rangle$:\n$$ P(\\text{route via } |2,1,0\\rangle) = BR(|3,0,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2,1,0\\rangle) \\times BR(|2,1,0\\rangle \\rightarrow |1,0,0\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3} $$\nThe same probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$ applies to the routes via $|2,1,1\\rangle$ and $|2,1,-1\\rangle$.\n\n**Comparing with the options:**\n*   A) The route is possible, but the probability is given as $\\frac{1}{4}$, which is incorrect.\n*   B) The route is possible, but the probability is given as $\\frac{1}{4}$, which is incorrect.\n*   C) The route $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ is possible and the calculated probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$. This matches the option.\n*   D) The route is possible, but the probability is given as $\\frac{2}{3}$, which is incorrect.\n\nThus, option C correctly identifies a possible transition route and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<C>>>"
