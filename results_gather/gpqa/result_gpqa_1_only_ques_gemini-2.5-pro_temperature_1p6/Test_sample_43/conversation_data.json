    "The question asks to identify the experiment that would **not** be useful for investigating a drug's effect on mitochondria. Let's analyze each option:\n\n*   **A) Transformation of cells with recombinant luciferase and luminometer reading after 5 μM of luciferin addition to the supernatant:** The luciferase-luciferin reaction produces light in an ATP-dependent manner. Measuring the light output is a way to quantify ATP levels. Since mitochondria are the primary producers of ATP in the cell, a drug affecting mitochondria would likely alter cellular ATP production. This change could be detected by a luciferase assay (either in cell lysate for total ATP or in the supernatant for released ATP). Therefore, this is a valid method to study mitochondrial function indirectly.\n\n*   **B) Differential centrifugation extraction of mitochondria followed by the Glucose Uptake Colorimetric Assay Kit:** This experiment involves two steps. First, mitochondria are isolated from the cells. Second, a glucose uptake assay is performed on these isolated mitochondria. The critical point is that glucose metabolism (glycolysis) occurs in the cytoplasm, breaking down glucose into pyruvate. It is the pyruvate (and fatty acids) that is transported into the mitochondria to fuel the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondria themselves do **not** take up glucose. Glucose uptake is mediated by transporters on the cell's plasma membrane. Therefore, trying to measure glucose uptake in isolated mitochondria is a flawed experiment and would not yield meaningful data about mitochondrial function.\n\n*   **C) Confocal fluorescence microscopy after Mito-RTP staining of the cells:** \"Mito-RTP\" is a fluorescent probe specifically designed to accumulate in mitochondria and report on the levels of pyrophosphate (PPi), a byproduct of mitochondrial metabolism. Using this probe along with confocal microscopy allows for the visualization and quantification of a specific metabolic activity directly within the mitochondria. This is a highly relevant experiment to study a drug's effect on this organelle.\n\n*   **D) Flow cytometry after labeling with 2.5 μM 5,5',6,6'-Tetrachloro-1,1',3, 3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide:** This long chemical name refers to the dye **JC-1**. JC-1 is a widely used fluorescent probe to measure mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). The mitochondrial membrane potential is a key indicator of mitochondrial health and is essential for ATP synthesis. A drug that damages mitochondria often causes a drop in this potential. Flow cytometry is a high-throughput method to measure the fluorescence shift of JC-1 in a large population of cells. This is a standard and powerful assay for mitochondrial toxicity and function.\n\nBased on the analysis, experiment B is based on an incorrect biological premise and would not be helpful.\n\n<<<B>>>"
