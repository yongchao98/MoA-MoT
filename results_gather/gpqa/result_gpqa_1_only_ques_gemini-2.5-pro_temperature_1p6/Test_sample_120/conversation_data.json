    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct product.\n\n**1. Structure of the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is **(1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**.\n\n*   **7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane**: This is the structure of cyclohexene oxide. The cyclohexane ring is fused to a three-membered epoxide ring. The carbons of the epoxide ring are numbered C1 and C6.\n*   **1,3,4-trimethyl**: There are methyl groups at positions C1, C3, and C4.\n*   **(1R,3R,4R,6S)**: This defines the absolute stereochemistry at the four chiral centers.\n\nLet's determine the 3D structure:\n*   We use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules to assign priorities to the substituents at each chiral center. A consistent analysis reveals the following structure (often visualized with the cyclohexane ring in a half-chair conformation and using wedges for bonds pointing up (beta) and dashes for bonds pointing down (alpha)):\n    *   The epoxide ring is on the top (beta) face of the cyclohexane ring. The C1-O and C6-O bonds are wedged.\n    *   The methyl group at C1 is also on the beta face (wedged). This is required for the `1R` configuration.\n    *   The methyl group at C3 is on the beta face (wedged) for the `3R` configuration.\n    *   The methyl group at C4 is on the beta face (wedged) for the `4R` configuration.\n    *   The hydrogen at C6 is on the bottom (alpha) face (dashed). This results in the `6S` configuration.\n\nSo, the epoxide and all three methyl groups are on the same side (beta face) of the ring system. This creates a sterically crowded top face and a more open bottom face (apart from the ring hydrogens).\n\n**2. The Reaction**\n\nThe reagent is **Me2CuLi (lithium dimethylcuprate)**, a Gilman reagent. The reaction is the ring-opening of an epoxide.\n\n*   **Regioselectivity**: The problem states, \"the alkyl group of the reagent is always introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\"\n    *   The epoxide carbons are C1 and C6.\n    *   C1 is a **quaternary** carbon (bonded to C2, C6, a methyl group, and oxygen).\n    *   C6 is a **tertiary** carbon (bonded to C1, C5, a hydrogen, and oxygen).\n    *   In general, for SN2-like reactions, attack at a less substituted carbon is faster. Therefore, the nucleophilic methyl anion (Me⁻) from the cuprate will attack **C6**.\n\n*   **Stereoselectivity**: The problem states, \"inversion of configuration occurs at a carbon to which Nu is added.\" This is a classic **SN2 reaction**.\n    *   The nucleophile attacks from the side opposite to the leaving group (the epoxide oxygen).\n    *   The epoxide is on the beta (top) face. Thus, the Me⁻ nucleophile must attack from the **alpha (bottom) face**.\n    *   This attack occurs at C6. The C6-O bond breaks, and a new C6-Me bond is formed on the alpha face. The configuration at C6 is inverted.\n\n**3. Structure of the Product**\n\nLet's trace the consequences of the attack:\n*   **Attack at C6**: A methyl group is added to C6 from the alpha face.\n*   **Inversion at C6**: The original configuration at C6 was `S`. Due to the inversion, the new configuration at this carbon will be `R`.\n*   **Ring Opening**: The C6-O bond breaks. The epoxide oxygen remains attached to C1 and becomes an alkoxide (O⁻).\n*   **Workup**: Aqueous workup protonates the alkoxide at C1 to form a hydroxyl (-OH) group. Since the original C1-O bond was beta, the resulting C1-OH group will also be beta.\n*   **Unaffected Centers**: The configurations at C1, C3, and C4 are not involved in the reaction, so their absolute configurations (`R`, `R`, and `R`, respectively) are retained.\n\nThe resulting molecule is a substituted cyclohexanol. We need to name it according to IUPAC rules.\n\n*   **Numbering the product**: The carbon with the -OH group gets the highest priority and is numbered C1. This corresponds to the original C1 of the epoxide. We then number the ring to give the methyl substituents the lowest possible locants.\n    *   Original C1 -> New C1\n    *   Original C6 -> New C2\n    *   Original C3 -> New C5\n    *   Original C4 -> New C4\n*   **Substituents**:\n    *   New C1: has the original C1-Me (beta) and the new OH group (beta).\n    *   New C2: has the new Me group from the cuprate (alpha).\n    *   New C4: has the original C4-Me (beta).\n    *   New C5: has the original C3-Me (beta).\n*   The IUPAC name is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**. This matches the names in options B and D.\n\n**4. Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nWe need to determine the absolute configuration (R/S) of each chiral center in the product.\n*   **New C1 (Original C1)**: Configuration is retained. It was `1R`. It remains `R`. -> **1R**.\n*   **New C2 (Original C6)**: Configuration is inverted. It was `6S`. It becomes `R`. -> **2R**.\n*   **New C4 (Original C4)**: Configuration is retained. It was `4R`. It remains `R`. -> **4R**.\n*   **New C5 (Original C3)**: Configuration is retained. It was `3R`. It remains `R`. -> **5R**.\n\nPutting it all together, the product is **(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol**.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
