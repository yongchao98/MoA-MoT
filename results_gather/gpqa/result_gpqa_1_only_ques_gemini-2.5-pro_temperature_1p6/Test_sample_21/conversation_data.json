    "This question tests two fundamental concepts in electrochemistry regarding the behavior of oxygen: its thermodynamic potential and its reaction kinetics, and how these are affected by pH. Let's break down the statement into its two parts.\n\n**Part 1: Thermodynamics**\n\"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions.\"\n\n*   The strength of an oxidizing agent (oxidant) is measured by its standard reduction potential (E°). A more positive E° indicates a stronger oxidant because the reduction reaction is more spontaneous.\n*   We need to compare the reduction potential of oxygen in acidic and basic solutions.\n\nThe relevant half-reactions are:\n1.  **In acidic solution:** O₂(g) + 4H⁺(aq) + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O(l)\n    *   The standard reduction potential is **E° = +1.23 V**.\n2.  **In basic solution:** O₂(g) + 2H₂O(l) + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻(aq)\n    *   The standard reduction potential is **E° = +0.40 V**.\n\nComparing the two E° values, +1.23 V (acidic) is significantly more positive than +0.40 V (basic). This means that oxygen has a greater tendency to be reduced (and thus act as an oxidant) in acidic solution than in basic solution.\nTherefore, thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions compared to acidic solutions.\n\nThis narrows down the correct answer to options A or B.\n\n**Part 2: Kinetics**\n\"Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions.\"\n\n*   Kinetics refers to the speed or rate of a reaction. A thermodynamically favorable reaction (like oxygen reduction) is not necessarily fast. The reduction of oxygen is famously slow, which is why catalysts are essential in applications like fuel cells. This slowness is due to the high activation energy required to break the strong O=O double bond.\n*   The question asks how the reaction rate in acidic solution compares to the rate in basic solution.\n*   In electrochemistry, it is a well-established experimental observation that the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is kinetically more facile (i.e., **faster**) in acidic media than in alkaline (basic) media on most common electrode materials (like platinum). While the exact reasons are complex and still a subject of research, the mechanisms and intermediates involved in acidic solution lead to lower activation barriers compared to those in basic solution.\n\nSo, kinetically, oxygen reacts **faster** in acidic solutions.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   First blank: **weaker**\n*   Second blank: **faster**\n\nCombining these, the correct pair is \"weaker – faster\", which corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
