    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial and Final States:**\n    *   The initial state of the 2-electron system is given in the coupled basis representation: $|\\psi_{initial}\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$.\n        *   $l_1 = 1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 1.\n        *   $l_2 = 1$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of electron 2.\n        *   $l = 2$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number of the system.\n        *   $m = -1$ is the quantum number for the z-component of the total orbital angular momentum ($L_z$). The eigenvalue of the operator $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ for this state is $m\\hbar = -1\\hbar$.\n\n    *   A measurement of the individual z-components of angular momentum, $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, is performed. We want to find the joint probability of a specific outcome.\n    *   The desired outcome is that the eigenvalue of $L_{1z}$ is $-\\hbar$ and the eigenvalue of $L_{2z}$ is also $-\\hbar$.\n    *   An eigenvalue of $L_{iz}$ is given by $m_i\\hbar$. So, for this outcome, we must have $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   This measurement outcome corresponds to projecting the initial state onto the final state in the uncoupled basis: $|\\psi_{final}\\rangle = |l_1, l_2, m_1, m_2\\rangle = |1, 1, -1, -1\\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    *   According to the principles of quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a system, initially in state $|\\psi_{initial}\\rangle$, to be in a specific state $|\\psi_{final}\\rangle$ is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product of the two states:\n        $P = |\\langle \\psi_{final} | \\psi_{initial} \\rangle|^2$\n    *   Substituting our states:\n        $P = |\\langle 1, 1, -1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle|^2$\n\n3.  **Apply the Conservation of Angular Momentum (Z-component):**\n    *   The total z-component of angular momentum operator is $L_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$.\n    *   The coupled state $|l, m\\rangle$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the uncoupled states $|m_1, m_2\\rangle$. This is the Clebsch-Gordan series:\n        $|l, m\\rangle = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} \\langle l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle |m_1, m_2\\rangle$\n    *   A fundamental selection rule for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, $\\langle l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2 | l, m \\rangle$, is that they are non-zero only if the z-components of angular momentum add up:\n        $m_1 + m_2 = m$\n    *   This rule reflects the fact that the total z-component of angular momentum is conserved. An eigenstate of $L_z$ with eigenvalue $m\\hbar$ can only be composed of states that also have a total z-component eigenvalue of $m\\hbar$.\n\n4.  **Check the Selection Rule for this Problem:**\n    *   From the initial state, $|1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle$, we have the total magnetic quantum number $m = -1$.\n    *   For the final measured state, $|1, 1, -1, -1\\rangle$, we have the individual magnetic quantum numbers $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.\n    *   Let's check the sum: $m_1 + m_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n    *   Comparing the required total m-value with the initial state's m-value:\n        $-2 \\neq -1$\n    *   Since $m_1 + m_2 \\neq m$, the selection rule is not satisfied.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Because the selection rule is violated, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which represents the inner product, must be zero:\n        $\\langle 1, 1, -1, -1 | 1, 1, 2, -1 \\rangle = 0$\n    *   Therefore, the probability is:\n        $P = |0|^2 = 0$\n\nThe joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is 0.\n\n<<<D>>>"
