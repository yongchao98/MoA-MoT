    "Here is the step-by-step synthesis and analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1.**\nThis is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, specifically the nitration of toluene. The methyl group (-CH3) on toluene is an ortho-, para- director and an activating group. The reaction with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) typically yields a mixture of ortho-nitrotoluene and para-nitrotoluene. Due to steric hindrance, the para isomer is the major product.\n*   **Product 1:** 4-nitrotoluene (p-nitrotoluene).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4, forming product 2.**\nThis step involves the oxidation of the methyl group. Manganese dioxide (MnO2) is a strong oxidizing agent capable of oxidizing the benzylic methyl group to a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) under acidic conditions. The nitro group (-NO2) is stable to these oxidation conditions.\n*   **Product 2:** 4-nitrobenzoic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide, forming product 3.**\nThis reaction is more complex. Let's analyze the components:\n*   **4-nitrobenzoic acid (Product 2):** An acid.\n*   **Sodium hydroxide (NaOH):** A strong base.\n*   **Acetone ((CH3)2C=O):** A ketone with α-hydrogens.\n\n1.  First, an acid-base reaction occurs: 4-nitrobenzoic acid reacts with NaOH to form sodium 4-nitrobenzoate.\n2.  NaOH also deprotonates the α-carbon of acetone to form an enolate ion (⁻CH2COCH3), which is a strong nucleophile.\n3.  The aromatic ring of 4-nitrobenzoate is highly electron-deficient due to the powerful electron-withdrawing effects of the nitro group (-NO2) and the carboxylate group (-COO⁻). This makes the ring susceptible to nucleophilic attack. The nitro group strongly activates the ortho and para positions to nucleophilic attack.\n4.  The acetone enolate attacks the ring at a position ortho to the nitro group (the C-3 or C-5 position). This reaction is a type of nucleophilic aromatic substitution of hydrogen, related to the Janovsky and Zimmermann reactions. An initial adduct (a Meisenheimer complex) is formed, which is then oxidized (often by atmospheric oxygen or the nitro compound itself) to restore aromaticity.\n\nThe net result is the substitution of a hydrogen atom on the ring with an acetonyl group (-CH2COCH3).\n*   **Product 3:** 3-acetonyl-4-nitrobenzoic acid.\n\n**Symmetry Analysis of Product 3 (3-acetonyl-4-nitrobenzoic acid):**\nLet's analyze the structure of 3-acetonyl-4-nitrobenzoic acid to determine its molecular symmetry group (point group).\n\n*   The molecule has a benzene ring with three different substituents at positions 1 (-COOH), 3 (-CH2COCH3), and 4 (-NO2).\n*   Because the substituents are arranged asymmetrically on the ring, the molecule does not have any rotational axes (except the trivial C1 axis) or an inversion center.\n*   Assuming the most stable conformation where the benzene ring and the planar portions of the substituents (-COOH, -NO2, and the C=O of the acetonyl group) are all co-planar to maximize resonance and minimize steric hindrance, the entire molecule is planar.\n*   A planar molecule that has no other symmetry elements besides the plane of the molecule itself belongs to the **Cs** point group. The plane of the molecule is the single plane of symmetry (σ).\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of product 3 is Cs.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) C2h\nB) D2h\nC) C3\nD) Cs\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
