    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct pair of compounds.\n\n**1. Analyze the given 1H NMR data:**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C10H14 for both compounds.\n*   **Mixture Ratio:** 1:1.\n*   **Aromatic Region (~6.7 ppm):** Two signals, both are singlets, with a 1:1 integration ratio.\n*   **Alkyl Region (~2.2 ppm):** Three signals, all are singlets, with a 2:1:1 integration ratio.\n\n**2. Analyze the structure and predict the 1H NMR spectrum for each candidate compound.**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 3 and 6 are chemically equivalent. They have no adjacent protons, so they appear as a single **singlet** integrating to 2H.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. They appear as a single **singlet** integrating to 12H.\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):**\n    *   This molecule has one plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The protons at positions 4 and 6 are in different chemical environments. Neither has an adjacent proton. Therefore, they appear as two separate **singlets**, each integrating to 1H.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** There are three distinct sets of methyl groups:\n        *   The methyls at C1 and C3 are equivalent (6H).\n        *   The methyl at C2 is unique (3H).\n        *   The methyl at C5 is unique (3H).\n        *   This results in three **singlets** with an integration ratio of 6H:3H:3H, which simplifies to **2:1:1**.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):**\n    *   This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The two protons at positions 5 and 6 are chemically equivalent but are adjacent to each other. They will couple and appear as an **AB quartet** or a pair of doublets, **not a singlet**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** Two sets of equivalent methyl groups (C1/C4 and C2/C3), resulting in two singlets (6H each).\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** The four aromatic protons are equivalent, appearing as a single **singlet** (4H).\n    *   **Ethyl Protons:** The protons of the ethyl groups will show spin-spin splitting. The -CH2- protons will be a **quartet** (4H), and the -CH3 protons will be a **triplet** (6H). The alkyl region will not consist of only singlets.\n\n**3. Eliminate options based on the predicted spectra.**\n\nThe problem states that the mixture's spectrum contains only **singlets** in both the aromatic and alkyl regions (at the specified chemical shifts).\n\n*   We can immediately eliminate **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene** because its aromatic protons would form a multiplet (AB quartet), not a singlet.\n*   We can immediately eliminate **1,4-diethylbenzene** because its alkyl protons would form a quartet and a triplet, not singlets.\n\nThis elimination process rules out any option containing these two compounds.\n*   Option A contains 1,4-diethylbenzene. Incorrect.\n*   Option B contains 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Incorrect.\n*   Option C contains 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Incorrect.\n\nThe only remaining option is **D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.\n\n**4. Verify Option D.**\n\nLet's see if a 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene is consistent with the given NMR data.\n\n*   **Compound 1 (1,2,4,5-TMB):** 1 aromatic singlet (2H), 1 alkyl singlet (12H).\n*   **Compound 2 (1,2,3,5-TMB):** 2 aromatic singlets (1H each), 3 alkyl singlets (6H, 3H, 3H).\n\nIn a 1:1 mixture, we determine the expected signals and their integrations:\n*   **Total Aromatic Protons:** 2H (from Cpd 1) + 2H (from Cpd 2) = 4H.\n*   **Total Alkyl Protons:** 12H (from Cpd 1) + 12H (from Cpd 2) = 24H.\n\nThe problem states there are **two aromatic singlets in a 1:1 ratio**. For a total of 4H, this means each signal must integrate to 2H.\n*   1,2,4,5-TMB provides one 2H singlet.\n*   1,2,3,5-TMB provides two 1H singlets. For these to appear as a single 2H singlet, they must have an accidental overlap (accidental isochrony), which is common in textbook problems.\n*   This combination gives two 2H singlets, matching the 1:1 ratio.\n\nThe problem states there are **three alkyl singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio**. For a total of 24H, this corresponds to signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H (since 12+6+6 = 24 and the ratio is 2:1:1).\n*   1,2,4,5-TMB provides the 12H singlet.\n*   1,2,3,5-TMB provides a 6H singlet and two different 3H singlets.\n*   If the two 3H singlets from 1,2,3,5-TMB have an accidental overlap, they will appear as a single 6H singlet.\n*   This combination results in three signals with integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H, matching the 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nTherefore, the combination of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene is fully consistent with all the provided spectral data.\n\n<<<D>>>"
