    "Here is a step-by-step logical deduction to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y using the information about substance A2.**\n    A2 is a binary compound of element Y and fluorine (F), with a formula of YFₓ.\n    The mass percentage of fluorine (ɷF) in A2 is given as 31.96% or 0.3196.\n    Let M(Y) be the atomic molar mass of element Y and M(F) be the atomic molar mass of fluorine (~19.00 g/mol).\n    The formula for the mass percentage is:\n    ɷF = (x * M(F)) / (M(Y) + x * M(F))\n    0.3196 = (x * 19.00) / (M(Y) + x * 19.00)\n    By rearranging the formula, we can express M(Y) in terms of x:\n    M(Y) = (x * 19.00 / 0.3196) - (x * 19.00)\n    M(Y) ≈ (59.45 * x) - (19.00 * x)\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * x\n\n2.  **Test integer values for x (the number of fluorine atoms, representing the oxidation state of Y).**\n    *   If x = 1, M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (close to K, Ca). Unlikely candidates as they don't form 5 fluorides or highly oxidizing species.\n    *   If x = 2, M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (close to Br). Bromine does not fit all the chemical properties described (e.g., it only has 3 common binary fluorides, and its higher fluorides are not \"bright-red\").\n    *   If x = 3, M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol. This is extremely close to the atomic mass of **Antimony (Sb)**, which is 121.76 g/mol. Let's test this as our primary hypothesis.\n    *   If x = 4, M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol (close to Dy, Tb). Unlikely chemistry.\n    *   If x = 6, M(Y) ≈ 242.7 g/mol (close to Pu). While plutonium chemistry is complex, the properties of PuF₆ do not fully align with all the clues.\n\n3.  **Verify the hypothesis Y = Sb.**\n    If Y is Antimony (Sb) and x=3, then substance A2 is **SbF₃**.\n    Let's calculate the theoretical mass percentage of fluorine in SbF₃ to confirm:\n    M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 18.998 = 178.754 g/mol.\n    ɷF = (3 * 18.998) / 178.754 = 56.994 / 178.754 = 0.3188, or **31.88%**.\n    This value is exceptionally close to the given 31.96%, with a relative difference of only ~0.25%. This provides strong evidence that Y=Sb and A2=SbF₃.\n\n4.  **Identify substance A4.**\n    The problem asks for the molecular weight range of A4. We know that A4 is one of the five binary fluorides of antimony. The two common, stable binary fluorides of antimony are SbF₃ and SbF₅.\n    Let's calculate their molecular weights:\n    *   **MW(SbF₃)** = 178.75 g/mol\n    *   **MW(SbF₅)** = 121.76 + 5 * 18.998 = 216.75 g/mol\n\n5.  **Compare the calculated molecular weights with the given ranges.**\n    A) 140-160\n    B) 160-180\n    C) 220-240\n    D) 110-130\n\n    The molecular weight of **SbF₃ (178.75 g/mol)** falls perfectly within range **B (160-180)**.\n    The molecular weight of SbF₅ (216.75 g/mol) does not fall into any of the given ranges. It is close to range C, but not within it.\n\n6.  **Conclusion.**\n    Based on the highly accurate match from the mass percentage data, Y is Antimony (Sb). Of the possible antimony fluorides, only SbF₃ has a molecular weight that fits one of the provided ranges. Therefore, A4 must be SbF₃.\n\n*Note: There are several apparent contradictions in the qualitative descriptions of the problem (e.g., the properties of A1, the 1:1 reaction). These are likely flaws in the problem statement. However, the quantitative data provide a clear and unambiguous path to the solution.*\n\nThe molecular weight of A4 (SbF₃) is ~179 g/mol, which is in the range of 160-180.\n\n<<<B>>>"
