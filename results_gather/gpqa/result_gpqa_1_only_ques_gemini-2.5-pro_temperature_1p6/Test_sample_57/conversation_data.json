    "This question deals with the concept of ultraviolet (UV) divergences in physical theories, which occur at high energies or, equivalently, at short distances. Regularization is a mathematical procedure used to handle these divergences and make calculations meaningful.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n*   **A) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the quantum field theory of light and matter. When calculating physical quantities using perturbation theory (Feynman diagrams), integrals over the momenta of virtual particles often diverge at high momenta (high energies). This requires the use of regularization techniques (like a momentum cutoff or dimensional regularization) followed by renormalization to obtain finite, physical predictions. Therefore, QED requires regularization.\n\n*   **D) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD):** This is the quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force. Like QED, it is a quantum field theory based on point particles. Calculations in QCD also suffer from ultraviolet divergences in loop diagrams and absolutely require regularization and renormalization.\n\n*   **C) Classical Electrodynamics:** This theory, described by Maxwell's equations, is not a quantum theory. However, it has its own well-known high-energy divergence problem: the self-energy of a point charge. If you model an electron as a true mathematical point, the energy stored in its own electric field is infinite. To get a finite result, one must \"regularize\" the problem, for instance, by assuming the charge has a small but finite radius. Thus, even the classical theory requires a form of regularization to avoid infinities at short distances.\n\n*   **B) Superstring Theory:** A key motivation and feature of superstring theory is its potential to be a \"UV-complete\" theory of quantum gravity. Unlike point-particle theories, the fundamental objects in string theory are one-dimensional, extended strings. This \"fuzziness\" smooths out interactions at very short distances. As a result, the scattering amplitudes calculated in superstring theory are believed to be free of the ultraviolet (high-energy) divergences that plague quantum field theories. The finite size of the string acts as a natural regulator, meaning no additional, artificial regularization procedure is needed for high-energy behavior.\n\nTherefore, Superstring Theory is the only theory on the list that is thought not to require regularization at high energies.\n\n<<<B>>>"
