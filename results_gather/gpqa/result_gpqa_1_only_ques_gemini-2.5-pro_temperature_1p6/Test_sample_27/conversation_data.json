    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the alcohol**\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. This is an α,β-unsaturated ketone with a secondary alcohol. The stereocenter at C4 has the (S) configuration. In a standard representation, the hydroxyl group (-OH) is on a wedge.\n*   **Reagents:** tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) and triethylamine (Et3N).\n*   **Reaction:** The hydroxyl group is protected as a tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) ether. This is a standard procedure. Et3N acts as a base to neutralize the HCl formed during the reaction. The stereochemistry at C4 is retained.\n*   **Product 1:** (S)-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)cyclohex-2-en-1-one. The bulky OTBS group is on a wedge at the C4 position.\n\n**Step 2: Conjugate addition and enolate trapping**\n*   **Reagents:** Diphenylcopperlithium (Ph2CuLi), followed by benzyl bromide (BnBr).\n*   **Reaction Part 1 (Conjugate Addition):** Ph2CuLi is a Gilman reagent, which is a soft nucleophile that undergoes 1,4-conjugate addition (Michael addition) to α,β-unsaturated ketones. The phenyl anion (Ph-) attacks the β-carbon (C3) of the enone system. The attack occurs from the face opposite to the bulky OTBS group at C4. Since the OTBS group is on a wedge (up), the phenyl group will add from the bottom face, resulting in a dash bond. This establishes a trans relationship between the substituents at C3 and C4. This addition creates a lithium enolate intermediate.\n    *   Stereochemistry after addition: C4 remains (S) with the OTBS group on a wedge. The new center at C3 has the phenyl group on a dash, which corresponds to an (R) configuration.\n*   **Reaction Part 2 (Enolate Trapping):** The lithium enolate formed is then trapped by the electrophile, benzyl bromide. The enolate attacks the benzyl group at the α-carbon (C2). The stereochemistry of this alkylation is also controlled by sterics. The phenyl group at C3 (on a dash) blocks the bottom face, so the benzyl group attacks from the top face, resulting in a wedge bond.\n    *   Stereochemistry after alkylation: The new center at C2 has the benzyl group on a wedge, which corresponds to an (S) configuration.\n*   **Product 2:** (2S,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: A second alkylation**\n*   **Reagents:** Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at low temperature, followed by iodomethane (CH3I).\n*   **Reaction Part 1 (Enolate Formation):** LDA is a strong, bulky, non-nucleophilic base. It forms the kinetic enolate by removing the most sterically accessible α-proton. Product 2 has protons at C2 and C6. The proton at C2 is trisubstituted and highly hindered by the adjacent benzyl and phenyl groups. The protons at C6 are much less hindered. Therefore, LDA deprotonates C6 to form the kinetic enolate between C1 and C6.\n*   **Reaction Part 2 (Alkylation):** The enolate attacks the methyl group of iodomethane, adding a methyl group to C6. The stereochemistry of this methylation is determined by minimizing steric interactions in the transition state. The most stable chair conformation of the intermediate has the three large substituents (OTBS, Benzyl, Phenyl) in equatorial positions. A detailed analysis shows that the equatorial attack on C6 is sterically favored, leading to the formation of the product with an equatorial methyl group. In the stable chair conformation, an equatorial group at C6 is on a wedge. A wedge methyl group at C6 results in an (S) configuration.\n*   **Product 3:** (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-6-methyl-4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Step 4: Deprotection**\n*   **Reagent:** Aqueous HCl (H3O+).\n*   **Reaction:** The acidic aqueous workup cleaves the silyl ether (OTBS) protective group, regenerating the hydroxyl group (-OH). This reaction does not affect the other functional groups or the stereocenters.\n*   **Product 4 (Final Product):** (2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.\n\n**Comparing with the Options:**\n*   A) (2S,3S,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-**2-methyl**-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one. Incorrect methylation position (C2) and C3 stereochemistry.\n*   B) ...biphenyl... Incorrect structure type.\n*   C) **(2S,3R,4S,6S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one.** This matches our derived structure and stereochemistry perfectly.\n*   D) (2R,3R,4S)-2-benzyl-4-hydroxy-**2-methyl**-3-phenylcyclohexan-1-one. Incorrect methylation position (C2) and C2 stereochemistry.\n\nThe correct product is given in option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
