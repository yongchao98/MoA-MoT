    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct compound.\n\n**1. Analyze the FTIR Data**\n\n*   **A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is caused by extensive hydrogen bonding.\n*   **A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This is characteristic of the C=O (carbonyl) stretch. In a carboxylic acid, this peak typically appears around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹.\n\n**Conclusion from FTIR:** The unknown compound is a carboxylic acid. All four possible options (A, B, C, and D) are carboxylic acids, so this information confirms the functional group is present in all candidates but does not help distinguish between them.\n\n**2. Analyze the ¹H NMR Data**\n\n*   **No signals corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** This indicates the absence of C=C double bonds. All four options are saturated molecules, consistent with this information.\n*   **The key information is the splitting patterns (multiplicity):**\n    *   One signal is a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This means the proton giving this signal is coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (giving the doublet, d).\n        *   A group of two neighboring protons (giving the triplet, t).\n        *   A group of three neighboring protons (giving the quartet, q).\n    *   A different signal is a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This means the proton giving this signal is coupled to three different groups of neighboring protons:\n        *   One neighboring proton (giving the doublet, d).\n        *   A group of two neighboring protons (giving the first triplet, t).\n        *   Another, non-equivalent group of two neighboring protons (giving the second triplet, t).\n\n**3. Analyze the Structures of the Candidate Compounds**\n\nLet's determine the IUPAC names and analyze the expected splitting patterns for the protons in each molecule. We will focus on the most complex signals, which typically arise from C-H protons on the backbone of the molecule. The `n+1` rule applies for protons on adjacent carbons (vicinal coupling).\n\n*   **A) CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH → 2,3-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   The `H` on C3 is adjacent to a `CH` (at C2) and a `CH₂` (at C4). Its signal would be a doublet of triplets (`dt`).\n    *   The `H` on C2 is adjacent to a `CH` (at C3). Its signal would be a doublet (`d`).\n    *   This molecule does not have protons that would give `dtt` or `dtq` signals from standard vicinal coupling.\n\n*   **C) CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH → 3,4-dimethylpentanoic acid**\n    *   The `H` on C3 is adjacent to a `CH` (at C4) and a `CH₂` (at C2). Its signal would be a doublet of triplets (`dt`).\n    *   The `H` on C4 is adjacent to a `CH` (at C3) and a `CH₃` (at C5). Its signal would be a doublet of quartets (`dq`).\n    *   This molecule does not have protons that would give `dtt` or `dtq` signals.\n\n*   **D) CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH → 2,3-diethylpentanoic acid**\n    Let's draw the structure: `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH(Et)(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   Consider the proton on **C3**. It is adjacent to:\n        *   The `CH` group at C2 (1 proton).\n        *   The `CH₂` group at C4 (2 protons).\n        *   The `CH₂` group of the ethyl substituent on C3 itself (2 protons).\n    *   This proton is coupled to one proton, a group of two protons, and another group of two protons. This would result in a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. So, molecule D is a strong candidate as it contains one of the required signals. However, it is difficult to find a proton that would produce a `dtq` through standard vicinal coupling.\n\n*   **B) CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH → 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid**\n    Let's draw the structure based on this, the correct IUPAC interpretation of the condensed formula:\n    `CH₃(6)-CH₂(5)-CH(CH₃)(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n    *   Let's first look for the **dtt** signal. Consider the proton on **C3**. It is adjacent to:\n        *   The `CH` group at C4 (1 proton).\n        *   The `CH₂` group at C2 (2 protons).\n        *   The `CH₂` group of its own ethyl substituent (2 protons).\n    *   This proton is coupled to one proton, a group of two protons, and another group of two protons. This gives a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This matches one of the observed signals.\n\n    *   Now, let's look for the **dtq** signal. Consider the proton on **C4**. It is adjacent to:\n        *   The `CH` group at C3 (1 proton).\n        *   The `CH₂` group at C5 (2 protons).\n    *   Standard vicinal coupling would result in a doublet of triplets (`dt`). However, complex molecules can exhibit observable coupling over 4 bonds (long-range coupling), especially if the protons are held in a 'W' or planar zig-zag conformation. The proton on C4 is 4 bonds away from the `CH₃` group at C6 (`H(4)-C(4)-C(5)-C(6)-H₃`). If this coupling is resolved, the `H(4)` signal would be split by:\n        *   The `H` at C3 (1H) → doublet (d)\n        *   The `CH₂` at C5 (2H) → triplet (t)\n        *   The `CH₃` at C6 (3H) → quartet (q) (long-range)\n    *   This would produce the required **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. While relying on long-range coupling can sometimes be ambiguous, molecule B is the only structure that provides a clear origin for both the `dtt` and `dtq` signals simultaneously, with the `dtt` arising from unambiguous vicinal coupling and the `dtq` arising from a plausible combination of vicinal and long-range coupling.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMolecule B, 3-ethyl-4-methylhexanoic acid, is the only candidate that provides a reasonable explanation for both the `dtt` and `dtq` signals described in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<B>>>"
