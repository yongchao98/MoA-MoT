    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the structure of compound D.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Compound A**\n\n*   The proton NMR spectrum of compound A shows two signals.\n*   A triplet at 0.9 ppm with an integration of 6H. A triplet (n+1=3, so n=2) for 6 hydrogens is characteristic of two equivalent methyl groups (-CH3), each adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n*   A quartet at 1.3 ppm with an integration of 4H. A quartet (n+1=4, so n=3) for 4 hydrogens is characteristic of two equivalent methylene groups (-CH2-), each adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3).\n*   Putting these pieces together, we have two equivalent ethyl groups (CH3-CH2-). For the signals to be so simple, the molecule must be symmetrical. The chemical shifts (0.9 and 1.3 ppm) are in the typical alkane region.\n*   The structure that fits this data is n-butane (CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3). Due to symmetry, the two CH3 groups are equivalent, and the two CH2 groups are equivalent. The CH3 groups (6H) are next to a CH2 group (2H), so they appear as a triplet. The CH2 groups (4H) are next to a CH3 group (3H), so they appear as a quartet.\n*   **Compound A is n-butane.**\n\n**Step 2: Identify Compound B**\n\n*   Compound A (n-butane) undergoes monobromination. This is a free-radical halogenation reaction.\n*   n-Butane has primary hydrogens (at C1 and C4) and secondary hydrogens (at C2 and C3).\n*   Free radical bromination is selective, preferentially substituting at the most stable radical position. A secondary radical is more stable than a primary radical.\n*   Therefore, the major product of monobromination of n-butane is 2-bromobutane.\n*   **Compound B is 2-bromobutane (CH3-CH(Br)-CH2-CH3).**\n\n**Step 3: Identify Compound C**\n\n*   Compound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic KOH. This is a strong base in alcohol, promoting an E2 elimination reaction.\n*   The bromine is on C2. A hydrogen can be removed from C1 or C3.\n*   According to Zaitsev's rule, the major product is the more substituted (more stable) alkene.\n    *   Elimination of H from C1 gives but-1-ene (a monosubstituted alkene).\n    *   Elimination of H from C3 gives but-2-ene (a disubstituted alkene).\n*   The major product is but-2-ene. The problem states that C has two geometrical isomers, which confirms this, as but-2-ene exists as *cis* and *trans* isomers.\n*   **Compound C is but-2-ene (CH3-CH=CH-CH3).** The reaction will use the *cis*-isomer.\n\n**Step 4: The Diels-Alder Reaction to form Compound D**\n\n*   The *cis*-isomer of C (*cis*-but-2-ene) acts as the dienophile.\n*   The diene is (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol.\n*   This is a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction (Diels-Alder reaction) which forms a six-membered ring.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Structure and Stereochemistry of Compound D**\n\n1.  **Reactants:**\n    *   Diene: (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol. For the reaction, it must adopt an s-cis conformation. In this conformation, the \"outer\" groups (pointing away from the C-shape) are the -OH at C1 and the -CH3 at C4. The \"inner\" groups are the hydrogens at C1 and C4.\n    *   Dienophile: *cis*-but-2-ene. The two methyl groups are *cis* to each other.\n\n2.  **Product Structure:**\n    *   The reaction forms a cyclohexene ring. Numbering according to IUPAC rules, the OH group is at C1, the double bond is between C2 and C3, the methyl group from the diene is at C4, and the two methyl groups from the dienophile are at C5 and C6. The product is named **4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**. This eliminates options C and D which have an incorrect substitution pattern (6,6-dimethyl).\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction can proceed via two main pathways: *endo* or *exo*.\n    *   The *endo* pathway is usually kinetically favored due to secondary orbital overlap. In the *endo* product, the substituents from the dienophile are *cis* to the \"inner\" groups of the diene.\n    *   The *exo* pathway is usually thermodynamically favored as it is less sterically hindered. In the *exo* product, the substituents from the dienophile are *cis* to the \"outer\" groups of the diene.\n    *   Let's analyze the *exo* product, as it is a common outcome when steric hindrance is significant, as it is here with a *cis*-disubstituted dienophile.\n    *   In the *exo* product:\n        *   The two methyl groups from *cis*-but-2-ene (at C5 and C6) are *cis* to each other.\n        *   These methyl groups are *cis* to the \"outer\" groups of the diene, which are the -OH at C1 and the -CH3 at C4.\n    *   Therefore, in the *exo* product, the four key substituents (-OH at C1, -CH3 at C4, -CH3 at C5, and -CH3 at C6) are all *cis* to each other (all on the same face of the ring).\n\n4.  **Assigning R/S Configuration:**\n    *   Let's draw one enantiomer of this *exo* product, placing all four substituents \"up\" (wedge) and all their corresponding hydrogens \"down\" (dash).\n    *   We can now assign the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog configuration at each chiral center (C1, C4, C5, C6).\n        *   **C1:** Priorities: -OH (1), -C2=C (2), -C6 (3), -H (4). H is back (down). The sequence 1→2→3 is counter-clockwise. **C1 is S.**\n        *   **C4:** Priorities: -C3=C (1), -C5 (2), -CH3 (3), -H (4). H is back (down). The sequence 1→2→3 is clockwise. **C4 is R.**\n        *   **C5:** Priorities: -C6 (1), -C4 (2), -CH3 (3), -H (4). H is back (down). The sequence 1→2→3 is counter-clockwise. **C5 is S.**\n        *   **C6:** Priorities: -C1 (1), -C5 (2), -CH3 (3), -H (4). H is back (down). The sequence 1→2→3 is clockwise. **C6 is R.**\n    *   The resulting product is **(1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol**. This configuration matches option B exactly. (The reaction produces a racemic mixture of this compound and its enantiomer, (1R,4S,5R,6S)).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reaction proceeds via an *exo* Diels-Alder addition to give compound D, which is (1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol.\n\n<<<B>>>"
