    "This question requires understanding the cellular processes occurring during shmoo formation in yeast and how they relate to the protein complexes listed.\n\n1.  **Shmoo Formation:** When a yeast cell is exposed to a mating pheromone (in this case, mimicked by a bacterial peptide), it arrests its cell cycle in the **G1 phase** and undergoes a major transcriptional program to prepare for mating. This involves expressing genes for cell-cell adhesion, cell fusion, and pheromone signaling. The cell does not replicate its DNA; it is arrested *before* the S phase.\n\n2.  **The Experiment (ChIP-MS on Active Chromatin):** The goal is to identify proteins on *active chromatin*. Active chromatin is where genes are being transcribed. This means we are looking for proteins involved in transcription.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Protein Complexes:**\n    *   **A) Enhancer protein complex:** Enhancers are DNA regions that bind transcription factors to increase the rate of transcription of a gene. These complexes are integral to *active transcription* and would be abundant on the active chromatin of a shmooing cell.\n    *   **C) Nucleosome histone complex:** Nucleosomes are the basic unit of chromatin. Active chromatin is made of nucleosomes, often with specific modifications (like acetylation) that make the DNA more accessible. Any ChIP experiment that pulls down chromatin will recover large amounts of core histone proteins.\n    *   **D) Pre-initiation complex (PIC):** The PIC consists of general transcription factors and RNA polymerase II assembled at a gene's promoter. Its presence is the definitive sign that a gene is about to be or is being actively transcribed. Since shmoo formation involves massive gene expression changes, PICs would be abundant on active chromatin.\n    *   **B) Pre-replication complex (pre-RC):** This complex (containing ORC, Cdc6, Cdt1, Mcm2-7) assembles on origins of replication during the G1 phase to \"license\" the DNA for replication in the upcoming S phase. However, a shmooing cell is **arrested in G1** and **inhibits the transition to S phase**. Its cellular machinery is dedicated to mating, not DNA replication. While the pre-RC is assembled in G1, it is not part of the active transcription machinery, and its function (replication) is suppressed in this state. Therefore, compared to complexes directly involved in the highly active transcription process, the pre-replication complex would be the least enriched in a sample of *active chromatin*.\n\n**Conclusion:** The shmooing cell is characterized by high transcriptional activity but an arrest of the cell cycle before DNA replication. Therefore, complexes involved in transcription (enhancer and pre-initiation complexes) will be highly abundant on active chromatin. The pre-replication complex, which is involved in a process that is actively suppressed, will be the least abundant.\n\n<<<B>>>"
