    "An oscillating charge distribution acts as a source of electromagnetic radiation. The most fundamental and dominant form of radiation from a compact oscillating source (whose size is much smaller than the wavelength \\lambda) is electric dipole radiation. We will model the oscillating spheroid as a simple oscillating electric dipole.\n\n1.  **Identify the physical model:** The oscillating spheroid, with its axis of symmetry along the z-axis, can be modeled as an electric dipole `p(t)` oscillating along the z-axis.\n\n2.  **Recall the radiation pattern for an electric dipole:** The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle `(dP/dΩ)` by an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis is given by:\n    `(dP/dΩ) = C * sin²(θ)`\n    where `θ` is the polar angle measured from the axis of oscillation (the z-axis), and `C` is a constant that depends on the frequency (or wavelength) and the amplitude of the dipole moment.\n\n3.  **Determine the maximum power:** The radiated power is maximum when `sin²(θ)` is maximum. The maximum value of `sin²(θ)` is 1, which occurs at `θ = 90°` (i.e., in the plane perpendicular to the axis of oscillation).\n    The problem states that this maximum radiated power per unit solid angle is `A`.\n    So, `A = (dP/dΩ)_max = C * sin²(90°) = C * 1 = C`.\n    Thus, we can write the radiated power at any angle `θ` as:\n    `(dP/dΩ) = A * sin²(θ)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the power at the given angle:** We need to find the fraction of `A` that is radiated at an angle `θ = 30°`. We calculate the power at this angle using the formula from the previous step:\n    `(dP/dΩ) at θ=30° = A * sin²(30°)`\n    We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\n    Therefore, `sin²(30°) = (1/2)² = 1/4`.\n    So, `(dP/dΩ) at θ=30° = A * (1/4) = A/4`.\n    The fraction of `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is `(A/4) / A = 1/4`.\n\n5.  **Determine the wavelength dependence:** Now, we need to find the dependence of the radiated power on the wavelength `λ`. The full formula for the time-averaged power per unit solid angle from an oscillating electric dipole `p(t) = p₀ cos(ωt)` is:\n    `(dP/dΩ) = (p₀² ω⁴ / (32π²ε₀c³)) * sin²(θ)`\n    Here, `ω` is the angular frequency of oscillation, `p₀` is the amplitude of the dipole moment, `ε₀` is the permittivity of free space, and `c` is the speed of light.\n    The angular frequency `ω` is related to the wavelength `λ` by `ω = 2πf = 2π(c/λ)`.\n    So, `ω⁴ ∝ (1/λ)⁴ = λ⁻⁴`.\n    This means the radiated power per unit solid angle is proportional to `λ⁻⁴`.\n    The function `f(\\lambda, θ) = (dP/dΩ)` therefore has a `λ⁻⁴` dependence. This is the basis of Rayleigh scattering, which explains why the sky is blue (shorter wavelengths are scattered more strongly).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   The fraction of the maximum power `A` radiated at `θ = 30°` is **1/4**.\n*   A possible form of the function `f` (representing the power) shows a dependence on wavelength as **λ⁻⁴**.\n\nCombining these two results, we look at the given options:\nA) 1/4, λ⁻⁴\nB) 1/4, λ⁻³\nC) 3/4, λ⁻⁶\nD) 1/2, λ⁻⁴\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
