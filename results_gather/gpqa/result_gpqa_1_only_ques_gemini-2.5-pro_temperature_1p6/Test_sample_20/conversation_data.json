    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism**\n\nTautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two readily interconvertible structural isomers. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of an α-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group).\n\n1.  **Benzoquinone (p-benzoquinone):**\n    *   The structure of p-benzoquinone is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds.\n    *   All carbon atoms in the ring are sp² hybridized.\n    *   To exhibit keto-enol tautomerism, there must be an α-hydrogen on an sp³ hybridized carbon. Benzoquinone lacks any sp³ hybridized carbon atoms in its ring, and therefore has no α-hydrogens.\n    *   Thus, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.**\n\n2.  **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   This compound has three ketone (C=O) groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbons between the carbonyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are CH₂ groups.\n    *   These methylene (CH₂) carbons are sp³ hybridized and are α-carbons to the adjacent carbonyl groups. The hydrogens on these carbons are α-hydrogens.\n    *   Because it has α-hydrogens, it can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. The resulting enol form is 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol), which is an aromatic and highly stable compound. The equilibrium strongly favors this aromatic enol form.\n    *   Thus, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.**\n\n**Conclusion for Part A:** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. The most common feature causing chirality is a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n1.  **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is attached to four different groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl)\n    *   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. The molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral.\n    *   Thus, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism.**\n\n2.  **Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   This is the *trans* isomer of an alkene with the structure H₃COOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   The molecule is planar and possesses a plane of symmetry that lies in the plane of the molecule itself, as well as a center of inversion.\n    *   There are no chiral centers (no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups).\n    *   Because the molecule is achiral (it is superimposable on its mirror image), it cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n    *   Thus, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism.**\n\n**Conclusion for Part B:** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n*   (A) The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n*   (B) The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
