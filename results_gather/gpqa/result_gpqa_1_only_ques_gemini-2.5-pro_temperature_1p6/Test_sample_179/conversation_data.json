    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the minimum energy of the system.\n\n**1. Define the System and Energy Components**\n\nThe system consists of 13 identical particles, each with a charge `q = 2e`.\n*   One particle, `q_P`, is fixed at a point P.\n*   The other 12 particles, `q_i` (for `i = 1 to 12`), are constrained to the surface of a sphere of radius `R = 2 m` centered at P.\n\nThe total potential energy of the system `U_total` is the sum of the potential energies of all unique pairs of charges. We can split this into two parts:\n1.  `U_center_sphere`: The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge `q_P` and the 12 charges on the sphere.\n2.  `U_sphere_sphere`: The potential energy from the interactions among the 12 charges on the sphere.\n\n`U_total = U_center_sphere + U_sphere_sphere`\n\n**2. Calculate `U_center_sphere`**\n\nThe potential energy between the central charge `q_P = 2e` and each of the 12 sphere charges `q_i = 2e` is given by Coulomb's law. The distance is `R = 2 m`.\nThe energy for one such pair is `k * q_P * q_i / R`, where `k ≈ 8.98755 x 10^9 N m^2 / C^2` is Coulomb's constant.\nSince there are 12 such charges on the sphere, this part of the energy is:\n`U_center_sphere = 12 * (k * (2e) * (2e) / R)`\n`U_center_sphere = 12 * (k * 4e^2 / R)`\n`U_center_sphere = 48 * (k * e^2 / R)`\n\nThis energy is fixed as long as the charges are on the sphere.\n\n**3. Calculate `U_sphere_sphere`**\n\nTo find the minimum energy of the entire system, we must also minimize `U_sphere_sphere`. This involves finding the arrangement of 12 identical charges on the surface of a sphere that minimizes their mutual repulsion energy. This is a classic problem known as the **Thomson problem**.\n\nFor `N=12`, the minimum energy configuration is achieved when the charges are located at the vertices of a regular **icosahedron**.\n\nWe need to calculate the sum of potential energies for all pairs of these 12 charges. There are `12 * 11 / 2 = 66` pairs. In an icosahedron with edge length `a` inscribed in a sphere of radius `R`, the distances between vertices are not all the same. There are three distinct distances between pairs of vertices:\n*   The edge length `a`. There are 30 such pairs (the edges of the icosahedron). Let this be `d_1 = a`.\n*   The short diagonal across a face, which connects a vertex to its 5 \"next-nearest\" neighbors. The distance is `a * φ`, where `φ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ 1.618` is the golden ratio. There are 30 such pairs. Let this be `d_2 = aφ`.\n*   The long diagonal connecting antipodal vertices, which is the diameter of the sphere `2R`. There are 6 such pairs. Let this be `d_3 = 2R`.\n\nThe potential energy of the 12 charges on the sphere is the sum over all 66 pairs:\n`U_sphere_sphere = k(2e)^2 * [ 30/d_1 + 30/d_2 + 6/d_3 ]`\n`U_sphere_sphere = 4ke^2 * [ 30/a + 30/(aφ) + 6/(2R) ]`\n`U_sphere_sphere = 4ke^2 * [ (30/a)(1 + 1/φ) + 3/R ]`\nUsing the identity `1 + 1/φ = φ`:\n`U_sphere_sphere = 4ke^2 * [ 30φ/a + 3/R ]`\n\nNow we need the relationship between the icosahedron edge length `a` and the circumradius `R`. For an icosahedron:\n`a = 4R / sqrt(10 + 2*sqrt(5))`\nSo, `a/R = 4 / sqrt(10 + 2*sqrt(5))`, or `R/a = sqrt(10 + 2*sqrt(5)) / 4`.\n\nSubstitute `1/a = (1/R) * (R/a)` into the energy expression:\n`U_sphere_sphere = 4ke^2 * [ (30φ/R) * (R/a) + 3/R ]`\n`U_sphere_sphere = (4ke^2/R) * [ 30φ * (sqrt(10 + 2*sqrt(5)) / 4) + 3 ]`\n`U_sphere_sphere = (4ke^2/R) * [ 7.5φ * sqrt(10 + 2*sqrt(5)) + 3 ]`\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Energy and Substitute Values**\n\n`U_total = U_center_sphere + U_sphere_sphere`\n`U_total = 48(ke^2/R) + (4ke^2/R) * [ 7.5φ * sqrt(10 + 2*sqrt(5)) + 3 ]`\n`U_total = (ke^2/R) * [ 48 + 4 * (7.5φ * sqrt(10 + 2*sqrt(5)) + 3) ]`\n`U_total = (ke^2/R) * [ 48 + 30φ * sqrt(10 + 2*sqrt(5)) + 12 ]`\n`U_total = (ke^2/R) * [ 60 + 30φ * sqrt(10 + 2*sqrt(5)) ]`\n\nNow, let's evaluate the numerical constant in the bracket:\n*   `φ ≈ 1.618034`\n*   `sqrt(5) ≈ 2.236068`\n*   `sqrt(10 + 2*sqrt(5)) ≈ sqrt(14.472136) ≈ 3.804226`\n*   `30φ * sqrt(10 + 2*sqrt(5)) ≈ 30 * 1.618034 * 3.804226 ≈ 184.6617`\n*   The total constant is `60 + 184.6617 = 244.6617`.\n\nSo, `U_total = 244.6617 * (ke^2 / R)`.\n\nLet's plug in the physical constants:\n*   `k ≈ 8.98755 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2`\n*   `e ≈ 1.602177 x 10^-19 C`\n*   `R = 2 m`\n\nFirst, calculate the term `ke^2 / R`:\n`ke^2 / R = (8.98755 x 10^9 * (1.602177 x 10^-19)^2) / 2`\n`ke^2 / R ≈ (8.98755 x 10^9 * 2.56697 x 10^-38) / 2`\n`ke^2 / R ≈ (2.30707 x 10^-28) / 2`\n`ke^2 / R ≈ 1.15354 x 10^-28 J`\n\nNow, calculate the total energy:\n`U_total = 244.6617 * (1.15354 x 10^-28 J)`\n`U_total ≈ 2.8222 x 10^-26 J`\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe calculated minimum energy is `2.822 x 10^-26 J`. This matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
