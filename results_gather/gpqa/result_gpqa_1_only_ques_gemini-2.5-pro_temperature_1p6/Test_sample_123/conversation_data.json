    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing principles:** The problem involves two key concepts from physics:\n    *   **Radioactive/Particle Decay:** The number of particles, N, remaining after a certain time follows an exponential decay law.\n    *   **Special Relativity (Time Dilation):** A moving particle's internal clock runs slower as observed from a stationary frame (the lab/detector frame). This means its lifetime appears longer.\n\n2.  **Formulate the equation:**\n    The fraction of particles (N/N₀) that survive after traveling a distance R in the lab frame is given by:\n    N/N₀ = exp( -t_lab / T_lab )\n    Where:\n    *   `t_lab` is the time it takes to travel the distance R in the lab frame.\n    *   `T_lab` is the average lifetime of the particle in the lab frame.\n\n3.  **Express the terms using given variables:**\n    *   The particles are \"ultra-relativistic,\" so their velocity `v` is approximately the speed of light, `c`.\n    *   Therefore, the time to travel the detector radius `R` is `t_lab ≈ R / c`.\n    *   The particle's lifetime in the lab frame (`T_lab`) is related to its proper lifetime in its own rest frame (`τ`) by the Lorentz factor (`γ`): `T_lab = γ * τ`.\n    *   Substituting these into the decay equation, we get:\n        N/N₀ = exp( -(R/c) / (γ * τ) ) = exp( -R / (γ * c * τ) )\n\n4.  **Use the initial condition to find a constant:**\n    We are given:\n    *   `R = 30 m`\n    *   Initial fraction `(N/N₀)₁ = 1/3`\n    *   Initial Lorentz factor `γ₁ = 20`\n\n    Plugging these values into our equation:\n    1/3 = exp( -30 / (20 * c * τ) )\n\n    To solve for the unknown `c*τ` (which is a constant for this type of particle), we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * c * τ)\n    -ln(3) = -30 / (20 * c * τ)\n    ln(3) = 30 / (20 * c * τ)  ---- (Equation 1)\n\n5.  **Use the final condition to set up the second equation:**\n    We want to find the new Lorentz factor, `γ₂`, required for the final fraction `(N/N₀)₂` to be `2/3`.\n    2/3 = exp( -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ) )\n\n    Again, taking the natural logarithm:\n    ln(2/3) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)\n    -ln(3/2) = -30 / (γ₂ * c * τ)\n    ln(3/2) = 30 / (γ₂ * c * τ) ---- (Equation 2)\n\n6.  **Solve for the new Lorentz factor (γ₂):**\n    The easiest way to solve for `γ₂` is to divide Equation 1 by Equation 2:\n    ln(3) / ln(3/2) = [ 30 / (20 * c * τ) ] / [ 30 / (γ₂ * c * τ) ]\n    ln(3) / ln(3/2) = ( 30 / (20 * c * τ) ) * ( (γ₂ * c * τ) / 30 )\n\n    The terms `30` and `c*τ` cancel out:\n    ln(3) / ln(3/2) = γ₂ / 20\n\n    Now, solve for `γ₂`:\n    γ₂ = 20 * [ ln(3) / ln(3/2) ]\n    γ₂ ≈ 20 * [ 1.0986 / 0.4055 ]\n    γ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709\n    γ₂ ≈ 54.18\n\n7.  **Compare with the options:**\n    The calculated value `γ₂ ≈ 54.18` is very close to 54.\n\nTherefore, the correct Lorentz factor is approximately 54.\n\n<<<B>>>"
