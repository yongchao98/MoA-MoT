    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n1.  **Analysis of FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ is highly characteristic of the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. The broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, specifically consistent with the carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid (~1700-1725 cm⁻¹).\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch.\n    *   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n2.  **Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens (hydrogens attached to the carbons of a double bond) confirms the presence of a C=C double bond.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid. This fragment corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group, [COOH]⁺ (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45).\n\n**Synthesizing the Information:**\nThe combined data strongly indicates that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. It must contain:\n*   A carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH), which has two oxygen atoms and one C=O double bond.\n*   An alkene functional group (C=C), which is a C=C double bond.\n\n**Evaluating the Options using the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\nThe Degree of Unsaturation tells us the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule. The formula is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2). Our molecule has one C=C bond (1 DoU) and one C=O bond (1 DoU), so it must have a total DoU of 2.\n\n*   **A) C6H10O:** Has only one oxygen, so it cannot be a carboxylic acid. Also, DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This fits the DoU but not the functional group.\n*   **B) C6H12O:** Has only one oxygen. DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This DoU is too low.\n*   **C) C6H12O2:** Contains two oxygens. DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This DoU is too low. A saturated carboxylic acid like hexanoic acid has this formula, but it lacks the C=C bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR.\n*   **D) C6H10O2:** Contains two oxygens, which can form a carboxylic acid. Let's check the DoU: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = 2. This matches our requirement for one C=C bond and one C=O bond.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe formula C6H10O2 is the only option that is consistent with all the spectral data: it has two oxygens for the carboxylic acid group and a degree of unsaturation of 2, accounting for both the C=O and C=C double bonds.\n\n<<<D>>>"
