    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Identify the Rest Wavelength:** The Lyman-alpha (Lyα) transition of hydrogen has a rest-frame wavelength (λ_rest) of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å). This is in the far-ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n2.  **Identify the Observational Constraint:** The problem states the detection is done with \"optical ground-based telescopes.\" The Earth's atmosphere, primarily due to ozone (O3), absorbs most ultraviolet radiation. The atmosphere becomes transparent to light at a wavelength of approximately 3200 Å (or 320 nm). For practical spectroscopic observations of faint objects, a more realistic limit where atmospheric transmission becomes reasonably good is around 3500 Å. We are looking for the minimum redshift that will shift the 1216 Å line to a wavelength longer than this atmospheric cutoff.\n\n3.  **Use the Redshift Formula:** The relationship between the rest-frame wavelength (λ_rest), the observed wavelength (λ_observed), and the redshift (z) is given by:\n    λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + z)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Minimum Redshift:** We need to find the redshift 'z' for which the observed wavelength is equal to the atmospheric cutoff wavelength. We can rearrange the formula to solve for z:\n    z = (λ_observed / λ_rest) - 1\n\n    Let's calculate the redshift required to shift the Lyα line to the edge of the atmospheric window, say ~3500 Å, which corresponds to the most plausible physical limit given the answer choices.\n    *   λ_rest = 1216 Å\n    *   λ_observed_min ≈ 3500 Å\n\n    z_min = (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\n    z_min ≈ 2.88 - 1\n    z_min ≈ 1.88\n\n5.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    *   A) 3\n    *   B) 2.4\n    *   C) 1.2\n    *   D) 1.9\n\n    Our calculated value of z ≈ 1.88 is very close to 1.9.\n\n    Let's check the observed wavelength for the given options to be certain:\n    *   For z = 1.2: λ_observed = 1216 * (1 + 1.2) = 2675 Å. This is deep in the UV and is completely blocked by the atmosphere. So, C is incorrect.\n    *   For z = 1.9: λ_observed = 1216 * (1 + 1.9) = 3526 Å. This is at the very blue edge of the optical window and is observable from the ground.\n    *   For z = 2.4 and z = 3, the observed wavelengths would be 4134 Å and 4864 Å respectively. These are well within the optical window and easily observable.\n\n    The question asks for the *lower limit*. Since z=1.2 is not observable, and z=1.9 is the lowest redshift among the remaining options that makes the line observable, it is the correct answer for the lower limit.\n\n<<<D>>>"
