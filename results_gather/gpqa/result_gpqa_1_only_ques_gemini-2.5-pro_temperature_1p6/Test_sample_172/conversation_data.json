    "This problem requires us to connect the uncertainty in position (`Δx`) with the uncertainty in energy (`ΔE`). We can do this in two steps using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the energy-momentum relation.\n\n**Step 1: Find the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) from the uncertainty in position (Δx).**\n\nHeisenberg's Uncertainty Principle for position and momentum states:\n`Δx * Δp_x ≥ ħ / 2`\n\nwhere:\n*   `Δx` is the uncertainty in position.\n*   `Δp_x` is the uncertainty in momentum in the x-direction.\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, `ħ ≈ 1.054 * 10^(-34) J·s`.\n\nTo find the *minimum* uncertainty, we use the equality:\n`Δx * Δp_x ≈ ħ / 2`\n\nWe are given `Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1 * 10^(-9) m = 10^(-10) m`.\n\nNow, we can solve for `Δp_x`:\n`Δp_x ≈ ħ / (2 * Δx)`\n`Δp_x ≈ (1.054 * 10^(-34) J·s) / (2 * 10^(-10) m)`\n`Δp_x ≈ 5.27 * 10^(-25) kg·m/s`\n\n**Step 2: Relate the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) to the uncertainty in momentum (Δp_x).**\n\nThe relationship between energy (E) and momentum (p) is given by the energy-momentum relation. Since the electron's speed (`v = 2 * 10^8 m/s`) is a significant fraction of the speed of light (`c ≈ 3 * 10^8 m/s`), we must use the relativistic formula:\n`E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m_0 c^2)^2`\n\nTo find the relationship between small uncertainties (`ΔE` and `Δp`), we can use calculus. The uncertainty `ΔE` is approximately:\n`ΔE ≈ (dE/dp) * Δp`\n\nLet's find the derivative `dE/dp` by differentiating the energy-momentum equation with respect to `p`:\n`d/dp(E^2) = d/dp[(p c)^2 + (m_0 c^2)^2]`\n`2E * (dE/dp) = 2p * c^2`\n`dE/dp = (p c^2) / E`\n\nWe also know that for a relativistic particle, energy `E = γ m_0 c^2` and momentum `p = γ m_0 v`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor. Substituting these into the expression for `dE/dp`:\n`dE/dp = ((γ m_0 v) c^2) / (γ m_0 c^2) = v`\n\nSo, the relationship between the uncertainties is surprisingly simple:\n`ΔE ≈ v * Δp_x`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the uncertainty in energy (ΔE).**\n\nNow we can plug in the values for `v` and `Δp_x`:\n*   `v = 2 * 10^8 m/s`\n*   `Δp_x ≈ 5.27 * 10^(-25) kg·m/s`\n\n`ΔE ≈ (2 * 10^8 m/s) * (5.27 * 10^(-25) kg·m/s)`\n`ΔE ≈ 10.54 * 10^(-17) J`\n`ΔE ≈ 1.054 * 10^(-16) J`\n\nThis value is approximately `10^(-16) J`. Comparing this to the given options:\n\nA) ~10^(-16) J\nB) ~10^(-18) J\nC) ~10^(-19) J\nD) ~10^(-17) J\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
