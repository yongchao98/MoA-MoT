    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.\n\nThe standard notation for elemental abundance in astronomy is:\n`[A/B] = log10( (nA/nB)_star ) - log10( (nA/nB)_sun )`\nwhere `n_A` and `n_B` are the number densities of elements A and B.\n\nThis notation has a useful property:\n`[A/C] = [A/B] + [B/C]`\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the two stars. In the context of photospheric abundances, this refers to the ratio of their silicon number fractions relative to hydrogen, i.e., `(nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2`.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the silicon abundance of Star_1, [Si/H]_1.**\n\nWe are given for Star_1:\n*   `[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3`\n*   `[Fe/H]_1 = 0`\n\nUsing the property `[A/C] = [A/B] + [B/C]`, we can set A=Si, B=Fe, and C=H:\n`[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1`\n`[Si/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3`\n\nBy definition, this means:\n`log10( (nSi/nH)_1 ) - log10( (nSi/nH)_sun ) = 0.3`\nSo, `log10( (nSi/nH)_1 ) = 0.3 + log10( (nSi/nH)_sun )`\n`(nSi/nH)_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi/nH)_sun`\n\n**Step 2: Determine the silicon abundance of Star_2, [Si/H]_2.**\n\nWe are given for Star_2:\n*   `[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3`\n*   `[Mg/H]_2 = 0`\n\nWe can rearrange the property `[Mg/H] = [Mg/Si] + [Si/H]` to solve for `[Si/H]`:\n`[Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2`\n`[Si/H]_2 = 0 - 0.3 = -0.3`\n\nBy definition, this means:\n`log10( (nSi/nH)_2 ) - log10( (nSi/nH)_sun ) = -0.3`\nSo, `log10( (nSi/nH)_2 ) = -0.3 + log10( (nSi/nH)_sun )`\n`(nSi/nH)_2 = 10^-0.3 * (nSi/nH)_sun`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the ratio of silicon abundances.**\n\nWe need to find the ratio `(nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2`.\n\nRatio = `( (nSi/nH)_1 ) / ( (nSi/nH)_2 )`\nRatio = `( 10^0.3 * (nSi/nH)_sun ) / ( 10^-0.3 * (nSi/nH)_sun )`\n\nThe term for the Sun's silicon abundance, `(nSi/nH)_sun`, cancels out.\nRatio = `10^0.3 / 10^-0.3`\nRatio = `10^(0.3 - (-0.3))`\nRatio = `10^0.6`\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\nRatio â‰ˆ 3.981\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9.\n\nThe information about the masses of the stars and the specific solar abundances of Fe and Mg are not needed for this calculation and can be ignored.\n\nComparing our result to the given options:\nA) ~12.6\nB) ~1.2\nC) ~0.8\nD) ~3.9\n\nOur calculated ratio of ~3.9 matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
