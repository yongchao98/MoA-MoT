    "This problem is a classic example of time dilation, a consequence of Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity. We need to calculate the time elapsed for the astronaut (the moving observer) and compare it to the time that would pass for a stationary observer (e.g., on Earth).\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **Identify Knowns:**\n    *   Velocity of the spacecraft (v) = 0.99999987 * c\n    *   Destination: Earth\n    *   Origin: Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)\n    *   Distance (D) from Earth to the LMC: The distance to the LMC is not fixed to a single number, but a widely accepted average is approximately 160,000 light-years. We will use this value for our calculation.\n\n2.  **Calculate the time for the journey in the stationary frame (Earth's frame of reference):**\n    Time is calculated as distance divided by speed.\n    *   $t_{Earth} = D / v$\n    *   $t_{Earth} = 160,000 \\text{ light-years} / (0.99999987 * c)$\n    Since a light-year is the distance light travels in one year (c * 1 year), the 'c' in the numerator and denominator effectively cancels out, leaving the unit as years.\n    *   $t_{Earth} ≈ 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000.02 \\text{ years}$\n    From Earth's perspective, the journey takes just over 160,000 years.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    Time dilation is governed by the Lorentz factor, γ (gamma). It determines how much time is slowed down for the moving observer.\n    *   $γ = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - (v^2/c^2)}$\n    *   Given $v = 0.99999987c$, we have $v/c = 0.99999987$.\n    *   $γ = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - (0.99999987)^2}$\n    *   $γ = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - 0.99999974}$\n    *   $γ = 1 / \\sqrt{0.00000026}$\n    *   $γ = 1 / 0.0005099$\n    *   $γ ≈ 1961.16$\n\n4.  **Calculate the time experienced by the astronaut:**\n    The time experienced by the moving astronaut ($t_{astronaut}$) is the time in the stationary frame divided by the Lorentz factor.\n    *   $t_{astronaut} = t_{Earth} / γ$\n    *   $t_{astronaut} ≈ 160,000.02 \\text{ years} / 1961.16$\n    *   $t_{astronaut} ≈ 81.58 \\text{ years}$\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The journey will take approximately 81.58 years from the astronaut's point of view. This value is closest to 81 years.\n\nThe astronaut starts at age 22 and the journey takes about 81.58 years, so they will be approximately 103.58 years old upon arrival ($22 + 81.58$). Since their average lifespan is 150 years, they will survive the journey. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nComparing our calculated value of 81.58 years to the given choices, the closest answer is 81 years.\n\nA) 72 years\nB) 77 years\nC) The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth.\nD) 81 years\n\nThe answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
