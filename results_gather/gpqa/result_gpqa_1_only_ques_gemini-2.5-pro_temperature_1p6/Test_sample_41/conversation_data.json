    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Relationship between Equilibrium Temperature and Orbital Distance**\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the balance between the energy it absorbs from its star and the energy it radiates into space. The formula for equilibrium temperature is:\n\nT_eq = [ L_star * (1 - A) / (16 * π * σ * a^2) ]^(1/4)\n\nWhere:\n*   `L_star` is the star's luminosity.\n*   `A` is the planet's albedo.\n*   `σ` is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (the orbital distance, since the orbits are circular).\n\nSince the planets orbit the same star, `L_star` is constant. The problem states that the albedo `A` is the same for all three planets. All other terms except for `a` are also constants. Therefore, we can establish a proportionality:\n\nT_eq ∝ (1 / a^2)^(1/4)\nT_eq ∝ 1 / a^(1/2)  or  T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a)\n\nThis means that the square of the orbital distance `a` is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the equilibrium temperature, or more simply, the orbital distance `a` is inversely proportional to the square of the equilibrium temperature:\n\na ∝ 1 / T_eq^2\n\n**2. Understand the Relationship between Orbital Period and Orbital Distance**\n\nKepler's Third Law relates a planet's orbital period (P) to its orbital distance (a). For planets orbiting the same star, the law is:\n\nP^2 ∝ a^3\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\nP ∝ a^(3/2)\n\n**3. Combine the Relationships to Link Period and Temperature**\n\nNow we can combine the two relationships to find a direct link between the orbital period (P) and the equilibrium temperature (T_eq).\n\n*   From step 1: `a ∝ 1 / T_eq^2`\n*   From step 2: `P ∝ a^(3/2)`\n\nSubstitute the expression for `a` into the second relationship:\n\nP ∝ (1 / T_eq^2)^(3/2)\nP ∝ 1 / T_eq^(2 * 3/2)\nP ∝ 1 / T_eq^3\n\nThis means that the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the equilibrium temperature. For any two planets in the system (e.g., Planet1 and Planet3), the ratio of their periods is:\n\nP3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^3\n\n**4. Calculate the Temperature Ratio T_eq1 / T_eq3**\n\nWe are given the following ratios:\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4\n*   T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3\n\nTo find the ratio of the temperatures of Planet1 and Planet3, we multiply these two ratios:\n\nT_eq1 / T_eq3 = (T_eq1 / T_eq2) * (T_eq2 / T_eq3)\nT_eq1 / T_eq3 ≈ 1.4 * 2.3\nT_eq1 / T_eq3 ≈ 3.22\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Period Ratio P3 / P1**\n\nNow, substitute the temperature ratio we just found into the formula from step 3:\n\nP3 / P1 = (T_eq1 / T_eq3)^3\nP3 / P1 ≈ (3.22)^3\nP3 / P1 ≈ 3.22 * 3.22 * 3.22\nP3 / P1 ≈ 10.3684 * 3.22\nP3 / P1 ≈ 33.386\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4.\n\nThe information about the TTV method, the planet masses, and the specific albedo value (0.3) is extra information not needed to solve the problem, as long as the albedo is the same for all planets.\n\nThe orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<B>>>"
