    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ and the renormalizability of the theory.\n\n### Step 1: Basic Principles of Dimensional Analysis in QFT\n\nWe work in natural units where $\\hbar=c=1$. In this system:\n*   Energy, mass, and momentum have a mass dimension of +1.\n*   Length and time have a mass dimension of -1.\n*   The action, $S = \\int d^4x \\mathcal{L}$, must be a dimensionless quantity.\n\nFrom the definition of the action, we can deduce the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$.\n*   The four-volume element $d^4x$ has a mass dimension of $[d^4x] = [\\text{length}]^4 = (-1)^4 = -4$.\n*   Since the action $[S]=0$ and $[S] = [d^4x][\\mathcal{L}]$, it must be that $[\\mathcal{L}] = 4$.\n*   This implies that every term in the Lagrangian density must have a mass dimension of 4.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Mass Dimensions of the Fields\n\nWe determine the mass dimension of the fields by looking at their standard kinetic terms in the Lagrangian.\n\n*   **Fermion field $\\psi$**: The kinetic term for a fermion is $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{fermion}} = \\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^{\\mu}\\partial_{\\mu}\\psi$. For this term to have a mass dimension of 4, we must have:\n    $[\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^{\\mu}\\partial_{\\mu}\\psi] = 4$\n    The derivative $\\partial_{\\mu} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{\\mu}}$ has a mass dimension of $[\\partial_{\\mu}] = [\\text{length}]^{-1} = -(-1) = 1$. The gamma matrices $\\gamma^\\mu$ are dimensionless.\n    So, $[\\bar{\\psi}][\\psi][\\partial_{\\mu}] = 4$, which leads to $[\\bar{\\psi}][\\psi] \\cdot 1 = 4$.\n    Assuming the dimensions of $\\psi$ and its adjoint $\\bar{\\psi}$ are the same, $[\\psi] = [\\bar{\\psi}]$, we have $2[\\psi] = 3$.\n    Therefore, the mass dimension of the fermion field is $[\\psi] = [\\bar{\\psi}] = 3/2$.\n\n*   **Gauge field strength tensor $F^{\\mu\\nu}$**: The kinetic term for a gauge field (like the electromagnetic field) is $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{gauge}} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$. For this term to have a mass dimension of 4:\n    $[F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 4$, which means $[F^{\\mu\\nu}]^2 = 4$.\n    Therefore, the mass dimension of the field strength tensor is $[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 2$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Interaction Term\n\nNow we analyze the given interaction Lagrangian term:\n$\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}$\n\nThis term must also have a mass dimension of 4:\n$[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa][\\bar{\\psi}][\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}][\\psi][F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 4$\n\nLet's find the dimension of each component:\n*   $[\\kappa]$ is the unknown we want to find.\n*   $[\\bar{\\psi}] = 3/2$.\n*   $[\\psi] = 3/2$.\n*   $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma_{\\mu},\\gamma_{\\nu}]$ is constructed from the dimensionless gamma matrices, so it is also dimensionless: $[\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] = 0$.\n*   $[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 2$.\n\nSubstituting these dimensions into the equation for $[\\mathcal{L}_{int}]$:\nThe dimension of a product of terms is the sum of the individual dimensions.\n$[\\kappa] + [\\bar{\\psi}] + [\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}] + [\\psi] + [F^{\\mu\\nu}] = 4$\n$[\\kappa] + 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2 = 4$\n$[\\kappa] + 3 + 2 = 4$\n$[\\kappa] + 5 = 4$\n$[\\kappa] = -1$\n\nSo, the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\\kappa$ is -1.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Renormalizability of the Theory\n\nIn quantum field theory, the renormalizability of a theory can be determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants, a concept known as power-counting renormalizability. Let the mass dimension of a generic coupling constant be $[g]_M$.\n*   If $[g]_M > 0$, the interaction is called \"super-renormalizable\".\n*   If $[g]_M = 0$, the interaction is called \"renormalizable\" (or more precisely, strictly renormalizable).\n*   If $[g]_M < 0$, the interaction is \"non-renormalizable\".\n\nIn this problem, the coupling constant is $\\kappa$, and we found its mass dimension to be $[\\kappa]_M = -1$. Since the mass dimension is negative, the theory described by this interaction term is non-renormalizable. Non-renormalizable theories require an infinite number of counter-terms to absorb divergences at all orders of perturbation theory, which robs them of their predictive power as fundamental theories (though they are very useful as effective field theories).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mass dimension of $\\kappa$ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
