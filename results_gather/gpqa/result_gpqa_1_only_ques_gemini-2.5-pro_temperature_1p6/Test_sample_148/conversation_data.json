    "This is an excellent analytical chemistry puzzle. Let's break down the evidence to arrive at the most logical conclusion.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrometry (MS) Data:** The LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity, but both have the *same mass spectrum*, which is consistent with the target molecule. This is a critical piece of information.\n    *   It immediately rules out contamination with a precursor **(D)**, as a precursor would have a different (usually lower) molecular weight.\n    *   It also rules out side products formed by additions or incomplete deprotections, as these would also have different masses.\n    *   The fact that there are two distinct peaks indicates we have two different chemical species that can be separated by chromatography.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (Â¹H NMR) Data:** The NMR spectrum shows two distinct peaks for the *same* alpha-proton, with a combined integral of one proton.\n    *   Since these two species have different chemical shifts for the same proton, they cannot be **enantiomers (B)**. Enantiomers are mirror images and are indistinguishable in a standard (achiral) NMR experiment; they would produce only a single set of peaks.\n    *   The observation of two distinct chemical environments for the same proton confirms the presence of two different species that are stable and interconvert slowly on the NMR timescale at the temperature of the experiment.\n    *   The description \"similar chemical shifts\" is characteristic of isomers where the structural difference is subtle.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Evidence and Evaluate Remaining Options:**\n    *   We have established that the sample contains a mixture of two species that are **isomers** (same mass) but not enantiomers. By definition, stereoisomers that are not enantiomers are called **diastereoisomers**.\n    *   **Option A: The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.** This fits all the evidence. Diastereoisomers have different physical and chemical properties. Therefore, they can be separated by LC (giving two peaks) and will have different NMR spectra (giving two sets of peaks for affected protons). They have the same mass, consistent with the MS data.\n    *   **How could diastereomers form?** There are two very common ways this happens in peptide synthesis:\n        1.  **Epimerization:** One of the chiral centers of an amino acid could have inverted its configuration (e.g., from L to D) during a harsh reaction step, like amide bond activation. This creates a diastereomer. If this happened to ~50% of the material at one specific center, you would see a roughly 1:1 mixture.\n        2.  **Cis/Trans Isomerism:** Amide bonds have restricted rotation. While most peptide bonds strongly prefer a *trans* conformation, the bond preceding a proline residue (an X-Pro bond) often exists as a significant mixture of both *cis* and *trans* isomers. These isomers are a specific type of diastereomer (rotamers) that interconvert. The energy barrier to this rotation is often high enough that they can be observed as separate species in both NMR and LC, perfectly matching all the observations provided. The protons near the isomeric bond (especially the alpha-proton of the \"X\" residue) will exist in two different chemical environments, giving two peaks.\n\n    *   **Option C: 'Double coupling' has occurred...** This is a procedural term, not a type of product. If an amino acid were added twice by mistake, it would result in a product with a different mass, which is ruled out by the MS data.\n\n**Conclusion:** The evidence points unequivocally to a mixture of diastereomers. The two species have the same mass but different chromatographic and spectroscopic properties, which is the definition of how diastereomers behave.\n\n<<<A>>>"
