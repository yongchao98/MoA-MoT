    "Here is the step-by-step solution to determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex in the solution.\n\n1.  **Identify all cobalt-containing species in the solution.**\n    In a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN⁻) ligands, the following species will be in equilibrium:\n    *   Free Co²⁺ ions\n    *   `[Co(SCN)]⁺` (monothiocyanato complex)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₂]` (dithiocyanato complex)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₃]⁻` (trithiocyanato complex)\n    *   `[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻` (tetrathiocyanato complex)\n\n2.  **Write the mass balance equation for the total cobalt concentration, c(Co).**\n    The total concentration of cobalt is the sum of the concentrations of all cobalt-containing species:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]`\n\n3.  **Use the overall stability constants (βn) to express the concentration of each complex.**\n    The overall stability constants are defined as:\n    `βn = [[Co(SCN)n]²⁻ⁿ] / ([Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]ⁿ)`\n    From this, we can express the concentration of each complex in terms of the free Co²⁺ concentration `[Co²⁺]` and the free thiocyanate concentration `[SCN⁻]`:\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]²`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]³`\n    *   `[[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄ * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]⁴`\n\n4.  **Substitute these expressions into the mass balance equation.**\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]² + β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³ + β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴`\n    Factoring out `[Co²⁺]`:\n    `c(Co) = [Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n5.  **Determine the formula for the fraction (α₂) of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex.**\n    The fraction of a specific species is its concentration divided by the total concentration. We want to find the fraction of `[Co(SCN)₂]`, which we'll call `α₂`.\n    `α₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)`\n    Substituting the expressions from the previous steps:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²) / ([Co²⁺] * (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴))`\n    The `[Co²⁺]` term cancels out, simplifying the expression:\n    `α₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)`\n\n6.  **Plug in the given values and calculate α₂.**\n    Given values:\n    *   `[SCN⁻]` = 0.1 M (This is the concentration of the free thiocyanate ligand at equilibrium).\n    *   `β₁ = 9`\n    *   `β₂ = 40`\n    *   `β₃ = 63`\n    *   `β₄ = 16`\n    (Note: The total cobalt concentration `c(Co) = 10⁻² M` is not needed to calculate the percentage distribution of the species, as it only depends on the free ligand concentration.)\n\n    First, calculate each term in the denominator:\n    *   Term 0: `1`\n    *   Term 1: `β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 * (0.1) = 0.9`\n    *   Term 2: `β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4`\n    *   Term 3: `β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063`\n    *   Term 4: `β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016`\n\n    Now, sum these terms to find the value of the denominator:\n    Denominator = `1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646`\n\n    The numerator is the term for the dithiocyanato complex, which is `β₂[SCN⁻]²`:\n    Numerator = `0.4`\n\n    Calculate the fraction `α₂`:\n    `α₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916`\n\n7.  **Convert the fraction to a percentage.**\n    Percentage = `α₂ * 100%`\n    Percentage = `0.16916 * 100% ≈ 16.9%`\n\nThe percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<B>>>"
