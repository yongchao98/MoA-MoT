    "To determine which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry, we need to analyze the symmetry elements of each molecule. A molecule belongs to the C3h point group if it has:\n1.  A threefold axis of rotation (C3).\n2.  A horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n3.  And crucially, it must *not* have any C2 axes perpendicular to the C3 axis, nor any vertical mirror planes (σv). The presence of these additional elements would place it in a higher symmetry group like D3h.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**A) triisopropyl borate, B(O-CH(CH3)2)3**\nThe molecule has a central boron atom bonded to three oxygen atoms, forming a trigonal planar BO3 core. A C3 axis passes through the boron atom, perpendicular to this plane. However, the isopropyl groups (-CH(CH3)2) are not planar. The H atom and two methyl groups attached to the central carbon of each isopropyl group are arranged tetrahedrally. Due to this non-planar arrangement, there is no mirror plane (σh) that contains the BO3 core. The most stable conformation has C3 symmetry, not C3h.\n\n**D) quinuclidine, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane**\nThis is a cage-like molecule. There is a C3 axis that passes through the bridgehead nitrogen atom and the opposite bridgehead carbon atom. Rotating by 120° around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged. However, there is no horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to this C3 axis. Instead, there are three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the C3 axis. Therefore, the point group of quinuclidine is C3v.\n\n**C) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**\nThis molecule, also known as mellitic trianhydride, consists of a central benzene ring with three anhydride groups fused to alternate double bonds.\n*   **Idealized Planar Structure:** The molecule has a C3 axis perpendicular to the central ring. Since it's planar, the molecular plane acts as a σh plane. However, it also has three C2 axes lying in the plane (e.g., an axis passing through the midpoints of the C2-C3 and C5-C6 bonds). The presence of these C2 axes means the point group is D3h, not C3h.\n*   **Actual Structure:** Due to steric hindrance between the adjacent carbonyl groups, this molecule is known to adopt a slight propeller-like twist, losing its planarity and thus its σh plane. The actual point group is C3.\nIn either the idealized or actual structure, the molecule is not C3h.\n\n**B) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**\nThis molecule has a large, planar triphenylene core, which has D3h symmetry. Three anhydride groups are fused at positions 1-2, 5-6, and 9-10.\n*   The placement of these three groups is symmetric with respect to a 120° rotation around the center of the molecule, so it retains a **C3 axis**.\n*   The molecule is large and highly conjugated, and the substituting groups are far apart, so it is expected to be **planar**. The molecular plane therefore acts as a **σh plane**.\n*   Now we must check for other symmetry elements. The triphenylene core has three C2 axes in the plane. Let's consider one such axis, for example, the one passing through the midpoint of the C2-C3 bond. A 180° rotation around this axis does *not* leave the substituted molecule unchanged, because it moves the anhydride group at position C1-C2 to an unsubstituted region of the molecule (C4-C4a). Since this operation is not a symmetry operation for the substituted molecule, the **C2 axes are lost**.\n*   Similarly, the vertical mirror planes (σv) of the triphenylene core are also lost upon this substitution.\n\nSince the molecule has a C3 axis and a perpendicular σh plane, but lacks perpendicular C2 axes and vertical σv planes, its point group is exactly **C3h**.\n\nTherefore, triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone is the molecule with C3h symmetry.\n\n<<<B>>>"
