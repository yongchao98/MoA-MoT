    "Here is the step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Basics**\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the state of a system is described by a state vector, in this case, `|ψ>`. An observable quantity (like energy, momentum, or in this case, a generic observable `P`) is represented by a Hermitian operator. The possible results of a measurement of this observable are the eigenvalues of the operator.\n\nThe probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue `λ` for a system in a state `|ψ>` is given by the formula:\n`Prob(λ) = |<v_λ|ψ>|^2 / <ψ|ψ>`\nwhere:\n*   `|v_λ>` is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ`.\n*   `|ψ>` is the state vector of the system.\n*   `<v_λ|` is the bra-vector (conjugate transpose) of `|v_λ>`.\n*   `<v_λ|ψ>` is the inner product (or projection) of the state `|ψ>` onto the eigenvector `|v_λ>`.\n*   `<ψ|ψ>` is the squared norm of the state vector, which is needed for normalization. If the state vector is already normalized, `<ψ|ψ> = 1`.\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information**\n\n*   The state vector of the system: `|ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T` (T denotes the transpose, so it's a column matrix).\n*   The observable operator `P`:\n    `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0],\n         [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],\n         [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n\n**3. Find the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of P**\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the measurement result `0`. So, we are looking for the eigenvector for the eigenvalue `λ = 0`.\n\nLet the eigenvector be `|v₀> = [x, y, z]^T`. The eigenvector equation is `P|v₀> = λ|v₀>`. For `λ = 0`, this becomes `P|v₀> = 0`.\n\n`[[0, 1/√2, 0],     [x]   [0]\n [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], * [y] = [0]\n [0, 1/√2, 0]]      [z]   [0]`\n\nThis matrix equation gives us a system of linear equations:\n1.  `(1/√2) * y = 0`  =>  `y = 0`\n2.  `(1/√2) * x + (1/√2) * z = 0`  => `x + z = 0` => `z = -x`\n3.  `(1/√2) * y = 0`  => `y = 0`\n\nSo, any eigenvector corresponding to `λ = 0` must be of the form `[x, 0, -x]^T`. We can choose a simple representation for this eigenvector by setting `x=1`.\n`|v₀> = [1, 0, -1]^T`\n(Note: We don't necessarily need to normalize the eigenvector, as any scaling factor will cancel out in the final probability calculation).\n\n**4. Calculate the Probability**\n\nNow we use the probability formula: `Prob(λ=0) = |<v₀|ψ>|^2 / (<v₀|v₀> * <ψ|ψ>)`. A simpler form, which is equivalent, is `Prob(λ=0) = |<v₀|ψ>|^2 / (<ψ|ψ>)` where `v₀` is a *normalized* eigenvector. An even more direct approach is `P(λ) = |c|^2 / <ψ|ψ>` where `c = <v_unnormalized | ψ>`. Let's stick to the main formula `|<v_λ|ψ>|^2 / <ψ|ψ>` where `|v_λ>` is the normalized eigenvector.\n\nFirst, let's normalize the eigenvector `|v₀> = [1, 0, -1]^T`.\nThe squared norm is `<v₀|v₀> = 1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 = 2`.\nThe normalized eigenvector is `|v₀_norm> = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T`.\n\nNow, let's calculate the components of the probability formula:\n\n*   **Calculate the inner product `<v₀_norm|ψ>`:**\n    The bra-vector is `<v₀_norm| = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]`.\n    `<v₀_norm|ψ> = ((1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]) * [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n    `<v₀_norm|ψ> = (1/√2) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1)`\n    `<v₀_norm|ψ> = (1/√2) * (-1 - 1) = -2/√2 = -√2`\n\n*   **Calculate the squared magnitude of the inner product:**\n    `|<v₀_norm|ψ>|^2 = (-√2)^2 = 2`\n\n*   **Calculate the squared norm of the state vector `<ψ|ψ>`:**\n    `<ψ|ψ> = [-1, 2, 1] * [-1, 2, 1]^T`\n    `<ψ|ψ> = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`\n\n*   **Finally, calculate the probability:**\n    `Prob(0) = |<v₀_norm|ψ>|^2 / <ψ|ψ>`\n    `Prob(0) = 2 / 6`\n    `Prob(0) = 1/3`\n\nThe probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t is 1/3.\n\n<<<A>>>"
