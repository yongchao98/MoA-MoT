    "Here is a step-by-step solution to find the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe uncertainty of an operator $A$ in a given state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is defined by the formula:\n$\\Delta A = \\sqrt{\\langle A^2 \\rangle - \\langle A \\rangle^2}$\nwhere $\\langle A \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | A | \\psi \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A$, and $\\langle A^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | A^2 | \\psi \\rangle$ is the expectation value of $A^2$.\n\nWe need to calculate the uncertainty of the operator $P_z$, so the formula is:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information**\n\n*   The operator $P_z$ is given by the matrix:\n    $P_z = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   The state of the system is given by the column vector (ket) $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   The problem states that the basis used is the eigenbasis of $P_z$. This is consistent with the fact that the matrix for $P_z$ is diagonal. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\\hbar$, $0$, and $-\\hbar$, and the corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, and $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**3. Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z \\rangle$**\n\nThe expectation value is calculated as $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle$.\n\n*   First, we need the bra vector $\\langle \\psi |$, which is the conjugate transpose of $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $\\langle \\psi | = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   Next, we calculate the action of the operator $P_z$ on the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $P_z |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) \\\\ (-1)(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   Finally, we compute the inner product $\\langle \\psi | (P_z |\\psi\\rangle)$:\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left[ (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(1/2) \\right]$\n    $\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\hbar \\left[ 1/4 + 0 - 1/4 \\right] = 0$\n\nSo, the expectation value of $P_z$ is $\\langle P_z \\rangle = 0$.\n\n**4. Calculate the Expectation Value $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$**\n\nThe expectation value is calculated as $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle$.\n\n*   First, we find the matrix for the operator $P_z^2$:\n    $P_z^2 = P_z \\cdot P_z = \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\left( \\hbar \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $P_z^2 = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & (-1)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   Next, we calculate the action of the operator $P_z^2$ on the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n    $P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(-1/2) \\\\ (0)(1/\\sqrt{2}) \\\\ (1)(-1/2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   Finally, we compute the inner product $\\langle \\psi | (P_z^2 |\\psi\\rangle)$:\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right)$\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left[ (-1/2)(-1/2) + (1/\\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(-1/2) \\right]$\n    $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2 \\left[ 1/4 + 0 + 1/4 \\right] = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$\n\nSo, the expectation value of $P_z^2$ is $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}$.\n\n**5. Calculate the Uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$**\n\nNow we can plug the calculated expectation values into the uncertainty formula:\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} - (0)^2}$\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nThe uncertainty of $P_z$ is $\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
