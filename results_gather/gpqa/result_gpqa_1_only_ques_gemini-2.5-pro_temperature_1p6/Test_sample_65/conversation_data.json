    "The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed as an extension of the Standard Model that preserves its fundamental structure, including its gauge symmetries and spacetime symmetries. It adds higher-dimensional operators built from Standard Model fields. Let's analyze each of the proposed symmetries:\n\n1.  **Lorentz Symmetry:** This is a fundamental spacetime symmetry that requires the laws of physics to be the same for all observers in uniform motion. The Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, and the SMEFT is constructed to maintain this principle. All operators in the SMEFT are built to be Lorentz scalars. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.\n\n2.  **Poincare Symmetry:** This is a broader spacetime symmetry that includes Lorentz symmetry (rotations and boosts) plus spacetime translations. Like Lorentz symmetry, it is a foundational principle of modern particle physics and quantum field theory. The SMEFT respects Poincare symmetry.\n\n3.  **CP Symmetry:** This is the combined symmetry of charge conjugation (C) and parity inversion (P). It is well-established that the Standard Model itself violates CP symmetry, most famously in the weak interactions involving quarks (as described by the CKM matrix). Since the goal of the SMEFT is to parameterize all possible new physics effects, including new sources of CP violation, there is no requirement for its operators to respect CP symmetry. In fact, many SMEFT operators are explicitly CP-violating.\n\n4.  **CPT Symmetry:** This is the combined symmetry of charge conjugation (C), parity inversion (P), and time reversal (T). The CPT theorem is a fundamental result in quantum field theory, stating that any local, Lorentz-invariant theory with a Hermitian Hamiltonian must have CPT symmetry. The SMEFT is constructed as just such a theory. Therefore, all operators in the SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Lorentz symmetry (1) must be respected.\n- Poincare symmetry (2) must be respected.\n- CP symmetry (3) is **not** required to be respected.\n- CPT symmetry (4) must be respected.\n\nThe correct options are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
