    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n**1. Determine the rest-mass energies**\n\nLet M be the mass of the initial nucleus, and m1 and m2 be the rest-masses of the two fragments. We are given:\n*   Initial rest-mass energy: M * c^2 = 300 GeV.\n*   The more massive fragment (m1) is twice as massive as the other (m2): m1 = 2 * m2.\n*   The sum of the fragment masses is 99% of the initial mass: m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.\n\nWe can solve for m1 and m2 in terms of M:\nSubstitute m1 = 2*m2 into the second equation:\n(2 * m2) + m2 = 0.99 * M\n3 * m2 = 0.99 * M\nm2 = 0.33 * M\n\nThen, m1 = 2 * m2 = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M.\n\nNow, we can find the rest-mass energies of the fragments:\n*   Rest-mass energy of the more massive fragment (m1):\n    m1 * c^2 = 0.66 * (M * c^2) = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n*   Rest-mass energy of the less massive fragment (m2):\n    m2 * c^2 = 0.33 * (M * c^2) = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n**2. Apply Conservation of Energy**\n\nThe initial nucleus is at rest, so its total energy is its rest-mass energy, E_initial = M*c^2 = 300 GeV.\nThe final total energy is the sum of the rest-mass energies and kinetic energies of the two fragments: E_final = (m1*c^2 + T1) + (m2*c^2 + T2).\n\nAccording to the conservation of energy, E_initial = E_final:\n300 GeV = (198 GeV + T1) + (99 GeV + T2)\n300 GeV = 297 GeV + T1 + T2\n\nThe total kinetic energy (Q-value) released in the fission is:\nQ = T1 + T2 = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Momentum**\n\nThe initial nucleus is at rest, so the initial momentum is P_initial = 0.\nBy conservation of momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero. The two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum.\nLet p1 and p2 be the momenta of the fragments. Then p1 = -p2, and their magnitudes are equal: |p1| = |p2| = p.\n\n**4. Calculate T1 using the Classical Approximation**\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy (T) and momentum (p) are related by T = p^2 / (2m).\nFrom the conservation of momentum, p1^2 = p2^2.\n2 * m1 * T1_classical = 2 * m2 * T2_classical\nm1 * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical\n\nSince m1 = 2 * m2:\n(2 * m2) * T1_classical = m2 * T2_classical\nT2_classical = 2 * T1_classical\n\nNow we use the total kinetic energy equation:\nT1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV\nT1_classical + (2 * T1_classical) = 3 GeV\n3 * T1_classical = 3 GeV\n**T1_classical = 1 GeV**\n\n**5. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) T1**\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the total energy E of a particle is related to its momentum p and rest-mass m by E^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2.\nAlso, the total energy is the sum of rest-mass energy and kinetic energy: E = m*c^2 + T.\nCombining these gives:\n(m*c^2 + T)^2 = (p*c)^2 + (m*c^2)^2\nm^2*c^4 + 2*T*m*c^2 + T^2 = p^2*c^2 + m^2*c^4\np^2*c^2 = T^2 + 2*T*m*c^2 = T * (T + 2*m*c^2)\n\nFrom momentum conservation, p1^2 = p2^2, so p1^2*c^2 = p2^2*c^2.\nT1 * (T1 + 2*m1*c^2) = T2 * (T2 + 2*m2*c^2)\n\nWe substitute the known values for the rest-mass energies (m1*c^2 = 198 GeV, m2*c^2 = 99 GeV) and use the relation T2 = 3 GeV - T1:\nT1 * (T1 + 2 * 198) = (3 - T1) * ((3 - T1) + 2 * 99)\nT1 * (T1 + 396) = (3 - T1) * (3 - T1 + 198)\nT1 * (T1 + 396) = (3 - T1) * (201 - T1)\nT1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 3*T1 - 201*T1 + T1^2\nT1^2 + 396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1 + T1^2\n\nCanceling the T1^2 term from both sides:\n396*T1 = 603 - 204*T1\n396*T1 + 204*T1 = 603\n600 * T1 = 603\n**T1_correct = 603 / 600 = 1.005 GeV**\n\n**6. Find the Difference**\n\nThe question asks for the difference between the correct T1 value and the classical T1 value.\nDifference = T1_correct - T1_classical\nDifference = 1.005 GeV - 1.000 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nFinally, we convert the result to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\nDifference = 0.005 GeV * (1000 MeV / 1 GeV) = 5 MeV.\n\nThe correct option is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
