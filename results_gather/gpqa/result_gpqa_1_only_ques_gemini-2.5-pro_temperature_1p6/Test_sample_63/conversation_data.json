    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Gas Treatment Process**\n\nThe mixture of gases produced by heating the salts is passed through three tubes. Let's determine what each tube absorbs and calculate the moles of each gaseous product.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This is a strong drying agent (desiccant) that absorbs water (H₂O).\n    *   The mass increase is 3.60 g, which is the mass of water produced.\n    *   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = mass / Molar Mass = 3.60 g / 18.0 g/mol = 0.20 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which absorbs acidic gases like CO₂ or SO₂.\n    *   The mass of the tube did not change (increase is 0 g).\n    *   This indicates that no acidic gases were produced during the decomposition. This rules out salts like carbonates, oxalates, sulfites, etc. The original salts must only contain elements that do not form acidic gases under these conditions. The products tell us the elements are N, H, and O.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxidizing agents, typically oxygen (O₂) or nitrous oxide (N₂O). The problem states CuO is formed, which means the gas supplied oxygen atoms to the copper.\n    *   The mass increase is 0.80 g. This is the mass of the oxygen atoms that reacted with the copper.\n    *   Molar mass of O = 16.0 g/mol.\n    *   Moles of O atoms = mass / Molar Mass = 0.80 g / 16.0 g/mol = 0.05 mol.\n    *   This oxygen could have come from O₂ gas (O₂) or nitrous oxide (N₂O).\n        *   If from O₂: The reaction is 2Cu + O₂ → 2CuO. Moles of O₂ = moles(O)/2 = 0.05/2 = 0.025 mol.\n        *   If from N₂O: The reaction is Cu + N₂O → CuO + N₂. Moles of N₂O = moles(O) = 0.05 mol.\n\n*   **Gas C (Remaining Gas):** This is the gas that passed through all three tubes without reacting.\n    *   Volume at STP = 2.24 L.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = Volume / Molar Volume = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.10 mol.\n    *   Since this gas is unreactive with the reagents used, it is very likely nitrogen (N₂), a common product of the decomposition of nitrogen-containing salts.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Salts and their Decomposition Reactions**\n\nThe products of decomposition are H₂O, N₂, and either O₂ or N₂O. The original salts contained only N, H, and O. This suggests the salts are ammonium salts of nitrogen oxyacids, such as ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's test this hypothesis. We have an equimolar mixture, so let there be `n` moles of salt A and `n` moles of salt B. Let A = NH₄NO₂ and B = NH₄NO₃.\n\nConsider the common thermal decomposition reactions:\n1.  **Ammonium nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n2.  **Ammonium nitrate:** The decomposition depends on temperature. At around 200°C, the main reaction is NH₄NO₃(s) → N₂O(g) + 2H₂O(g).\n\nLet's see if this matches our experimental results.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₂, we get: `n` moles of N₂ and 2`n` moles of H₂O.\n*   From `n` moles of NH₄NO₃, we get: `n` moles of N₂O and 2`n` moles of H₂O.\n\nThe total initial gas mixture would be:\n*   Total H₂O = 2`n` + 2`n` = 4`n`\n*   Total N₂ = `n`\n*   Total N₂O = `n`\n\nNow let's trace these gases through the tubes:\n*   **Tube 1:** Absorbs H₂O. Moles H₂O = 4`n`. We found this to be 0.20 mol. So, 4`n` = 0.20 mol ⇒ `n` = 0.05 mol.\n*   **Tube 3:** The N₂O reacts with Cu: N₂O + Cu → N₂ + CuO. The mass gain is from `n` moles of oxygen atoms. Moles O = `n`. We found this to be 0.05 mol. So, `n` = 0.05 mol.\n*   **Gas C:** The final gas consists of the initial N₂ from the nitrite decomposition plus the N₂ formed from the N₂O decomposition in tube 3.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = (N₂ from nitrite) + (N₂ from N₂O) = `n` + `n` = 2`n`.\n    *   We found Moles of Gas C to be 0.10 mol. So, 2`n` = 0.10 mol ⇒ `n` = 0.05 mol.\n\nAll three calculations yield the same value, `n` = 0.05 mol. This confirms our hypothesis is correct. The mixture consists of 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₂ and 0.05 mol of NH₄NO₃.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the Total Mass**\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₂ = 14.0 + 4(1.0) + 14.0 + 2(16.0) = 64.0 g/mol.\n*   Molar Mass of NH₄NO₃ = 14.0 + 4(1.0) + 14.0 + 3(16.0) = 80.0 g/mol.\n*   Total Mass = (0.05 mol × 64.0 g/mol) + (0.05 mol × 80.0 g/mol)\n*   Total Mass = 3.20 g + 4.00 g = 7.20 g.\nThis matches the initial mass given in the problem.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Atoms**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of atoms in the formulas of salts A and B.\n*   **Salt A:** NH₄NO₂. It contains 2 N atoms, 4 H atoms, and 2 O atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 atoms.\n*   **Salt B:** NH₄NO₃. It contains 2 N atoms, 4 H atoms, and 3 O atoms. Total = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 atoms.\n\n**Total atoms = (Atoms in A) + (Atoms in B) = 8 + 9 = 17.**\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
