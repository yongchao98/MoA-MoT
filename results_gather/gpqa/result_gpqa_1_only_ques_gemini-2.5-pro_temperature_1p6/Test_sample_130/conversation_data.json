    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Dienophile:** The problem describes a dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene that is dehydrated to an anhydride. The anhydride's NMR data is provided:\n    *   ¹H NMR: a single peak at 7 ppm. This indicates two chemically equivalent protons, likely on a double bond (vinylic protons). The symmetry suggests they are cis to each other.\n    *   ¹³C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. The peak at ~165 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon in an anhydride. The peak at ~137 ppm is characteristic of an alkene carbon.\n    *   This data perfectly matches **maleic anhydride**. Maleic acid is *cis*-butenedioic acid. Its dehydration product, maleic anhydride, is a cyclic molecule with C₂v symmetry. The two vinylic protons are equivalent, giving one singlet. The two carbonyl carbons are equivalent, and the two alkene carbons are equivalent, giving two signals in the ¹³C NMR. The chemical shifts are also a perfect match.\n\n    Structure of Maleic Anhydride (the dienophile):\n    ```\n       O=C   C=O\n          \\ /\n           O\n          / \\\n       H-C---C-H\n    ```\n\n*   **Diene:** The diene is **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**. This is a five-membered ring containing a conjugated diene system, with methyl groups substituting all four carbons of the diene moiety.\n\n    Structure of 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (the diene):\n    ```\n           C5H2\n          /    \\\n      (Me)C4==C3(Me)\n         |      |\n      (Me)C1--C2(Me) <-- This has C2-C3 single bond.\n    ```\n    (Note: There are various ways to draw this, but the connectivity C1(Me)=C2(Me)-C3(Me)=C4(Me)-C5H₂-C1 defines the conjugated diene.)\n\n**Step 2: The Reaction and Its Stereochemistry**\n\n*   The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n*   This reaction typically produces two stereoisomers: the **endo** and **exo** adducts.\n*   According to the **endo rule**, the product formed faster (the kinetic product) is the *endo* adduct, which is therefore the **major product**. The more stable *exo* adduct is the thermodynamic product and is typically the **minor product**.\n*   The product has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene core structure. The stated molecular formula of the products, C₁₃H₁₆O₃, is consistent with the addition of C₉H₁₄ (diene) and C₄H₂O₃ (anhydride).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Structure of the Major (Endo) and Minor (Exo) Products**\n\nLet's visualize the two products to understand the spatial relationships between the protons. The key difference is the orientation of the anhydride ring relative to the rest of the molecule.\n\n*   **Endo Adduct (Major Product):** The anhydride ring is tucked \"under\" the newly formed cyclohexene ring, on the same side as the vinyl methyl groups. The anhydride protons point towards the double bond.\n*   **Exo Adduct (Minor Product):** The anhydride ring is on the opposite side, pointing away from the vinyl methyl groups. The anhydride protons are on the same side as the -CH₂- bridge.\n\n**Step 4: Use NOESY NMR to Distinguish the Isomers**\n\n*   **NOESY** (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) detects protons that are close in space (typically < 5 Å). A cross-peak connects the signals of two spatially close protons.\n*   We are looking for a cross-peak that is **present in the major product (endo)** but **absent or weak in the minor product (exo)**. This means we must identify a pair of protons that are close in the endo adduct but far apart in the exo adduct.\n\nLet's examine the proton groups and their proximity in each isomer:\n\n*   **Proton Groups:** Based on the product structure and typical chemical shifts, we can assign the signals mentioned in the options:\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm:** These are the two equivalent methyl groups on the double bond (the vinylic methyls). Vinylic methyls are typically downfield compared to aliphatic methyls.\n    *   **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm:** These are the two equivalent protons from the maleic anhydride part, now on the bicyclic framework. Protons alpha to a carbonyl group have a chemical shift in this range.\n    *   **6H singlet at ~1 ppm:** These are the two equivalent methyl groups on the bridgehead carbons (saturated carbons).\n    *   **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm:** This signal is likely from one of the two -CH₂- bridge protons, which may be non-equivalent and coupled to each other. However, this signal is not relevant for the correct option.\n\n*   **Spatial Proximity Analysis:**\n    1.  **In the Endo (Major) Product:** The anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) are oriented towards the double bond, making them spatially **close** to the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm). A strong NOESY cross-peak is expected between them.\n    2.  **In the Exo (Minor) Product:** The anhydride protons (~3.5 ppm) are oriented away from the double bond, making them spatially **far** from the vinylic methyl groups (~1.7 ppm). The NOESY cross-peak between them would be absent or very weak.\n\n    This observation perfectly matches the problem description: a cross-peak present in the major product but absent in the minor. Therefore, the cross-peak connects the vinylic methyl protons and the anhydride protons.\n\n**Step 5: Match the Analysis to the Options**\n\n*   The resonances connected by the specific cross-peak are:\n    *   The **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm** (vinylic methyls)\n    *   The **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm** (anhydride protons)\n\n*   This corresponds to option **C**.\n\nLet's quickly check the other options:\n*   A) (Bridgehead Me & Vinylic Me): Their spatial relationship is similar in both isomers. An NOE here would not distinguish between them.\n*   B) (Bridgehead Me & Bridge -CH₂-): These protons are relatively far apart in both isomers.\n*   D) (Bridge -CH₂- & Anhydride H): These are close in the *exo* (minor) product and far in the *endo* (major) product. An NOE here would be strong for the minor product, which is the opposite of the given information.\n\nThus, the only logical answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
