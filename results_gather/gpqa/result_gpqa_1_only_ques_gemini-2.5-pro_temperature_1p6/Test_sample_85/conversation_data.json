    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown to determine the correct starting materials, A and B.\n\n**1. Analyze the Product Structure**\n\nThe product in both reactions is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, differing only in its stereochemistry at the C4 position. Let's break down this name:\n*   **Pyran:** A six-membered ring containing one oxygen atom.\n*   **Tetrahydro:** The ring is fully saturated (no double bonds).\n*   **-2-one:** There is a carbonyl group (C=O) at the C2 position, making this a lactone (a cyclic ester). By IUPAC convention for heterocycles, the oxygen atom is position 1.\n*   **4-ethyl:** An ethyl group (-CH2CH3) is attached to the C4 position.\n\nThe structure is a delta-lactone. The chiral center is C4, the carbon atom bonded to the ethyl group.\n*   Reaction 1 product: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   Reaction 2 product: (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n\nThis lactone can be formed by the intramolecular cyclization (esterification) of a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\nHOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-CH₂(5)-OH\n\nDuring cyclization, the hydroxyl group (-OH) on C5 attacks the carbonyl carbon of the carboxylic acid (C1). The chiral center at C3 of this acid becomes the C4 of the lactone ring, and its stereochemistry is preserved.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material Structure**\n\nAll the options suggest the starting material is a derivative of 3-ethylglutaric acid, named \"3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\". This compound is a half-ester, containing both a carboxylic acid group and an ester group.\n\nLet's draw the structure based on the name. It is a pentanoic acid derivative where C1 is a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and C5 is an isobutyl ester (-COO-isobutyl).\nStructure: HOOC(1)-CH₂(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(4)-C(5)(O)-O-isobutyl\n*   This molecule has two reducible groups: a carboxylic acid at C1 and an ester at C5.\n*   It has one chiral center at C3, the carbon bearing the ethyl group. The reactions do not occur at this chiral center, so its configuration will be retained in the product.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺\n*   **Product:** (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces esters much faster than it reduces carboxylic acids.\n\n**Mechanism:**\n1.  LiBH₄ reduces the ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The carboxylic acid at C1 remains unchanged.\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-isobutyl   ---(LiBH₄)--->   HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-CH₂OH\n    This forms 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n2.  The acid workup (H⁺) protonates the carbonyl and catalyzes the intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the six-membered lactone product.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** The reaction does not involve the chiral center at C3. Therefore, the stereochemistry is conserved. The C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the lactone. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n    *   **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction 2**\n\n*   **Reactants:** B + BH₃ + H⁺\n*   **Product:** (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is a reducing agent that selectively reduces carboxylic acids much faster than it reduces esters.\n\n**Mechanism:**\n1.  BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (-CH₂OH). The ester group at C5 remains unchanged.\n    HOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-isobutyl   ---(BH₃)--->   HO-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-C(=O)O-isobutyl\n    This forms isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n2.  Under acidic (H⁺) or thermal conditions, the molecule undergoes intramolecular transesterification. The newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, displacing isobutanol to form the same six-membered lactone product.\n3.  **Stereochemistry:** This reaction pathway also does not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemistry is conserved. The C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the lactone. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
