    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the options to determine which planet has the highest density:\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** This is essentially a description of Earth itself. The average density of Earth is approximately 5.5 g/cm³. This is our baseline for comparison.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm^3:** The density is explicitly stated as 5.5 g/cm³, the same as Earth's.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** The key here is \"same composition.\" As you add mass to a rocky planet, the force of its own gravity increases. This increased gravity compresses the material more tightly. Therefore, a more massive planet with the same composition as a smaller one will have a higher average density. A 5-Earth-mass rocky planet would be significantly more compressed by gravity than Earth, resulting in a density greater than 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** This is the opposite of case (c). With less mass, there is less gravitational force to compress the material. Therefore, this planet would be less dense than Earth, with a density below 5.5 g/cm³.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Planet (a) and (b) have a density of ~5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (d) has a density < 5.5 g/cm³.\n*   Planet (c) has a density > 5.5 g/cm³ due to greater gravitational compression.\n\nTherefore, the planet with the highest density is the one described in option (c).\n\n<<<D>>>"
