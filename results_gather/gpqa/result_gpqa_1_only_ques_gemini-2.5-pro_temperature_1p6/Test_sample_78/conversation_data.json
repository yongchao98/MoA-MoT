    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Product from the Provided NMR Data**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the structure of the product formed in the reaction. Let's analyze its ¹H and ¹³C NMR spectra.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** The starting material X is C11H12O. The reaction is likely an isomerization or rearrangement, so the product should have the same formula, C11H12O. Let's verify this.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** The sum of integrations is 3 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 12 hydrogens.\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** The sum of carbons is 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 11 carbons.\n    *   The formula C11H12O is consistent with the NMR data.\n\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** For C11H12O, DoU = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 6.\n\n*   **Structure Elucidation from NMR Signals:**\n    *   **Aromatic Ring:** The ¹H NMR shows two doublets, each integrating to 2H (δ 7.08 and δ 7.71). This is a classic pattern for a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. This accounts for a C6H4 moiety and 4 degrees of unsaturation. The significant downfield shift of the doublet at δ 7.71 suggests these protons are ortho to a strong electron-withdrawing group.\n    *   **Carbonyl Group:** The ¹³C NMR has a signal at δ 197.7, which is characteristic of a **ketone (C=O)**, likely conjugated. A ketone group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which explains the δ 7.71 signal from the ortho protons. This accounts for 1 degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **Methyl Groups:** The ¹H NMR shows two singlets at δ 2.28 and δ 2.31, each integrating to 3H. This indicates two **methyl (CH3) groups** that are not coupled to any adjacent protons (i.e., they are attached to quaternary carbons or atoms with no protons like C=O or a substituted aromatic carbon). The ¹³C NMR supports this with signals at δ 21.3 and δ 28.4.\n    *   **Double Bond:** The ¹H NMR has two doublets at δ 6.75 (1H) and δ 7.68 (1H). Since the aromatic protons are accounted for, these must be from a carbon-carbon double bond (**-CH=CH-**). They are doublets, which means they are coupled only to each other. This implies the carbons they are attached to have no other protons. This accounts for the final degree of unsaturation (Total DoU = 4(ring) + 1(C=O) + 1(C=C) = 6).\n\n*   **Assembling the Product Structure:**\n    1.  We have a p-disubstituted benzene ring. One substituent is a methyl group (e.g., from δ 2.28) and the other is the ketone group. This forms a **p-tolyl ketone** fragment: `CH3-C6H4-C(=O)-`. This fragment is consistent with the aromatic proton shifts (protons ortho to C=O are downfield, protons ortho to CH3 are upfield).\n    2.  The remaining atoms must form the rest of the molecule attached to the carbonyl. We have used `C8H7O`. The original formula is `C11H12O`. The remainder is `C3H5`.\n    3.  From the remaining NMR signals, we have another methyl group (δ 2.31, 3H, s) and a `-CH=CH-` group (δ 6.75 and 7.68).\n    4.  Let's combine these pieces. We have a `-CH=CH-` unit and a `-CH3` unit. The only way to form a stable molecule is to arrange them as an enone. There are two possibilities:\n        a) `CH3-C6H4-C(=O)-CH=CH-CH3`: 1-(p-tolyl)but-2-en-1-one. This structure's aromatic region fits the shifts well. However, the methyl group on the end (allylic CH3) should be a doublet, and the vinyl protons should show more complex splitting (doublet of quartets). The data shows two methyl singlets and two simple vinyl doublets. This structure is inconsistent with the splitting patterns.\n        b) `CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3`: 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one. Let's analyze its expected NMR:\n            *   Two methyl groups: One on the aromatic ring (`Ar-CH3`) and one attached to the carbonyl (`-CO-CH3`). Both are expected to be singlets. This matches the data (`s` at 2.28 and 2.31 ppm).\n            *   Vinyl protons (`-CH=CH-`): Since they are only coupled to each other, they should appear as two doublets. This matches the data (`d` at 6.75 and 7.68 ppm).\n            *   Aromatic protons: This structure has a p-tolyl group attached to a double bond (`Ar-C=C`). Protons on such a ring typically resonate around 7.2-7.5 ppm. The observed data shows shifts at 7.08 and 7.71 ppm. The shift at 7.71 ppm is anomalous for this structure, as it suggests the ring is attached directly to the carbonyl.\n\n*   **Conclusion on Product Structure:** There appears to be an inconsistency in the provided NMR data. However, the structure **4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one** is a much better fit overall, as it correctly predicts the multiplicity (singlet, singlet, doublet, doublet, doublet, doublet) of all signals, whereas the alternative structure fails on three different signals' multiplicities. We will proceed assuming the aromatic chemical shift data is either erroneous or anomalous, and the product is 4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Starting Material (Compound X)**\n\nNow we must determine which of the given options for Compound X would rearrange to form `4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one` upon treatment with DABCO (a base) at high temperature.\n\n*   The product contains a **p-tolyl group (CH3-C6H4-)**. Therefore, the starting material must also contain this group. Let's examine the options:\n    *   A) `2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane`: Contains a 4-methyl (para) group on the benzene ring. This is a p-tolyl group.\n    *   B) `2-methyl-3-styryloxirane`: Contains a phenyl group (C6H5-), not a p-tolyl group.\n    *   C) `2-styrylepoxide`: Has the wrong molecular formula (C10H10O).\n    *   D) `2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane`: Contains a phenyl group, not a p-tolyl group.\n\n*   Based on the requirement of a p-tolyl group, only option **A** is a possible starting material.\n\n*   **Reaction Plausibility:** The reaction is the base-catalyzed rearrangement of the vinylic epoxide in option A.\n    *   Compound X (A): `CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-CH(O)CH2` (2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane)\n    *   Product: `CH3-C6H4-CH=CH-C(=O)-CH3` (4-(p-tolyl)but-3-en-2-one)\n    The rearrangement of vinylic epoxides to α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds is a known, albeit sometimes complex, transformation. In this context, the transformation from A to the identified product is the most chemically sound pathway among the choices.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBy determining the most likely product structure from the NMR data and then identifying which starting material could form this product, we can identify Compound X. Compound X must be 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.\n\n<<<A>>>"
