    "To solve this problem, we will use the principle of conservation of energy. The total energy of the relativistic harmonic oscillator is the sum of its relativistic kinetic energy and its potential energy. This total energy must remain constant throughout the motion.\n\n1.  **Potential Energy:** The force is given by Hooke's Law, $F = -kx$. The potential energy $U(x)$ is found by integrating the force: $U(x) = -\\int F dx = \\int kx dx = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 + C$. We can set the potential energy to be zero at the equilibrium position ($x=0$), so the constant of integration $C=0$. Thus, the potential energy is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\n2.  **Relativistic Kinetic Energy:** The total relativistic energy of a particle with rest mass $m$ and speed $v$ is $E_{rel} = \\gamma mc^2$, where the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$. The kinetic energy $T$ is the total relativistic energy minus the rest energy $mc^2$:\n    $T = E_{rel} - mc^2 = \\gamma mc^2 - mc^2 = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$.\n\n3.  **Conservation of Total Energy:** The total energy of the system, $E_{total} = T + U(x)$, is conserved.\n    $E_{total} = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \\text{constant}$.\n\nWe can evaluate the total energy at two key points in the oscillator's motion:\na)  At the point of maximum displacement (the amplitude), $x = A$. At this point, the mass is momentarily at rest, so its speed is $v = 0$.\n    *   Since $v=0$, the Lorentz factor is $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-0}} = 1$.\n    *   The kinetic energy is $T = (1-1)mc^2 = 0$.\n    *   The potential energy is at its maximum: $U_{max} = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n    *   The total energy of the system is $E_{total} = 0 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\nb)  At the equilibrium position, $x = 0$. At this point, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy (and thus the speed) is at its maximum. Let's call the maximum speed $v_{max}$.\n    *   The Lorentz factor at this speed is $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    *   The kinetic energy is at its maximum: $T_{max} = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n    *   The potential energy is $U = \\frac{1}{2}k(0)^2 = 0$.\n    *   The total energy of the system is $E_{total} = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2 + 0 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$.\n\nBy the principle of conservation of energy, the total energy at both points must be the same:\n$E_{total}(\\text{at } x=A) = E_{total}(\\text{at } x=0)$\n$\\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\\gamma_{max} - 1)mc^2$\n\nNow, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$:\n1.  Isolate $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\gamma_{max} - 1 = \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n    $\\gamma_{max} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n2.  Substitute the definition of $\\gamma_{max}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}$\n\n3.  Square both sides of the equation:\n    $\\frac{1}{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2} = \\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2$\n\n4.  Take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n5.  Rearrange to solve for $v_{max}^2$:\n    $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}$\n\n6.  Finally, solve for $v_{max}$:\n    $v_{max} = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\\right)^2}}$\n\nComparing this result with the given options, we find that it matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
