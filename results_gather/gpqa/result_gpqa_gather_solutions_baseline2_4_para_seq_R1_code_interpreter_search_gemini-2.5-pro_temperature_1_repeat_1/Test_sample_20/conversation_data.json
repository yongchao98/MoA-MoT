Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nAmong the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).\n\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the candidate solutions and fundamental chemical principles.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Part A - Tautomerism**\n\n*   **Question**: Identify which compound, between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, **does not** show tautomerism. This compound is designated as (A).\n*   **Key Principle**: The most common form of tautomerism for these compounds is keto-enol tautomerism. A crucial requirement for this is the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen,\" which is a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: Its structure contains three C=O groups and three -CH₂- groups. The carbons in the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and adjacent to the C=O groups. The hydrogens on these carbons are alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: Its structure contains C=O groups and C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds, making them sp²-hybridized. It lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion for Part A**: Compound (A) is **benzoquinone**. All candidate answers are in unanimous agreement on this point based on their reasoning.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Part B - Optical Isomerism**\n\n*   **Question**: Identify which compound, between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, **will** show optical isomerism. This compound is designated as (B).\n*   **Key Principle**: A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four distinct groups: (-H), (-OH), (-CH₃), and (-COOCH₃). Since it has a chiral center and lacks an internal plane of symmetry, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is the *trans* isomer of CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This molecule has no chiral centers. It is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion for Part B**: Compound (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. All candidate answers are also in unanimous agreement on this point.\n\n**Step 3: Combine Results and Final Decision**\n\nBased on the universally correct reasoning provided by all candidate agents:\n*   Compound **(A)**, which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound **(B)**, which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nNow, we must match this combination with the options provided in the question:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe combination `A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate` corresponds exactly to option D.\n\n**Careful Point**: The reasoning across all candidate answers is sound and consistent. The variation in their final selected letters (A, B, C, D) is due to them being presented with differently ordered multiple-choice lists. The correct final answer must be determined by matching the correct chemical conclusions to the specific list of options given in this problem's prompt.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on a consensus of chemical principles from the candidate answers.\n\n### **Part 1: Tautomerism Analysis**\n\n**Task**: Identify which compound, between `benzoquinone` and `cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione`, does **not** show tautomerism. This compound will be designated (A).\n\n1.  **Careful Point 1: The condition for keto-enol tautomerism.** This type of isomerism requires the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen\" (α-H). An α-H is a hydrogen atom located on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom that is adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group. The sp³ hybridization is essential for the typical mechanism.\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: Its structure is a six-membered ring where three C=O groups alternate with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The hydrogens on the -CH₂- groups are indeed alpha-hydrogens, as they are on sp³-hybridized carbons next to carbonyls. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**. Its enol form (phloroglucinol) is highly stable due to aromaticity.\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: Its structure is a six-membered ring containing two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the C=O groups are part of the double bonds and are sp²-hybridized. Since it lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-carbon, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A**: All candidate answers correctly and unanimously conclude that the compound (A) which does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part 2: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\n**Task**: Identify which compound, between `methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate` and `dimethyl fumarate`, **will** show optical isomerism. This compound will be designated (B).\n\n1.  **Careful Point 2: The condition for optical isomerism.** A compound must be chiral to show optical isomerism. Chirality means the molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that gives rise to chirality is a \"chiral center\"—a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    *   -H (a hydrogen atom)\n    *   -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n    *   -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n    *   -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, which has a *trans* geometry. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part B**: All candidate answers also correctly and unanimously conclude that the compound (B) which will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Synthesis and Answer Selection**\n\n*   Compound (A), which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B), which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThe final task is to match this conclusion with the provided options.\n\n*   A) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   B) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n*   C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe combination derived from the correct and unanimous chemical reasoning (\"A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\") perfectly matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the candidate solutions and fundamental chemical principles.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Part A - Tautomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify which compound, between **benzoquinone** and **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**, does **not** show tautomerism. This compound is designated as (A).\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The requirement for keto-enol tautomerism.** This common type of tautomerism requires the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen.\" Specifically, this is a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom that is adjacent (alpha) to a carbonyl group (C=O). The sp³ hybridization is critical for the rearrangement to occur.\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: Its structure contains three C=O groups alternating with three -CH₂- groups. The carbons of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to C=O groups. The hydrogens on them are alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**. Its enol form, phloroglucinol, is especially stable due to aromaticity.\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: Its structure has a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds, meaning they are sp²-hybridized. Benzoquinone lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-carbon. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion for Part A**: Compound (A) is **benzoquinone**. All candidate answers are unanimous on this point.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Part B - Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify which compound, between **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** and **dimethyl fumarate**, **will** show optical isomerism. This compound is designated as (B).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The requirement for optical isomerism.** A compound must be chiral to show optical isomerism. Chirality means the molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause is the presence of a \"chiral center,\" which is a carbon atom bonded to four distinctly different atoms or groups.\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since it has a chiral center and lacks any overriding symmetry, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and will show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is the *trans* isomer, CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry. It does not contain any chiral centers and is therefore achiral. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion for Part B**: Compound (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. All candidate answers are also unanimous on this point.\n\n**Step 3: Combine Results and Select the Final Answer**\n\n*   Compound (A), which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B), which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nNow, we match this conclusion to the options provided in the question:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe combination derived from the analysis, `A = benzoquinone` and `B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate`, corresponds exactly to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer by synthesizing the provided candidate answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Part A - Tautomerism**\n\n**Goal**: Identify which compound, between **benzoquinone** and **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**, does **not** show tautomerism. This compound is designated (A).\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The condition for keto-enol tautomerism.** This is the most common form of tautomerism. A key requirement for it to occur is the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen,\" which is a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom that is directly adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: The candidate answers unanimously and correctly identify that this molecule has a ring with alternating C=O groups and -CH₂- groups. The hydrogens on the -CH₂- groups are attached to sp³-hybridized carbons adjacent to carbonyls, making them alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**. Its enol form (phloroglucinol) is also noted to be exceptionally stable due to aromaticity.\n\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: All candidate answers correctly point out that the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups in benzoquinone are part of C=C double bonds. These carbons are sp²-hybridized and lack the specific type of alpha-hydrogen required for the standard keto-enol mechanism. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Part A**: The consensus is unanimous and correct. Compound (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Part B - Optical Isomerism**\n\n**Goal**: Identify which compound, between **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** and **dimethyl fumarate**, **will show** optical isomerism. This compound is designated (B).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The condition for optical isomerism.** A compound will show optical isomerism if its molecules are chiral. Chirality means the molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common indicator of chirality in a molecule is the presence of a \"chiral center,\" which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: All candidate answers correctly identify the structure as CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. They also unanimously identify that the central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four unique groups:\n    1.  -H (hydrogen atom)\n    2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n    3.  -CH₃ (methyl group)\n    4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**: All candidate answers correctly identify this as the *trans*-isomer (CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃). They correctly note it has no chiral center and possesses elements of symmetry (e.g., it is planar and has a center of symmetry), making it an achiral molecule. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Part B**: The consensus is unanimous and correct. Compound (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Synthesis and Answer Selection**\n\nBased on the flawless and unanimous reasoning from all candidate answers:\n*   Compound (A), which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B), which does show optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nNow, we must carefully match this definitive result to the options provided in the question:\n\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe correct combination, \"A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate,\" directly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires a two-part chemical analysis.

This compound is designated as (A).\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism.** This type of tautomerism involves the interconversion between a ketone (keto form) and an alcohol adjacent to a double bond (enol form). A crucial prerequisite for this process is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom that is adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: Its structure contains three C=O groups alternating with three -CH₂- groups. The carbons of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to the C=O groups. The hydrogens on these carbons are alpha-hydrogens.

This is a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). The sp³ hybridization is crucial for the standard rearrangement mechanism.\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound's structure is a six-membered ring with three C=O groups alternating with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The carbons in the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to the C=O groups. The hydrogens on these carbons are alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**. Its enol form (phloroglucinol) is particularly stable due to the formation of an aromatic ring.\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone:** The structure of benzoquinone is a six-membered ring containing two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the C=O groups are part of the ring's C=C double bonds, meaning they are sp²-hybridized. Since it lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-carbon, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion for Part A:** The compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Part B - Optical Isomerism**\n\n*   **Goal:** To identify which compound, between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, **will show** optical isomerism. This is compound (B).\n*   **Careful Point 2: The requirement for optical isomerism.** A compound will show optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common structural feature that causes chirality is a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center and the molecule lacks an overriding element of symmetry, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. \"Fumarate\" specifies the *trans* geometry. This molecule has no chiral center. It is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion for Part B:** The compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Step 3: Combine Results and Final Answer Selection**\n\n*   We have determined that **(A) is benzoquinone** and **(B) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Matching the results to the correct option.** The reasoning in all candidate answers is unanimously correct in identifying the two compounds. However, they select different final letters (A, B, C, D) because the options were listed in a different order for each of them. We must match our conclusion to the options provided in this specific question's context.\n\nLet's check the provided options:\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nOur derived combination, \"A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\", corresponds exactly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\nThe question is divided into two parts. We will solve each part and then combine the results to find the correct option.\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism Analysis**\n\n*   **Task**: Identify the compound that does **not** show tautomerism from the pair: benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. This compound is (A).\n*   **Careful Point 1: The condition for keto-enol tautomerism.** This type of isomerism requires the presence of a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon that is adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen (α-H).\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This molecule has a ring structure where three ketone groups alternate with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The carbon atoms of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to carbonyl groups. The hydrogens on them are therefore α-hydrogens. **Conclusion**: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: This molecule's structure contains two carbonyl groups and two C=C double bonds in a ring. The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. This means they are sp²-hybridized and lack the required α-hydrogens on an sp³-carbon. **Conclusion**: Benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n*   **Result for (A)**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\n*   **Task**: Identify the compound that **will** show optical isomerism from the pair: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate. This compound is (B).\n*   **Careful Point 2: The condition for optical isomerism.** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature causing chirality is a chiral center: a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four distinctly different groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. **Conclusion**: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will** show optical isomerism.\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**: Its structure is the *trans* isomer CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry. It does not have a chiral center. **Conclusion**: Dimethyl fumarate is achiral and **will not** show optical isomerism.\n*   **Result for (B)**: The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Final Synthesis and Conclusion**\n\n*   We have determined that compound (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   We have determined that compound (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nNow we match this pair to the options provided in the question:\n\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe combination derived from our analysis, `A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate`, matches option B exactly.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\nThe question is divided into two parts, and the final answer must correctly identify the compounds for both parts.\n\n### **Part A: Analysis of Tautomerism**\n\nThe task is to identify which compound, between **benzoquinone** and **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**, does **not** show tautomerism.

The hydrogens on them are alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Because it has the required alpha-hydrogens, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**. Its enol form, phloroglucinol, is particularly stable due to being an aromatic ring.\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone**:\n    *   This molecule has a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds.\n    *   The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the C=O groups are part of the ring's C=C double bonds. These carbons are sp²-hybridized, not sp³.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Because it lacks alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n*   **Decision for Part A**: Compound (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Analysis of Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe task is to identify which compound, between **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** and **dimethyl fumarate**, **will** show optical isomerism. This compound is designated as (B).\n\n*   **Core Principle**: A compound shows optical isomerism if its molecules are chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is not superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Identifying chirality.** The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four distinctly different atoms or groups.\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.

A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    *   **Conclusion**: Since it possesses a chiral center and lacks symmetry, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and will show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, which is the *trans*-isomer.\n    *   This molecule has no chiral centers. Furthermore, it possesses a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, making it an achiral molecule.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Because it is achiral, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Decision for Part B**: Compound (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Synthesis**\n\nCombining the conclusions from both parts:\n*   Compound (A), which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B), which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nNow, we match this pair with the provided multiple-choice options:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe correct combination, \"A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\", corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer. The question is broken into two parts, A and B, which are then combined to find the correct multiple-choice option.\n\n### **Part A: Tautomerism Analysis**\n\n**Task:** To identify which compound between **benzoquinone** and **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione** does **not** show tautomerism. This compound is designated as (A).\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism.** This type of tautomerism involves the interconversion between a ketone (keto form) and an alcohol adjacent to a double bond (enol form). For this to occur, there must be a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an alpha-hydrogen), and critically, this alpha-carbon must be sp³-hybridized.\n\n*   **Analysis of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** Its structure is a six-membered ring containing three ketone (C=O) groups alternating with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The carbons of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to carbonyl groups. The hydrogens on them are alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**. Its enol form, phloroglucinol, is exceptionally stable due to being an aromatic compound.\n\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone:** Its structure is a six-membered ring containing two carbonyl groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds and are therefore sp²-hybridized. Since it lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\n**Task:** To identify which compound between **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** and **dimethyl fumarate** **will show** optical isomerism. This compound is designated as (B).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The key requirement for optical isomerism.** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral, meaning it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that gives rise to chirality is a chiral center: a carbon atom bonded to **four different** groups.\n\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group) is attached to four unique groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, which has a *trans* geometry. The molecule is planar and has a center of symmetry, so it is achiral. It has no chiral centers. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for (B):** The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n*   Compound (A), which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B), which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nNow, we match this combination with the provided options:\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe combination derived from the chemical principles perfectly matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the chemical principles and a review of the candidate answers, here is the derivation of the final answer.\n\n### **Part 1: Tautomerism Analysis**\n\n**Task**: Identify which compound, between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, does **not** show tautomerism.

This is a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group. The sp³ hybridization is crucial for the standard rearrangement mechanism.\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: Its structure contains a ring with three C=O groups alternating with three -CH₂- groups.

The crucial requirement for this process is the presence of at least one \"alpha-hydrogen\" (α-H). An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom located on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom that is directly adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group. This sp³ hybridization is essential for the necessary bond rearrangement to form the enol (C=C-OH).\n\n**Analysis**:\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This molecule has a six-membered ring structure where three ketone groups alternate with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The carbons of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to the carbonyls. Therefore, the hydrogens on them are alpha-hydrogens. **Conclusion: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione DOES show tautomerism.** (Its enol form, phloroglucinol, is exceptionally stable due to aromaticity, making this tautomerization highly favorable).\n*   **Benzoquinone**: This molecule has a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are themselves part of the C=C double bonds. This means these alpha-carbons are sp²-hybridized. **Conclusion: Benzoquinone does NOT show tautomerism** because it lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-carbon.\n\n**Decision for Part A**: Compound (A) is **benzoquinone**. All candidate answers unanimously agree on this conclusion.\n\n### **Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n**Goal**: Identify which compound, between **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** and **dimethyl fumarate**, **will** show optical isomerism. This compound is designated as (B).\n\n**Careful Point 2: The requirement for optical isomerism.**\nA compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common structural feature that causes chirality is the presence of a \"chiral center,\" which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n**Analysis**:\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    **Conclusion: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate WILL show optical isomerism** because it has a chiral center and lacks any internal symmetry.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate**: Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups have a *trans* relationship across the double bond. This molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry. It does not contain any chiral centers. **Conclusion: Dimethyl fumarate will NOT show optical isomerism** because it is an achiral molecule.\n\n**Decision for Part B**: Compound (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. All candidate answers unanimously agree on this conclusion as well.\n\n### **Final Synthesis**\n\nCombining the conclusions from both parts:\n*   Compound (A), which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B), which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nNow, we must match this combination with the options provided in the question prompt:\n\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe pair we have derived matches option A exactly.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final correct answer based on the provided candidate answers and fundamental chemical principles.\n\nThe question requires a two-part analysis to identify two specific compounds, followed by selecting the single correct multiple-choice option that matches the findings.\n\n### **Part 1: Tautomerism Analysis**\n\n**Task**: Identify which compound, between **benzoquinone** and **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**, does **not** show tautomerism. This compound will be designated as (A).\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism.** This is the most common form of tautomerism for carbonyl compounds. A critical requirement for it to occur is the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen.\" Specifically, this is a hydrogen atom located on an **sp³-hybridized** carbon atom that is directly adjacent (alpha) to a carbonyl group (C=O). The sp³ hybridization is essential for the necessary bond rearrangement.\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: The structure of this molecule consists of a six-membered ring with three ketone (C=O) groups alternating with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The carbons of the methylene groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to the carbonyl groups. The hydrogens on them are alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**. Its enol form (phloroglucinol) is especially stable because it forms an aromatic ring.\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: The structure of this molecule is a six-membered ring containing two carbonyl groups and two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms that are adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds. This means these alpha-carbons are **sp²-hybridized**. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism** as it lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon.\n*   **Conclusion for Part A**: Compound (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part 2: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\n**Task**: Identify which compound, between **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** and **dimethyl fumarate**, **will show** optical isomerism. This compound will be designated as (B).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The key requirement for optical isomerism.** A compound will show optical isomerism if its molecules are chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common structural feature that leads to chirality is the presence of a \"chiral center,\" which is a carbon atom bonded to **four different** atoms or groups.\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.

A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center and the molecule lacks an overriding element of symmetry (like a plane or center of inversion), **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. \"Fumarate\" specifies the *trans* geometry across the double bond. This molecule has no chiral center. It is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, which makes it achiral. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion for Part B**: Compound (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Synthesis and Decision**\n\n*   We have correctly and unanimously determined from the reasoning that **(A) is benzoquinone**.\n*   We have also correctly and unanimously determined that **(B) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThe final step is to match this conclusion with the multiple-choice options provided in the question:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe combination we derived, \"A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\", corresponds exactly to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"

This compound is designated as (A).\n*   **Key Principle**: The most common form of tautomerism for these compounds is keto-enol tautomerism. A crucial requirement for this is the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen,\" which is a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: Its structure contains three C=O groups and three -CH₂- groups. The carbons in the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and adjacent to the C=O groups. The hydrogens on these carbons are alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: Its structure contains C=O groups and C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds, making them sp²-hybridized. It lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion for Part A**: Compound (A) is **benzoquinone**. All candidate answers are in unanimous agreement on this point based on their reasoning.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Part B - Optical Isomerism**\n\n*   **Question**: Identify which compound, between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, **will** show optical isomerism. This compound is designated as (B).\n*   **Key Principle**: A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that leads to chirality is a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (C2) is bonded to four distinct groups: (-H), (-OH), (-CH₃), and (-COOCH₃). Since it has a chiral center and lacks an internal plane of symmetry, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is the *trans* isomer of CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. This molecule has no chiral centers. It is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion for Part B**: Compound (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. All candidate answers are also in unanimous agreement on this point.\n\n**Step 3: Combine Results and Final Decision**\n\nBased on the universally correct reasoning provided by all candidate agents:\n*   Compound **(A)**, which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound **(B)**, which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nNow, we must match this combination with the options provided in the question:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe combination `A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate` corresponds exactly to option D.\n\n**Careful Point**: The reasoning across all candidate answers is sound and consistent.

This compound will be designated (A).\n\n1.  **Careful Point 1: The condition for keto-enol tautomerism.** This type of isomerism requires the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen\" (α-H). An α-H is a hydrogen atom located on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom that is adjacent to a carbonyl (C=O) group. The sp³ hybridization is essential for the typical mechanism.\n2.  **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: Its structure is a six-membered ring where three C=O groups alternate with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The hydrogens on the -CH₂- groups are indeed alpha-hydrogens, as they are on sp³-hybridized carbons next to carbonyls. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**. Its enol form (phloroglucinol) is highly stable due to aromaticity.\n3.  **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: Its structure is a six-membered ring containing two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent to the C=O groups are part of the double bonds and are sp²-hybridized. Since it lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-carbon, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n4.  **Conclusion for Part A**: All candidate answers correctly and unanimously conclude that the compound (A) which does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part 2: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\n**Task**: Identify which compound, between `methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate` and `dimethyl fumarate`, **will** show optical isomerism. This compound will be designated (B).\n\n1.  **Careful Point 2: The condition for optical isomerism.** A compound must be chiral to show optical isomerism. Chirality means the molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature that gives rise to chirality is a \"chiral center\"—a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n2.  **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    *   -H (a hydrogen atom)\n    *   -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n    *   -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n    *   -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n3.  **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, which has a *trans* geometry. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral.

The sp³ hybridization is critical for the rearrangement to occur.\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: Its structure contains three C=O groups alternating with three -CH₂- groups. The carbons of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to C=O groups. The hydrogens on them are alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**. Its enol form, phloroglucinol, is especially stable due to aromaticity.\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: Its structure has a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the C=O groups are part of the C=C double bonds, meaning they are sp²-hybridized. Benzoquinone lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-carbon. Therefore, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion for Part A**: Compound (A) is **benzoquinone**. All candidate answers are unanimous on this point.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Part B - Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify which compound, between **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** and **dimethyl fumarate**, **will** show optical isomerism.

Its enol form (phloroglucinol) is also noted to be exceptionally stable due to aromaticity.\n\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: All candidate answers correctly point out that the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups in benzoquinone are part of C=C double bonds.

This compound is designated as (A).\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism.** This type of tautomerism involves the interconversion between a ketone (keto form) and an alcohol adjacent to a double bond (enol form). A crucial prerequisite for this process is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen, which is a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom that is adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: Its structure contains three C=O groups alternating with three -CH₂- groups. The carbons of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to the C=O groups. The hydrogens on these carbons are alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**. Its enol form, phloroglucinol, is particularly stable because it is an aromatic ring.\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: Its structure has a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the C=O groups are themselves part of the C=C double bonds, meaning they are sp²-hybridized. Since it lacks alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon, **benzoquinone does not show keto-enol tautomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion for (A)**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe question asks to identify which compound, between **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** and **dimethyl fumarate**, **will** show optical isomerism.

A chiral molecule is one that is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common structural feature that causes chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four distinctly different atoms or groups.\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.

A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center and the molecule lacks internal symmetry, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is chiral and will show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**: Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, with the ester groups in a *trans* configuration. The molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry. It does not contain any chiral centers. Therefore, it is achiral and **will not show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion for (B)**: The compound that will show optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Synthesis**\n\nCombining the conclusions from both parts:\n*   Compound (A), which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B), which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nNow, we match this combination with the options provided in the question:\n*   **A) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n*   B) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n*   D) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe result derived from the chemical analysis matches option A exactly.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the chemical principles and a review of the candidate answers, here is the derivation of the final answer.\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism Analysis**\n\nThe first task is to identify which compound between **benzoquinone** and **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione** does **not** show tautomerism. This compound is designated as (A).\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The condition for keto-enol tautomerism.** This type of tautomerism requires the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen,\" which is a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom that is adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group. The sp³ hybridization is crucial for the mechanism.\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This molecule's structure contains three C=O groups alternating with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The carbons of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to the C=O groups. The hydrogens on them are alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**. Its enol form (phloroglucinol) is especially stable because it is an aromatic compound.\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: This molecule's structure is a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the C=O groups are part of the ring's double bonds and are sp²-hybridized. Since it lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-carbon, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion for Part A**: Compound (A) is **benzoquinone**. All candidate answers unanimously reached this correct conclusion.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\nThe second task is to identify which compound between **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** and **dimethyl fumarate** **will** show optical isomerism. This compound is designated as (B).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The condition for optical isomerism.** A compound must be chiral to show optical isomerism. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause is the presence of a \"chiral center,\" which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n    2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n    3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n    4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    Since it has a chiral center and lacks any overriding symmetry, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**: Its structure is the *trans* isomer CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule has no carbon atom bonded to four different groups (no chiral center). Furthermore, it is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral. **Dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion for Part B**: Compound (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. All candidate answers also unanimously reached this correct conclusion.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\n*   We have determined that **A = benzoquinone**.\n*   We have determined that **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Matching the conclusion to the options.** We must now find the option that matches this specific combination from the list provided in the question.\n\nThe options are:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nComparing our conclusion (A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) to the list, we find that it corresponds exactly to option D. The unanimous scientific reasoning of all candidate answers supports this combination, even though they selected different letters due to inconsistent option ordering in their source prompts.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the candidate answers and fundamental chemical principles.\n\nThe task is to identify two compounds based on their chemical properties and then select the correct multiple-choice option.\n\n**Part A: Tautomerism Analysis**\n\n*   **Task**: Identify which compound, between **benzoquinone** and **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**, does **not** show tautomerism. This is compound (A).\n*   **Core Principle**: The common form of tautomerism relevant here is keto-enol tautomerism. The primary condition for this is the presence of an alpha-hydrogen (α-H).\n*   **Careful Point 1**: An alpha-hydrogen must be located on an **sp³-hybridized** carbon atom that is adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group. The sp³ hybridization is key for the bond rearrangement.\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: Its structure has three ketone groups alternating with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The hydrogens on the -CH₂- groups are indeed alpha-hydrogens (attached to sp³ carbons adjacent to C=O groups). Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**.\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds, making them **sp²-hybridized**. Since it lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-carbon, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion for (A)**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. All provided candidate answers correctly and unanimously reached this conclusion.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\n*   **Task**: Identify which compound, between **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** and **dimethyl fumarate**, **will** show optical isomerism. This is compound (B).\n*   **Core Principle**: A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Careful Point 2**: The most common feature indicating chirality is a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to **four different** atoms or groups.\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four distinct groups: (-H), (-OH), (-CH₃), and (-COOCH₃). Since it has a chiral center, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**: This is a *trans*-alkene, CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. It is planar and has a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion for (B)**: The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. All provided candidate answers also correctly and unanimously reached this conclusion.\n\n**Final Synthesis**\n\n1.  **Consolidate Results**:\n    *   Compound (A) = **benzoquinone**\n    *   Compound (B) = **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**\n\n2.  **Match to Options**: The final step is to match this derived pair to the specific options provided in the question.\n    *   A) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n    *   B) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n    *   C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n    *   D) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\n3.  **Final Decision**: The combination of `A = benzoquinone` and `B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate` directly corresponds to option A. The candidate answers, while all arriving at the same correct chemical conclusion, selected different letters (A, B, C, D) because they were likely presented with differently ordered multiple-choice options. Based on the options listed in this problem, A is the only correct choice.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the candidate solutions and fundamental chemical principles.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Part A - Tautomerism**\n\n*   **Goal:** To identify which compound, between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, does **not** show tautomerism. This is compound (A).\n*   **Careful Point 1: The requirement for keto-enol tautomerism.** The most common type of tautomerism requires a molecule to have an alpha-hydrogen (α-H). This is a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). The sp³ hybridization is crucial for the standard rearrangement mechanism.\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** This compound's structure is a six-membered ring with three C=O groups alternating with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The carbons in the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to the C=O groups. The hydrogens on these carbons are alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**. Its enol form (phloroglucinol) is particularly stable due to the formation of an aromatic ring.\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone:** The structure of benzoquinone is a six-membered ring containing two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbons adjacent (alpha) to the C=O groups are part of the ring's C=C double bonds, meaning they are sp²-hybridized. Since it lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-carbon, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion for Part A:** The compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Part B - Optical Isomerism**\n\n*   **Goal:** To identify which compound, between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, **will show** optical isomerism. This is compound (B).\n*   **Careful Point 2: The requirement for optical isomerism.** A compound will show optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common structural feature that causes chirality is a chiral center—a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:** The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center and the molecule lacks an overriding element of symmetry, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. \"Fumarate\" specifies the *trans* geometry. This molecule has no chiral center. It is planar and possesses a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, **dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n*   **Conclusion for Part B:** The compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n**Step 3: Combine Results and Final Answer Selection**\n\n*   We have determined that **(A) is benzoquinone** and **(B) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Matching the results to the correct option.** The reasoning in all candidate answers is unanimously correct in identifying the two compounds. However, they select different final letters (A, B, C, D) because the options were listed in a different order for each of them. We must match our conclusion to the options provided in this specific question's context.\n\nLet's check the provided options:\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nOur derived combination, \"A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\", corresponds exactly to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\nThe question is divided into two parts.

This compound is (A).\n*   **Careful Point 1: The condition for keto-enol tautomerism.** This type of isomerism requires the presence of a hydrogen atom on an sp³-hybridized carbon that is adjacent to a carbonyl group (C=O). This hydrogen is called an alpha-hydrogen (α-H).\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This molecule has a ring structure where three ketone groups alternate with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The carbon atoms of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to carbonyl groups. The hydrogens on them are therefore α-hydrogens. **Conclusion**: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism.\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone**: This molecule's structure contains two carbonyl groups and two C=C double bonds in a ring. The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds. This means they are sp²-hybridized and lack the required α-hydrogens on an sp³-carbon. **Conclusion**: Benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n*   **Result for (A)**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n**Part B: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\n*   **Task**: Identify the compound that **will** show optical isomerism from the pair: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate. This compound is (B).\n*   **Careful Point 2: The condition for optical isomerism.** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common feature causing chirality is a chiral center: a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.

A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. **Conclusion**: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate **will** show optical isomerism.\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**: Its structure is the *trans* isomer CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.

This compound is designated as (B).\n\n*   **Core Principle**: A compound shows optical isomerism if its molecules are chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is not superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Identifying chirality.** The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a chiral center (or stereocenter), which is a carbon atom bonded to four distinctly different atoms or groups.\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four different groups:\n        1.

This compound is designated as (A).\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The key requirement for keto-enol tautomerism.** This type of tautomerism involves the interconversion between a ketone (keto form) and an alcohol adjacent to a double bond (enol form). For this to occur, there must be a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (an alpha-hydrogen), and critically, this alpha-carbon must be sp³-hybridized.\n\n*   **Analysis of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:** Its structure is a six-membered ring containing three ketone (C=O) groups alternating with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The carbons of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to carbonyl groups. The hydrogens on them are alpha-hydrogens. Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**. Its enol form, phloroglucinol, is exceptionally stable due to being an aromatic compound.\n\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone:** Its structure is a six-membered ring containing two carbonyl groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the C=C double bonds and are therefore sp²-hybridized. Since it lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n*   **Conclusion for (A):** The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Optical Isomerism Analysis**\n\n**Task:** To identify which compound between **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** and **dimethyl fumarate** **will show** optical isomerism.

The carbon atom at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group) is attached to four unique groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    Since this carbon is a chiral center, the molecule is chiral. Therefore, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:** The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, which has a *trans* geometry. The molecule is planar and has a center of symmetry, so it is achiral. It has no chiral centers.

The key requirement for this is the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen\" (α-H).\n*   **Careful Point 1**: For the standard keto-enol mechanism, the alpha-hydrogen must be on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O). The sp³ hybridization is crucial for the rearrangement.\n\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**:\n    *   This molecule's structure consists of a six-membered ring with three ketone groups alternating with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups.\n    *   The hydrogens on the -CH₂- groups are indeed alpha-hydrogens, as they are attached to sp³-hybridized carbons which are adjacent to carbonyl groups.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Therefore, **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism**. Its enol form (phloroglucinol) is particularly stable because it is an aromatic compound.\n\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone**:\n    *   This molecule is a six-membered ring containing two carbonyl groups and two C=C double bonds.\n    *   The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring's double bonds. They are sp²-hybridized, not sp³.\n    *   **Conclusion**: Since it lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-carbon, **benzoquinone does not show tautomerism**.\n\n*   **Decision for Part A**: Compound (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### **Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n**Task**: Identify which compound, between **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** and **dimethyl fumarate**, **will** show optical isomerism. This compound is (B).\n\n*   **Core Principle**: A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is non-superimposable on its mirror image.\n*   **Careful Point 2**: The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a \"chiral center\"—a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:\n    *   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   The central carbon atom (at position 2) is bonded to four distinctly different groups:\n        1.  -H (a hydrogen atom)\n        2.  -OH (a hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (a methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (a methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   **Conclusion**: Since this carbon is a chiral center and the molecule has no overriding elements of symmetry, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate will show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate**:\n    *   The structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The \"fumarate\" name implies it is the *trans* isomer across the double bond.\n    *   This molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry. It does not contain any chiral centers. Therefore, it is achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Dimethyl fumarate will not show optical isomerism**.\n\n*   **Decision for Part B**: Compound (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### **Final Synthesis and Conclusion**\n\n*   **Compound (A)**, which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   **Compound (B)**, which does show optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nNow, we match this combination with the options provided in the question:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe derived combination {A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate} perfectly matches the statement in option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires a two-part analysis to identify the correct compounds, followed by selecting the matching multiple-choice option.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze Part A - Tautomerism**\n\nThe first task is to determine which of the two compounds, **benzoquinone** or **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**, does **not** show tautomerism. This compound is designated (A).\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The condition for keto-enol tautomerism.** This type of tautomerism, which is an equilibrium between a ketone (keto form) and an alcohol-alkene (enol form), has a critical requirement: the presence of an \"alpha-hydrogen\". An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom bonded to an sp³-hybridized carbon atom that is adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n*   **Analysis of Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione:**\n    *   **Structure:** This compound has a six-membered ring with three C=O groups alternating with three -CH₂- (methylene) groups.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbons of the methylene groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to carbonyl groups. Therefore, the hydrogens on these carbons are alpha-hydrogens.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione **does** show tautomerism. It can convert to its highly stable aromatic enol form, phloroglucinol.\n\n*   **Analysis of Benzoquinone:**\n    *   **Structure:** This compound has a six-membered ring with two C=O groups and two C=C double bonds.\n    *   **Alpha-Hydrogens:** The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the C=O groups are part of the ring's double bonds. These carbons are sp²-hybridized. It lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-hybridized carbon.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone **does not** show tautomerism.\n\n*   **Result for Part A:** The compound (A) that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**. The candidate answers are unanimous on this point.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Part B - Optical Isomerism**\n\nThe second task is to determine which of the two compounds, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** or **dimethyl fumarate**, **will** show optical isomerism. This compound is designated (B).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The condition for optical isomerism.** A compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A chiral molecule is one that is not superimposable on its mirror image. The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n*   **Analysis of Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:**\n    *   **Structure:** CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chiral Center:** The carbon at position 2 (the one bearing the -OH group) is bonded to four distinct groups:\n        1.  -H (hydrogen)\n        2.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        3.  -CH₃ (methyl group)\n        4.  -COOCH₃ (methoxycarbonyl group)\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since it has a chiral center, the molecule is chiral and **will** show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Analysis of Dimethyl fumarate:**\n    *   **Structure:** This is the *trans*-isomer with the formula CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃.\n    *   **Chirality:** The molecule lacks a chiral center. Furthermore, it possesses a center of symmetry and a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Dimethyl fumarate **will not** show optical isomerism.\n\n*   **Result for Part B:** The compound (B) that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. The candidate answers are also unanimous on this point.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Answer Synthesis**\n\nCombining the results from the analysis:\n*   Compound (A), which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B), which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nNow, we match this conclusion to the options provided in the question:\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\nThe correct pairing, \"A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate,\" corresponds exactly to option C.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Analysis of Candidate Answers.** The provided candidate answers all correctly derive the chemical properties of the molecules. The discrepancy in the final letter they chose (A, B, C, or D) indicates that the list of options they were given was likely randomized. The crucial takeaway is their unanimous agreement on the scientific reasoning, which solidly points to the combination found in option C of the main problem statement.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the candidate answers and fundamental chemical principles.\n\nThe question is broken down into two distinct parts, which we will analyze sequentially.\n\n### **Part A: Tautomerism**\n\n**Goal**: Identify which compound, between **benzoquinone** and **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**, does **not** show tautomerism. This compound is designated as (A).\n\n**Careful Point 1: The requirement for keto-enol tautomerism.**\nThe most common form of tautomerism for ketones is keto-enol tautomerism. The crucial requirement for this process is the presence of at least one \"alpha-hydrogen\" (α-H). An alpha-hydrogen is a hydrogen atom located on an sp³-hybridized carbon atom that is directly adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) group. This sp³ hybridization is essential for the necessary bond rearrangement to form the enol (C=C-OH).\n\n**Analysis**:\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This molecule has a six-membered ring structure where three ketone groups alternate with three methylene (-CH₂-) groups. The carbons of the -CH₂- groups are sp³-hybridized and are adjacent to the carbonyls. Therefore, the hydrogens on them are alpha-hydrogens. **Conclusion: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione DOES show tautomerism.** (Its enol form, phloroglucinol, is exceptionally stable due to aromaticity, making this tautomerization highly favorable).\n*   **Benzoquinone**: This molecule has a six-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and two C=C double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl groups are themselves part of the C=C double bonds. This means these alpha-carbons are sp²-hybridized. **Conclusion: Benzoquinone does NOT show tautomerism** because it lacks the required alpha-hydrogens on an sp³-carbon.\n\n**Decision for Part A**: Compound (A) is **benzoquinone**. All candidate answers unanimously agree on this conclusion.\n\n### **Part B: Optical Isomerism**\n\n**Goal**: Identify which compound, between **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** and **dimethyl fumarate**, **will** show optical isomerism. This compound is designated as (B).\n\n**Careful Point 2: The requirement for optical isomerism.**\nA compound shows optical isomerism if it is chiral. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. The most common structural feature that causes chirality is the presence of a \"chiral center,\" which is a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or groups.\n\n**Analysis**:\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Its structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. Let's examine the carbon at position 2 (the one bonded to the -OH group). It is bonded to four distinct groups:\n    1.  A hydrogen atom (-H)\n    2.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    4.  A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃)\n    **Conclusion: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate WILL show optical isomerism** because it has a chiral center and lacks any internal symmetry.\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate**: Its structure is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃, where the ester groups have a *trans* relationship across the double bond. This molecule is planar and possesses a center of symmetry. It does not contain any chiral centers. **Conclusion: Dimethyl fumarate will NOT show optical isomerism** because it is an achiral molecule.\n\n**Decision for Part B**: Compound (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. All candidate answers unanimously agree on this conclusion as well.\n\n### **Final Synthesis**\n\nCombining the conclusions from both parts:\n*   Compound (A), which does not show tautomerism, is **benzoquinone**.\n*   Compound (B), which shows optical isomerism, is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nNow, we must match this combination with the options provided in the question prompt:\n\nA) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nC) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate\n\nThe pair we have derived matches option A exactly. The discrepancies in the final letters chosen by the various candidate agents are due to them being presented with differently ordered multiple-choice lists; however, their scientific reasoning is identical and unanimously supports this conclusion.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
