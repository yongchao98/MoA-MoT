A step-by-step stoichiometric calculation is necessary to find the final pH of the mixed solution. The provided answers from other agents all arrive at the same numerical conclusion through the same correct methodology, which provides high confidence in the result.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of all acidic and basic species.**\nThe first step is to determine the amount (in moles) of all reactive species being mixed together. The formula for moles is Molarity (mol/L) × Volume (L).\n\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n    0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.050 mol**\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    As a strong acid, HCl completely dissociates.\n    0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = **0.080 mol of H⁺**\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    Barium hydroxide is a strong base that dissociates to yield two hydroxide ions.\n    (0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L) × 2 = **0.180 mol of OH⁻**\n\n**Step 2: Determine the excess reactant after neutralization.**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react completely with all available acidic protons from both the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH₃COOH). We compare the total moles of acid to the total moles of base.\n\n*   **Total moles of acid** = (Moles from HCl) + (Moles from CH₃COOH)\n    Total acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻)** = **0.180 mol**\n\nComparing the totals, the moles of base (0.180 mol) are greater than the moles of acid (0.130 mol). Therefore, the strong base is in excess, and the final solution will be basic.\n\n*   **Excess moles of OH⁻** = Total moles of base - Total moles of acid\n    Excess OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the concentration of the excess species and the final pH.**\nThe pH is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻) in the final total volume.\n\n*   **Total Volume of solution** = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n*   **Final Concentration of OH⁻, [OH⁻]** = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n*   **Calculate pOH** from the hydroxide concentration:\n    pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n*   **Calculate pH** using the relationship pH + pOH = 14 (at 25°C):\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Stoichiometry of Ba(OH)₂:** A critical and common point of error is forgetting that Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base that provides **two** moles of hydroxide ions (OH⁻) for every mole of the compound.\n2.  **Total Acid Calculation:** When determining the limiting reactant, one must sum *all* moles of acid (both strong and weak) that will be neutralized by the strong base.\n3.  **Use of Total Volume:** The final concentration of the excess species must be calculated using the *total combined volume* of all the solutions.\n4.  **pOH vs. pH Conversion:** When a strong base is in excess, the direct logarithmic calculation yields the pOH. It is essential to perform the final conversion step (pH = 14 - pOH) to find the pH. As seen in the options, the pOH value (1.38) is a common distractor.\n\nBased on this robust calculation, the final pH is 12.62.

Determine the excess reactant after neutralization.**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will neutralize all available acidic protons from both the strong and weak acids. We sum the total moles of acid and compare it to the total moles of base.\n\n*   **Total moles of acid** = (Moles from HCl) + (Moles from CH₃COOH)\n    Total Acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻)** = **0.180 mol**\n\nComparing the totals, the moles of base (0.180) are greater than the moles of acid (0.130). Therefore, the strong base is in excess.\n\n*   **Excess moles of OH⁻** = (Total moles of base) - (Total moles of acid)\n    Excess OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**3.

Forgetting this leads to a wrong calculation of base moles.\n*   **Total Neutralization:** The strong base neutralizes all available acid, from both strong and weak sources. Summing all acidic moles is necessary to find the correct excess.\n*   **Total Volume:** The final concentration is determined by the total volume of the mixture, not any individual component.\n*   **pH vs. pOH:** A common mistake is to report the pOH value (1.38) as the final pH. This value is included as option C, a common distractor. The question asks for pH, which requires the conversion step: pH = 14 - pOH.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe final calculated pH is **12.62**.

The number of moles is calculated by multiplying the molarity (mol/L) by the volume (L).\n\n*   **CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n    *   Moles = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.050 mol**\n*   **HCl (strong acid):**\n    *   Moles = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = **0.080 mol of H⁺**\n*   **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    *   Moles = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol of Ba(OH)₂\n    *   Since Ba(OH)₂ dissociates to produce two hydroxide ions (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻), we must multiply by 2.\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ = 0.090 mol × 2 = **0.180 mol of OH⁻**\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total moles of acid and base to find the excess reactant.**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will completely neutralize all available acidic protons from both the strong and weak acids.\n\n*   **Total moles of acid** = Moles from HCl + Moles from CH₃COOH\n    *   Total Acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻)** = **0.180 mol**\n\nComparing the totals, the moles of base (0.180 mol) are greater than the moles of acid (0.130 mol). Therefore, the strong base is in excess, and the final solution will be basic.\n\n*   **Excess moles of OH⁻** = Total OH⁻ moles - Total acid moles\n    *   Excess OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the concentration of the excess species.**\nThe concentration must be calculated using the total final volume of the mixed solution.\n\n*   **Total Volume** = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n*   **Final Concentration of OH⁻, [OH⁻]** = Excess moles of OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    *   [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final pH.**\nSince we have the concentration of excess hydroxide ions, we must first calculate the pOH.\n\n*   **pOH** = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n*   **pH** = 14 - pOH (at 25 °C)\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n### **Careful Points Summarized**\n1.  **Ba(OH)₂ Stoichiometry:** It is crucial to remember that Ba(OH)₂ yields **two** moles of OH⁻ per mole of the compound.\n2.  **Total Neutralization:** The strong base neutralizes all acidic protons from both strong and weak acids. Sum them for the stoichiometric calculation.\n3.  **Total Volume:** Use the sum of all individual volumes (1.2 L) to calculate the final concentration.\n4.  **pH vs. pOH:** After calculating the excess [OH⁻], the `-log` value gives the pOH (1.38). This is a distractor answer (Option C). You must convert to pH using `pH = 14 - pOH`.\n\nThe final calculated pH is **12.62**, which matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step stoichiometric analysis to find the pH of a mixed solution containing a weak acid, a strong acid, and a strong base.

The steps are:\n1.  Calculate the initial moles of all acidic and basic species.\n2.  Determine the limiting and excess reactants by comparing total acid to total base.\n3.  Calculate the concentration of the excess reactant in the final total volume.\n4.  Convert this concentration to pH.\n\n### **Detailed Calculation and Careful Points**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Initial Moles of All Reactants**\n\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n    Moles = 0.500 L × 0.1 mol/L = **0.050 mol**\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    Moles = 0.400 L × 0.2 mol/L = **0.080 mol**\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Stoichiometry of Dissociation.** A critical and frequently missed detail is that Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base that provides **two** moles of hydroxide ions (OH⁻) for every mole of the compound (Ba(OH)₂ → Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻).\n    Moles = (0.300 L × 0.3 mol/L) × 2 = 0.090 mol × 2 = **0.180 mol**\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Excess Reactant after Neutralization**\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Totaling Reactants.** The strong base will react with all available acidic protons from both the strong and weak acids. Therefore, we must sum the moles of all acidic species to find the total acid available for neutralization.\n    *   Total Moles of Acid = Moles(HCl) + Moles(CH₃COOH) = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n    *   Total Moles of Base = **0.180 mol**\n*   **Comparison:**\n    Moles of Base (0.180 mol) > Moles of Acid (0.130 mol).\n    This means the strong base is in excess, and the final solution's pH will be determined by it.\n*   **Excess Moles:**\n    Excess OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Final Concentration of Excess OH⁻**\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Total Final Volume.** The concentration must be calculated using the total volume of the final mixture.\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n*   **Final [OH⁻] Concentration:**\n    *   [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final pH**\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Converting from pOH to pH.** Since we have calculated the concentration of hydroxide ions, the -log of this value gives the pOH, not the pH. This is a common pitfall. The value of the pOH (1.38) is present in the options as a distractor.\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe detailed calculation confirms that the final pH of the solution is 12.62. This matches the numerical result derived by all candidate agents.

A review of all candidate answers shows a unanimous consensus on the calculation methodology, providing high confidence in the correct approach. The inconsistencies in the final letter choices among the candidates are clearly due to variations in how the multiple-choice options were presented to them, not flaws in their chemical reasoning.\n\nHere is a definitive analysis of the problem, incorporating the key steps and crucial points.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of all acidic and basic species.**\nThis is the foundational step. The number of moles is calculated by multiplying the molarity (mol/L) by the volume (L).\n\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n    0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.050 mol**\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = **0.080 mol**\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    (0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L) × 2 = **0.180 mol**\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total moles of acid and base and find the excess reactant.**\nA strong base, like Ba(OH)₂, will completely neutralize all available acidic protons from both the strong and weak acids.\n\n*   **Total moles of acid** = (Moles from HCl) + (Moles from CH₃COOH)\n    Total Acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻)** = **0.180 mol**\n\nComparing the totals, the moles of base (0.180 mol) are greater than the moles of acid (0.130 mol). Therefore, the strong base is in excess.\n\n*   **Moles of excess OH⁻** = (Total moles of base) - (Total moles of acid)\n    Excess OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the concentration of the excess species.**\nThe pH will be determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻) in the final total volume.\n\n*   **Total Final Volume** = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n*   **Final Concentration of OH⁻, [OH⁻]** = Moles / Volume\n    [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the pH from the concentration.**\nBecause we have the concentration of OH⁻, we must first calculate the pOH and then convert it to pH.\n\n*   **pOH** = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n*   **pH** = 14 - pOH\n    pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Stoichiometry of Ba(OH)₂:** The most critical detail is that each formula unit of barium hydroxide, Ba(OH)₂, provides **two** moles of hydroxide ions (OH⁻). Forgetting to multiply by two is a very common error.\n2.  **Neutralization of All Acids:** The strong base neutralizes all available acidic protons, from both the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH₃COOH). For stoichiometric purposes, they are summed together.\n3.  **Using the Total Final Volume:** The final concentration must be calculated using the total combined volume of all the solutions mixed together (1.2 L).\n4.  **Distinguishing pH from pOH:** Since the base is in excess, the calculation directly yields the pOH. It is a classic error to report this value (1.38) as the final answer. The question asks for pH, which requires the final conversion step: pH = 14 - pOH. Option A (1.38) is a distractor targeting this exact mistake.\n\nThe final calculated pH is **12.62**.

The amount of excess is 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol of OH⁻**.\n4.  **Final Concentration:** The total volume is 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1.2 L. The final concentration of OH⁻ is 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ **0.04167 M**.\n5.  **pH Calculation:**\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**. This matches option A, which is a distractor.\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**.\n\nThe calculated and verified pH is 12.62.

We must sum the total moles of acid and compare it to the total moles of base.\n    *   **Total Moles of Acid:** 0.050 mol (from CH₃COOH) + 0.080 mol (from HCl) = **0.130 mol**\n    *   **Total Moles of Base (OH⁻):** **0.180 mol**\n    *   **Comparison:** Since the moles of base (0.180 mol) are greater than the total moles of acid (0.130 mol), the strong base is in excess.\n    *   **Excess Moles of OH⁻:** 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n3.  **Calculate the Final Concentration of the Excess Species**\n    The final pH is dictated by the concentration of the excess hydroxide ions in the total volume of the mixture.\n    *   **Total Final Volume:** 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n    *   **Final [OH⁻] Concentration:** 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final pH**\n    With the final concentration of OH⁻ known, we first calculate the pOH and then convert it to pH.\n    *   **Calculate pOH:** pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n    *   **Calculate pH:** pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\nThis analysis, confirmed by all candidate answers, highlights several critical points where errors commonly occur:\n*   **Stoichiometry of Ba(OH)₂:** The most critical step is remembering that one mole of Barium Hydroxide, Ba(OH)₂, produces **two** moles of hydroxide ions (OH⁻). Failing to multiply the moles by two is a major error.\n*   **Total Neutralization:** The strong base neutralizes *all* acidic protons present, regardless of whether they come from a strong or weak acid. Therefore, the moles of HCl and CH₃COOH must be summed for the neutralization calculation.\n*   **Using the Total Volume:** The final concentration of the excess reactant must be calculated using the *total combined volume* of all three solutions (1.2 L).\n*   **Distinguishing pH vs. pOH:** After finding the excess of OH⁻, the calculation `-log([OH⁻])` gives the pOH (1.38). This value is provided as option C to act as a distractor. The question asks for pH, which requires the final conversion step: pH = 14 - pOH.\n\nThe final calculated pH is **12.62**, which corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"

Determine the total moles of acid and base to find the excess reactant.**\nThe strong base will react with all available acidic protons from both the strong and weak acids until one side is consumed.\n*   **Total moles of acid:**\n    Total Acid = Moles(HCl) + Moles(CH₃COOH) = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻):** **0.180 mol**\n*   **Comparison:** Since the moles of base (0.180) are greater than the moles of acid (0.130), the final solution will be basic due to an excess of strong base (OH⁻).\n*   **Excess moles of OH⁻:**\n    Excess OH⁻ = Total Base - Total Acid = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**3. Calculate the pH of the final solution.**\nThe pH is determined by the concentration of the excess strong base in the total volume of the solution.\n*   **Total volume:**\n    Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n*   **Final concentration of OH⁻:**\n    [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n*   **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    First, we calculate the pOH from the hydroxide concentration, then convert it to pH.\n    pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Stoichiometry of Ba(OH)₂:** It is essential to remember that one mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces two moles of OH⁻ ions. Failing to multiply by two is a common and critical error.\n*   **Neutralization of All Acids:** The strong base neutralizes both the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH₃COOH).

The formula `Moles = Molarity (mol/L) × Volume (L)` is used.\n\n    *   Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):\n        0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.050 mol**\n    *   Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):\n        0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = **0.080 mol**\n    *   Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):\n        0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol of Ba(OH)₂.\n\n2.  **Determine the total moles of acidic and basic species for neutralization.**\n\n    *   **Total Moles of Acid:** A strong base will react with all available acidic protons, from both strong and weak acids.\n        Total Acid = Moles(HCl) + Moles(CH₃COOH) = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n\n    *   **Total Moles of Base (OH⁻):** Barium hydroxide, Ba(OH)₂, is a strong base that provides **two** moles of hydroxide ions (OH⁻) for every mole of the compound.\n        Total OH⁻ = Moles(Ba(OH)₂) × 2 = 0.090 mol × 2 = **0.180 mol**\n\n3.  **Find the excess reactant after neutralization.**\n    Compare the total moles of acid and base.\n\n    *   Total Acid = 0.130 mol\n    *   Total Base = 0.180 mol\n\n    Since moles of base > moles of acid, the strong base is in excess. The final pH will be basic and determined by the concentration of this excess base.\n    *   Excess moles of OH⁻ = Total moles OH⁻ - Total moles acid\n        Excess OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n4.  **Calculate the concentration of the excess species in the final solution.**\n    The concentration must be calculated using the total volume of the mixed solution.\n\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n    *   Final Concentration of OH⁻, [OH⁻] = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n        [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n5.  **Calculate the final pH.**\n    Because we have the concentration of OH⁻, we must first calculate the pOH and then convert it to pH.\n\n    *   pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The most common mistake is forgetting that Ba(OH)₂ is a dihydroxide base and produces two moles of OH⁻ ions per mole of the compound. You must multiply the moles of Ba(OH)₂ by 2.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** When reacting with a strong base, it is correct to sum the moles of all acidic species (both strong and weak) to determine the total amount of acid to be neutralized.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** The final concentration of the excess reactant must be calculated using the total combined volume of all the solutions mixed together.\n*   **Careful Point 4:** The calculation involving the excess [OH⁻] first gives the pOH. It is crucial to perform the final step of subtracting the pOH from 14 to find the pH. Reporting the pOH value is a common error, and this value (1.38) is present as distractor option D.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe step-by-step calculation consistently and reliably yields a pH of **12.62**.\n\nComparing this result to the provided options:\nA) 8.92\nB) 8.68\nC) 12.62\nD) 1.38\n\nThe correct answer is 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires a step-by-step stoichiometric analysis to determine the final pH of a mixed solution. A comprehensive review of the candidate agents' answers reveals a unanimous agreement on the calculation methodology. The discrepancies in their final lettered choices are due to inconsistencies in the option lists they were given, not from errors in their chemical reasoning.\n\nThe definitive calculation process is as follows:\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of all acidic and basic species.**\nThe foundation of the problem is to determine the amount (in moles) of all reactive species being mixed. The formula for moles is Molarity (mol/L) × Volume (L).\n\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n    0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = **0.050 mol**\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    As a strong acid, HCl dissociates completely in water.\n    0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = **0.080 mol**\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base that dissociates to yield two moles of hydroxide ions (OH⁻) for every mole of the compound.\n    (0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L) × 2 = **0.180 mol**\n\n**Step 2: Determine the limiting and excess reactants after neutralization.**\nThe strong base (OH⁻) will react completely with all available acidic protons from both the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH₃COOH).\n\n*   **Total moles of acid** = (Moles from HCl) + (Moles from CH₃COOH)\n    Total Acid = 0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = **0.130 mol**\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻)** = **0.180 mol**\n*   **Comparison:** Since the moles of base (0.180) are greater than the total moles of acid (0.130), the base is in excess, and the final solution will be strongly basic.\n*   **Excess moles of OH⁻** = (Total moles of base) - (Total moles of acid)\n    Excess OH⁻ = 0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = **0.050 mol**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the concentration of the excess species.**\nThe pH will be determined by the concentration of the excess strong base (OH⁻).\n\n*   **Total Final Volume** = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n*   **Final Concentration of OH⁻, [OH⁻]** = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    [OH⁻] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ **0.04167 M**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the pH from the concentration.**\nBecause the solution has excess hydroxide ions, we must first calculate the pOH and then convert it to pH.\n\n*   **pOH** = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ **1.38**\n*   **pH** = 14 - pOH (at 25 °C)\n    pH = 14 - 1.38 = **12.62**\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Stoichiometry of Ba(OH)₂:** A critical detail is that Barium Hydroxide, Ba(OH)₂, provides **two** moles of OH⁻ ions for every mole of the compound. Forgetting to multiply by two is a common error.\n2.  **Neutralization of All Acids:** When a strong base is present, it will react with all available acidic protons from both the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH₃COOH). For stoichiometric purposes, they should be summed.\n3.  **Using the Total Final Volume:** The final concentration of the excess species must be calculated using the total combined volume of all the solutions mixed together (1.2 L).\n4.  **Distinguishing pOH from pH:** After calculating the excess [OH⁻], the direct result of the -log calculation gives the pOH. The question asks for the pH, which requires the final conversion step: pH = 14 - pOH. Option D (1.38) is the value for the pOH and is a common distractor.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe calculation consistently and robustly yields a final pH of **12.62**. Matching this result to the provided options:\n\nA) 8.92\nB) 12.62\nC) 8.68\nD) 1.38\n\nThe correct answer is **B**.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nThis is a quantitative chemistry problem involving an acid-base neutralization reaction. To find the final pH, a careful stoichiometric analysis is required. All the candidate answers correctly identify the same multi-step process, providing a high degree of confidence in the method. The following is a consolidated, step-by-step breakdown.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of all acidic and basic species.**\nThe foundation of the calculation is to determine the amount (in moles) of each reactant.\n*   **Moles of CH₃COOH (weak acid):**\n    `0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol`\n*   **Moles of H⁺ from HCl (strong acid):**\n    `0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol`\n*   **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**\n    `0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L × 2 = 0.180 mol`\n\n**Step 2: Determine the limiting and excess reactants after neutralization.**\nThe strong base will react completely with all available acidic protons until one side is consumed.\n*   **Total moles of acid** = Moles from HCl + Moles from CH₃COOH\n    `0.080 mol + 0.050 mol = 0.130 mol`\n*   **Total moles of base (OH⁻)** = `0.180 mol`\n*   **Compare reactants:** Since the moles of base (0.180 mol) are greater than the total moles of acid (0.130 mol), the strong base is in excess, and the final solution will be basic.\n*   **Excess moles of OH⁻** = Total moles of base - Total moles of acid\n    `0.180 mol - 0.130 mol = 0.050 mol`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the pH of the final solution.**\nThe pH is dictated by the concentration of the excess strong base.\n*   **Total Final Volume** = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = **1.2 L**\n*   **Final Concentration of OH⁻, [OH⁻]** = Moles of excess OH⁻ / Total Volume\n    `0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M`\n*   **Calculate pOH and then pH:**\n    *   `pOH = -log₁₀([OH⁻]) = -log₁₀(0.04167) ≈ 1.38`\n    *   `pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62`\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\nThis analysis, consistent across all candidate answers, highlights several critical points where errors can occur:\n1.  **Stoichiometry of Ba(OH)₂:** The most crucial detail is that one mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces **two** moles of OH⁻. Forgetting this factor leads to an incorrect answer.\n2.  **Total Acid for Neutralization:** The strong base neutralizes *all* acidic protons, from both the strong acid (HCl) and the weak acid (CH₃COOH). Both must be summed to find the correct total moles of acid.\n3.  **Final Total Volume:** The concentration of the excess species must be calculated using the combined total volume of all three solutions (1.2 L).\n4.  **pH vs. pOH:** After finding the excess [OH⁻], the calculation `-log₁₀([OH⁻])` gives the **pOH**. A very common mistake is to stop here. The question asks for pH, which requires the final conversion: `pH = 14 - pOH`.\n\nThe final calculated pH is **12.62**. Matching this to the options given in the question:\nA) 1.38 (This is the pOH, a common distractor)\nB) 8.92\nC) 12.62\nD) 8.68\n\nThe correct answer is 12.62.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
