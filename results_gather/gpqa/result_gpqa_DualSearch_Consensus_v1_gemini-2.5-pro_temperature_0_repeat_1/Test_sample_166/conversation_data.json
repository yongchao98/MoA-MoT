    "To calculate the amount of non-Gaussianity (nG) in the given Schrödinger cat state, we use the relative entropy measure provided.\n\n**1. Understand the State and Parameters:**\nThe Schrödinger cat state is given by:\n|ψ⟩ = (cos(φ)|α⟩ + sin(φ)|-α⟩) / N\nwith the normalization constant N = √(1 + sin(2φ)exp(-2α²)).\n\nThe specific parameters are:\n*   Amplitude, α = 0.5\n*   Phase, φ = -π/4\n\nFor these parameters, the state simplifies. `sin(2φ) = sin(-π/2) = -1`, so the state becomes an \"odd cat state\".\n\n**2. The Measure of Non-Gaussianity (nG):**\nThe relative entropy measure is given as:\nnG = trace(ρ ln ρ) - trace(τ ln τ)\nwhere ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ| is the density matrix of the cat state, and τ is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.\n\nThis formula can be rewritten as `nG = S(τ) - S(ρ)`, where `S` is the von Neumann entropy.\nSince |ψ⟩ is a pure state, its entropy `S(ρ) = -trace(ρ ln ρ)` is zero.\nTherefore, the non-Gaussianity is simply the entropy of the reference Gaussian state: `nG = S(τ)`.\n\n**3. The Reference Gaussian State (τ):**\nThe reference Gaussian state τ is defined as the Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments as the state ρ.\n\n*   **First Moment (Displacement):** The average displacement `⟨a⟩` for this specific cat state is zero. This means the reference state τ is a zero-mean Gaussian state.\n*   **Second Moments:** A zero-mean Gaussian state is characterized by two moments:\n    *   `N = ⟨a†a⟩`, the mean photon number.\n    *   `M = ⟨a²⟩`, a term related to squeezing.\n\n**4. Calculation:**\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n*   First, we calculate the moments `N` and `M` for the given cat state with α = 0.5 and φ = -π/4.\n    *   The mean photon number is `N = α² * (1 + exp(-2α²)) / (1 - exp(-2α²))`. Plugging in α = 0.5, we get `N ≈ 1.0207`.\n    *   The squeezing moment is `M = α² = 0.25`.\n*   Next, we find the entropy of the Gaussian state τ defined by these moments. The entropy of a single-mode, zero-mean Gaussian state is given by:\n    `S(τ) = (d + 1/2)ln(d + 1/2) - (d - 1/2)ln(d - 1/2)`\n    where `d` is the symplectic eigenvalue of the state's covariance matrix.\n*   The symplectic eigenvalue `d` is related to `N` and `M` by the formula:\n    `d² = (N + 1/2)² - |M|²`\n*   Substituting the calculated values of `N` and `M`:\n    `d² = (1.0207 + 0.5)² - (0.25)²`\n    `d² = (1.5207)² - 0.0625`\n    `d² ≈ 2.3126 - 0.0625 = 2.2501`\n    This gives `d ≈ √2.25 = 1.5`.\n*   Finally, we calculate the entropy `S(τ)` with `d = 1.5`:\n    `S(τ) = (1.5 + 0.5)ln(1.5 + 0.5) - (1.5 - 0.5)ln(1.5 - 0.5)`\n    `S(τ) = 2ln(2) - 1ln(1)`\n    `S(τ) = 2ln(2) - 0`\n    `S(τ) ≈ 2 * 0.6931 = 1.3862`\n\nThe calculated amount of non-Gaussianity is approximately 1.386.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0\nB) 0.25\nC) 2.48\nD) 1.38\n\nThe value 1.38 is the closest to our calculated result of 1.386.\n\n<<<D>>>"
