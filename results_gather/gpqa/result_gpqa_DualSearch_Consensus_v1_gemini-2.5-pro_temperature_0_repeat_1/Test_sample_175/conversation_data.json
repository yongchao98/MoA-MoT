    "To determine the probability of obtaining 0 for the measurement of observable P and subsequently -1 for the measurement of observable Q, we must follow the principles of quantum mechanics for sequential measurements.\n\nFirst, the initial state of the system must be normalized. The given state is:\n|ψ⟩ = `[[-1], [2], [1]]`\n\nThe squared norm of this state is ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.\nThe normalized state, |ψ_norm⟩, is therefore:\n|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/√6) * `[[-1], [2], [1]]`\n\nNext, we find the eigenvector of the operator P that corresponds to the eigenvalue 0. The matrix for P is:\nP = `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0. This gives the eigenvalues λ = 0, 1, and -1. We are interested in the eigenvalue 0. The corresponding eigenvector |v_P=0⟩ is found by solving P|v⟩ = 0|v⟩:\n`[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]` * `[[x], [y], [z]]` = `[[0], [0], [0]]`\nThis leads to the equations y = 0 and x + z = 0. A normalized eigenvector for this case is:\n|v_P=0⟩ = (1/√2) * `[[1], [0], [-1]]`\n\nThe probability of measuring P and obtaining the value 0 is the squared magnitude of the projection of the initial normalized state onto this eigenvector.\nProb(P=0) = |⟨v_P=0|ψ_norm⟩|²\nProb(P=0) = |( (1/√2) * `[[1, 0, -1]]` ) ⋅ ( (1/√6) * `[[-1], [2], [1]]` )|²\nProb(P=0) = |(1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1)|²\nProb(P=0) = |(1/√12) * (-2)|² = |-2/√12|² = |-1/√3|² = 1/3\n\nAfter this measurement, the state of the system collapses to the eigenvector corresponding to the measured eigenvalue. The new state of the system, |ψ'⟩, is:\n|ψ'⟩ = |v_P=0⟩ = (1/√2) * `[[1], [0], [-1]]`\n\nNow, we measure the observable Q. The matrix for Q is:\nQ = `[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\nWe want to find the probability of obtaining the value -1. Since Q is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements (1, 0, -1), and the corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. The normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue -1 is:\n|v_Q=-1⟩ = `[[0], [0], [1]]`\n\nThe probability of measuring Q and obtaining -1, given the system is in the state |ψ'⟩, is:\nProb(Q=-1 after P=0) = |⟨v_Q=-1|ψ'⟩|²\nProb(Q=-1 after P=0) = |( `[[0, 0, 1]]` ) ⋅ ( (1/√2) * `[[1], [0], [-1]]` )|²\nProb(Q=-1 after P=0) = |(1/√2) * (0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1))|²\nProb(Q=-1 after P=0) = |-1/√2|² = 1/2\n\nThe total probability of measuring P=0 and then Q=-1 is the product of the individual probabilities calculated in sequence.\nTotal Probability = Prob(P=0) * Prob(Q=-1 after P=0)\nTotal Probability = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6\n\n<<<B>>>"
