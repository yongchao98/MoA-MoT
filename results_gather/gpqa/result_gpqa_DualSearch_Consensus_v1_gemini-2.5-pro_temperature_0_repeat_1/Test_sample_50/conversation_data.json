    "To determine the net potential energy of the system, we can use the method of image charges. This electrostatic problem can be simplified by replacing the grounded conducting sphere with an \"image\" charge. The electric field outside the sphere is then the superposition of the fields of the original charge and the image charge.\n\n1.  **Image Charge and its Location**: For a point charge `q` located at a distance `d` from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius `R` (where `d > R`), the system can be modeled by placing an image charge, `q'`, inside the sphere.\n    *   The magnitude of the image charge is `q' = -q * (R/d)`.\n    *   The image charge is located at a distance `b = R^2/d` from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the center and the point charge `q`.\n\n2.  **Potential Energy Calculation**: The net potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge `q` from infinity to its position at distance `d`. This work is done against the force exerted by the induced charge on the sphere. A key principle in the method of images is that the potential energy of the interaction between the real charge and the induced surface charge is half the potential energy of the interaction between the real charge and the fictitious image charge.\n\n    The potential energy of interaction between two point charges is given by the formula `U = k * (q1*q2) / r`, where `k` is Coulomb's constant (`1/(4πε₀)`).\n\n3.  **Interaction Energy between the Real and Image Charge**:\n    *   The real charge is `q`.\n    *   The image charge is `q' = -qR/d`.\n    *   The distance between the real charge `q` (at `d`) and the image charge `q'` (at `b = R^2/d`) is `d - b = d - R^2/d = (d^2 - R^2)/d`.\n\n    The potential at the location of the charge `q` due to the image charge `q'` is:\n    `V_image = k * q' / (d - b) = k * (-qR/d) / ((d^2 - R^2)/d)`\n    `V_image = -k * q^2 * R / (d * (d^2 - R^2)/d) = -k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\n4.  **Net Potential Energy of the System**: The potential energy of the system is half the product of the real charge and the potential created by the image charge at the location of the real charge.\n    `U = (1/2) * q * V_image`\n    `U = (1/2) * q * [-k * q * R / (d^2 - R^2)]`\n    `U = - (1/2) * k * q^2 * R / (d^2 - R^2)`\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) U=- kq^2 d/(d^2 -R^2)\nB) U=- (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 +R^2)\nC) U=- (1/2) *kq^2 R/(d^2 -R^2)\nD) U=-(1/2) kq^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2)\n\nThe calculated potential energy matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
