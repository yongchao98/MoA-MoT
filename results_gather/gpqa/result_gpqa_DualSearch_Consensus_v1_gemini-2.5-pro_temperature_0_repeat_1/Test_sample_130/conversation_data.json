    "This is a multi-step chemical puzzle that can be solved by identifying the reactants, predicting the reaction products, and using the principles of 2D NOESY NMR spectroscopy.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Dienophile:** A dicarboxylic acid containing a *cis*-alkene is dehydrated to an anhydride. The ¹H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm (alkene protons), and the ¹³C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm (alkene carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons). This data is a perfect match for **maleic anhydride**. The *cis* configuration is necessary to form the cyclic anhydride.\n    *   **Diene:** The problem explicitly names **1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction and Products:**\n    *   The reaction between a diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This [4+2] cycloaddition forms a bicyclic compound.\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction can produce two stereoisomers: the *endo* and the *exo* product.\n    *   According to the \"endo rule,\" the major product of a kinetically controlled Diels-Alder reaction is typically the **endo isomer**. This is because of a stabilizing secondary orbital overlap in the transition state. The minor product is the **exo isomer**.\n    *   The molecular formula of the product is C₁₃H₁₆O₃ (C₉H₁₄ from the diene + C₄H₂O₃ from the anhydride), which matches the information given.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of the Major (Endo) and Minor (Exo) Products:**\n    *   **Endo Product (Major):** In this isomer, the anhydride portion of the molecule is tucked \"under\" the newly formed six-membered ring, on the same side as the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Exo Product (Minor):** In this isomer, the anhydride portion points \"away\" from the carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n4.  **Apply NOESY Spectroscopy Principles:**\n    *   NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) is a 2D NMR technique that shows cross-peaks between protons that are close to each other in space (typically < 5 Å), even if they are not connected by chemical bonds.\n    *   The problem states a cross-peak is present in the major product's spectrum but absent in the minor product's spectrum. We need to find a pair of protons that are close in the *endo* isomer but far apart in the *exo* isomer.\n\n5.  **Correlate Structure with NMR Data and NOESY Cross-Peaks:**\n    *   Let's identify the key protons in the product and their expected NMR signals. Due to a plane of symmetry in the product, we expect:\n        *   **Anhydride Protons:** Two equivalent protons on the five-membered anhydride ring. They are adjacent to carbonyl groups and part of a strained ring system, so their signal will be downfield. This corresponds to the **2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**.\n        *   **Vinyl Methyl Protons:** The four methyl groups are no longer all equivalent. The two methyl groups attached to the remaining double bond are equivalent to each other. This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm**.\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyl Protons:** The two methyl groups on the saturated bridgehead carbons are also equivalent to each other. Being on saturated carbons, they are more shielded (upfield). This corresponds to the **6H singlet at ~1 ppm**.\n        *   **Bridge Protons:** The two protons on the CH₂ bridge are not equivalent and would appear as two 1H signals, likely doublets. One is mentioned as a **1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**.\n\n    *   Now, let's examine the spatial relationships:\n        *   **In the Major (Endo) Product:** The anhydride protons (2H at ~3.5 ppm) are tucked underneath the bicyclic system. This position brings them very close to the vinyl methyl groups (6H at ~1.7 ppm) which are also on the \"bottom\" face of the molecule.\n        *   **In the Minor (Exo) Product:** The anhydride protons are on the \"top\" face of the molecule, pointing away from the vinyl methyl groups. The distance between them is large.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** A strong NOESY cross-peak between the anhydride protons and the vinyl methyl protons is expected for the major (*endo*) product, while this cross-peak would be absent or very weak for the minor (*exo*) product. This perfectly matches the experimental observation described in the problem.\n\nThe two resonances connected by this cross-peak are therefore the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (vinyl methyls) and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (anhydride protons).\n\n<<<B>>>"
