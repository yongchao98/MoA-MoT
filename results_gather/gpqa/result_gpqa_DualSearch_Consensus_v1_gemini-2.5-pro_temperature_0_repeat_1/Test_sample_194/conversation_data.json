    "To determine the maximum orbital period of the second planet, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Establish the Transit Condition:** A planet exhibits a transit when it passes in front of its star from our line of sight. The maximum possible orbital distance for a transit to occur is when the planet's center passes exactly over the star's edge. This corresponds to a maximum impact parameter (the projected distance between the planet's and star's centers, normalized by the star's radius) of `b_max = 1`.\n\n2.  **Relate the Two Planets:** Both planets are in the same system and share the same orbital plane, meaning they have the same orbital inclination (`i`) relative to us. The impact parameter `b` is given by the formula `b = (a * cos(i)) / R_s`, where `a` is the semi-major axis (orbital radius for a circular orbit) and `R_s` is the star's radius. Since `i` and `R_s` are the same for both planets, the ratio of their impact parameters is equal to the ratio of their orbital radii:\n    `a₂ / a₁ = b₂ / b₁`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Maximum Orbital Radius Ratio:** We are given that the first planet has an impact parameter `b₁ = 0.2`. For the second planet, the maximum impact parameter for a transit to occur is `b₂_max = 1`. Therefore, the maximum ratio of their orbital radii is:\n    `a₂_max / a₁ = 1 / 0.2 = 5`\n\n4.  **Apply Kepler's Third Law:** Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (`P`) is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`a`). For two planets orbiting the same star, this can be written as:\n    `(P₂ / P₁)² = (a₂ / a₁ )³`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Maximum Period:** We can now find the maximum period for the second planet (`P₂_max`) using its initial period (`P₁ = 3` days) and the maximum ratio of the orbital radii we found.\n    *   `P₂_max = P₁ * (a₂_max / a₁)^(3/2)`\n    *   `P₂_max = 3 * (5)^(3/2)`\n    *   `P₂_max = 3 * 5 * sqrt(5)`\n    *   `P₂_max ≈ 3 * 5 * 2.236`\n    *   `P₂_max ≈ 33.54` days\n\nThe calculation shows that the maximum orbital period for the second planet to still transit its star is approximately 33.5 days. The radii of the planets themselves are not needed for this specific calculation, as the limiting condition is based on the transit of the planet's center.\n\n<<<B>>>"
