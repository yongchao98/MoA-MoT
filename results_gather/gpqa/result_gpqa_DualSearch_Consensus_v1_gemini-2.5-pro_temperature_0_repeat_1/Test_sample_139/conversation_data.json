    "The evidence confirms the initial deductions. Here is a step-by-step derivation of the final answer based on the clues and the search results.\n\n*   **Identification of Substance X and related compounds:**\n    *   **Clue:** Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry, particularly for reactions involving keto acids.\n    *   **Inference:** This points to a reducing agent. Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄) is a powerful reducing agent used to reduce carboxylic acids and ketones. Its deuterated analog is Lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD₄).\n    *   **Clue:** Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.\n    *   **Inference:** LiAlD₄ contains deuterium (D or ²H), a heavier isotope of hydrogen. This fits the description, making **Substance X = LiAlD₄**. Its common analog is LiAlH₄.\n    *   **Clue:** The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.\n    *   **Inference:** LiAlD₄ reduces both the ketone and carboxylic acid groups of a keto acid to alcohols. The resulting product is a diol, which contains two oxygen atoms. This is consistent with the properties of LiAlH₄ and by extension, LiAlD₄.\n\n*   **Identification of the reaction components (Y, W, G, B):**\n    *   **Clue:** Substance X (LiAlD₄) reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W.\n    *   **Inference:** LiAlD₄ reacts violently with water. If liquid Y is heavy water (D₂O), the reaction would be: LiAlD₄ + 4D₂O → LiOD + Al(OD)₃ + 4D₂.\n    *   **Clue:** Gas W's molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons.\n    *   **Inference:** The gas produced in the proposed reaction is D₂ (deuterium gas). A deuterium atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Therefore, a D₂ molecule has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the description. This confirms **Gas W = D₂** and **Liquid Y = D₂O**.\n    *   **Clue:** A precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B.\n    *   **Inference:** In the reaction products (LiOD and Al(OD)₃), aluminum hydroxide is a known precipitate, so Al(OD)₃ is the precipitate G. Heating aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)₃) yields alumina (Al₂O₃) and water (H₂O). Therefore, heating G (Al(OD)₃) will release B (D₂O).\n    *   **Clue:** The melting point of B is very close to 277 K.\n    *   **Inference:** The melting point of heavy water (D₂O) is 3.82 °C, which is 276.97 K. This is indeed very close to 277 K, confirming that **B = D₂O**.\n\n*   **Calculation of Cumulative Atomic Masses:**\n    *   **Substance X:** LiAlD₄\n    *   **Constituent Elements:** Lithium (Li), Aluminum (Al), and Hydrogen (as Deuterium, D).\n    *   **Lightest Element:** Hydrogen (Atomic Number 1).\n    *   **Heaviest Element:** Aluminum (Atomic Number 13).\n    *   **Isotopes present in LiAlD₄:**\n        *   For Hydrogen: Four atoms of the heavier isotope, Deuterium (D). The mass number of Deuterium is 2 (1 proton, 1 neutron).\n        *   For Aluminum: One atom. The only naturally occurring stable isotope is ²⁷Al (13 protons, 14 neutrons).\n        *   For Lithium: One atom. Naturally occurring lithium is a mix of ⁶Li and ⁷Li. We will use the most common isotope, ⁷Li, for identification, but it is not needed for the final calculation.\n    *   **The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present.** This means summing the masses of all aluminum atoms and all deuterium atoms in the molecule.\n    *   **Mass from the lightest element (Hydrogen):** There are 4 atoms of Deuterium (D). Using the mass number, the total mass is 4 × 2 = 8.\n    *   **Mass from the heaviest element (Aluminum):** There is 1 atom of Aluminum (²⁷Al). The mass number is 27.\n    *   **Cumulative Atomic Mass:** 8 (from Deuterium) + 27 (from Aluminum) = 35.\n\nThis corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
