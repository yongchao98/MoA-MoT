    "Here is a step-by-step solution to determine the velocity of particle A.\n\n### 1. Conservation of Energy\n\nThe process begins with a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) annihilating each other. The problem states that the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which implies its kinetic energy is negligible. We can assume both the proton and antiproton are effectively at rest before annihilation.\n\nThe total initial energy ($E_{initial}$) is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton. According to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence principle, $E = mc^2$.\n\nThe rest mass energy of a proton is approximately 938 MeV. The CODATA value provides a more precise figure of 938.272 MeV. Since a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass, the antiproton also has a rest mass energy of 938.272 MeV.\n\n$E_{initial} = E_{proton} + E_{antiproton}$\n$E_{initial} = 938.272 \\text{ MeV} + 938.272 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.544 \\text{ MeV}$\n\nThis initial energy is conserved and converted into the four resulting particles ($2A^{+}$ and $2A^{-}$).\n\n### 2. Energy of the Final Particles\n\nThe final state consists of four particles of type A, each with a rest mass energy ($m_A c^2$) of 300 MeV. The total initial energy is distributed equally among these four particles.\n\nThe total energy of a single moving particle A ($E_A$) is given by the relativistic energy equation:\n$E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\nWhere $\\gamma$ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$.\n\nThe total final energy ($E_{final}$) is:\n$E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n\n### 3. Calculating the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)\n\nBy the principle of conservation of energy, $E_{initial} = E_{final}$:\n$1876.544 \\text{ MeV} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV})$\n$1876.544 = 1200 \\gamma$\n\nNow, we solve for $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876.544}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n### 4. Calculating the Velocity (v)\n\nThe final step is to calculate the velocity (v) from the Lorentz factor ($\\gamma$).\n\nStarting with the definition of $\\gamma$:\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$\n\nWe rearrange the formula to solve for $v/c$ (often denoted as $\\beta$):\n$\\gamma^2 = \\frac{1}{1 - (v/c)^2}$\n$1 - (v/c)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$(v/c)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nNow, substitute the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089}$\n$v/c = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n$v/c \\approx 0.7688$\n\nTherefore, the velocity of particle A is approximately $0.77c$.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.86c\nB) 0.96c\nC) 0.77c\nD) 0.91c\n\nThe calculated velocity matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
