    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the quantum mechanics problem.\n\n### 1. Normalization of the State\n\nFirst, we need to normalize the given state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. A quantum state must be normalized, meaning the total probability of finding the particle in any possible state is 1.\n\nLet the normalized state be |α⟩ = C * [(1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩]. The normalization condition is ⟨α|α⟩ = 1.\n\nThe complex conjugate of the state, ⟨α|, is C* * [⟨up|(1-i) + ⟨down|(2+i)].\n\nSo, ⟨α|α⟩ = |C|² * [(1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i)] = 1.\n|C|² * [(1 - i²) + (4 - i²)] = 1\n|C|² * [(1 + 1) + (4 + 1)] = 1\n|C|² * (2 + 5) = 1\n|C|² * 7 = 1\nC = 1/√7\n\nThus, the normalized state is:\n|α⟩ = (1/√7) * [(1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩]\n\nIn vector notation, where |up⟩ =ᵀ and |down⟩ =ᵀ, the state is:\n|α⟩ = (1/√7) * [ 1+i, 2-i ]ᵀ\n\n### 2. Eigenstates and Eigenvalues of the Operator A\n\nThe operator A is given by the matrix elements Aij = ħ/2 for i ≠ j and Aij = 0 for i = j. For a two-state system, this gives the matrix:\nA = (ħ/2) * [,]\n\nTo find the eigenvalues (λ), we solve the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0.\ndet([[ -λ, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, -λ ]]) = λ² - (ħ/2)² = 0\nThis gives two eigenvalues: λ₁ = +ħ/2 and λ₂ = -ħ/2.\n\nNext, we find the corresponding normalized eigenvectors.\n\n*   **For λ₁ = +ħ/2:**\n    (A - λ₁I)v₁ = 0  => [[-ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -ħ/2]] * [x, y]ᵀ =ᵀ\n    This implies -x + y = 0, or x = y. The normalized eigenvector is |a₁⟩ = (1/√2) *ᵀ = (1/√2)(|up⟩ + |down⟩).\n\n*   **For λ₂ = -ħ/2:**\n    (A - λ₂I)v₂ = 0  => [[ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, ħ/2]] * [x, y]ᵀ =ᵀ\n    This implies x + y = 0, or x = -y. The normalized eigenvector is |a₂⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, -1]ᵀ = (1/√2)(|up⟩ - |down⟩).\n\n### 3. Probabilities of Measurement\n\nThe probability of measuring an eigenvalue λᵢ is given by the square of the magnitude of the inner product of the corresponding eigenstate |aᵢ⟩ with the state |α⟩, i.e., P(λᵢ) = |⟨aᵢ|α⟩|².\n\n*   **Probability for λ₁ = +ħ/2:**\n    ⟨a₁|α⟩ = [(1/√2)(⟨up| + ⟨down|)] * [(1/√7)((1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩)]\n    ⟨a₁|α⟩ = (1/√14) * [(1+i) + (2-i)] = 3/√14\n    P(λ₁) = |3/√14|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.643\n\n*   **Probability for λ₂ = -ħ/2:**\n    ⟨a₂|α⟩ = [(1/√2)(⟨up| - ⟨down|)] * [(1/√7)((1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩)]\n    ⟨a₂|α⟩ = (1/√14) * [(1+i) - (2-i)] = (-1 + 2i)/√14\n    P(λ₂) = |(-1 + 2i)/√14|² = ((-1)² + 2²)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357\n\nThe probabilities of measuring the particle in the two eigenstates are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\n### 4. Average Value of the Operator\n\nThe average or expectation value of the operator A can be calculated in two ways.\n\n*   **Method 1: Using eigenvalues and probabilities**\n    ⟨A⟩ = Σᵢ P(λᵢ)λᵢ\n    ⟨A⟩ = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2)\n    ⟨A⟩ = (ħ/28) * (9 - 5) = 4ħ/28 = ħ/7\n\n*   **Method 2: Using the state vector**\n    ⟨A⟩ = ⟨α|A|α⟩\n    A|α⟩ = (ħ/2) * [,] * (1/√7) * [1+i, 2-i]ᵀ = (ħ/(2√7)) * [2-i, 1+i]ᵀ\n    ⟨α|A|α⟩ = (1/√7) * [1-i, 2+i] * (ħ/(2√7)) * [2-i, 1+i]ᵀ\n    ⟨A⟩ = (ħ/14) * [(1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i)]\n    ⟨A⟩ = (ħ/14) * [(2 - 3i - 1) + (2 + 3i - 1)]\n    ⟨A⟩ = (ħ/14) * [1 - 3i + 1 + 3i] = 2ħ/14 = ħ/7\n\nBoth methods yield the same average value: ħ/7.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of the operator is ħ/7. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
