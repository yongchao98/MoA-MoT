    "To determine the correct option, we must analyze the tautomerism of benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, and the optical isomerism of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.\n\n### Part A: Tautomerism\n\nTautomerism is a chemical equilibrium between two isomers that readily interconvert. The most common form is keto-enol tautomerism, which requires the presence of a hydrogen atom on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group (an alpha-hydrogen).\n\n*   **Benzoquinone**: The structure of p-benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups within a six-membered ring containing two carbon-carbon double bonds. The carbon atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of these double bonds (sp² hybridized) and do not have the required alpha-hydrogens on a saturated carbon. While hydrogens are present on the ring, their migration would lead to a highly unstable structure. Therefore, benzoquinone does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.\n\n*   **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three ketone groups and alpha-hydrogens on the carbon atoms situated between them. It can undergo keto-enol tautomerism to form its enol, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol). This enol form is particularly stable because it is aromatic, which strongly favors the tautomerization process.\n\nThus, the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) is **benzoquinone**.\n\n### Part B: Optical Isomerism\n\nOptical isomerism occurs in chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. A common feature of chiral molecules is the presence of a chiral center, typically a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n*   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This molecule, also known as methyl lactate, has a central carbon atom (at position 2) that is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). This carbon is a chiral center, meaning the molecule is chiral and will exhibit optical isomerism, existing as two enantiomers (L and D forms).\n\n*   **Dimethyl fumarate**: This is the methyl ester of fumaric acid, with the chemical name dimethyl (E)-but-2-enedioate. It is a planar molecule with a carbon-carbon double bond in the *trans* configuration. It does not contain any chiral centers and possesses a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is not a chiral molecule and does not show optical isomerism.\n\nThus, the compound that will show optical isomerism (B) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   **A** (does not show tautomerism) is **benzoquinone**.\n*   **B** (shows optical isomerism) is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
