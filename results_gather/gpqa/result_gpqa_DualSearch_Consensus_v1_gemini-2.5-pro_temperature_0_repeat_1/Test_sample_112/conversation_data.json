    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the chemical formula of the unknown compound.\n\n### Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data\n\n1.  **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid. The significant broadness is due to hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ falls within the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This, combined with the broad O-H peak, strongly suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group.\n    *   Another strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the compound is unsaturated.\n\n2.  **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens confirms the presence of a C=C double bond. Vinyl hydrogens are those directly attached to the carbon atoms of a double bond.\n\n3.  **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A fragment peak at a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 45 is a common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids, corresponding to the [COOH]⁺ ion.\n\n### Evaluating the Chemical Formulas\n\nThe combined spectral data indicate that the unknown compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. This means it must contain at least one C=C double bond and a -COOH group.\n\nTo assess the given options, we can calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for each molecular formula. The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. A C=C double bond and a C=O double bond each contribute one degree of unsaturation. Therefore, an unsaturated carboxylic acid must have a DoU of at least 2.\n\nThe formula for the Degree of Unsaturation is:\n`DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)` (for formulas with C, H, and O).\n\n*   **A) C₆H₁₀O:** This formula contains only one oxygen atom, which is inconsistent with a carboxylic acid (-COOH) that has two oxygen atoms.\n*   **B) C₆H₁₂O₂:** The DoU is 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This DoU of 1 corresponds to a saturated carboxylic acid (only the C=O double bond), which contradicts the ¹H NMR and FTIR data showing a C=C double bond.\n*   **C) C₆H₁₂O:** This formula has only one oxygen atom and is also inconsistent with a carboxylic acid.\n*   **D) C₆H₁₀O₂:** The DoU is 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. This value is consistent with a molecule containing one C=C double bond and one C=O double bond (from the carboxylic acid group). This formula fits all the spectral evidence.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data all point towards an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The only molecular formula that contains two oxygen atoms (necessary for a carboxylic acid) and has a degree of unsaturation of 2 (accounting for both a C=C and a C=O double bond) is C₆H₁₀O₂.\n\n<<<D>>>"
