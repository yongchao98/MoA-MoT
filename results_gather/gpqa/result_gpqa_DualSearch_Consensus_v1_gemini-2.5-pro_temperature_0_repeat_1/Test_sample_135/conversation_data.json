    "To evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field **f**(r), we can employ two primary methods: direct calculation of the divergence followed by integration, or the application of the Divergence Theorem.\n\nThe vector field is given by **f**(r) = (1/r²) **r̂**, where **r̂** is the unit vector in the radial direction. This field is directed radially outward from the origin, and its magnitude decreases as the square of the distance from the origin.\n\n### Method 1: Direct Calculation of the Divergence\n\nIn spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field **F** = F_r **r̂** + F_θ **θ̂** + F_φ **φ̂** is given by:\n\n∇ ⋅ **F** = (1/r²) ∂(r² F_r)/∂r + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂(sinθ F_θ)/∂θ + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂F_φ/∂φ.\n\nFor the given vector field **f**(r), the components are F_r = 1/r², and F_θ = F_φ = 0. Substituting these into the divergence formula, we get:\n\n∇ ⋅ **f** = (1/r²) ∂(r² * (1/r²))/∂r = (1/r²) ∂(1)/∂r = 0.\n\nThis calculation shows that the divergence of the field is zero for any point where r is not zero. However, at the origin (r=0), the vector field itself is singular, and the divergence is undefined. This singularity at the origin is crucial. A more rigorous calculation involving distribution theory would show that the divergence of this field is a Dirac delta function at the origin, specifically 4πδ(r). The volume integral of this delta function over any volume containing the origin is 4π.\n\n### Method 2: Using the Divergence Theorem\n\nThe Divergence Theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume V is equal to the surface integral of the field over the closed surface S that encloses the volume V:\n\n∫_V (∇ ⋅ **f**) dV = ∮_S (**f** ⋅ **n**) dS.\n\nHere, S is the surface of the sphere of radius R, and **n** is the outward-pointing unit normal vector. For a sphere centered at the origin, the outward normal vector is simply the radial unit vector, **n** = **r̂**.\n\nThe dot product **f** ⋅ **n** on the surface of the sphere (where r = R) is:\n\n**f**(R) ⋅ **r̂** = (1/R²) **r̂** ⋅ **r̂** = 1/R²\n\nThe surface integral is therefore:\n\n∮_S (1/R²) dS = (1/R²) ∮_S dS\n\nThe integral ∮_S dS is simply the total surface area of the sphere, which is 4πR².\n\nSo, the surface integral is:\n\n(1/R²) * (4πR²) = 4π.\n\nAccording to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence of the field is equal to this surface integral. The presence of the singularity at the origin means that while the divergence is zero almost everywhere, its integral over the volume containing the singularity is non-zero. The Divergence Theorem provides a way to calculate this integral by examining the flux through the boundary surface.\n\nBoth methods, when accounting for the singularity at the origin, lead to the same result. The volume integral of the divergence of the given vector field within a sphere of radius R centered at the origin is 4π.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
