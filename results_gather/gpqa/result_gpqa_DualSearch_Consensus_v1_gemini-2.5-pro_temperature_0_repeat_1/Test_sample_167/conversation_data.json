    "All four of the listed issues are widely recognized as common sources of difficult-to-spot errors in genomics data analysis.\n\n*   **Mutually incompatible data formats:** Bioinformatics tools often rely on specialized file formats that may lack formal, universally accepted specifications. This ambiguity can lead to problems with how different tools handle inputs and outputs, potentially causing undetected errors in scientific results. One study that tested 80 software packages for their ability to correctly parse the BED format found that 75 of them achieved less than 70% correctness, highlighting the prevalence of this issue.\n\n*   **The \"chr\" / \"no chr\" confusion:** A lack of standardization in chromosome naming conventions is a persistent and irritating problem. For instance, databases like UCSC use the \"chr\" prefix (e.g., \"chr1\"), while others like Ensembl do not (e.g., \"1\"). This seemingly simple difference can cause tools to fail or, more insidiously, lead to incorrect data interpretation if not properly handled.\n\n*   **Reference assembly mismatch:** Using an incorrect or outdated reference genome assembly is a critical error that can invalidate an entire analysis. Aligning sequencing reads to the wrong assembly version (e.g., hg19 instead of hg38 for human data) leads to incorrect mapping and flawed downstream analyses like variant calling. Furthermore, even the correct reference genomes can contain errors like falsely duplicated or collapsed regions, which introduce their own set of analytical artifacts.\n\n*   **Incorrect ID conversion:** The automatic conversion of gene symbols into dates or numbers by spreadsheet software is a well-documented and surprisingly common error. For example, a gene named \"MARCH1\" can be converted to the date \"1-Mar,\" and RIKEN identifiers can be turned into floating-point numbers. These changes can be irreversible and lead to the inadvertent loss of data, contaminating even carefully curated public databases. Studies have shown this problem is widespread, affecting a significant percentage of scientific papers that include supplementary gene lists in Excel.\n\nSince all four issues are well-documented, common, and lead to errors that can be difficult to detect, they are all significant sources of erroneous results in genomics data analysis.\n\n<<<C>>>"
