    "To determine the total energy of the Lithium-6 nucleus, we can follow these steps:\n\n**1. Identify the Nucleus and its Properties:**\nThe nucleus X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons.\n*   Lithium has an atomic number (Z) of 3, which means it has 3 protons.\n*   With 3 neutrons (N), the mass number (A) is Z + N = 3 + 3 = 6.\n*   Therefore, the nucleus is Lithium-6 (⁶Li).\n\n**2. Determine the Rest Mass of the Nucleus:**\nThe total energy calculation requires the rest mass of the nucleus. We can find this by taking the atomic mass of a ⁶Li atom and subtracting the mass of its three electrons.\n\n*   The atomic mass of a ⁶Li atom is approximately 6.0151223 amu (atomic mass units).\n*   The mass of a single electron is about 0.00054858 amu.\n*   The total mass of three electrons is 3 * 0.00054858 amu = 0.00164574 amu.\n*   The rest mass of the ⁶Li nucleus is therefore: 6.0151223 amu - 0.00164574 amu = 6.01347656 amu.\n\n**3. Calculate the Rest Energy (E₀):**\nThe rest energy is given by Einstein's equation, E₀ = m₀c². We need to convert the mass from atomic mass units (amu) to energy units (GeV). The conversion factor is 1 amu ≈ 0.931494 GeV/c².\n\n*   Rest Energy (E₀) = 6.01347656 amu * 0.931494 GeV/c²\n*   E₀ ≈ 5.60150 GeV\n\n**4. Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\nThe Lorentz factor depends on the velocity (v) of the nucleus, which is given as 0.96c (where c is the speed of light).\n\n*   The formula for the Lorentz factor is: γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n*   Given v = 0.96c, the ratio v/c is 0.96.\n*   γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.96²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / √(0.0784)\n*   γ = 1 / 0.28\n*   γ ≈ 3.571428\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Relativistic Energy (E):**\nThe total energy is the product of the Lorentz factor and the rest energy.\n\n*   E = γ * E₀\n*   E ≈ 3.571428 * 5.60150 GeV\n*   E ≈ 20.0053 GeV\n\nThis value is closest to 20.132 GeV. The minor discrepancy can arise from using slightly different values for physical constants. Let's re-evaluate using the binding energy provided in one of the search results, which can be a more direct way to get the nuclear rest energy.\n\n*   The binding energy of ⁶Li is 31994.564 keV. This is equivalent to 0.031994564 GeV.\n*   The mass of 3 protons is 3 * 1.007276 amu ≈ 3.021828 amu.\n*   The mass of 3 neutrons is 3 * 1.008665 amu ≈ 3.025995 amu.\n*   Total mass of constituents = 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 amu.\n*   Converting this to energy: 6.047823 amu * 0.931494 GeV/amu ≈ 5.6333 GeV.\n*   The rest energy of the nucleus is the energy of its constituents minus the binding energy: 5.6333 GeV - 0.03199 GeV ≈ 5.6013 GeV.\n*   Total Energy E = γ * E₀ ≈ 3.571428 * 5.6013 GeV ≈ 20.0046 GeV.\n\nBoth calculations yield a result very close to 20.0 GeV. Given the options, 20.132 GeV is the most plausible answer, with the difference likely attributable to the precision of the constants used in the problem's original formulation.\n\nFinal check of the calculation:\nE = (1/√(1-0.96²)) * (6.01347656 * 0.931494) GeV ≈ 20.005 GeV.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, option C is the closest.\n\n<<<C>>>"
