    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the observations to determine the most likely explanation:\n\n1.  **Analyze the 1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Two peaks for one alpha-proton:** The alpha-proton is a single proton, so observing two distinct peaks for it (that are not due to spin-spin coupling) indicates that this proton exists in two different chemical environments.\n    *   **Similar chemical shifts:** This suggests the two environments are structurally very similar, which is consistent with isomers.\n    *   **Roughly equal integrals (summing to 1H):** This implies that the two different species are present in approximately a 1:1 ratio.\n\n2.  **Analyze the LC-MS Data:**\n    *   **Two clearly defined peaks at elevated temperature:** The liquid chromatography (LC) is separating the crude compound into two distinct components. The fact that the peaks are still separate at an elevated temperature suggests that these are stable, non-interconverting (or slowly interconverting) species under these conditions.\n    *   **Equal intensities:** This confirms the 1:1 ratio of the two species observed in the NMR.\n    *   **Same mass spectrum for both peaks:** The mass spectrometry (MS) data shows that both separated components have the same mass. This is a critical piece of information, as it rules out impurities with different molecular weights (like a precursor). The mass being consistent with the expected molecule confirms we are looking at isomers of the target peptide.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n\n    *   **A) The compound is contaminated with a precursor:** This is unlikely. A precursor would almost certainly have a different molecular weight and therefore a different mass spectrum. The data shows both peaks have the same mass.\n\n    *   **B) The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers:** Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. They have identical physical and chemical properties in an achiral environment. Therefore, they cannot be distinguished by standard 1H NMR (they would show a single set of peaks) or separated by a standard (achiral) LC column (they would elute as a single peak). This contradicts the observation of two peaks in both the NMR and LC.\n\n    *   **C) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers:** Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They have different physical properties and are chemically distinct.\n        *   **In NMR:** Because they are different compounds, their corresponding protons will have different chemical shifts, even in a standard achiral solvent. This explains the two peaks for the alpha-proton.\n        *   **In LC-MS:** Because they have different physical properties, they can be separated by standard chromatography techniques like HPLC. This explains the two peaks in the chromatogram. Since they are isomers, they have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass, which explains why both peaks give the same mass spectrum.\n        *   **Origin in Peptide Synthesis:** A mixture of diastereomers can easily arise during chemical peptide synthesis if one of the chiral amino acid building blocks undergoes racemization (loss of stereochemical purity) at its alpha-carbon. If the peptide contains other chiral centers, this will result in the formation of a pair of diastereomers. Another possibility is the formation of stable atropisomers (a type of diastereomer) due to hindered rotation around an amide bond, which is particularly common with proline residues.\n\n    *   **D) 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction:** This is not a recognized or standard term in chemistry to describe this phenomenon. The observations are classic indicators of isomerism. This option is chemically imprecise and does not provide a plausible explanation for the presence of two stable, separable compounds of the same mass.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to the presence of a mixture of two diastereomers in a roughly 1:1 ratio. They are isomers (same mass), but their different spatial arrangements make them distinct compounds that can be resolved by both NMR and LC.\n\n<<<C>>>"
