    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the major isomer of product 3.\n\n**Step 1: Cyclooctatetraene heated with maleic anhydride (1:1) → Product 1**\n\n*   Cyclooctatetraene (COT) exists in a non-planar \"tub\" conformation. To participate in a Diels-Alder reaction, it must be planar. However, COT does not react directly. Instead, it first undergoes a thermal electrocyclic ring closure to form its valence isomer, bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene.\n*   This isomer contains a 1,3-cyclohexadiene unit, which is a reactive diene.\n*   The diene (bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene) then reacts with the dienophile (maleic anhydride) in a [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition.\n*   According to the Alder-endo rule, Diels-Alder reactions kinetically favor the *endo* product due to stabilizing secondary orbital interactions between the diene's π-system and the dienophile's electron-withdrawing groups.\n*   Therefore, Product 1 is the *endo* adduct.\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with methanol and sulfuric acid → Product 2**\n\n*   This reaction is a Fischer esterification. The acid catalyst (H₂SO₄) protonates the anhydride, and the nucleophilic methanol attacks the carbonyl carbons, leading to the opening of the anhydride ring.\n*   The result is the formation of a dimethyl dicarboxylate, where the two ester groups (-COOCH₃) replace the anhydride functional group.\n*   This reaction does not alter the stereochemistry of the carbon skeleton. Product 2 retains the *endo* configuration of the newly formed ester groups.\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 heated with cyclopentadiene → Product 3**\n\n*   This is a second Diels-Alder reaction. Product 2 acts as the dienophile, using the double bond within its bicyclo[2.2.2]octene framework. Cyclopentadiene is a highly reactive diene.\n*   The stereochemical outcome of this step is determined by the direction of approach of the cyclopentadiene to the dienophile (Product 2).\n*   Product 2 is a bulky molecule. The cyclopentadiene will approach from the sterically less hindered face of the double bond. This is the face *opposite* to the existing ester groups and the cyclobutene ring, known as the *exo* face.\n*   Therefore, the major product (Product 3) results from the *exo* addition of cyclopentadiene. In the resulting structure, the methano bridge (from cyclopentadiene) and the ethano-dicarboxylate bridge are on opposite sides (*trans*) of the central six-membered ring.\n\n**Analysis of the Options**\n\nWe need to identify the option whose structure corresponds to the product of an initial *endo* Diels-Alder reaction followed by a second *exo* Diels-Alder reaction. This requires examining the relative stereochemistry described by the IUPAC names and SMILES strings.\n\n*   The key feature of the major product is that the methano bridge (formed from cyclopentadiene in step 3) is *trans* (on the opposite side) to the dicarboxylate groups.\n\nLet's analyze the provided SMILES strings:\n\n*   **Structure A:** A detailed look at this structure shows that the methano bridge and the dicarboxylate groups are on the same side (*syn* or *cis*) of the main ring system. This would be the result of a sterically hindered *endo* attack in the second step, making it a minor product.\n*   **Structure D:** `O=C(OC)[C@@H]1[C@@H](C=C2)[C@@H]3[C@@H]([C@@H]4[C@H]3[C@H]5C=C[C@@H]4C5)[C@@H]2[C@H]1C(OC)=O`. Analysis of this structure reveals that the methano bridge and the dicarboxylate groups are on opposite sides (*anti* or *trans*) of the central ring. This is consistent with the expected product from the sterically favored *exo* attack in the second Diels-Alder reaction. The stereochemistry of the ester groups is also consistent with the initial *endo* addition.\n\nBased on this analysis, Structure D represents the major isomer formed.\n\n<<<D>>>"
