    "To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph, we must evaluate each star based on two criteria: its visibility from the Paranal Observatory and whether its brightness allows for a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of at least 10 in a one-hour exposure.\n\n**1. ESPRESSO's Detection Limit:**\nThe official documentation for ESPRESSO indicates that when coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes, it can achieve a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 for a star with an apparent visual magnitude (V) of 16 during a one-hour exposure. Therefore, any star with an apparent magnitude of 16 or brighter (i.e., V ≤ 16) is considered detectable in terms of brightness.\n\n**2. Visibility from Paranal Observatory:**\nThe Paranal Observatory is located in the Atacama Desert in Chile at a latitude of approximately 24.6 degrees south. This southern location limits the visibility of stars in the northern celestial sky. A star's declination (its celestial latitude) is a key factor. Polaris, the North Star, has a declination of about +89 degrees. Due to its extreme northern declination, Polaris is not visible from the Southern Hemisphere and therefore cannot be observed by the VLT at Paranal.\n\nNow, let's assess each star:\n\n*   **a) Canopus:** This is the second-brightest star in the night sky, with a very bright apparent magnitude of -0.74. Its declination is -52° 41', placing it in the southern celestial hemisphere.\n    *   **Magnitude Check:** -0.74 is much brighter than the V=16 limit.\n    *   **Visibility Check:** Its southern declination makes it easily observable from Paranal.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Detectable.\n\n*   **b) Polaris:** The North Star has an apparent magnitude that fluctuates around 1.98. Its declination is approximately +89° 15'.\n    *   **Magnitude Check:** 1.98 is brighter than the V=16 limit.\n    *   **Visibility Check:** Its declination of +89° makes it impossible to see from Paranal's southern latitude.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not detectable.\n\n*   **c) Star at 10 pc:** An object with an absolute magnitude (M) of 15 at a distance (d) of 10 parsecs has an apparent magnitude (m) equal to its absolute magnitude. The formula is m = M + 5*log10(d/10), which gives m = 15 + 5*log10(1) = 15. Its declination is 0°, on the celestial equator.\n    *   **Magnitude Check:** V=15 is brighter than the V=16 limit.\n    *   **Visibility Check:** A declination of 0° is easily observable from Paranal.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Detectable.\n\n*   **d) Star at 200 pc:** With an absolute magnitude of 15 and a distance of 200 parsecs, the apparent magnitude is m = 15 + 5*log10(200/10) = 15 + 5*log10(20) ≈ 21.5. Its declination is 0°.\n    *   **Magnitude Check:** V≈21.5 is much fainter than the V=16 limit.\n    *   **Visibility Check:** A declination of 0° is observable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not detectable.\n\n*   **e) Star at 5 pc:** With an absolute magnitude of 15 and a distance of 5 parsecs, the apparent magnitude is m = 15 + 5*log10(5/10) = 15 + 5*log10(0.5) ≈ 13.5. Its declination is 0°.\n    *   **Magnitude Check:** V≈13.5 is brighter than the V=16 limit.\n    *   **Visibility Check:** A declination of 0° is observable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Detectable.\n\n*   **f) Star at 50 pc:** With an absolute magnitude of 15 and a distance of 50 parsecs, the apparent magnitude is m = 15 + 5*log10(50/10) = 15 + 5*log10(5) ≈ 18.5. Its declination is 0°.\n    *   **Magnitude Check:** V≈18.5 is fainter than the V=16 limit.\n    *   **Visibility Check:** A declination of 0° is observable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not detectable.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe stars that meet both the brightness and visibility criteria are:\n1.  Canopus\n2.  Star with Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag at 10 pc\n3.  Star with Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag at 5 pc\n\nIn total, 3 of the listed stars would be detectable.\n\n<<<A>>>"
