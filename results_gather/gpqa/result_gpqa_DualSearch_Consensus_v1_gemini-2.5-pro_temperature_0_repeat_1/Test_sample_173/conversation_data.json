    "Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Determine the Rest-Masses of the Fragments\n\nFirst, we establish the rest-mass energies of the two fragments. We are given:\n*   Initial rest-mass energy, M*c² = 300 GeV.\n*   The mass of the more massive fragment (m₁) is twice that of the less massive fragment (m₂): m₁ = 2 * m₂.\n*   The sum of the rest-masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass: m₁ + m₂ = 0.99 * M.\n\nBy substituting the first relation into the second, we get:\n2 * m₂ + m₂ = 0.99 * M\n3 * m₂ = 0.99 * M\nm₂ = 0.33 * M\n\nAnd for the more massive fragment:\nm₁ = 2 * m₂ = 2 * (0.33 * M) = 0.66 * M\n\nNow, we can find their rest-mass energies:\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 1 (m₁c²): 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.\n*   Rest-mass energy of fragment 2 (m₂c²): 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Released Kinetic Energy (Q-value)\n\nThe energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference between the initial rest-mass energy and the sum of the final rest-mass energies.\n*   Q = Initial Energy - Final Energy\n*   Q = (M*c²) - (m₁c² + m₂c²)\n*   Q = 300 GeV - (198 GeV + 99 GeV) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.\n\nThis total kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments: T₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Correct (Relativistic) Kinetic Energy T₁\n\nFor the relativistic calculation, we use the conservation of both energy and momentum. Since the initial nucleus was at rest, the final momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n\nThe relativistic energy-momentum relation is E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)², where E is the total energy (rest energy + kinetic energy) and p is the momentum.\n\nFor the two fragments:\n*   E₁² = (p₁c)² + (m₁c²)²\n*   E₂² = (p₂c)² + (m₂c²)²\n\nSince |p₁| = |p₂|, we have (p₁c)² = (p₂c)². Therefore:\nE₁² - (m₁c²)² = E₂² - (m₂c²)²\n\nWe also know the total energy of the system is conserved:\nE₁ + E₂ = M*c² = 300 GeV\n\nRearranging the momentum equation:\nE₁² - E₂² = (m₁c²)² - (m₂c²)²\n(E₁ - E₂)(E₁ + E₂) = (198 GeV)² - (99 GeV)²\n(E₁ - E₂)(300 GeV) = (39204 - 9801) GeV²\n(E₁ - E₂)(300 GeV) = 29403 GeV²\nE₁ - E₂ = 29403 / 300 GeV = 98.01 GeV\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations:\n1.  E₁ + E₂ = 300 GeV\n2.  E₁ - E₂ = 98.01 GeV\n\nAdding the two equations gives:\n2E₁ = 398.01 GeV\nE₁ = 199.005 GeV\n\nThe kinetic energy T₁ is the total energy E₁ minus the rest-mass energy m₁c²:\n*   T₁ (relativistic) = E₁ - m₁c² = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Approximate (Classical) Kinetic Energy T₁\n\nIn classical mechanics, kinetic energy is given by T = p² / (2m). From the conservation of momentum (p₁ = p₂), we have:\nm₁T₁ = m₂T₂\n\nUsing the mass relationship m₁ = 2m₂, we get:\n2m₂ * T₁ = m₂ * T₂\n2T₁ = T₂\n\nWe also know that the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV:\nT₁ + T₂ = 3 GeV\n\nSubstituting 2T₁ for T₂:\nT₁ + 2T₁ = 3 GeV\n3T₁ = 3 GeV\n*   T₁ (classical) = 1 GeV.\n\n### 5. Find the Difference\n\nFinally, we calculate the difference between the relativistic and classical values for T₁:\n*   Difference = T₁ (relativistic) - T₁ (classical)\n*   Difference = 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV\n\nConverting this to MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV):\n*   Difference = 0.005 * 1000 MeV = 5 MeV.\n\nThe difference between the correct (relativistic) T₁ and the classical approximation is 5 MeV.\n\n<<<A>>>"
