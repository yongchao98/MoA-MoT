    "To determine the energy at which high-energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes limited by pair production with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons, we need to find the threshold energy for the reaction $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$.\n\nThe process involves a high-energy gamma-ray with energy $E_\\gamma$ colliding with a low-energy CMB photon with average energy $E_{CMB}$. For an electron-positron pair to be created, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame must be at least the rest mass energy of the electron and the positron combined.\n\nThe rest mass energy of an electron ($m_e c^2$) is approximately 0.511 MeV. Since a positron has the same rest mass, the minimum energy required to create an electron-positron pair is $2 \\times m_e c^2 = 1.022$ MeV.\n\nThe threshold condition for pair production in a head-on collision between two photons of energies $E_\\gamma$ and $E_{CMB}$ is given by the equation:\n\n$E_\\gamma E_{CMB} \\ge (m_e c^2)^2$\n\nTo find the minimum energy of the high-energy gamma-ray ($E_\\gamma$) for this process to occur, we can rearrange the formula:\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{CMB}}$\n\nWe are given:\n*   The average energy of a CMB photon, $E_{CMB} = 10^{-3}$ eV.\n*   The rest mass energy of an electron, $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\text{ MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6$ eV.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the equation:\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\text{ eV}}$\n\n$E_\\gamma = 0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}$\n\nThe question asks for the energy in Giga-electron-volts (GeV), where $1 \\text{ GeV} = 10^9 \\text{ eV}$. Therefore, we convert the energy:\n\n$E_\\gamma = \\frac{0.261121 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ eV}}{10^9 \\text{ eV/GeV}} = 0.261121 \\times 10^6 \\text{ GeV}$\n\n$E_\\gamma = 2.61121 \\times 10^5 \\text{ GeV}$\n\nThis result is approximately $2.6 \\times 10^5$ GeV, which corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
