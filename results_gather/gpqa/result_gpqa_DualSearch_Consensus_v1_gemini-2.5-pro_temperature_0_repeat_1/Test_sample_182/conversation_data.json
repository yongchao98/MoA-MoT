    "To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the final product, we must first identify the starting material and the transformations it undergoes.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material\n\nThe starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's determine its molecular formula:\n*   The base structure is a cyclohex-3-ene ring.\n*   At position 1, there is a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   At position 2, there is a formyl group (-CHO).\n*   At position 5, there is a vinyl group (-CH=CH₂).\n\nLet's count the atoms:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the ring + 1 in the carboxyl group + 1 in the formyl group + 2 in the vinyl group = 10 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** We start with a cyclohexene ring (C₆H₁₀) and substitute at positions 1, 2, and 5. This gives a C₆H₇ core. Adding the hydrogens from the substituents: 7 (core) + 1 (in -COOH) + 1 (in -CHO) + 3 (in -CH=CH₂) = 12 hydrogens.\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 in the carboxyl group + 1 in the formyl group = 3 oxygens.\n\nThe molecular formula of the starting material is C₁₀H₁₂O₃.\n\nThe Index of Hydrogen Deficiency (IHD), also known as the degree of unsaturation, can be calculated from the molecular formula using the formula: IHD = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1. For C₁₀H₁₂O₃, the IHD is:\nIHD = 10 - (12/2) + 1 = 10 - 6 + 1 = 5.\n\nThis IHD of 5 corresponds to:\n*   1 for the ring structure.\n*   1 for the double bond in the cyclohexene ring.\n*   1 for the double bond in the vinyl group.\n*   1 for the carbonyl double bond in the formyl group.\n*   1 for the carbonyl double bond in the carboxylic acid group.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reaction\n\nThe reactant is treated with red phosphorus (P) and an excess of hydroiodic acid (HI). This combination is a very powerful reducing agent. It is known to reduce several functional groups to alkanes:\n*   Aldehydes (-CHO) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Carboxylic acids (-COOH) are reduced to methyl groups (-CH₃).\n*   Carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) are reduced to single bonds (C-C).\n\nTherefore, all the sites of unsaturation and all oxygen-containing functional groups in the starting material will be completely reduced.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Product\n\nThe reaction will cause the following transformations:\n*   The cyclohex-3-ene ring will be reduced to a cyclohexane ring.\n*   The carboxylic acid group at position 1 will be reduced to a methyl group.\n*   The formyl group at position 2 will be reduced to a methyl group.\n*   The vinyl group at position 5 will be reduced to an ethyl group.\n\nThe final product is 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the IHD of the Product\n\nLet's determine the molecular formula of the product, 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane:\n*   **Carbons (C):** 6 in the cyclohexane ring + 1 in the first methyl group + 1 in the second methyl group + 2 in the ethyl group = 10 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** A cyclohexane ring has the formula C₆H₁₂. We replace three hydrogen atoms with the substituent groups, leaving C₆H₉. Adding the hydrogens from the substituents: 9 (ring) + 3 (first methyl) + 3 (second methyl) + 5 (ethyl) = 20 hydrogens.\n\nThe molecular formula of the product is C₁₀H₂₀.\n\nNow, we calculate the IHD for the product C₁₀H₂₀:\nIHD = 10 - (20/2) + 1 = 10 - 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nAlternatively, the IHD represents the number of rings and/or multiple bonds in a molecule. The product, 5-ethyl-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane, is a saturated cycloalkane. It contains one ring and no double or triple bonds. Therefore, its Index of Hydrogen Deficiency is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
