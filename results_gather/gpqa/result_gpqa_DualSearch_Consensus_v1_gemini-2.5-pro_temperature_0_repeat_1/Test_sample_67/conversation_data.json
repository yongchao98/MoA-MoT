    "Here is a step-by-by-step derivation to determine the oscillation frequency:\n\n1.  **Initial State**: The particle's magnetic moment is initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. This means the particle is in a \"spin-up\" state with respect to the Z-axis. In quantum mechanics, this state is an eigenstate of the spin operator in the Z direction, Sz, and is denoted as `|+z>`.\n\n2.  **New Hamiltonian**: When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction with magnitude B, the interaction between the particle's magnetic moment (μ) and the new magnetic field creates a new Hamiltonian (H) for the system. The Hamiltonian is given by H = -**μ** · **B**. Since **μ** = γ**S** (where **S** is the spin operator and γ is the gyromagnetic ratio) and **B** is now B**ŷ** (a vector of magnitude B in the Y direction), the Hamiltonian becomes H = -γB * Sy, where Sy is the spin operator in the Y direction.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution**: The state of the particle, |ψ(t)>, evolves over time according to the Schrödinger equation. Starting from the initial state |ψ(0)> = `|+z>`, the state at a later time t is given by |ψ(t)> = e<sup>-iHt/ħ</sup>|ψ(0)>.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Expectation Value**: We are interested in the average (or expectation value) of the z-component of the magnetic moment, <μz(t)>. This is equal to γ times the expectation value of the z-component of the spin, <Sz(t)>. The expectation value is calculated as <Sz(t)> = <ψ(t)|Sz|ψ(t)>.\n\n5.  **Larmor Precession**: This physical situation describes Larmor precession. The spin vector, initially pointing along the Z-axis, will start to precess around the new magnetic field axis (the Y-axis). The frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency.\n\n6.  **Oscillation Frequency**: The projection of the precessing spin vector onto the original Z-axis will oscillate. The angular frequency of this oscillation is precisely the Larmor frequency, which is given by the formula ω = γB. The expectation value of the z-component of the spin, <Sz(t)>, will be found to oscillate with a term proportional to cos(γBt). Therefore, the angular frequency of this oscillation is γB.\n\nBased on this, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's moment is γB.\n\n<<<D>>>"
