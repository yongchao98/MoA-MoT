    "Based on the analysis of the provided 1H NMR data, the unknown compound is identified as Trans-propenyl acetate. Here is a detailed breakdown of the evidence:\n\n*   **Signal at 2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This singlet, integrating to three protons, is characteristic of the methyl protons of an acetate group (CH₃-C=O). All four potential compounds contain this group, so this signal confirms the \"acetate\" part of the name.\n\n*   **Integration:** The total integration of the signals is 1H + 1H + 3H + 3H = 8 protons. This is consistent with the molecular formula of propenyl acetate (C₅H₈O₂) and inconsistent with butenyl acetate (C₆H₁₀O₂), which would have 10 protons. This allows us to eliminate both cis- and trans-butenyl acetate as possibilities.\n\n*   **Vinyl Proton at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This signal is in the typical region for a proton on a carbon-carbon double bond. It is a doublet, meaning it is coupled to one other proton. The most critical piece of information here is the coupling constant (J) of 16.0 Hz. Coupling constants for vinylic protons in a *trans* configuration are typically in the range of 11-18 Hz, while *cis* protons show smaller coupling constants, usually between 6-15 Hz. The large value of 16.0 Hz strongly indicates a *trans* relationship between the two protons on the double bond.\n\n*   **Vinyl Proton at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This signal corresponds to the second proton on the double bond. The splitting pattern, a doublet of quartets (dq), indicates it is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons:\n    *   The \"doublet\" (d) part arises from coupling to the other vinyl proton (at 7.0 ppm).\n    *   The \"quartet\" (q) part arises from coupling to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group.\n\n*   **Aliphatic Protons at 1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This doublet signal, integrating to three protons, corresponds to the methyl group (CH₃) attached to the double bond. It is a doublet because it is coupled to the single vinyl proton at 5.5 ppm.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of the integration (8H), the splitting patterns (s, d, dq, d), and especially the large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) definitively points to a trans-propenyl group attached to an acetate moiety. Therefore, the unknown compound is Trans-propenyl acetate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
