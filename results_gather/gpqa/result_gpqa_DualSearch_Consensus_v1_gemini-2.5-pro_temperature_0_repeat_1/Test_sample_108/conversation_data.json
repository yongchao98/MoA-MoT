    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the partial waves is not permitted.\n\n### 1. Initial State Properties\n\nThe initial state is a two-nucleon (NN) system in a `1S0` state.\n*   **Spin (S):** `2S+1 = 1` implies `S_i = 0`.\n*   **Orbital Angular Momentum (L):** The 'S' indicates `L_i = 0`.\n*   **Total Angular Momentum (J):** The '0' indicates `J_i = 0`.\n*   **Parity (P):** The parity of a two-nucleon system is given by `P = (-1)^L`. Therefore, the initial parity is `P_i = (-1)^0 = +1`.\n\n### 2. Conservation Laws\n\nThe reaction `NN(initial) -> NN(final) + X` must obey several conservation laws.\n\n*   **Conservation of Angular Momentum:** The total angular momentum of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n    *   `J_i = J_f_total`\n    *   The initial total angular momentum is `J_i = 0`.\n    *   The final total angular momentum `J_f_total` is the vector sum of the final NN state's total angular momentum (`J_f`) and the orbital angular momentum of particle X (`L_X`).\n    *   For `J_f_total` to be 0, we must have `J_f = L_X`.\n\n*   **Conservation of Parity:** The total parity of the initial state must equal that of the final state.\n    *   `P_i = P_f_total`\n    *   The initial parity is `P_i = +1`.\n    *   The final parity is the product of the final NN state's parity (`P_f`), the intrinsic parity of particle X (`P_X`), and the parity associated with the orbital motion of X (`(-1)^L_X`).\n    *   `P_f = (-1)^L_f`\n    *   `P_X = -1` (given)\n    *   So, the equation is: `+1 = ((-1)^L_f) * (-1) * ((-1)^L_X)`.\n    *   This simplifies to `+1 = (-1)^(L_f + L_X + 1)`, which means the exponent `L_f + L_X + 1` must be even.\n    *   Therefore, `L_f + L_X` must be odd.\n\n### 3. Pauli Principle for the Final State\n\nThe problem states that for the final NN state, the isospin is `T_f = 0`. The Pauli principle for a two-nucleon system requires that the total wavefunction be antisymmetric, which leads to the condition that `L+S+T` must be an odd integer. The problem provides an equivalent formula: `T = S + L + 1 (mod 2)`.\n\n*   Substituting `T_f = 0` into the given formula: `0 = S_f + L_f + 1 (mod 2)`.\n*   This implies that `S_f + L_f` must be an odd number.\n\n### 4. Evaluating the Options\n\nWe will check each option against the three required conditions:\n1.  **Angular Momentum:** `J_f = L_X`\n2.  **Parity:** `L_f + L_X` must be odd.\n3.  **Pauli Principle:** `S_f + L_f` must be odd.\n\n| Option | Final NN State (`(2S_f+1)L_f(J_f)`) | Particle X (`L_X`) | 1. `J_f = L_X`? | 2. `L_f + L_X` is odd? | 3. `S_f + L_f` is odd? | Permitted? |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| A) | `7D1` (`S_f=3, L_f=2, J_f=1`) | `p` (`L_X=1`) | `1 = 1` (Yes) | `2 + 1 = 3` (Yes) | `3 + 2 = 5` (Yes) | Yes |\n| B) | `3S1` (`S_f=1, L_f=0, J_f=1`) | `p` (`L_X=1`) | `1 = 1` (Yes) | `0 + 1 = 1` (Yes) | `1 + 0 = 1` (Yes) | Yes |\n| C) | `3P0` (`S_f=1, L_f=1, J_f=0`) | `s` (`L_X=0`) | `0 = 0` (Yes) | `1 + 0 = 1` (Yes) | `1 + 1 = 2` (**No**) | **No** |\n| D) | `3D3` (`S_f=1, L_f=2, J_f=3`) | `f` (`L_X=3`) | `3 = 3` (Yes) | `2 + 3 = 5` (Yes) | `1 + 2 = 3` (Yes) | Yes |\n\nThe analysis shows that option C is the only one that violates a required condition. Specifically, it violates the Pauli principle for the final two-nucleon state, as `S_f + L_f` is even (2), while it must be odd for a state with `T_f = 0`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
