    "To find the numerical value of \"a\", we must use the normalization condition of the wave function. According to the Born rule, the square of the magnitude of the wave function, |Ψ(x)|², represents the probability density of finding the particle at a specific position x. Since the particle is confined to the region between x=1 and x=3, the integral of the probability density over this interval must be equal to 1, which signifies a 100% probability of finding the particle in that region.\n\nThe given wave function is:\nΨ(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the probability density, |Ψ(x)|², which is the product of the wave function and its complex conjugate, Ψ*(x).\n\nThe complex conjugate of Ψ(x) is:\nΨ*(x) = ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i\n\nNow, we calculate |Ψ(x)|²:\n|Ψ(x)|² = Ψ*(x) * Ψ(x) = [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) + 0.5*i ] * [ ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i ]\n|Ψ(x)|² = (a² / (1 + x)) + 0.25\n\nNext, we apply the normalization condition by integrating |Ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 and setting the result to 1.\n∫[from 1 to 3] (a² / (1 + x) + 0.25) dx = 1\n\nWe solve the integral:\n∫(a² / (1 + x)) dx + ∫(0.25) dx\n= a² * ln|1 + x| + 0.25x\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral from 1 to 3:\n[a² * ln(1 + 3) + 0.25 * 3] - [a² * ln(1 + 1) + 0.25 * 1]\n= [a² * ln(4) + 0.75] - [a² * ln(2) + 0.25]\n= a² * (ln(4) - ln(2)) + 0.5\nUsing the logarithm property ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b):\n= a² * ln(4/2) + 0.5\n= a² * ln(2) + 0.5\n\nFinally, we set this expression equal to 1 and solve for \"a\":\na² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\na² * ln(2) = 0.5\na² = 0.5 / ln(2)\na = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2))\n\nUsing the approximate value for ln(2) ≈ 0.693:\na ≈ sqrt(0.5 / 0.693)\na ≈ sqrt(0.7215)\na ≈ 0.849\n\nThis value is closest to 0.85.\n\n<<<D>>>"
