    "The analysis of the reactions and the selectivity of the reducing agents is confirmed by the search results.\n\n*   **Reaction A with LiBH4**: Lithium borohydride (LiBH4) is used for the selective reduction of esters and lactones in the presence of carboxylic acids. It is less reactive than LiAlH4 but more reactive than NaBH4. The greater reactivity compared to NaBH4 is due to the Lewis-acidic lithium ion which activates the carbonyl group. Therefore, in the starting material `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-isobutyl`, LiBH4 will selectively reduce the isobutyl ester to a primary alcohol. The resulting intermediate, 3-ethyl-5-hydroxypentanoic acid, will then undergo intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) to form the 6-membered lactone. The stereocenter at the ethyl-bearing carbon is not affected during this process. To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must have the (R) configuration.\n\n*   **Reaction B with BH3**: Borane (BH3) is highly selective for the reduction of carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. While NaBH4 is not strong enough to reduce carboxylic acids, BH3 reduces them rapidly to primary alcohols. In the starting material `HOOC-CH2-CH(Et)-CH2-COO-isobutyl`, BH3 will selectively reduce the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol. The resulting intermediate, isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate, will then undergo intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone. Again, the stereocenter is unaffected. To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration.\n\nBased on this confirmed selectivity:\n*   Starting material A is treated with LiBH4 (ester reduction) to give (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Since the stereochemistry is retained, **A must be (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B is treated with BH3 (carboxylic acid reduction) to give (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Since the stereochemistry is retained, **B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
