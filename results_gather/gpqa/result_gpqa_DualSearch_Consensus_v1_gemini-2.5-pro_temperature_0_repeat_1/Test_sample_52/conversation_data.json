    "The user wants me to identify the correct chemical formula for an unknown compound based on its spectral data.\n\n### Analysis of the Provided Information:\n\n1.  **Di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring:** This implies a C6H4 core.\n2.  **FTIR shows an ester group:** This indicates the presence of a -COO- functional group, which contains two oxygen atoms.\n3.  **1H NMR Data:**\n    *   **Two signals for aromatic-H:** A di-substituted benzene ring has 4 protons. The presence of only two signals suggests a para (1,4) or ortho (1,2) substitution pattern with electronically similar substituents or symmetry.\n    *   **Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets):** This strongly suggests a `-CH=CH-CH3` (propenyl) group. The H on the carbon adjacent to the ring would be a doublet (split by the other vinyl H). The other vinyl H would be a doublet of quartets (split by the first vinyl H and the three protons of the methyl group).\n    *   **Two signals for –CH3 groups:** This indicates two distinct methyl groups.\n    *   **No signals for –CH2 groups:** Confirms the absence of any methylene (-CH2-) bridges.\n\n### Assembling the Structure:\n\nBased on the fragments identified from the spectral data, we can propose a plausible structure.\n*   **Core:** A di-substituted benzene ring (C6H4).\n*   **Functional Groups/Substituents:**\n    *   An ester group (-COO-).\n    *   A propenyl group (-CH=CH-CH3).\n    *   A methyl group (-CH3).\n\nLet's combine these pieces. The ester group must be one of the substituents on the ring, and it incorporates one of the methyl groups. The other substituent is the propenyl group.\n\n**Plausible Structure:** Methyl propenylbenzoate. For example, methyl 4-(prop-1-en-1-yl)benzoate.\n\n*   The aromatic ring is substituted with a `-COOCH3` group and a `-CH=CH-CH3` group.\n*   This structure fits all the NMR data:\n    *   Two aromatic signals (from the para-substituted ring).\n    *   Two vinyl signals with the described splitting pattern.\n    *   Two methyl signals (one from the ester, one from the propenyl group).\n    *   No -CH2- groups.\n\n### Calculating the Chemical Formula:\n\nNow, let's determine the chemical formula for this proposed structure.\n*   **Benzene ring part:** C6H4\n*   **Ester group part:** -COOCH3 -> adds C2, H3, O2\n*   **Propenyl group part:** -CH=CH-CH3 -> adds C3, H5\n*   **Total Carbon atoms:** 6 (from ring) + 1 (from C=O) + 1 (from O-CH3) + 3 (from propenyl) = 11 carbons.\n*   **Total Hydrogen atoms:** 4 (from ring) + 3 (from O-CH3) + 5 (from propenyl) = 12 hydrogens.\n*   **Total Oxygen atoms:** 2 (from ester).\n\nThe resulting chemical formula is **C11H12O2**.\n\n### Verifying with Degree of Unsaturation:\n\nThe degree of unsaturation for C11H12O2 is calculated as:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2) = 11 + 1 - (12/2) = 12 - 6 = 6.\n*   Benzene ring = 4 units of unsaturation.\n*   C=O bond in ester = 1 unit of unsaturation.\n*   C=C bond in vinyl group = 1 unit of unsaturation.\n*   Total = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\nThe calculated degree of unsaturation matches the proposed structure.\n\n### Comparing with the Options:\n\n*   A) C11H14O2 (DoU = 5) - Incorrect DoU.\n*   B) C12H12O2 (DoU = 7) - Incorrect DoU.\n*   C) C11H12O2 (DoU = 6) - Matches the analysis.\n*   D) C12H14O2 (DoU = 6) - While the DoU is correct, this formula does not match the fragments identified from the NMR data. Building a C12H14O2 molecule consistent with the NMR data (especially the absence of -CH2- groups) is not feasible.\n\nThe analysis of the provided FTIR and 1H NMR data strongly and consistently points to a molecular formula of C11H12O2. This is supported by constructing a plausible chemical structure that fits all the spectral details.\n\n<<<C>>>"
