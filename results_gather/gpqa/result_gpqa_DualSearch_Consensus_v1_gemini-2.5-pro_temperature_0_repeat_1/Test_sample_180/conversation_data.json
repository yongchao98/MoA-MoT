    "To determine the approximate ratio of neutrino fluxes, we must first understand the sources of neutrinos in the specified energy bands and how they are affected by the hypothetical cessation of the pp-III branch.\n\n### Neutrino Sources by Energy Band:\n\n*   **Band 1 (700-800 keV):** The primary source of neutrinos in this energy range is the continuous spectrum produced by the beta decay of Boron-8 (⁸B). This reaction is the defining step of the pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain.\n*   **Band 2 (800-900 keV):** This band receives contributions from two main sources:\n    *   The continuous spectrum from the decay of ⁸B (part of the pp-III branch).\n    *   A prominent, sharp, and monochromatic neutrino line at 861 keV (0.861 MeV). This line originates from the electron capture of Beryllium-7 (⁷Be), a key reaction in the pp-II branch.\n\n### Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch:\n\nThe problem states that the pp-III branch suddenly stops. The sequence of reactions in the pp-III branch leads to the creation of ⁸B, which then decays to produce high-energy neutrinos. If this branch ceases, the production of ⁸B stops, and consequently, the flux of neutrinos from ⁸B decay disappears.\n\nHowever, the problem explicitly notes that all other reactions, including the pp-II branch, continue as normal. This is crucial because the pp-II branch is the source of the 861 keV ⁷Be neutrinos.\n\n### Calculating the New Flux Ratio:\n\nWith the pp-III branch halted, we can assess the remaining neutrino flux in each band:\n\n*   **Flux in Band 1 (700-800 keV):** Since the dominant source, ⁸B decay, has been eliminated, the neutrino flux in this energy range drops to virtually zero. While other reactions in the Sun produce neutrinos, their contributions in this specific energy window are negligible.\n*   **Flux in Band 2 (800-900 keV):** The contribution from ⁸B decay is gone. However, the strong neutrino line at 861 keV from ⁷Be electron capture (pp-II branch) persists. This single, strong source now completely dominates the flux in this band.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the flux in band 1 to the flux in band 2 is approximately zero divided by the significant flux from ⁷Be neutrinos. This results in a value very close to zero.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the available options, we must choose the one that best represents a ratio that is nearly zero.\n*   A) 0.1 (10⁻¹)\n*   B) 1\n*   C) 10\n*   D) 0.01 (10⁻²)\n\nThe value 0.01, or 10⁻², is the smallest non-zero option and the closest approximation to zero. This reflects a scenario where the flux in the first band is 100 times smaller than in the second, which aligns with our analysis that the flux in the 700-800 keV band becomes negligible while a strong source remains in the 800-900 keV band.\n\n<<<D>>>"
