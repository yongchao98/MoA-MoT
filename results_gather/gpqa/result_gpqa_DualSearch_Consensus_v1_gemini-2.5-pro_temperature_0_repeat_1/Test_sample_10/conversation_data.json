    "All the provided statements concern the molecular biology of SARS-CoV-2. After a thorough review of the scientific literature, the incorrect statement has been identified.\n\n**A) Correct.** The SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein ORF3a is known to induce apoptosis. Studies have shown that it activates caspase-8, a key initiator of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, without altering the levels of Bcl-2, which is a crucial regulator of the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. This selective activation strongly suggests that ORF3a triggers cell death primarily through the extrinsic pathway. Some research indicates that the activation of caspase-8 by ORF3a can subsequently lead to the cleavage of the protein Bid, which then activates the intrinsic pathway, but the initial trigger described in the statement is accurate.\n\n**B) Correct.** Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) is a crucial mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 protein production. The efficiency of this process has been linked to the conformational plasticity of the RNA pseudoknot structure that stimulates the frameshift. Specifically, studies using optical tweezers have shown that the rate of frameshifting correlates with the number of conformations the pseudoknot can adopt under tension. Both the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signals have been observed to adopt two main conformations under force, which is consistent with their measured frameshifting efficiencies.\n\n**C) Incorrect.** The SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14 complex is a critical component of the virus's replication machinery, functioning as a heterodimer with 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) activity. This activity provides a proofreading or mismatch repair function, ensuring the fidelity of the large RNA genome. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14, stimulated by its cofactor nsp10, actively degrades RNA to remove misincorporated nucleotides. It is capable of cleaving both single-stranded and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Therefore, the statement that the complex *prevents* the breakdown of dsRNA is factually incorrect. Its function is to cleave or break down RNA strands to correct errors, not to protect them.\n\n**D) Correct.** Programmed ribosomal frameshifting is a translational mechanism where the ribosome shifts its reading frame back by one nucleotide (-1 PRF). This event occurs at a specific \"slippery sequence\" and is stimulated by a downstream RNA pseudoknot structure. In SARS-CoV-2, this allows the synthesis of two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, from the overlapping open reading frames ORF1a and ORF1b. This frameshifting signal is located at the junction of ORF1a/1b. Structural analyses, including small-angle X-ray scattering, have confirmed that the pseudoknot structures of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are highly conserved and adopt the same overall conformation.\n\n<<<C>>>"
