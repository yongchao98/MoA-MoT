    "To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻), we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the moles of each component:**\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial concentrations:**\n    The solution volume is 200.00 cm³, which is equal to 0.20000 L.\n    *   The concentration of the dihydrogen phosphate ion, [H₂PO₄⁻], is from KH₂PO₄:\n        [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   The concentration of the hydrogen phosphate ion, [HPO₄²⁻], is from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O:\n        [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n3.  **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H⁺]:**\n    The solution contains a buffer system composed of a weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻). The relevant equilibrium is the second dissociation of phosphoric acid, which has an acid dissociation constant, Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation or the Ka₂ expression to find the pH and subsequently [H⁺].\n\n    Using the Ka₂ expression:\n    Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n    [H⁺] = 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n4.  **Calculate the orthophosphate ion concentration [PO₄³⁻]:**\n    The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is formed from the dissociation of the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO₄²⁻). This corresponds to the third dissociation of phosphoric acid, with Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹².\n\n    The equilibrium is:\n    HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n\n    The expression for Ka₃ is:\n    Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for the orthophosphate concentration, [PO₄³⁻], using the [H⁺] and [HPO₄²⁻] values we've already determined.\n    [PO₄³⁻] = (Ka₃ * [HPO₄²⁻]) / [H⁺]\n    [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹² * 0.02809 M) / (8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n    [PO₄³⁻] = 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nRounding to three significant figures, the concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<A>>>"
