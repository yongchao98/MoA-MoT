    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Element Y and Compound A2:**\n    The problem states that compound A2 has a fluorine mass percentage (ωF) of 31.96%. Let the formula for A2 be YFₙ, where Y is the unknown element, n is the number of fluorine atoms, M(Y) is the molar mass of Y, and M(F) is the molar mass of fluorine (≈19.00 g/mol).\n\n    The formula for mass percentage is:\n    ωF = (n * M(F)) / (M(Y) + n * M(F))\n\n    Plugging in the given value:\n    0.3196 = (n * 19.00) / (M(Y) + n * 19.00)\n\n    Rearranging to solve for M(Y):\n    0.3196 * M(Y) + 0.3196 * (19.00 * n) = 19.00 * n\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 19.00 * n - 6.0724 * n\n    0.3196 * M(Y) = 12.9276 * n\n    M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n\n\n    We can test integer values for n:\n    *   n=1: M(Y) ≈ 40.45 g/mol (similar to Calcium, but its fluoride chemistry doesn't fit)\n    *   n=2: M(Y) ≈ 80.9 g/mol (similar to Bromine, but its fluoride chemistry doesn't fit)\n    *   n=3: M(Y) ≈ 121.35 g/mol (very close to Antimony, Sb, with M=121.76 g/mol)\n    *   n=4: M(Y) ≈ 161.8 g/mol\n    *   n=5: M(Y) ≈ 202.25 g/mol\n\n    Let's verify with Antimony (Sb) and n=3. The compound A2 would be SbF₃.\n    ωF(SbF₃) = (3 * 19.00) / (121.76 + 3 * 19.00) = 57 / 178.76 ≈ 0.3188, which is approximately 31.9%. This is a very strong match.\n\n2.  **Identify the Five Compounds:**\n    The problem states that five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y (Antimony) are known. Antimony is known to form several fluorides, including SbF₃ and SbF₅, as well as polymeric fluorides. The five known binary compounds are SbF₃, SbF₅, and the polymeric species (SbF₅)₂, (SbF₅)₃, and (SbF₅)₄.\n\n    *   **A2 is SbF₃.**\n\n3.  **Identify Compound A1:**\n    A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (20 °C) into A2 (SbF₃) and fluorine. This implies A1 has a higher oxidation state than SbF₃. The reaction is: A1 → SbF₃ + F₂. This decomposition reaction is characteristic of Antimony(V) fluoride, SbF₅, which can be contaminated with SbF₃, leading to such a decomposition, although SbF₅ itself is a colorless liquid. The clue about A1 oxidizing xenon under normal conditions points to a very strong Lewis acid and fluorinating agent. Antimony pentafluoride, SbF₅, is one of the strongest known Lewis acids and can react with xenon. The \"bright-red\" color might be due to impurities or a specific polymeric form, but the chemical properties strongly point to the +5 oxidation state. Let's assume A1 is related to SbF₅.\n\n4.  **Identify Compound A3:**\n    A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y (Sb) with fluorine and can also interact with xenon. The direct fluorination of antimony yields antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅).\n    2Sb + 5F₂ → 2SbF₅\n    Therefore, **A3 is SbF₅**.\n\n5.  **Identify Compounds A4 and A5:**\n    The problem states that adding element Y (Sb) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4 yields A5. This suggests a comproportionation reaction where antimony in a zero oxidation state (Sb) reacts with antimony in a higher oxidation state (in A4) to form a compound with an intermediate oxidation state (A5).\n    The reaction is: Sb + A4 → A5.\n    Given that A2 is SbF₃ and A3 is SbF₅, it is logical that A4 and A5 are also antimony fluorides.\n    Let's test the reaction with A4 being SbF₅:\n    Sb + SbF₅ → A5\n    If this were a 1:1 reaction, the product would have an average oxidation state of +2.5.\n    However, a known reaction is the formation of SbF₃ from Sb and SbF₅:\n    2Sb + 3SbF₅ → 5SbF₃\n    This does not fit the 1:1 molar ratio described.\n\n    Let's reconsider the compounds. The five known binary compounds are SbF₃, SbF₅, and the polymers (SbF₅)₂, (SbF₅)₃, and (SbF₅)₄.\n    *   A1: A higher fluoride that decomposes to A2. Let's assign it as a form of SbF₅.\n    *   A2: SbF₃ (ωF ≈ 31.9%)\n    *   A3: SbF₅ (from direct fluorination of Sb)\n    *   This leaves the polymeric forms for A4 and A5. The polymers are essentially different structural arrangements of SbF₅ units.\n\n    Let's re-read the clue: \"By adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 can be obtained.\" This reaction might not be a redox reaction but an addition or structural change. If A4 is a monomeric or smaller polymeric form of SbF₅, adding Sb might catalyze its polymerization into a larger form, A5.\n    Let's assume A4 is the monomer, SbF₅.\n    *   **A4 = SbF₅**\n\n6.  **Calculate the Molecular Weight of A4:**\n    If A4 is antimony pentafluoride (SbF₅), its molecular weight can be calculated:\n    M(A4) = M(Sb) + 5 * M(F)\n    M(A4) = 121.76 g/mol + 5 * 19.00 g/mol\n    M(A4) = 121.76 + 95.00\n    M(A4) = 216.76 g/mol\n\n7.  **Determine the Correct Range:**\n    The calculated molecular weight of A4 is 216.76 g/mol. We need to find the range in which this value falls.\n    A) 160-180\n    B) 220-240\n    C) 110-130\n    D) 140-160\n\n    The value 216.76 g/mol does not fall into any of the ranges. Let's re-examine the problem. There might be a misunderstanding of the compounds.\n\n    Let's reconsider the reaction: Y + A4 -> A5 (1:1 molar ratio).\n    What if A4 is SbF₃ and Y is Sb? This doesn't make sense.\n    What if the element is not Antimony? Let's re-check the mass calculation. M(Y) ≈ 40.45 * n.\n    If n=5, M(Y) ≈ 202.25. This is close to Gold (Au, 197.0) or Bismuth (Bi, 209.0).\n    *   Let's check BiF₅: ωF = (5 * 19) / (209 + 95) = 95 / 304 ≈ 31.25%. This is also close. Bismuth forms BiF₃ and BiF₅. BiF₅ is a powerful oxidizing agent.\n    *   Let's check AuF₅: ωF = (5 * 19) / (197 + 95) = 95 / 292 ≈ 32.5%. This is also close.\n\n    However, the match with Antimony (Sb) for n=3 (ωF = 31.88% vs 31.96%) is mathematically the closest. There might be a slight ambiguity in the problem's description of the reactions, but the identification of Y as Sb and A2 as SbF₃ is the most solid starting point.\n\n    Let's assume the identification of A3 as SbF₅ is correct (direct fluorination).\n    Let's assume A4 is SbF₃.\n    M(SbF₃) = 121.76 + 3 * 19.00 = 178.76 g/mol. This falls in the range **160-180**.\n    Let's check if this fits the remaining clues.\n    *   A4 = SbF₃.\n    *   Reaction: Sb + SbF₃ (A4) -> A5 (1:1 ratio). This is chemically unlikely to produce a distinct binary compound A5.\n\n    Let's reconsider the initial assignment.\n    *   Y = Sb\n    *   A1 = A form of SbF₅ (perhaps polymeric or impure)\n    *   A2 = SbF₃\n    *   A3 = SbF₅\n    *   A4 = ?\n    *   A5 = ?\n\n    The clue \"hot colorless concentrated solution of A4\" is key. SbF₅ is a liquid that can act as a solvent. SbF₃ is a solid. It is more likely that A4 is the liquid SbF₅.\n    If A4 = SbF₅, M(A4) = 216.76 g/mol. This value is very close to range B) 220-240. It's possible there's a slight variation in molar masses used or the ranges are approximate. 216.76 is only 1.5% away from the lower bound of 220.\n\n    Let's assume A4 is the dimeric form, (SbF₅)₂.\n    M((SbF₅)₂) = 2 * 216.76 = 433.52 g/mol. This is too high.\n\n    Given the options, the most plausible scenario is:\n    1.  Y is Antimony (Sb).\n    2.  A2 is SbF₃.\n    3.  A3 and A4 are SbF₅. The description of A4 as a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\" fits well with liquid SbF₅ being used as a solvent for the reaction.\n    4.  The molecular weight of A4 (SbF₅) is 216.76 g/mol.\n    5.  This value is closest to the range [220-240]. The discrepancy could be due to rounding in the problem statement or the provided options. No other assignment of compounds yields a molecular weight that fits any of the other ranges. For instance, if A4 were SbF₃, its weight (178.76 g/mol) would fit in range A [160-180], but the chemistry described (using it as a \"hot colorless concentrated solution\") is less likely than for SbF₅. The strong oxidizing properties mentioned for A1 and A3 also point to SbF₅ being central to the problem.\n\nTherefore, based on the chemical properties and the closest numerical fit, A4 is SbF₅, and its molecular weight falls just outside but is best represented by the 220-240 range.\n\nFinal check:\n*   Y = Sb\n*   A1 -> A2(SbF₃) + F₂. (A1 is a higher fluoride, likely SbF₅).\n*   A1(SbF₅) oxidizes Xe. (Correct).\n*   A3(SbF₅) from Sb + F₂. (Correct).\n*   A3(SbF₅) interacts with Xe. (Correct).\n*   A4 = SbF₅. M.W. = 216.76 g/mol.\n*   The range is 220-240. This is the most plausible option.\n\n<<<B>>>"
