    "To determine the minimum energy of the system, we must calculate the total electrostatic potential energy. The total energy is the sum of two components:\n1.  The potential energy resulting from the interactions among the 12 charges on the surface of the sphere (`U_sphere`).\n2.  The potential energy from the interaction between the central charge and the 12 charges on the sphere (`U_interaction`).\n\n**1. Potential Energy of the 12 Charges on the Sphere (`U_sphere`)**\n\nFor the 12 charges constrained to the surface of a sphere to have minimum potential energy, they must arrange themselves in a configuration that maximizes their mutual distances. This is a well-known problem in physics called the Thomson problem. For 12 charges, the configuration of minimum energy is at the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\nThe potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies for every pair of charges:\n`U = Σ (k * q_i * q_j) / r_ij` for i < j\n\nFor the 12 particles on the sphere, each with charge `q = 2e`, the energy is `U_sphere = k * (2e)² * Σ (1 / r_ij)`.\n\nThe calculation of the sum of inverse distances for an icosahedron is complex. However, the dimensionless energy for the N=12 Thomson problem is a known result. The energy `U_N` can be expressed as `U_N = E_N * (k * q²) / R`, where `E_N` is a dimensionless constant that depends on the geometry of the arrangement. For N=12 (an icosahedron), the constant `E_12` is approximately 49.17.\n\nIn our case, the charge `q` is `2e` and the radius `R` is 2 m.\n`U_sphere = 49.17 * (k * (2e)²) / R`\n`U_sphere = 49.17 * (k * 4e²) / 2`\n`U_sphere = 98.34 * k * e²`\n\n**2. Interaction Energy between the Central Charge and the Sphere Charges (`U_interaction`)**\n\nThis is the potential energy between the 13th charge at point P (the center) and the 12 charges on the sphere. The charge at the center is `q_center = 2e`, and each of the 12 charges on the sphere is `q_sphere = 2e`. The distance between the central charge and each of the charges on the sphere is the radius `R = 2 m`.\n\nThe total interaction energy is the sum of the potential energies of the central charge with each of the 12 charges on the sphere:\n`U_interaction = Σ (k * q_center * q_sphere) / R` (summed over the 12 charges)\n`U_interaction = 12 * (k * (2e) * (2e)) / R`\n`U_interaction = 12 * (k * 4e²) / 2`\n`U_interaction = 24 * k * e²`\n\n**3. Total Minimum Energy of the System**\n\nThe total energy is the sum of the two components:\n`U_total = U_sphere + U_interaction`\n`U_total = 98.34 * k * e² + 24 * k * e²`\n`U_total = 122.34 * k * e²`\n\nNow, we substitute the values for Coulomb's constant (`k`) and the elementary charge (`e`):\n*   `k ≈ 8.98755 × 10⁹ N·m²/C²`\n*   `e ≈ 1.602177 × 10⁻¹⁹ C`\n\n`U_total = 122.34 * (8.98755 × 10⁹) * (1.602177 × 10⁻¹⁹)²`\n`U_total ≈ 122.34 * (8.98755 × 10⁹) * (2.56697 × 10⁻³⁸)`\n`U_total ≈ 122.34 * (2.30708 × 10⁻²⁸)`\n`U_total ≈ 2.82245 × 10⁻²⁶ J`\n\nCorrect to three decimals, the minimum energy is `2.822 × 10⁻²⁶ J`.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 2.822 x 10⁻²⁶\nB) 5.645 x 10⁻²⁶\nC) 7.056 x 10⁻²⁷\nD) 122.330\n\nThe calculated value matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
