    "To determine the correct reaction sequence for synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, a careful analysis of the directing effects of the substituents is necessary. The target molecule has three substituents—acetyl (-COCH3), bromo (-Br), and nitro (-NO2)—all in a *meta* relationship to each other (positions 1, 3, and 5).\n\n**Analysis of Substituent Directing Effects:**\n*   **Acetyl group (-COCH3):** A deactivating group that directs incoming substituents to the *meta* position.\n*   **Bromo group (-Br):** A deactivating group that directs incoming substituents to the *ortho* and *para* positions.\n*   **Nitro group (-NO2):** A strongly deactivating group that directs incoming substituents to the *meta* position.\n\n**Evaluation of the Proposed Sequences:**\n\n*   **Option A and C:** These sequences begin with nitration to form nitrobenzene, followed by reduction to aniline. Aniline's amino group (-NH2) is a strong *ortho, para*-director. Subsequent reactions, such as Friedel-Crafts acylation (which fails on anilines without protection) or bromination, would not lead to the required 1,3,5-substitution pattern. Therefore, these options are incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B:** This sequence starts with the bromination of benzene to form bromobenzene. The bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director. The next step, nitration, would predominantly yield *p*-bromonitrobenzene, which does not have the necessary *meta* relationship between the substituents. This makes option B an unviable route.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence begins with the Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene to produce acetophenone.\n    1.  **i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Acetophenone:** The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a *meta*-director.\n    2.  **ii) Acetophenone + Br2/FeBr3 → 3-Bromoacetophenone:** The acetyl group directs the incoming bromine to the *meta* position (position 3), which is consistent with the target molecule's structure.\n    3.  **iii) 3-Bromoacetophenone + HNO3/H2SO4 → 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one:** At this stage, the benzene ring has an acetyl group at position 1 and a bromo group at position 3. The acetyl group is a *meta*-director (directing to position 5), and the bromo group is an *ortho, para*-director (directing to positions 5 and 1). Both groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position 5. This reinforcement of directing effects leads to the selective formation of the desired 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThis three-step sequence (Acylation → Bromination → Nitration) is the most logical and effective pathway among the choices to achieve the specific 1,3,5-substitution pattern. While Friedel-Crafts reactions are generally difficult on deactivated rings, this sequence introduces the deactivating groups in an order that maintains sufficient reactivity for each subsequent step while ensuring the correct regiochemistry. The additional steps listed in option D (iv through vii) are superfluous as the target molecule is successfully synthesized in the first three steps. Their inclusion appears to be a distractor, as the initial three-step sequence is chemically sound and directly produces the target compound with high regioselectivity, which implies a high yield of the desired isomer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
