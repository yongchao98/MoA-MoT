    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the pH at both stages of the titration.\n\n### 1. Dilution of Acetic Acid\n\nFirst, we calculate the new concentration of the acetic acid solution after it has been diluted with water.\n*   **Initial moles of acetic acid (HA):**\n    Volume × Molarity = 0.02000 L × 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol\n*   **New total volume:**\n    20.00 cm³ (acid) + 20.00 cm³ (water) = 40.00 cm³ = 0.04000 L\n*   **New concentration of acetic acid:**\n    Moles / New Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M\n\n### 2. pH at 25% Titration\n\nThis is the point where 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. The solution now contains the remaining acetic acid and the acetate (CH₃COO⁻) that has been formed, creating a buffer solution.\n\n*   **Moles of NaOH added:** At 25% titration, 0.25 × 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol of NaOH has been added.\n*   **Moles of acetic acid remaining:** 0.001 mol - 0.00025 mol = 0.00075 mol\n*   **Moles of acetate formed:** 0.00025 mol\n\nTo find the pH of this buffer solution, we use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\npH = pKa + log ([A⁻]/[HA])\n\n*   **pKa calculation:**\n    pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.733\n*   **pH calculation:**\n    The ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base ([A⁻]) to the acid ([HA]) is the same as the ratio of their moles.\n    pH = 4.733 + log (0.00025 / 0.00075)\n    pH = 4.733 + log (1/3)\n    pH = 4.733 - 0.477\n    pH ≈ 4.256\n\nSo, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.\n\n### 3. pH at the Equivalence Point\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been completely neutralized by the NaOH, forming sodium acetate. The solution's pH is now determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion, which is a weak base.\n\n*   **Volume of NaOH to reach equivalence:**\n    Volume = Moles / Molarity = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³\n*   **Total volume at equivalence point:**\n    40.00 cm³ (diluted acid) + 10.00 cm³ (NaOH) = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L\n*   **Concentration of acetate ([A⁻]):**\n    [A⁻] = Moles / Total Volume = 0.001 mol / 0.05000 L = 0.02 M\n*   **Hydrolysis of acetate:**\n    CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻\n*   **Kb calculation:** We need the base dissociation constant (Kb) for acetate, which can be found using the ion-product of water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C).\n    Kb = Kw / Ka = (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) / (1.85 x 10⁻⁵) ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰\n*   **[OH⁻] calculation:** We can set up an equilibrium expression for the hydrolysis.\n    Kb = [CH₃COOH][OH⁻] / [CH₃COO⁻]\n    5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)\n    Assuming x is small, we can simplify:\n    x² ≈ 5.405 x 10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02\n    x² ≈ 1.081 x 10⁻¹¹\n    x = [OH⁻] ≈ 3.288 x 10⁻⁶ M\n*   **pOH and pH calculation:**\n    pOH = -log([OH⁻]) = -log(3.288 x 10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.483\n    pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517\n\nSo, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.\n\nComparing our calculated values (pH at 25% titration ≈ 4.26; pH at equivalence point ≈ 8.52) with the given options, the correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
