    "The analysis of the problem is confirmed by the search results.\n\n1.  **Hydrocarbon Z**: The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. This is characteristic of a cycloalkane with the general formula CnH2n. The mass percentage of hydrogen is (2n * 1.008) / (12.011n + 2n * 1.008) which simplifies to approximately 2/14 or 1/7, which is ~14.3%. The problem states Z is a widely used solvent, which strongly points to cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\n2.  **Mixture Y**: This mixture does not decolorize bromine water, indicating its components are saturated or aromatic. It is formed from a disproportionation reaction and contains Z (cyclohexane) as one component. Hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only cyclohexane. This is consistent with Y being a mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water under normal conditions and is hydrogenated to cyclohexane under severe conditions with a platinum catalyst.\n\n3.  **Mixture X**: This is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, meaning its components are unsaturated. It has no conjugated multiple bonds. When heated with platinum, it undergoes disproportionation to form an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6).\n\n4.  **The Disproportionation Reaction**: The overall transformation is from mixture X (composed of two molecules, X1 and X2) to mixture Y (composed of cyclohexane and benzene).\n    `X1 + X2 --(Pt, heat)--> C6H12 + C6H6`\n\n    This is a hydrogen transfer reaction. By the law of conservation of mass, the total number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the equation.\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = (H atoms in cyclohexane) + (H atoms in benzene)\n    *   Total hydrogen atoms in the products = 12 + 6 = 18.\n\n    Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X (one molecule of each) must also be 18.\n\n5.  **Identity of X1 and X2**: To satisfy the conditions, X1 and X2 must be C6 cyclic hydrocarbons. A plausible combination for X1 and X2 would be cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8).\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 10 + 8 = 18.\n    *   Both are unsaturated and will decolorize bromine water.\n    *   Neither cyclohexene nor 1,4-cyclohexadiene has conjugated double bonds (1,3-cyclohexadiene does).\n    *   The reaction `C6H10 (cyclohexene) + C6H8 (1,4-cyclohexadiene) -> C6H12 (cyclohexane) + C6H6 (benzene)` is a valid hydrogen transfer (disproportionation) reaction. 1,4-cyclohexadiene can act as a hydrogen donor. Such reactions involving cyclohexene, cyclohexadienes, cyclohexane, and benzene with platinum catalysts are well-documented.\n\nThe central point is the conservation of atoms in the reaction. The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two product molecules (cyclohexane and benzene) is 18. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two reactant molecules from mixture X must also be 18.\n\n<<<A>>>"
