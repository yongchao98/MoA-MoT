    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the total number of atoms in salts A and B.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Gaseous Products\n\nThe initial mixture of salts, weighing 7.20 g, was heated and decomposed completely into a mixture of gases. These gases were passed through a series of tubes, allowing us to identify and quantify them.\n\n*   **Tube №1 (Anhydrous Mg(ClO₄)₂):** This substance is a powerful drying agent that absorbs water (H₂O). The weight of this tube increased by 3.60 g, which corresponds to the mass of water produced.\n    *   Moles of H₂O = 3.60 g / 18.02 g/mol ≈ 0.2 mol.\n\n*   **Tube №2 (Ca(OH)₂ solution):** This is limewater, which reacts with acidic gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂). Since the weight of this tube did not change, no CO₂ was produced during the decomposition. This indicates the absence of carbon in the original salts.\n\n*   **Tube №3 (Red-hot copper):** Hot copper reacts with oxygen (O₂) to form copper(II) oxide (CuO). The weight increase of 0.80 g is due to the mass of oxygen that reacted.\n    *   Moles of O₂ = 0.80 g / 32.00 g/mol = 0.025 mol.\n\n*   **Remaining Gas (Gas C):** After passing through the three tubes, 2.24 liters of a non-reactive gas (at standard temperature and pressure) remained.\n    *   Moles of Gas C = 2.24 L / 22.4 L/mol = 0.1 mol.\n\nThe total mass of the gaseous products (Water + Oxygen + Gas C) must equal the initial mass of the salts (7.20 g).\n*   Mass of Gas C = 7.20 g - 3.60 g (H₂O) - 0.80 g (O₂) = 2.80 g.\n*   Molar mass of Gas C = Mass / Moles = 2.80 g / 0.1 mol = 28 g/mol.\n\nA gas with a molar mass of 28 g/mol that is unreactive under these conditions is nitrogen (N₂). Therefore, the decomposition products are H₂O, O₂, and N₂.\n\n### 2. Identify the Salts A and B\n\nThe elements present in the products are Nitrogen (N), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O). This means the original salts A and B must be composed of these elements. Given they are salts, a likely cation is ammonium (NH₄⁺), and the anions would be nitrogen-oxygen anions (oxyanions). The two most common such salts are ammonium nitrite (NH₄NO₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃).\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the equimolar mixture consists of Salt A = Ammonium Nitrite and Salt B = Ammonium Nitrate.\n\nThe thermal decomposition reactions are:\n*   **Ammonium Nitrite:** NH₄NO₂(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n*   **Ammonium Nitrate:** 2NH₄NO₃(s) → 2N₂(g) + O₂(g) + 4H₂O(g)\n\nLet 'n' be the number of moles for each salt in the equimolar mixture.\n\nFrom the decomposition of 'n' moles of each salt:\n*   **Total Moles of N₂:** n (from NH₄NO₂) + n (from NH₄NO₃) = 2n\n*   **Total Moles of H₂O:** 2n (from NH₄NO₂) + 2n (from NH₄NO₃) = 4n\n*   **Total Moles of O₂:** 0.5n (from NH₄NO₃)\n\nUsing the moles calculated from the experimental data:\n*   From O₂: 0.5n = 0.025 mol  => **n = 0.05 mol**\n*   Checking with N₂: 2n = 2 * 0.05 = 0.1 mol. This matches the experimental result.\n*   Checking with H₂O: 4n = 4 * 0.05 = 0.2 mol. This also matches the experimental result.\n\nThe value of n = 0.05 mol is consistent across all products, confirming that the salts are indeed ammonium nitrite and ammonium nitrate.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Total Number of Atoms\n\nNow, we determine the number of atoms in one molecule of each salt.\n\n*   **Salt A (Ammonium Nitrite - NH₄NO₂):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 1 Nitrogen (N) + 2 Oxygen (O) = **8 atoms**\n\n*   **Salt B (Ammonium Nitrate - NH₄NO₃):**\n    *   1 Nitrogen (N) + 4 Hydrogen (H) + 1 Nitrogen (N) + 3 Oxygen (O) = **9 atoms**\n\nThe total number of all atoms in salts A and B is the sum of the atoms in each formula unit.\n*   Total Atoms = Atoms in Salt A + Atoms in Salt B = 8 + 9 = 17\n\n<<<A>>>"
