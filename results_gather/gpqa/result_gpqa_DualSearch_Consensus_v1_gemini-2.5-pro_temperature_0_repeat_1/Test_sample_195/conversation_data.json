    "In a relativistic system, the total energy E of a particle is the sum of its rest energy ($mc^2$), its kinetic energy ($K$), and its potential energy ($U$). The total energy is conserved.\n\nThe kinetic energy of a relativistic particle is given by $K = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$, where $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\nTherefore, the total energy can be expressed as $E = \\gamma mc^2 + U(x)$.\n\nFor a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.\n\nWe can analyze the energy of the oscillator at two key points in its motion:\n\n1.  **At the point of maximum displacement (amplitude A):**\n    Here, the position is $x = A$, and the mass is momentarily at rest, so its speed is $v = 0$.\n    When $v=0$, the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0}} = 1$.\n    The total energy at this point is:\n    $E_{total} = (1)mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2$.\n\n2.  **At the equilibrium position (x = 0):**\n    Here, the potential energy is zero, $U(0) = 0$. The speed of the mass is at its maximum, $v = v_{max}$.\n    The Lorentz factor is at its maximum value, $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n    The total energy at this point is purely the relativistic energy of the moving mass (rest energy + kinetic energy):\n    $E_{total} = \\gamma_{max}mc^2 + 0 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$.\n\nAccording to the principle of conservation of energy, the total energy at these two points must be equal.\n\n$mc^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \\frac{mc^2}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\nNow, we solve this equation for $v_{max}$:\n\nFirst, divide both sides by $mc^2$:\n$1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v_{max}^2/c^2}}$\n\nNext, to isolate the square root term, we take the reciprocal of both sides:\n$\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}}$\n\nSquare both sides to eliminate the square root:\n$\\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2} = 1 - \\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for $\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2}$:\n$\\frac{v_{max}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}$\n\nFinally, multiply by $c^2$ and take the square root to find $v_{max}$:\n$v_{max} = c\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\n\nThis result matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
