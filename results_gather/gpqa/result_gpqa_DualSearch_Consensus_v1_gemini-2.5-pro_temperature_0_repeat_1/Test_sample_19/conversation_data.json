    "The impulse approximation in many-body nuclear calculations is a simplifying assumption that allows the complex interaction with a nucleus to be treated as a collection of interactions with individual, free nucleons. This approximation is valid under specific conditions, primarily when the interaction time is very short and the momentum transfer is high.\n\nLet's analyze the four proposed assumptions:\n\n1.  **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons:** This is the foundational concept of the impulse approximation. The incoming probe (e.g., in an electroweak interaction) is assumed to interact with only one nucleon at a time. This ignores more complex \"many-body currents\" where the probe interacts with multiple nucleons simultaneously. This is often referred to as the \"one-body current\" assumption.\n\n2.  **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon:** This assumption implies that neither the incoming probe before the interaction nor the outgoing particles (the scattered probe and the struck nucleon) interact with the other nucleons in the nucleus. This is known as the neglect of \"initial-state\" and \"final-state interactions\" (FSI). Without this assumption, the effects of the surrounding nuclear medium on the particles would need to be considered.\n\n3.  **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic:** This statement concerns the internal structure of the nucleon itself, not its behavior within the nucleus. The impulse approximation treats the nucleon as the fundamental interacting particle. While the nucleon's response is described by form factors that depend on its internal quark-gluon structure (which is relativistic), the impulse approximation itself does not require the quarks to be non-relativistic. In fact, there are relativistic versions of the impulse approximation that treat the nucleons' motion relativistically. Therefore, this is not a core assumption of the impulse approximation for the nucleus.\n\n4.  **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces:** This is a key element of the approximation. The interaction is assumed to occur over such a short time that the forces binding the nucleon to the rest of the nucleus can be ignored during the collision. The nucleon is treated as a stationary, free particle at the instant of interaction, though its momentum distribution before the event is determined by its bound state.\n\nBased on this analysis, the three assumptions that jointly define the impulse approximation are 1, 2, and 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
