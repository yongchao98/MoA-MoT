    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### **Analysis of the Spectral Data**\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak is at **m/z = 156**. This represents the molecular weight of the compound.\n    *   There is a significant peak at **m/z = 158** with an intensity of about 32% of the molecular ion peak. This M+2 peak pattern (a ratio of approximately 3:1 for M to M+2) is a distinctive isotopic signature for the presence of one **chlorine** atom.\n    *   All the proposed options are isomers with the chemical formula C7H5ClO2, and a molecular weight of approximately 156.57 g/mol, which is consistent with the mass spectrum.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A very **broad peak spanning from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹** is observed. This is highly characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid** that is undergoing hydrogen bonding.\n    *   A **strong, sharp peak appears at 1720 cm⁻¹**. This frequency is typical for the C=O (carbonyl) stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid.\n    *   The combination of these two peaks strongly indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. This makes Phenyl chloroformate (an ester/acid chloride) and 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (a phenol and aldehyde) less likely candidates. 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-chlorobenzoic acid remain as strong possibilities.\n\n3.  **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (¹H NMR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A singlet at **11.0 ppm (1H)** is observed. A chemical shift in this region (typically 10-13 ppm) is definitive for a **carboxylic acid proton** (-COOH).\n    *   The aromatic region of the spectrum shows two doublets: one at **8.02 ppm (2H)** and another at **7.72 ppm (2H)**. This pattern of two doublets, each integrating to two protons, is a classic indication of a **1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring**. The two sets of aromatic protons are chemically non-equivalent and split each other.\n    *   Comparing this to the possible structures:\n        *   **4-chlorobenzoic acid** is a 1,4-disubstituted benzene. It would exhibit this exact pattern of two doublets for its four aromatic protons. The protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group are shifted further downfield (around 8.0 ppm), while the protons next to the chlorine atom are at a slightly higher field (around 7.7 ppm).\n        *   **2-chlorobenzoic acid** is a 1,2-disubstituted (ortho) benzene. It would have four unique aromatic protons, leading to a more complex splitting pattern, not two simple doublets.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the combined evidence from all three spectroscopic techniques, the unknown compound is identified as **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. The mass spectrum confirms the molecular weight and the presence of chlorine. The IR and NMR spectra confirm the presence of a carboxylic acid group, and the specific pattern in the ¹H NMR spectrum confirms the 1,4- (para) substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\n<<<C>>>"
