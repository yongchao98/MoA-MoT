    "The initial analysis is confirmed by the search results. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which give the expansion of a coupled angular momentum state in terms of the uncoupled states, are non-zero only when the magnetic quantum numbers sum correctly.\n\nSpecifically, the coefficient `<l1, m1; l2, m2 | l, m>` is zero unless `m1 + m2 = m`.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the coupled state `|l=2, m=-1>`. We want to find the probability of measuring the system to be in the uncoupled state corresponding to `L1z = -ħ` and `L2z = -ħ`. This means we are looking for the state where `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1`.\n\nFor the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient `<1, -1; 1, -1 | 2, -1>` to be non-zero, the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers must equal the total magnetic quantum number.\nHere, `m1 + m2 = -1 + (-1) = -2`.\nThe total magnetic quantum number is `m = -1`.\nSince `-2 ≠ -1`, the condition is not met.\n\nTherefore, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is 0. The probability is the square of this coefficient, which is also 0. This means it is impossible to measure `m1 = -1` and `m2 = -1` simultaneously if the system is in the state `|l=2, m=-1>`.\n\nThe state `|l=2, m=-1>` is a superposition of the states `|m1=0, m2=-1>` and `|m1=-1, m2=0>`. The probability of measuring `m1=-1` and `m2=-1` is the squared modulus of the amplitude of the state `|m1=-1, m2=-1>` in the expansion of `|l=2, m=-1>`. As established, this amplitude is zero.\n\nFinal Answer is 0.\n\n<<<D>>>"
