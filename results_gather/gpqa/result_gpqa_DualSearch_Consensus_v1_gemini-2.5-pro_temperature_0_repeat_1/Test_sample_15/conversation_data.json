    "To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we must assess each one for chirality. A molecule is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a racemic (50:50) mixture of enantiomers. Generally, a molecule is chiral if it lacks an internal plane of symmetry and a center of inversion.\n\nHere is the analysis of each compound:\n\n*   ***(Z)***-**1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This molecule lacks a chiral center. The carbon atoms of the double bond are each bonded to only two different groups, and the other carbons in the chain do not have four different substituents. The molecule is achiral and therefore optically inactive.\n*   ***(3aR,7aS,E)***-**8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name explicitly denotes a specific stereoisomer with absolute configurations (*R* and *S*) at its chiral centers. The designation of a single enantiomer confirms that the molecule is chiral and, by itself, is optically active.\n*   ***(2R,3S)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers at carbons 2 and 3. However, the (2*R*,3*S*) configuration results in a molecule with an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers and are optically inactive due to internal compensation.\n*   ***(2R,3R)***-**2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This stereoisomer also has two chiral centers. Unlike the *meso* form, the (2*R*,3*R*) isomer does not have a plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and this specific enantiomer is optically active. Its non-superimposable mirror image is the (2*S*,3*S*) isomer.\n*   ***(R)***-**cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The designation (*R*) specifies a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule. The carbon atom at position 1 is a chiral center, as it is bonded to four different groups (a hydroxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and two different carbon pathways within the ring). Therefore, it is optically active.\n*   ***(1s,3s,5s)***-**cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: The notation (1*s*,3*s*,5*s*) is synonymous with *cis,cis*-1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol, indicating that all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement gives the molecule a high degree of symmetry, including multiple planes of symmetry. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and optically inactive.\n*   **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: An examination of this molecule's structure reveals no chiral centers. The carbon atoms in the cyclopentyl ring and the butyl chain are not bonded to four different groups. The molecule is achiral and thus optically inactive.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following three compounds will exhibit optical activity:\n1.  (3a*R*,7a*S*,*E*)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n2.  (2*R*,3*R*)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n3.  (*R*)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nTherefore, 3 of the compounds listed will exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>"
