    "When the number of sides N of a regular polygon with a constant apothem 'a' becomes infinitely large, the polygon approaches a circle with a radius equal to the apothem 'a'. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture of radius 'a'.\n\nThe far-field diffraction pattern produced by a circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern. This pattern consists of a bright central spot, called the Airy disk, surrounded by a series of concentric dark and bright rings.\n\nThe angular positions of the dark rings (minima) are determined by the zeros of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, J₁(x). The minima occur when:\n\nsin(θ) ≈ θ = (zₘ * λ) / (π * D)\n\nwhere:\n*   θ is the angular position of the minimum.\n*   zₘ is the m-th zero of the Bessel function J₁(x).\n*   λ is the wavelength of the light.\n*   D is the diameter of the circular aperture.\n\nIn this case, the radius of the aperture is 'a', so the diameter D = 2a. The formula becomes:\n\nθ = (zₘ * λ) / (2πa)\n\nThe first two zeros of the first-order Bessel function are approximately:\n*   z₁ ≈ 3.8317\n*   z₂ ≈ 7.0156\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular positions of the first two minima:\n\n**First Minimum (θ₁):**\nUsing z₁, the angular position of the first minimum is:\nθ₁ = (3.8317 * λ) / (2πa) ≈ 0.6098 λ / a\nThis is often approximated using the well-known formula for the first minimum: θ₁ = 1.22 λ / D = 1.22 λ / (2a) = 0.610 λ / a.\n\n**Second Minimum (θ₂):**\nUsing z₂, the angular position of the second minimum is:\nθ₂ = (7.0156 * λ) / (2πa) ≈ 1.1166 λ / a\nThis corresponds to the approximation θ₂ ≈ 2.23 λ / D = 2.23 λ / (2a) = 1.115 λ / a.\n\n**Angular Distance:**\nThe angular distance between the first two minima is the difference between θ₂ and θ₁:\nΔθ = θ₂ - θ₁\nΔθ ≈ (1.1166 λ / a) - (0.6098 λ / a)\nΔθ ≈ 0.5068 λ / a\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 0.506 λ / a\nB) 0.610 λ / a\nC) 1.220 λ / a\nD) 0.500 λ / a\n\nThe calculated value of approximately 0.5068 λ / a is closest to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
