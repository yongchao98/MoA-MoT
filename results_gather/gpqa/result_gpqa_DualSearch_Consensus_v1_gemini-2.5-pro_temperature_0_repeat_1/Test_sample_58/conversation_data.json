    "To determine the pH of the final solution, we must first calculate the moles of the acidic and basic species and then determine which, if any, is in excess after neutralization.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of each substance.\n\n*   **Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid:**\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume\n    *   Moles of CH3COOH = 0.1 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.050 mol\n\n*   **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), a strong acid:**\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume\n    *   Moles of HCl = 0.2 mol/L × 0.400 L = 0.080 mol\n    *   Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, providing 0.080 moles of H+ ions.\n\n*   **Barium Hydroxide (Ba(OH)2), a strong base:**\n    *   Moles = Molarity × Volume\n    *   Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L = 0.090 mol\n    *   Ba(OH)2 is a strong base that dissociates to produce two hydroxide ions for each formula unit (Ba(OH)2 → Ba2+ + 2OH-).\n    *   Moles of OH- = 2 × Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 2 × 0.090 mol = 0.180 mol\n\n### Step 2: Neutralization Reactions\n\nFirst, the strong acid (HCl) will react with the strong base (Ba(OH)2).\n\n*   Initial moles of H+ (from HCl) = 0.080 mol\n*   Initial moles of OH- (from Ba(OH)2) = 0.180 mol\n\nThe neutralization reaction is: H+ + OH- → H2O.\nSince there are more moles of OH- than H+, all the H+ from HCl will be consumed.\n\n*   Moles of OH- remaining after reacting with HCl = 0.180 mol - 0.080 mol = 0.100 mol\n\nNext, the remaining strong base (OH-) will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH).\n\n*   Initial moles of CH3COOH = 0.050 mol\n*   Moles of OH- available = 0.100 mol\n\nThe neutralization reaction is: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O.\nThe acetic acid is the limiting reactant.\n\n*   Moles of OH- remaining = 0.100 mol - 0.050 mol = 0.050 mol\n*   All 0.050 moles of CH3COOH are consumed.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the pH of the final solution\n\nThe final solution contains an excess of 0.050 moles of OH- ions, which is a strong base. The pH will be determined by the concentration of this excess hydroxide.\n\n*   **Total Volume of the solution:**\n    *   Total Volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n*   **Concentration of excess OH-:**\n    *   [OH-] = Moles of excess OH- / Total Volume\n    *   [OH-] = 0.050 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M\n\n*   **Calculate pOH:**\n    *   pOH = -log[OH-]\n    *   pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38\n\n*   **Calculate pH:**\n    *   pH = 14 - pOH\n    *   pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nThe pH of the resulting solution is 12.62.\n\n<<<A>>>"
