    "To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we can use the provided elemental abundance data. The information regarding the stellar masses, Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), and the Equivalent Width (EW) method serves as context for how these abundances were determined but is not directly needed for the calculation itself.\n\n### Analysis of Stellar Abundances\n\nThe standard astronomical notation for elemental abundance ratios is [X/Y], which is defined as the logarithmic ratio of the number densities (n) of elements X and Y in a star compared to the same ratio in the Sun:\n[X/Y] = log₁₀(nₓ/nᵧ)ₛₜₐᵣ - log₁₀(nₓ/nᵧ)ₛᵤₙ\n\n**For Star_1:**\n\nWe are given:\n*   [Fe/H]₁ = 0 dex\n*   [Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3 dex\n\nWe can derive the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio for Star_1, [Si/H]₁, using the following relation:\n[Si/H]₁ = [Si/Fe]₁ + [Fe/H]₁\n[Si/H]₁ = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3\n\nThis means:\nlog₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)₁ - log₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ = 0.3\nlog₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)₁ = 0.3 + log₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ\n\nFrom this, we can express the silicon abundance in Star_1 relative to the Sun's:\n(nₛᵢ/nₕ)₁ = (nₛᵢ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ * 10⁰·³\n\n**For Star_2:**\n\nWe are given:\n*   [Mg/H]₂ = 0 dex\n*   [Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3 dex\n\nWe can find the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio for Star_2, [Si/H]₂, by rearranging the abundance relation:\n[Mg/Si]₂ = [Mg/H]₂ - [Si/H]₂\n0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]₂\n[Si/H]₂ = -0.3\n\nThis means:\nlog₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)₂ - log₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ = -0.3\nlog₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)₂ = -0.3 + log₁₀(nₛᵢ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ\n\nFrom this, we can express the silicon abundance in Star_2 relative to the Sun's:\n(nₛᵢ/nₕ)₂ = (nₛᵢ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ * 10⁻⁰·³\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. This corresponds to the ratio of their silicon abundances relative to hydrogen.\n\nRatio = (nₛᵢ/nₕ)₁ / (nₛᵢ/nₕ)₂\n\nSubstituting the expressions derived above:\nRatio = [ (nₛᵢ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ * 10⁰·³ ] / [ (nₛᵢ/nₕ)ₛᵤₙ * 10⁻⁰·³ ]\n\nThe solar silicon abundance term cancels out:\nRatio = 10⁰·³ / 10⁻⁰·³\nRatio = 10⁽⁰·³ ⁻ ⁽⁻⁰·³⁾⁾\nRatio = 10⁰·⁶\n\nCalculating the final value:\nRatio ≈ 3.981\n\nThis value is approximately 3.9.\n\n<<<C>>>"
