    "To solve this, we must analyze the expected 1H NMR spectrum for each compound and then see which 1:1 mixture matches the provided spectral data.\n\n**Analysis of Each Compound's 1H NMR Spectrum:**\n\n*   **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene):** Due to its high symmetry, all four methyl groups are chemically equivalent, and the two aromatic protons are also equivalent.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** One singlet (2H).\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** One singlet (12H).\n\n*   **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene):** This molecule is less symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** It has two non-equivalent aromatic protons (at positions 4 and 6), which do not have adjacent protons to couple with. This results in two separate singlets (1H each).\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** It has four non-equivalent methyl groups. This would typically produce four singlets. However, accidental overlap is possible. The problem's data of three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio suggests that two of the four methyl groups are coincidentally equivalent in the spectrum, giving a 6H:3H:3H ratio.\n\n*   **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene):** This molecule has a plane of symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** It has two aromatic protons at positions 5 and 6. They are chemically equivalent to each other but are adjacent, which should result in a coupled system (a doublet or multiplet). However, for highly symmetric molecules, this can sometimes appear as a singlet. Spectral data confirms one aromatic signal.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** The four methyl groups form two equivalence sets: (the outer methyls at 1 and 4) and (the inner methyls at 2 and 3). This results in two singlets, each integrating to 6 protons.\n\n*   **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This molecule is highly symmetrical.\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** One singlet (4H).\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** The ethyl groups produce a quartet (for the CH2) and a triplet (for the CH3), not singlets. This compound can be immediately ruled out.\n\n**Evaluation of the Mixture Options:**\n\nThe experimental data for the 1:1 mixture is:\n*   **Aromatic region:** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n*   **Aliphatic region:** Three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's test the options:\n\n*   **A) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one singlet (2H). In a 1:1 mixture, this would result in two singlets with a 2H:2H or 1:1 integration ratio. This matches the data.\n    *   **Aliphatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (12H). 1,2,3,4-TMB gives two singlets (6H each). The combination in a 1:1 mixture would show three singlets with relative integrations of 12H, 6H, and 6H. This simplifies to a 2:1:1 ratio. This also matches the data.\n\n*   **B) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,3,4-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets (1H each). This would result in a total of three aromatic signals. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **C) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:**\n    *   **Aromatic signals:** 1,2,4,5-TMB gives one singlet (2H). 1,2,3,5-TMB gives two singlets (1H each). This would result in a total of three aromatic signals. This contradicts the data.\n\n*   **D) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:**\n    *   This option is incorrect because 1,4-diethylbenzene does not produce singlets in the aliphatic region.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only mixture that perfectly matches the described 1H NMR spectrum is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
