    "To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the mean lifetime (τ) of the particle.**\n    The mean lifetime τ is related to the decay width Γ by the formula:\n    τ = ħ / Γ\n    where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s).\n\n    Given Γ_X = 320 MeV, the lifetime is:\n    τ = (6.582 x 10⁻²² MeV·s) / 320 MeV ≈ 2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s\n\n2.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ) and velocity (β).**\n    The Lorentz factor is the ratio of the particle's total energy (E) to its rest mass energy (m).\n    γ = E_X / m_X = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.667\n\n    The velocity β (in units of the speed of light, c) is related to the Lorentz factor by:\n    β = √(1 - 1/γ²)\n    β = √(1 - 1/(6.667)²) = √(1 - 1/44.449) = √(1 - 0.0225) = √0.9775 ≈ 0.9887\n\n3.  **Calculate the mean decay distance (L).**\n    In the laboratory frame, the particle's lifetime is dilated by the Lorentz factor (t' = γτ). The distance it travels before decaying is this dilated lifetime multiplied by its velocity.\n    L = v * γτ = (βc) * γ * τ\n\n    Substituting the values:\n    L ≈ 0.9887 * (3 x 10⁸ m/s) * 6.667 * (2.057 x 10⁻²⁴ s)\n    L ≈ 4.0655 x 10⁻¹⁵ m\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\nB) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁵ m\nC) 5.0223 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\nD) 4.0655 * 10⁻¹⁶ m\n\nThe calculated value matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
