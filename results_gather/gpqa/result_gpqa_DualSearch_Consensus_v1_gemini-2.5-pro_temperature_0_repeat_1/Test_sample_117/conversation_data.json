    "The reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine is an example of the alpha-halogenation of a carbonyl compound, which proceeds through an enol intermediate. Enols, which contain a carbon-carbon double bond with a hydroxyl group attached to one of the carbons, are the reactive intermediates in this type of reaction.\n\nThe key steps of the mechanism are as follows:\n*   The starting material, 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, is an enol. The double bond of the enol is electron-rich and acts as a nucleophile.\n*   This nucleophilic double bond attacks an electrophilic bromine molecule (Brâ‚‚).\n*   This results in the formation of a new carbon-bromine bond at the alpha-carbon (the carbon adjacent to the one with the hydroxyl group).\n*   Simultaneously, the enol rearranges to the more stable keto form. The hydroxyl group is converted into a carbonyl group (a ketone).\n\nIn the case of 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, the double bond is between carbon-1 and carbon-2, and the hydroxyl group is on carbon-1. The reaction with bromine will therefore add a bromine atom to carbon-2 and convert the hydroxyl group at carbon-1 into a ketone. The two methyl groups at carbon-4 are unaffected by the reaction.\n\nThe final product is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n*   A) and C) (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol and (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol would be the result of the addition of two bromine atoms across the double bond without the rearrangement of the enol to a ketone, which is not the major pathway.\n*   D) 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone would require the reaction to occur at the saturated carbon-4, which is not the reactive site of an enol.\n\n<<<B>>>"
