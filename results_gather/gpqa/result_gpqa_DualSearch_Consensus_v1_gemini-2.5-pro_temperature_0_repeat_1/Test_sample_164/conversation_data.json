    "### Correct Statement on Dual-Catalyst Ethylene Polymerization Identified\n\n**Of the four statements presented by a senior scientist regarding the production of a polymer with regular branches from only ethylene, the assertion that one can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators is the correct one.** This method is a known strategy to introduce regular branches into a polyethylene backbone using a dual-catalyst system where ethylene is the sole monomer.\n\nThe process involves a dual-catalyst system where one catalyst selectively oligomerizes ethylene into α-olefins, such as 1-hexene, and a second catalyst copolymerizes these in-situ generated α-olefins with the remaining ethylene. This results in a polyethylene chain with regular, short-chain branches.\n\nAn analysis of the four statements reveals the following:\n\n**A) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.**\nWhile noble metal catalysts, particularly those based on palladium, have been shown to be effective in the laboratory for producing branched polyethylene from ethylene through a \"chain-walking\" mechanism, their high cost is a significant barrier to large-scale industrial application. The economic viability of catalysts is a critical factor in industrial processes, and less expensive late-transition metals like nickel are often explored for this reason.\n\n**B) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.**\nThis statement is correct. Chromium, a group VIa transition metal, is a key component in catalysts used for the selective trimerization of ethylene to 1-hexene. These chromium-based catalysts are used in conjunction with activators, often aluminum-based compounds like methylaluminoxane (MAO), to facilitate the reaction. This production of 1-hexene from ethylene is the essential first step in a dual-catalyst system to create a regularly branched polymer. The in-situ-formed 1-hexene is then copolymerized with ethylene by a second catalyst.\n\n**C) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The essential additional reaction step is the oligomerization of ethylene. Research and industrial applications have repeatedly shown that aluminum-based activators, such as methylaluminoxane (MAO) and modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO), are not only effective but are commonly used to activate the chromium-based catalysts responsible for this oligomerization.\n\n**D) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.**\nThis statement is largely correct in a broader sense, as dual-reactor and dual-catalyst technologies are indeed used on an industrial scale in the U.S. by companies like Chevron Phillips Chemical and Dow for producing various grades of polyethylene, such as bimodal polyethylene. Specifically, the industrial production of 1-hexene from ethylene using chromium catalysts, a core component of the described system, has been commercialized. However, the statement in the context of a single integrated process for producing regularly branched polyethylene solely from ethylene might be more nuanced in its large-scale implementation compared to the production of bimodal high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Given the definitive correctness of statement B, it stands out as the most accurate and fundamental scientific principle among the choices.\n\n<<<B>>>"
