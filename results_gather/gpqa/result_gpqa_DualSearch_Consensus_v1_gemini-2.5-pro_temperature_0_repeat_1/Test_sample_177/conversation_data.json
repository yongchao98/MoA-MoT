    "To determine the mass dimension of κ and the renormalizability of the theory, we follow a step-by-step dimensional analysis in the framework of natural units (where ħ = c = 1) and a 4-dimensional spacetime.\n\n### Step 1: Mass Dimension of the Lagrangian Density (\\(\\mathcal{L}\\))\n\nThe action, \\(S\\), is a dimensionless quantity defined as the integral of the Lagrangian density, \\(\\mathcal{L}\\), over spacetime:\n\\[S = \\int d^4x \\, \\mathcal{L}\\]\nIn natural units, length and time have a mass dimension of -1. Therefore, the four-volume element \\(d^4x\\) has a mass dimension of \\([d^4x] = M^{-4}\\). For the action \\(S\\) to be dimensionless, the Lagrangian density \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) must have a mass dimension of +4.\n\\[[\\mathcal{L}] = M^4\\]\n\n### Step 2: Mass Dimension of the Fermion Field (\\(\\psi\\))\n\nThe kinetic term for a fermion field in the Dirac Lagrangian is \\(\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu\\psi\\). This term must have the same mass dimension as the Lagrangian density, i.e., \\(M^4\\). The derivative operator \\(\\partial_\\mu\\) has a mass dimension of +1. The gamma matrices \\(\\gamma^\\mu\\) are dimensionless.\n\\[[\\bar{\\psi}\\psi\\partial_\\mu] = M^4\\]\n\\[[\\bar{\\psi}][\\psi][\\partial_\\mu] = M^4\\]\nAssuming the field \\(\\psi\\) and its adjoint \\(\\bar{\\psi}\\) have the same mass dimension, we get:\n\\[[\\psi]^2 M^1 = M^4\\]\n\\[[\\psi]^2 = M^3\\]\n\\[[\\psi] = M^{3/2}\\]\nThus, the mass dimension of the fermion field \\(\\psi\\) is 3/2.\n\n### Step 3: Mass Dimension of the Field Strength Tensor (\\(F^{\\mu\\nu}\\))\n\nThe Lagrangian for the electromagnetic field is \\(\\mathcal{L}_{EM} = -\\frac{1}{4}F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}\\). This term must also have a mass dimension of \\(M^4\\).\n\\[[F^{\\mu\\nu}F_{\\mu\\nu}] = M^4\\]\n\\[[F^{\\mu\\nu}]^2 = M^4\\]\n\\[[F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^2\\]\nSo, the mass dimension of the electromagnetic field strength tensor \\(F^{\\mu\\nu}\\) is 2.\n\n### Step 4: Mass Dimension of the Coupling Constant (\\(\\kappa\\))\n\nNow we analyze the given interaction Lagrangian:\n\\[\\mathcal{L}_{int}=\\kappa\\bar{\\psi}\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi F^{\\mu\\nu}\\]\nThe tensor \\(\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is composed of gamma matrices and is therefore dimensionless. The entire interaction term must have a mass dimension of 4.\n\\[[\\mathcal{L}_{int}] = [\\kappa][\\bar{\\psi}][\\psi][\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}][F^{\\mu\\nu}] = M^4\\]\nSubstituting the mass dimensions we found:\n\\[[\\kappa] \\cdot (M^{3/2}) \\cdot (M^{3/2}) \\cdot (1) \\cdot (M^2) = M^4\\]\n\\[[\\kappa] \\cdot M^3 \\cdot M^2 = M^4\\]\n\\[[\\kappa] \\cdot M^5 = M^4\\]\n\\[[\\kappa] = M^{-1}\\]\nThe mass dimension of the coupling constant \\(\\kappa\\) is -1.\n\n### Step 5: Renormalizability of the Theory\n\nThe renormalizability of a quantum field theory can be determined by the mass dimension of its coupling constants. The criteria are as follows:\n*   **Renormalizable:** The coupling constant has a mass dimension greater than or equal to zero ([\\(g\\)] \\(\\ge 0\\)). Theories with dimensionless couplings ([\\(g\\)] = 0) are strictly renormalizable, while those with positive dimension couplings ([\\(g\\)] > 0) are super-renormalizable.\n*   **Non-renormalizable:** The coupling constant has a negative mass dimension ([\\(g\\)] < 0).\n\nIn this case, the mass dimension of \\(\\kappa\\) is -1, which is negative. A negative mass dimension for a coupling constant indicates that the theory is non-renormalizable. This is because, in perturbation theory, higher-order loop diagrams will have progressively worse ultraviolet divergences, requiring an infinite number of counter-terms to absorb them, which strips the theory of its predictive power at high energies.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mass dimension of \\(\\kappa\\) is -1, and because this dimension is negative, the theory is not renormalizable.\n\n<<<D>>>"
