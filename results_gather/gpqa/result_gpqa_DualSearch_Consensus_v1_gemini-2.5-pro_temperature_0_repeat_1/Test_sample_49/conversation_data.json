    "An analysis of the provided expression for the size estimate of the Feynman diagram allows for the determination of the number of loops it contained.\n\nIn quantum field theory calculations for four-dimensional spacetime, each loop in a Feynman diagram introduces a characteristic factor into the mathematical expression for the diagram's amplitude. This factor arises from the integration over the undetermined momentum flowing through the loop.\n\nThe standard loop integration measure is over a four-dimensional momentum `k`, written as `d⁴k / (2π)⁴`. When this integral is evaluated using common regularization techniques like dimensional regularization, it consistently produces a factor of `1 / (16π²)`, which can be expressed as `1 / (4π)²`.\n\nTherefore, a diagram with *L* loops will have a factor of `(1 / (4π)²)^L`, which simplifies to `1 / (4π)^(2L)`.\n\nThe expression found on the note is:\n`alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2`\n\nThe key term for determining the number of loops is `1/(4pi)^6`. By comparing this to the general formula `1/(4π)^(2L)`, we can equate the exponents:\n\n`2L = 6`\n\nSolving for *L*, the number of loops, we find:\n\n`L = 3`\n\nThe other components of the expression are consistent with a three-loop diagram:\n*   **`alpha^3 * g^2`**: These are coupling constants. `alpha` is the fine-structure constant. The powers of the coupling constants relate to the number and type of vertices where particles interact.\n*   **`(Q/M)^2`**: This is a ratio between two energy scales, `Q` and `M`, which is a typical feature of the final result of such a calculation.\n*   **`sqrt(2) * 8`**: These are numerical factors that can arise from the specific topology of the diagram (symmetry factors) or from evaluating traces of matrices associated with fermion loops.\n\nBased on the definitive `1/(4pi)^6` factor, the Feynman diagram must have contained three loops.\n\n<<<C>>>"
