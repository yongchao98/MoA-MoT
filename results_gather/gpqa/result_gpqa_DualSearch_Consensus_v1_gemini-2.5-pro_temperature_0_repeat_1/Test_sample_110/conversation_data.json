    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions to determine the major products.\n\n### **Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Michael addition reaction. The strong, bulky base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), will deprotonate the ketone at the α-carbon to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated ester, ethyl acrylate.\n\n2.  **Enolate Formation:** The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.\n    *   The α-carbon at position 2 is quaternary (bonded to an ethyl group and a methyl group) and has no protons to be removed.\n    *   The α-carbon at position 6 has one proton and a methyl group.\n    *   Therefore, the base will exclusively deprotonate the C6 carbon, forming the only possible enolate.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The C6 of the enolate attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-COOEt) in a 1,4-conjugate addition. This forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C6 of the cyclohexanone ring and the β-carbon of the ethyl acrylate.\n\n4.  **Product Structure (A):** After the attack and subsequent protonation (during workup), a `-CH₂-CH₂-COOEt` group is attached to the C6 carbon of the original cyclohexanone ring. The substituents on the ring are now:\n    *   C1: Carbonyl group (oxo)\n    *   C2: Ethyl and methyl groups\n    *   C6: Methyl group and the new ethyl 3-propanoate group.\n\n5.  **Nomenclature of Product A:** To name the product, we can treat the ethyl propanoate as the parent chain. The cyclohexyl ring is a substituent at position 3 of the propanoate chain. We number the cyclohexyl ring starting from the point of attachment as C1.\n    *   C1 (old C6) has a methyl group.\n    *   C2 (old C1) has the oxo group.\n    *   C3 (old C2) has an ethyl and a methyl group.\n    *   Therefore, the substituent is a `(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)` group.\n    *   The full name is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n\n### **Reaction B: 1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H₂O)**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is also a Michael addition. The base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), deprotonates the carbon α to the nitro group in 1-nitropropane, which is acidic. The resulting nitronate anion is a nucleophile.\n\n2.  **Nucleophile and Electrophile:**\n    *   **Nucleophile (Michael Donor):** The anion of 1-nitropropane, `CH₃-CH₂-CH⁻-NO₂`.\n    *   **Electrophile (Michael Acceptor):** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile), `CH₃-CH=CH-CN`.\n\n3.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** The nucleophilic carbon (C1 of the nitropropane) attacks the electrophilic β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile (C3 of the butene chain).\n\n4.  **Product Structure (B):** A new C-C bond forms between C1 of the nitropropane and C3 of the butenenitrile. After protonation, the resulting structure is `CH₃-CH₂-CH(NO₂)-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CN`.\n\n5.  **Nomenclature of Product B:** We identify the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the nitrile, -CN).\n    *   The chain is six carbons long, making it a hexanenitrile.\n    *   Numbering from the nitrile carbon as C1: `CN(1)-C(2)H₂-C(3)H(CH₃)-C(4)H(NO₂)-C(5)H₂-C(6)H₃`.\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at C3 and a nitro group at C4.\n    *   The full name is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   Product A is **ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate**.\n*   Product B is **3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile**.\n\nComparing this with the given options, the correct choice is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
