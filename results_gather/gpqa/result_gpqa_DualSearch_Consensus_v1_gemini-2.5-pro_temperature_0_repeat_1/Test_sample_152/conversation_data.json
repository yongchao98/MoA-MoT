    "Here is a breakdown of the three Michael addition reactions to determine the reactants and products.\n\n### Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) → (A)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Dimethyl malonate. In the presence of a base like sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), the acidic α-proton between the two ester groups is removed to form a resonance-stabilized enolate.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. This is an α,β-unsaturated ester, which is susceptible to nucleophilic attack at the β-carbon.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the β-carbon of the methyl acrylate derivative.\n    *   The resulting enolate intermediate is then protonated by the ethanol (EtOH) solvent to yield the final product.\n\n3.  **Product A:**\n    *   The attack of the dimethyl malonate enolate `[CH(COOCH₃)₂]⁻` onto the β-carbon of `(p-tolyl)-CH=CH-COOCH₃` results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond.\n    *   The final structure is `(p-tolyl)-CH(CH(COOCH₃)₂) - CH₂-COOCH₃`.\n    *   According to IUPAC nomenclature, this compound is named **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**.\n\n### Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H₃O⁺) → (B)\n\n1.  **Identify the Michael Donor and Acceptor:**\n    *   **Michael Donor:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. This is an enamine, formed from cyclohexanone and piperidine. Enamines are effective carbon nucleophiles at the α-carbon (the C2 of the cyclohexene ring). This type of reaction is known as the Stork enamine synthesis.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** (E)-but-2-enenitrile (also known as crotononitrile). This is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The nucleophilic α-carbon of the enamine attacks the β-carbon of the but-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This forms an iminium salt intermediate.\n    *   The addition of aqueous acid (H₃O⁺) in the workup step hydrolyzes the iminium salt, converting it back into a ketone.\n\n3.  **Product B:**\n    *   The reaction adds a `CH(CH₃)CH₂CN` group to the α-carbon of the original cyclohexanone.\n    *   The final product is a substituted cyclohexanone. The correct IUPAC name is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**.\n\n### Reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H₂O) → 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\n1.  **Identify the Knowns (Retro-synthesis):**\n    *   **Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n    *   **Michael Acceptor:** but-3-en-2-one (methyl vinyl ketone, MVK).\n    *   **Michael Donor:** Reactant C.\n\n2.  **Reaction Analysis:**\n    *   The Michael addition involves the formation of a bond between the donor (C) and the β-carbon of the acceptor (MVK).\n    *   The substituent on the product, the `-(CH₂)₂-CO-CH₃` (3-oxobutyl) group, is derived directly from the MVK molecule after the addition.\n    *   Therefore, the Michael donor (C) must be the rest of the molecule, which is **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**. The base (KOH) deprotonates the highly acidic proton at C2, located between the two carbonyl groups, to form the nucleophilic enolate.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of each reaction:\n*   **A** is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n*   **B** is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n*   **C** is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nThis combination matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
