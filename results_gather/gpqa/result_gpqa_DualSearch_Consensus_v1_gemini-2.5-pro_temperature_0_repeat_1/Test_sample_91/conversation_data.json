    "Here is a step-by-step calculation of the enthalpy of formation.\n\n**1. Determine the Molecular Formula**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms from the chemical formula (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.\n\n*   **(CH3)2C=**: 3 Carbon atoms, 6 Hydrogen atoms\n*   **=CH-**: 1 Carbon atom, 1 Hydrogen atom\n*   **-CH2-**: 1 Carbon atom, 2 Hydrogen atoms\n*   **-CH(CH3)-**: 2 Carbon atoms, 4 Hydrogen atoms\n*   **-CH2-**: 1 Carbon atom, 2 Hydrogen atoms\n*   **-CH=**: 1 Carbon atom, 1 Hydrogen atom\n*   **=C(CH3)2**: 3 Carbon atoms, 6 Hydrogen atoms\n\nAdding these up:\n*   **Total Carbon (C) atoms**: 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\n*   **Total Hydrogen (H) atoms**: 6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\n\nThe molecular formula is **C12H22**.\n\n**2. Count the Number of Each Type of Bond**\n\nNext, we need to count the number of C-H, C-C, and C=C bonds by examining the structure.\n\n*   **C-H bonds**: The total number of hydrogen atoms is 22, and each is bonded to a carbon atom, so there are **22 C-H bonds**.\n*   **C=C bonds**: The structure contains two double bonds (=), so there are **2 C=C bonds**.\n*   **C-C bonds**: We can count the single bonds between carbon atoms:\n    *   Two C-C bonds in (CH3)2C=\n    *   One C-C bond between =CH- and -CH2-\n    *   One C-C bond between -CH2- and -CH(CH3)-\n    *   One C-C bond within -CH(CH3)-\n    *   One C-C bond between -CH(CH3)- and -CH2-\n    *   One C-C bond between -CH2- and -CH=\n    *   Two C-C bonds in =C(CH3)2\n    *   Total C-C bonds = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = **9 C-C bonds**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Compound**\n\nThis is the energy required to break all the bonds in one mole of the compound.\n\n*   Energy from C-H bonds = 22 * (Bond energy of C-H) = 22 * 400 kJ/mol = 8800 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C=C bonds = 2 * (Bond energy of C=C) = 2 * 300 kJ/mol = 600 kJ/mol\n*   Energy from C-C bonds = 9 * (Bond energy of C-C) = 9 * 200 kJ/mol = 1800 kJ/mol\n\nTotal Enthalpy of Atomization = 8800 + 600 + 1800 = **11200 kJ/mol**.\n\n**4. Calculate the Enthalpy of Atomization of the Elements**\n\nThis is the energy required to form gaseous atoms from the elements in their standard state (12 moles of C(s) and 11 moles of H2(g)).\n\n*   Energy for Carbon = 12 * (Enthalpy of atomization of C) = 12 * 1000 kJ/mol = 12000 kJ/mol\n*   Energy for Hydrogen = 11 * (Bond energy of H-H) = 11 * 100 kJ/mol = 1100 kJ/mol\n\nTotal Enthalpy of Atomization of Elements = 12000 + 1100 = **13100 kJ/mol**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f)**\n\nThe enthalpy of formation is the difference between the enthalpy of atomization of the elements and the enthalpy of atomization of the compound.\n\n*   ΔH_f = (Enthalpy of atomization of elements) - (Enthalpy of atomization of compound)\n*   ΔH_f = 13100 kJ/mol - 11200 kJ/mol = **1900 kJ/mol**.\n\n**6. Convert Units to Match the Options**\n\nThe options are given in kJ/mol or kJ/g. Our result is 1900 kJ/mol. Let's convert this to kJ/g.\n\n*   Molar mass of C12H22 = (12 * 12.0 g/mol) + (22 * 1.0 g/mol) = 144 + 22 = 166 g/mol.\n*   ΔH_f in kJ/g = (1900 kJ/mol) / (166 g/mol) ≈ **11.44 kJ/g**.\n\nThis value matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
