    "To determine the probability that a measurement of the observable `P` will yield the value 0, we follow the principles of quantum mechanics. The calculation involves finding the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 and then projecting the given state of the system onto this eigenvector.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1.  **Define the State Vector and the Observable Operator:**\n    The state of the system, `|ψ⟩`, is given by the column matrix:\n    ```\n    |ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T\n    ```\n    The observable `P` is represented by the matrix:\n    ```\n    P = [ 0, 1/√2,  0 ]\n        [ 1/√2, 0, 1/√2 ]\n        [ 0, 1/√2,  0 ]\n    ```\n\n2.  **Find the Eigenvalues of the Operator P:**\n    To confirm that 0 is a possible measurement outcome, we find the eigenvalues (λ) by solving the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n    ```\n    det([ -λ, 1/√2,  0 ], [ 1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ], [ 0, 1/√2,  -λ ]) = 0\n    ```\n    This simplifies to:\n    ```\n    -λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = 0\n    -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = 0\n    -λ³ + λ = 0\n    λ(1 - λ²) = 0\n    ```\n    The eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, and λ = -1. Since 0 is an eigenvalue, it is a possible result of the measurement.\n\n3.  **Find the Eigenvector for the Eigenvalue λ = 0:**\n    We need to find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` that satisfies the equation `P|v₀⟩ = 0|v₀⟩`, which is `P|v₀⟩ = 0`.\n    Let `|v₀⟩ = [x, y, z]^T`.\n    ```\n    [ 0, 1/√2,  0 ] [x]   [0]\n    [ 1/√2, 0, 1/√2 ] [y] = [0]\n    [ 0, 1/√2,  0 ] [z]   [0]\n    ```\n    This gives the system of equations:\n    *   (1/√2)y = 0  =>  y = 0\n    *   (1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0  => x + z = 0 => x = -z\n\n    The eigenvector is of the form `[c, 0, -c]`. We can choose c=1 to get a representative eigenvector `[1, 0, -1]^T`. To work with it, we must normalize it:\n    *   Magnitude squared: `1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2`\n    *   Normalized eigenvector `|v₀⟩ = (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]^T`\n\n4.  **Normalize the State Vector |ψ⟩:**\n    The probability calculation requires the state vector to be normalized.\n    *   The squared norm is `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n    *   The normalized state vector `|ψ_norm⟩` is `(1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n    The probability of measuring an eigenvalue is the squared magnitude of the projection of the normalized state vector onto the corresponding normalized eigenvector.\n    `Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n\n    For the eigenvalue 0:\n    `Prob(0) = |⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩|²`\n\n    First, calculate the inner product `⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩`:\n    `⟨v₀|ψ_norm⟩ = ( (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1] ) ⋅ ( (1/√6) * [-1, 2, 1]^T )`\n    `= (1/√12) * (1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1)`\n    `= (1/√12) * (-1 - 1)`\n    `= -2 / √12 = -2 / (2√3) = -1/√3`\n\n    Now, square the magnitude to find the probability:\n    `Prob(0) = |-1/√3|² = 1/3`\n\nThe probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 is 1/3.\n\n<<<A>>>"
