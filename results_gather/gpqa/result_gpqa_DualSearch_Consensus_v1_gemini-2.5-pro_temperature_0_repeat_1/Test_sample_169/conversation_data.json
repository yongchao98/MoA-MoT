    "To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction (S_y) for an electron in the spin state (3i, 4), we follow these steps:\n\n**1. Normalize the Spin State**\nThe given unnormalized spin state is a column vector:\n|ψ⟩ = `[[3i], [4]]`\n\nThe corresponding bra vector is the conjugate transpose:\n⟨ψ| = `[-3i, 4]`\n\nTo normalize the state, we first calculate the inner product ⟨ψ|ψ⟩:\n⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = -9(i²) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25.\n\nThe normalization constant is the reciprocal of the square root of this value, which is 1/√25 = 1/5.\n\nThe normalized spin state is:\n|ψ_norm⟩ = (1/5) * `[[3i], [4]]`\n\n**2. Define the S_y Operator**\nThe spin operator S_y is defined in terms of the Pauli matrix σ_y and the reduced Planck constant ħ:\nS_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y\n\nGiven the matrix for σ_y:\nσ_y = `[[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n\nThe S_y operator is:\nS_y = (ħ/2) * `[[0, -i], [i, 0]]`\n\n**3. Calculate the Expectation Value**\nThe expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is calculated using the formula ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ_norm| S_y |ψ_norm⟩. This can also be written as (⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩) / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩.\n\nFirst, we apply the S_y operator to the unnormalized state |ψ⟩:\nS_y |ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * `[[0, -i], [i, 0]]` * `[[3i], [4]]`\nS_y |ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * `[[(0)(3i) + (-i)(4)], [(i)(3i) + (0)(4)]]`\nS_y |ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * `[[-4i], [3i²]]`\nS_y |ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * `[[-4i], [-3]]`\n\nNext, we calculate the inner product ⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩:\n⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = `[-3i, 4]` * (ħ/2) * `[[-4i], [-3]]`\n⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [(-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3)]\n⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [12i² - 12]\n⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-12 - 12]\n⟨ψ|S_y|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * [-24] = -12ħ\n\nFinally, we divide by the normalization factor ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 25:\n⟨S_y⟩ = (-12ħ) / 25\n\nThus, the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is -12ħ/25.\n\n<<<D>>>"
