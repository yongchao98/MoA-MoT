    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to identify compound D:\n\n1.  **Identify Compound A:**\n    *   The proton NMR spectrum shows a triplet for 6 hydrogens (6H) at 0.9 ppm and a quartet for 4 hydrogens (4H) at 1.3 ppm.\n    *   A 6H triplet suggests two equivalent methyl groups (-CH3), each adjacent to a methylene group (-CH2-).\n    *   A 4H quartet suggests two equivalent methylene groups (-CH2-), each adjacent to a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   This pattern is characteristic of two equivalent ethyl groups (CH3-CH2-). The low chemical shifts are typical for an alkane.\n    *   The subsequent reactions (monobromination followed by elimination to form geometric isomers) strongly point to the carbon skeleton being that of butane. While the proton NMR of butane is slightly more complex (the -CH2- signal is a multiplet, not a simple quartet), it is the most logical starting material that fits the reaction sequence. Thus, Compound A is butane (CH3CH2CH2CH3).\n\n2.  **Identify Compound B:**\n    *   Compound A (butane) undergoes monobromination. The bromination of an alkane proceeds via a free radical mechanism.\n    *   The bromine can substitute a hydrogen on a primary carbon (C1) or a secondary carbon (C2). Substitution at the secondary carbon is favored because it proceeds through a more stable secondary radical intermediate.\n    *   Therefore, the major product, Compound B, is 2-bromobutane (CH3CH(Br)CH2CH3).\n\n3.  **Identify Compound C:**\n    *   Compound B (2-bromobutane) reacts with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (KOH). This is a dehydrohalogenation reaction that proceeds via an E2 elimination mechanism.\n    *   According to Zaitsev's rule, the elimination will preferentially form the more substituted (more stable) alkene.\n    *   Elimination of HBr from 2-bromobutane can form but-1-ene (minor product) or but-2-ene (major product).\n    *   The problem states that Compound C has two geometrical isomers. But-2-ene (CH3-CH=CH-CH3) exists as cis ((Z)-but-2-ene) and trans ((E)-but-2-ene) isomers. But-1-ene does not have geometrical isomers.\n    *   Therefore, Compound C is but-2-ene.\n\n4.  **Identify Compound D:**\n    *   The cis-isomer of C, which is (Z)-but-2-ene, undergoes a Diels-Alder reaction with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol.\n    *   **Reactants:**\n        *   **Diene:** (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol. For the reaction, it must adopt an s-cis conformation. The substituents on the ends of the diene system (-OH at C1 and -CH3 at C4) are both in the \"E\" configuration, which means they both point \"outward\" in the s-cis conformation.\n        *   **Dienophile:** (Z)-but-2-ene. The two methyl groups are on the same side of the double bond (cis).\n    *   **Stereochemistry of the Diels-Alder Reaction:**\n        1.  **Diene Stereochemistry:** The \"outward\" pointing groups on the diene (-OH and -CH3) will end up on the same face of the newly formed cyclohexene ring. They will be *cis* to each other.\n        2.  **Dienophile Stereochemistry:** The *cis* relationship of the two methyl groups in the dienophile is retained in the product. They will be *cis* to each other.\n        3.  **Endo/Exo Selectivity:** The Diels-Alder reaction generally favors the *endo* product. In the endo transition state, the substituents of the dienophile (the two methyl groups) are oriented *trans* to the \"outward\" substituents of the diene (-OH and -CH3).\n    *   **Combining the Stereochemical Rules:**\n        *   The -OH at C1 and the -CH3 at C4 are *cis*.\n        *   The -CH3 at C5 and the -CH3 at C6 are *cis*.\n        *   The {C1-OH, C4-CH3} pair is *trans* to the {C5-CH3, C6-CH3} pair.\n    *   **Assigning R/S Configuration:**\n        *   Let's assume the -OH (C1) and the diene's -CH3 (C4) are \"up\" (wedge).\n        *   This means the dienophile's two -CH3 groups (C5 and C6) must be \"down\" (dash).\n        *   Assigning priorities and determining the configuration for each chiral center (C1, C4, C5, C6) based on this arrangement gives the stereochemistry **(1S, 4R, 5S, 6R)**.\n\nThe resulting compound D is (1S,4R,5S,6R)-4,5,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-enol.\n\n<<<B>>>"
