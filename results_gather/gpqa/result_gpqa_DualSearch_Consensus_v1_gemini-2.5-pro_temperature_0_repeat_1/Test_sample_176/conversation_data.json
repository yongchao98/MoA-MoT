    "Here is a step-by-step calculation to determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2.\n\n### 1. Stefan-Boltzmann Law\nThe luminosity (L) of a star, assuming it radiates as a perfect black body, is determined by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law. The formula for luminosity is:\n\nL = 4πR²σT⁴\n\nWhere:\n*   **L** is the luminosity\n*   **R** is the star's radius\n*   **σ** (sigma) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant\n*   **T** is the star's surface temperature in Kelvin\n\nTo find the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 (L₁) and Star_2 (L₂), we can set up the following equation:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (4πR₁²σT₁⁴) / (4πR₂²σT₂⁴)\n\nBy canceling out the constants (4, π, and σ), the formula simplifies to:\n\n**L₁ / L₂ = (R₁/R₂)² * (T₁/T₂)⁴**\n\n### 2. Radius Ratio\nThe problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2:\n\nR₁ = 1.5 * R₂\nTherefore, the ratio R₁/R₂ is 1.5.\n\nSquaring this ratio gives:\n(R₁/R₂)² = (1.5)² = 2.25\n\n### 3. Temperature Ratio\nTo find the temperature ratio, we use Wien's Displacement Law, which relates a star's temperature to the wavelength at which it emits the most light (its peak wavelength, λ_max). The law states that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature.\n\nThe problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars *appeared brightest* are the same. This refers to the observed peak wavelength, which can be affected by the star's motion relative to the observer due to the Doppler effect.\n\n*   **Star_1** has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, so its observed peak wavelength (λ_obs1) is the same as its intrinsic, or rest, peak wavelength (λ_rest1).\n*   **Star_2** has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. This velocity causes a redshift, meaning the light waves are stretched, and the observed wavelength is longer than the rest wavelength. The non-relativistic Doppler shift formula for light is: λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light (approximately 300,000 km/s).\n\nSince the observed peak wavelengths are equal (λ_obs1 = λ_obs2):\nλ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v₂/c)\n\nAccording to Wien's Law (λ_rest = b/T, where 'b' is Wien's constant), temperature is inversely proportional to the rest wavelength (T ∝ 1/λ_rest). Therefore, the ratio of the temperatures is the inverse of the ratio of their rest wavelengths:\n\nT₁/T₂ = λ_rest2 / λ_rest1\n\nFrom the Doppler relationship above, we can find this ratio:\nλ_rest2 / λ_rest1 = 1 / (1 + v₂/c)\n\nSo, the temperature ratio is:\nT₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + 700 km/s / 300,000 km/s)\nT₁/T₂ = 1 / (1 + 0.002333)\nT₁/T₂ ≈ 1 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.99767\n\n### 4. Final Luminosity Ratio Calculation\nNow, we can substitute the squared radius ratio and the fourth power of the temperature ratio back into the luminosity ratio formula:\n\nL₁ / L₂ = (2.25) * (0.99767)⁴\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907\nL₁ / L₂ ≈ 2.229\n\nThis value is closest to 2.23. The information about the stars' masses is not needed for this calculation and can be disregarded.\n\n<<<D>>>"
