    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatograms:\n\n### **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** The treatment of (E)-oct-4-ene (a trans-alkene) with mCPBA results in a *syn*-addition of an oxygen atom. This stereospecific reaction produces a trans-epoxide. Since the starting alkene is achiral, the product is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers: (4R,5R)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane and (4S,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The subsequent treatment with aqueous acid opens the epoxide ring via an *anti*-addition of a hydroxyl group.\n    *   The ring opening of the (4R,5R)-epoxide results in the formation of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Similarly, the ring opening of the (4S,5S)-epoxide also yields (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   This product, (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, has a plane of symmetry and is therefore a meso compound.\n\n**Product of Reaction 1:** A single product, the meso compound (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**\n\n1.  **Epoxidation:** The treatment of (Z)-oct-4-ene (a cis-alkene) with mCPBA also involves a *syn*-addition of oxygen. This reaction produces a cis-epoxide, which is a meso compound ((4R,5S)-4,5-di-n-propyloxirane) due to its internal plane of symmetry.\n2.  **Acid-Catalyzed Ring Opening:** The acid-catalyzed *anti*-addition of water opens the meso-epoxide ring.\n    *   Attack at one carbon of the epoxide yields (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol.\n    *   Attack at the other carbon yields its enantiomer, (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n**Product of Reaction 2:** A racemic mixture of (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol.\n\n### **Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe chemist combines the products from both reactions. The final mixture contains three distinct stereoisomers:\n*   **(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (the meso compound from Reaction 1)\n*   **(4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n*   **(4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol** (from Reaction 2)\n\nThe meso compound is a diastereomer to both the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers.\n\n### **Chromatographic Analysis**\n\n1.  **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC:**\n    *   Standard HPLC columns separate compounds based on physical properties like polarity but cannot distinguish between enantiomers.\n    *   Enantiomers have identical physical properties in an achiral environment and will therefore elute together as a single peak.\n    *   Diastereomers have different physical properties and can be separated.\n    *   In the mixture, the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers will co-elute, producing one peak. The meso-(4R,5S) compound is a diastereomer to the enantiomeric pair and will have a different retention time, producing a second peak.\n    *   Therefore, the standard HPLC chromatogram will show **2 peaks**.\n\n2.  **Chiral HPLC:**\n    *   Chiral HPLC columns use a chiral stationary phase (CSP) that interacts differently with each enantiomer, allowing for their separation.\n    *   The column will resolve the racemic mixture from Reaction 2 into two separate peaks for the (4R,5R) and (4S,5S) enantiomers.\n    *   The meso compound from Reaction 1 is a diastereomer to the other two compounds and will also be separated, appearing as a distinct, third peak.\n    *   Therefore, the chiral HPLC chromatogram will show **3 peaks**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the chemist will observe 2 peaks in the standard HPLC and 3 peaks in the chiral HPLC.\n\n<<<A>>>"
