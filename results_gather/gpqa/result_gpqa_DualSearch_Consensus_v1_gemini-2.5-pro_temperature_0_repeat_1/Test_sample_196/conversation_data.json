    "The analysis of the provided spectroscopic data and the subsequent reaction is as follows:\n\n### **Step 1: Identification of Compound X**\n\nFirst, we must determine the structure of the starting material, Compound X, from its Infrared (IR) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra.\n\n**IR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad):** This very broad signal is characteristic of the O-H stretching vibration in a carboxylic acid that is participating in hydrogen bonding.\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹:** This strong absorption corresponds to the C=O (carbonyl) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.\n*   **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹:** These peaks are in the region for C=C stretching, indicating the presence of an aromatic ring.\n\n**¹H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H):** This highly deshielded signal is a classic indicator of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).\n*   **8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (doublet, 2H):** These signals in the aromatic region suggest a para-substituted (1,4-disubstituted) benzene ring. The downfield shift of the doublet at 8.0 ppm indicates it is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the doublet at 7.2 ppm is adjacent to an electron-donating alkyl group.\n*   **The Alkyl Group (2.9 ppm, 1.7 ppm, 1.4 ppm, 0.9 ppm):**\n    *   **0.9 ppm (triplet, 3H):** A methyl group (-CH₃) coupled to a methylene group (-CH₂).\n    *   **1.4 ppm (doublet, 3H):** A methyl group (-CH₃) coupled to a methine group (-CH).\n    *   **1.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H):** A methylene group (-CH₂) coupled to both a methyl and a methine group.\n    *   **2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H):** A methine group (-CH) attached to the benzene ring and also coupled to the adjacent methyl and methylene groups.\n    \n    Assembling these fragments confirms the alkyl substituent is a **sec-butyl group** [-CH(CH₃)(CH₂CH₃)].\n\nBased on this combined spectral data, **Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This corresponds to option (B).\n\n### **Step 2: Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI**\n\nThe second step is to identify the product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus (Red P) and hydroiodic acid (HI).\n\nThis combination of reagents is a very strong reducing agent. It is known to reduce carboxylic acids completely to their corresponding alkanes. Specifically, the carboxyl group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The reaction is:\n\nR-COOH + 6HI --(Red P)--> R-CH₃ + 3I₂ + 2H₂O\n\nIn this case, the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction will reduce the carboxylic acid group at position 1 to a methyl group, while the sec-butyl group at position 4 will remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid\n*   **Reaction:** Reduction of the -COOH group to a -CH₃ group.\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy correctly identifying the starting material from the spectral data and knowing the outcome of the reaction with red phosphorus and HI, the final product is determined to be 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.\n\n<<<A>>>"
