    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the electric field at point P:\n\n1.  **Charge Induction:** The positive charge `+q` placed inside the cavity will attract the free electrons within the spherical conductor. This results in a total charge of `-q` being induced on the inner surface of the cavity.\n\n2.  **Charge on the Outer Surface:** Since the spherical conductor was initially uncharged, and a charge of `-q` has moved to the inner surface, a charge of `+q` must be induced on the outer surface of the conductor to maintain overall charge neutrality.\n\n3.  **Electrostatic Shielding:** A key principle of electrostatics is that a conductor shields its exterior from the electric fields of any charges located inside a cavity within it. The electric field inside the bulk of the conductor is zero. This means that the distribution of the charge `+q` on the outer surface is completely independent of the position of the charge `+q` inside the cavity.\n\n4.  **Distribution of Charge on the Outer Surface:** Because the outer surface of the conductor is a sphere, the induced charge `+q` will spread out uniformly over this surface to minimize electrostatic repulsion.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Electric Field:** For any point outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, Gauss's law tells us that the electric field is identical to that of a point charge with the same total charge located at the center of the sphere. In this case, the total charge on the outer surface is `+q`, and the center of the conductor is the reference point for the distance `L`.\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the electric field `E` at point P, which is at a distance `L` from the center of the spherical conductor, is given by the formula for a point charge:\n\n$E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$\n\nThe parameters `r`, `s`, `l`, and `Î¸`, which describe the geometry of the cavity and the position of the charge within it, are irrelevant to the electric field outside the conductor due to the shielding effect.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, the correct choice is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
