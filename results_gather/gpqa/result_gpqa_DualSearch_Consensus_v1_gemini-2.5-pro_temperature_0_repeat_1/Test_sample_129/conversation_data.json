    "To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of large neutral hydrogen clouds that absorb Lyman-alpha radiation so they can be detected by optical ground-based telescopes, we need to consider the wavelength of Lyman-alpha emission and the atmospheric window for optical observations.\n\nThe Lyman-alpha (Ly-α) transition of neutral hydrogen occurs at a wavelength of approximately 1216 Angstroms (Å). This wavelength falls within the ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Earth's atmosphere is largely opaque to UV radiation, meaning this light from space is absorbed by the atmosphere and does not reach ground-based telescopes.\n\nOptical ground-based telescopes operate within the \"optical window,\" which is a range of wavelengths that can pass through the atmosphere. This window typically starts at the edge of the near-ultraviolet, around 3500-4000 Å, and extends through the visible spectrum to the near-infrared. For a Lyman-alpha absorption feature to be detectable from the ground, its wavelength must be shifted by the expansion of the universe into this observable range.\n\nThis shift in wavelength is quantified by the redshift (z), according to the formula:\n\nz = (λ_observed / λ_emitted) - 1\n\nWhere:\n*   λ_emitted is the rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line (1216 Å).\n*   λ_observed is the wavelength at which the line is detected by the telescope.\n\nTo find the *lower limit* on the redshift, we must use the shortest possible observed wavelength, which corresponds to the lower boundary of the optical atmospheric window. Using a conservative lower limit of approximately 3500 Å for ground-based observations:\n\nz = (3500 Å / 1216 Å) - 1\nz ≈ 2.88 - 1\nz ≈ 1.88\n\nThis calculated redshift is very close to 1.9. If the redshift were any lower, the absorbed wavelength would be shorter than ~3500 Å and would be blocked by the atmosphere. Therefore, a redshift of at least 1.9 is required. This is consistent with astronomical observations, which typically study the \"Lyman-alpha forest\" from the ground at redshifts of 2 and higher.\n\nBased on this calculation, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n<<<A>>>"
