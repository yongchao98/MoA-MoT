    "To find the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical particle, we first need to express the given potential in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nThe potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) as:\nV(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²(θ)\n\nThe transformation from polar to Cartesian coordinates is:\nx = r cos(θ)\ny = r sin(θ)\nr² = x² + y²\n\nSubstituting these into the potential energy equation:\nV(x, y) = 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 k(x²)\nV(x, y) = 1/2 kx² + 1/2 ky² + 3/2 kx²\nV(x, y) = (1/2 k + 3/2 k)x² + 1/2 ky²\nV(x, y) = 2kx² + 1/2 ky²\n\nThis potential is recognizable as the potential for a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator. The potential is separable, meaning it can be written as a sum of potentials for each coordinate: V(x, y) = Vₓ(x) + Vᵧ(y).\n\nThe Schrödinger equation for this system is also separable. The total energy E will be the sum of the energies for the independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators in the x and y directions, E = Eₓ + Eᵧ.\n\n**1. Energy in the x-direction (Eₓ):**\n\nThe potential in the x-direction is Vₓ(x) = 2kx².\nThis can be written in the standard form for a 1D harmonic oscillator, V(x) = 1/2 k'x², where the effective spring constant is k' = 4k.\nThe angular frequency for this oscillator is ωₓ = √(k'/m) = √(4k/m) = 2√(k/m).\nThe energy levels for a 1D quantum harmonic oscillator are given by Eₙ = (n + 1/2)ħω.\nTherefore, the energy levels for the x-direction are:\nEₙₓ = (nₓ + 1/2)ħωₓ = (nₓ + 1/2)ħ * 2√(k/m)\n\n**2. Energy in the y-direction (Eᵧ):**\n\nThe potential in the y-direction is Vᵧ(y) = 1/2 ky².\nThis is already in the standard form for a 1D harmonic oscillator with a spring constant k.\nThe angular frequency for this oscillator is ωᵧ = √(k/m).\nThe energy levels for the y-direction are:\nEₙᵧ = (nᵧ + 1/2)ħωᵧ = (nᵧ + 1/2)ħ√(k/m)\n\n**3. Total Energy Spectrum (E):**\n\nThe total energy is the sum of the energies in the x and y directions:\nE = Eₙₓ + Eₙᵧ\nE = (nₓ + 1/2)ħ * 2√(k/m) + (nᵧ + 1/2)ħ√(k/m)\nE = [2(nₓ + 1/2) + (nᵧ + 1/2)] ħ√(k/m)\nE = [2nₓ + 1 + nᵧ + 1/2] ħ√(k/m)\nE = (2nₓ + nᵧ + 3/2)ħ√(k/m)\n\nComparing this result with the given options, it matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
