    "To determine which exoplanet has the highest density, let's analyze each option:\n\n*   **a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet:** By definition, this planet would have the same average density as Earth, which is approximately 5.51 g/cm³.\n\n*   **b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³:** This planet's density is stated to be about 5.5 g/cm³, which is very close to Earth's density.\n\n*   **c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth:** For planets with the same composition, a more massive planet will have a stronger gravitational pull, causing it to be more compressed. This gravitational compression results in a higher density. Therefore, a planet that is 5 times more massive than Earth but has the same composition will be significantly denser than Earth.\n\n*   **d) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth:** In contrast to the more massive planet, a planet with less mass will experience less gravitational compression. Consequently, a planet with half the mass of Earth but the same composition will be less dense than Earth.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the options, the planet described in option (c) will have the highest density. Its substantial mass (5 times that of Earth) leads to intense gravitational compression, making it denser than the other planets listed.\n\n<<<C>>>"
