  "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\nA) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nB) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\nC) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nD) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the experimental results:\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of G2:**\n    *   The single mutant `g2` shows 0% resistance, a complete loss of the wild-type phenotype. This indicates that G2 is an essential gene for anthracnose resistance.\n    *   The double mutants `g1g2` and `g2g3` also show 0% resistance. Their phenotype is identical to the `g2` single mutant.\n    *   This is a classic example of **epistasis**, where the phenotype of one gene mutation (g2) masks the phenotype of another gene mutation (g1 or g3). Specifically, `g2` is epistatic to both `g1` and `g3`.\n    *   When a gene is epistatic to others in a pathway, it usually means it acts upstream. Given that at least one gene is a transcription factor, the most logical conclusion is that **G2 is a transcription factor** that is required to activate the expression of both G1 and G3. Without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can function, leading to a complete loss of resistance.\n\n2.  **Analyze the roles of G1 and G3:**\n    *   The single mutants `g1` (75% resistance) and `g3` (50% resistance) both show a partial loss of resistance. This means both genes contribute to the final resistance phenotype, with G3 having a larger individual contribution than G1.\n    *   They are downstream of the transcription factor G2.\n\n3.  **Analyze the interaction between G1 and G3:**\n    *   If the effects of G1 and G3 were simply additive, the resistance of the `g1g3` double mutant would be expected to be around 25% (starting from 100%, losing 25% from g1 and 50% from g3, resulting in 25%).\n    *   However, the `g1g3` double mutant has only 10% resistance. This phenotype is much more severe than either single mutant and also more severe than a simple additive effect.\n    *   This synergistic interaction, where the combined effect is greater than the sum of the individual effects, suggests that G1 and G3 have partially overlapping functions. This is a form of **gene redundancy**. They likely act in two parallel pathways that contribute to resistance, and the loss of both pathways is nearly catastrophic.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n\n    *   **A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** G2 being a TF is correct. We cannot determine pleiotropy (one gene affecting multiple traits) from this experiment. \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is incorrect; the double mutant phenotype (10%) is not the same as the g1 phenotype (75%).\n    *   **B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1:** G2 being a TF is correct. We cannot conclude they have the same promoter from this data. \"G3 is epistatic towards G1\" is incorrect; the double mutant phenotype (10%) is not the same as the g3 phenotype (50%).\n    *   **C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3:** G2 being a TF is correct. G1 and G3 showing gene redundancy (interpreted as partial redundancy causing a synergistic effect) is also a correct interpretation of the data. The statement \"G1 is epistatic towards G3\" is factually incorrect based on the standard definition of masking epistasis. However, the first two statements are the most accurate conclusions from the experiment.\n    *   **D) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1:** \"G1 is a transcription factor\" is incorrect, as G2 is the clear upstream regulator. While \"G2 is epistatic towards G1\" is a correct statement, the primary premise of the option is wrong.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOption C provides the two most important and correct conclusions from the experiment: G2 is the upstream transcription factor, and G1 and G3 function with partial redundancy. Although the final clause about epistasis between G1 and G3 is incorrect as stated, Option C is the best description of the genetic interactions among the given choices.\n\n<<<C>>>"
