    "To determine the percentage of the dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂], among all cobalt-containing species, we must calculate the mole fraction of this specific complex.\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt, c(Co), is the sum of the concentrations of the free Co(II) ion and all the thiocyanato complexes formed in solution:\nc(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [[Co(SCN)]⁺] + [[Co(SCN)₂]] + [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] + [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻]\n\nThe concentration of each complex can be expressed using the overall stability constants (β) and the concentrations of the free metal ion [Co²⁺] and the ligand [SCN⁻]:\n*   [[Co(SCN)]⁺] = β₁[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]\n*   [[Co(SCN)₂]] = β₂[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]²\n*   [[Co(SCN)₃]⁻] = β₃[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]³\n*   [[Co(SCN)₄]²⁻] = β₄[Co²⁺][SCN⁻]⁴\n\nThe mole fraction (α₂) of the [Co(SCN)₂] complex is the ratio of its concentration to the total cobalt concentration:\nα₂ = [[Co(SCN)₂]] / c(Co)\n\nBy substituting the expressions for the complex concentrations, we can derive a formula for α₂ that depends only on the ligand concentration and the stability constants:\nα₂ = (β₂[SCN⁻]²) / (1 + β₁[SCN⁻] + β₂[SCN⁻]² + β₃[SCN⁻]³ + β₄[SCN⁻]⁴)\n\nNow, we can insert the given values into this formula:\n*   [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M\n*   β₁ = 9\n*   β₂ = 40\n*   β₃ = 63\n*   β₄ = 16\n\nFirst, let's calculate the value of each term in the denominator:\n*   1\n*   β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 × (0.1) = 0.9\n*   β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × (0.1)² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4\n*   β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × (0.1)³ = 63 × 0.001 = 0.063\n*   β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × (0.1)⁴ = 16 × 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nThe sum of these terms (the denominator) is:\n1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nThe numerator is the term for the dithiocyanato complex:\nβ₂[SCN⁻]² = 0.4\n\nNow, we calculate the mole fraction α₂:\nα₂ = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916\n\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\nPercentage = 0.16916 × 100 ≈ 16.9%\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex in the solution is approximately 16.9%.\n\n<<<C>>>"
