    "The expressions for the scalar potential (V) and vector potential ($\\vec{A}$) for a moving point charge are known as the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials describe the complete, relativistically correct, time-varying electromagnetic field for a point charge in arbitrary motion.\n\nThe potentials are evaluated at the observation point $\\vec{r}$ and time $t$, but they depend on the properties of the charge at an earlier \"retarded\" time, $t_r$. This is the time at which the electromagnetic signal must have been emitted from the charge's position, $\\vec{s}(t_r)$, to reach the observer at $\\vec{r}$ at time $t$.\n\nThe correct formulas for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\left[ \\dfrac{q}{d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\dfrac{q\\vec{v}}{d - \\dfrac{\\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}} \\right]$\n\nHere, the terms in the square brackets are evaluated at the retarded time $t_r$. The vector $\\vec{d}$ is the vector from the retarded position of the charge to the observation point, and $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n\nTo match these standard forms with the given options, we can manipulate the denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $c$:\n\n$V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o} \\dfrac{qc}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_o (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nSimilarly, for the vector potential:\n\n$\\vec{A}(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{\\mu_o}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{qc\\vec{v}}{d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v}} = \\dfrac{\\mu_o qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d} \\cdot \\vec{v})}$\n\nComparing these derived expressions with the given choices, we find that they match option B. It is also worth noting that the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is related to the scalar potential $V$ by the expression $\\vec{A} = \\dfrac{\\vec{v}}{c^2} V$.\n\n<<<B>>>"
