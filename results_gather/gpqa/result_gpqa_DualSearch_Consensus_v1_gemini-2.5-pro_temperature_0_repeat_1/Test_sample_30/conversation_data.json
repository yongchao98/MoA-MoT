    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product and its molecular symmetry group.\n\n### **Step 1: Toluene to Product 1**\n\nToluene is treated with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO₃) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This is a classic electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction known as nitration. The methyl group (-CH₃) on toluene is an ortho-, para-directing activator. This means the nitro group (-NO₂) will primarily be added at the positions ortho (adjacent) or para (opposite) to the methyl group. Due to less steric hindrance, the major product is the para isomer.\n\n*   **Product 1:** p-nitrotoluene (4-nitrotoluene)\n\n### **Step 2: Product 1 to Product 2**\n\nProduct 1 (p-nitrotoluene) is treated with manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). This combination of reagents acts as a strong oxidizing agent. It selectively oxidizes the activated methyl group of p-nitrotoluene to a carboxylic acid. The nitro group is resistant to this oxidation. Some sources also mention that MnO₂/H₂SO₄ can be used to oxidize toluene derivatives to the corresponding benzaldehyde, but oxidation to the carboxylic acid is also well-documented, especially under vigorous conditions. However, for the subsequent reaction to proceed as described, an aldehyde is required. Let's assume conditions are controlled to favor the formation of the aldehyde.\n\n*   **Product 2:** p-nitrobenzaldehyde (4-nitrobenzaldehyde)\n\n### **Step 3: Product 2 to Product 3**\n\nProduct 2 (p-nitrobenzaldehyde) is treated with acetone ((CH₃)₂CO) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a base-catalyzed crossed-aldol condensation, specifically known as the Claisen-Schmidt condensation. The hydroxide ion removes an acidic α-hydrogen from acetone to form an enolate. This enolate then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of p-nitrobenzaldehyde (which has no α-hydrogens and cannot self-condense). The initial aldol addition product quickly undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated ketone.\n\n*   **Product 3:** (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one\n\n### **Step 4: Molecular Symmetry of Product 3**\n\nThe final product is (E)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)but-3-en-2-one. To determine its molecular symmetry group, we must analyze its structure for symmetry elements (axes of rotation, planes of symmetry, center of inversion).\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule consists of a p-nitrophenyl group connected to a but-3-en-2-one chain via the C=C double bond. Due to extensive conjugation, the benzene ring, the C=C double bond, and the C=O group all tend to lie in the same plane.\n*   **Symmetry Elements:**\n    *   **Axis of Rotation (Cn):** There are no C₂ or higher-order rotation axes. Rotating the molecule 180° about any axis does not result in an identical configuration.\n    *   **Center of Inversion (i):** The molecule does not possess a center of inversion.\n    *   **Plane of Symmetry (σ):** Assuming the main framework of the molecule is planar, the plane containing the benzene ring and the enone system is a plane of symmetry. This plane bisects the methyl group's hydrogen atoms and the oxygen atoms of the nitro group.\n\nSince the only symmetry elements present are the identity element (E) and a single plane of symmetry (σ), the molecule belongs to the **Cs** point group.\n\n<<<C>>>"
