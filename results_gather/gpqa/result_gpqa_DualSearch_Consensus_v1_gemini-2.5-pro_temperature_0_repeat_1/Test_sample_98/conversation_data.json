    "The initial analysis of the four structures was a good starting point. The FTIR data confirms a carboxylic acid, and the 1H NMR data is key to distinguishing the isomers. The crucial pieces of information are the presence of two specific complex multiplets: a doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq) and a doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt).\n\nMy initial analysis found a potential `dtq` in molecule A and D, and a potential `dtt` in molecule B and C. However, I did not find a single molecule that clearly exhibited both splitting patterns. This suggests a more detailed look at the structures is necessary, as complex splitting can sometimes be non-intuitive.\n\nLet's re-evaluate each structure systematically, looking for protons that could give rise to these specific patterns.\n\n*   **A) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH**\n    *   Structure: `CH3(a)-CH2(b)-CH(c)(CH3(d))-CH(e)(CH3(f))-COOH(g)`\n    *   **Proton H(c):** This proton is on a chiral center. It is coupled to:\n        *   The two `H(b)` protons (a CH2 group), which would cause a **triplet**.\n        *   The single `H(e)` proton, which would cause a **doublet**.\n        *   The three `H(d)` protons (a CH3 group), which would cause a **quartet**.\n        *   Combining these, the signal for H(c) would be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This is a perfect match for the first signal described.\n    *   **Proton H(e):** This is the other proton on a chiral center. It is coupled to:\n        *   The single `H(c)` proton, which would cause a **doublet**.\n        *   The three `H(f)` protons (a CH3 group), which would cause a **quartet**.\n        *   The signal for H(e) would be a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. This does not match the `dtt` signal.\n    *   Let's re-examine the other protons in molecule A to be certain.\n    *   **Protons H(b):** These two protons are coupled to:\n        *   The three `H(a)` protons, causing a **triplet**.\n        *   The single `H(c)` proton, causing a **doublet**.\n        *   The signal for H(b) would be a **doublet of triplets (dt)**. This does not match the `dtt` signal.\n    *   Based on this analysis, molecule A contains the `dtq` signal but not the `dtt` signal.\n\n*   **B) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH**\n    *   Structure: `CH3(a)-CH2(b)-CH(c)(CH2(d)CH3(e))-CH(f)(CH2(g)CH3(h))-COOH(i)`\n    *   **Proton H(c):** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The two `H(b)` protons, causing a **triplet**.\n        *   The single `H(f)` proton, causing a **doublet**.\n        *   The two `H(d)` protons, causing a **triplet**.\n        *   Combining these, the signal for H(c) would be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This is a perfect match for the second signal described.\n    *   **Proton H(f):** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The single `H(c)` proton, causing a **doublet**.\n        *   The two `H(g)` protons, causing a **triplet**.\n        *   The signal for H(f) would be a **doublet of triplets (dt)**. This does not match the `dtq` signal.\n    *   Let's examine one of the methylene groups on the ethyl side chains, for example, `H(d)`.\n    *   **Protons H(d):** These two protons are coupled to:\n        *   The single `H(c)` proton, causing a **doublet**.\n        *   The three `H(e)` protons, causing a **quartet**.\n        *   The signal for H(d) would be a **doublet of quartets (dq)**. This does not match the `dtq` signal.\n    *   Based on this analysis, molecule B contains the `dtt` signal but not the `dtq` signal.\n\n*   **C) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH**\n    *   Structure: `CH3(a)-CH(b)(CH2(c)CH3(d))-CH(e)(CH2(f)CH3(g))-CH2(h)-COOH(i)`\n    *   **Proton H(e):** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The single `H(b)` proton, causing a **doublet**.\n        *   The two `H(f)` protons, causing a **triplet**.\n        *   The two `H(h)` protons, causing a **triplet**.\n        *   Combining these, the signal for H(e) would be a **doublet of triplets of triplets (dtt)**. This is a perfect match for the second signal described.\n    *   Now, let's search for the `dtq` signal.\n    *   **Proton H(b):** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The three `H(a)` protons, causing a **quartet**.\n        *   The single `H(e)` proton, causing a **doublet**.\n        *   The two `H(c)` protons, causing a **triplet**.\n        *   Combining these, the signal for H(b) would be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This is a perfect match for the first signal described.\n    *   Molecule C is the only structure that contains protons which would give rise to both a **doublet of triplets of quartets** and a **doublet of triplets of triplets**.\n\n*   **D) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH**\n    *   Structure: `CH3(a)-CH(b)(CH3(c))-CH(d)(CH3(e))-CH2(f)-COOH(g)`\n    *   **Proton H(d):** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The single `H(b)` proton, causing a **doublet**.\n        *   The three `H(e)` protons, causing a **quartet**.\n        *   The two `H(f)` protons, causing a **triplet**.\n        *   The signal for H(d) would be a **doublet of triplets of quartets (dtq)**. This matches the first signal.\n    *   **Proton H(b):** This proton is coupled to:\n        *   The three `H(a)` protons, causing a **quartet**.\n        *   The three `H(c)` protons, causing a **quartet**.\n        *   The single `H(d)` proton, causing a **doublet**.\n        *   The signal for H(b) would be a complex multiplet, a **doublet of quartets of quartets**, not a `dtt`.\n    *   Therefore, molecule D does not fit all the data.\n\nFinal Conclusion: Molecule C is the only one that can produce both of the complex splitting patterns described in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\nFinal check:\n- Molecule C: `CH3(a)-CH(b)(CH2(c)CH3(d))-CH(e)(CH2(f)CH3(g))-CH2(h)-COOH(i)`\n- Signal 1 (dtq): Proton H(b) is split by H(e) (doublet), H(c) (triplet), and H(a) (quartet). This gives a dtq.\n- Signal 2 (dtt): Proton H(e) is split by H(b) (doublet), H(f) (triplet), and H(h) (triplet). This gives a dtt.\n- Both required signals are present in molecule C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
