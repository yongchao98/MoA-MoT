    "In a synthetic organic chemistry lab, the phrase \"my compounds are on top of each other\" is a common way to describe a failed or difficult separation of substances. This statement most likely refers to the results of a chromatography experiment, a technique widely used to purify compounds.\n\nIn methods like Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) or column chromatography, a mixture is applied to a stationary phase, such as silica gel, and a solvent, the mobile phase, moves the compounds. The separation of these compounds depends on their differing affinities for the stationary and mobile phases, a property primarily governed by their polarity.\n\nWhen compounds have similar polarities, they travel at nearly the same rate through the stationary phase. This results in their spots overlapping on a TLC plate or them eluting from a column at the same time, a phenomenon known as co-elution. Consequently, the chemist is unable to isolate the desired compound from impurities or other products, leading to the lament that the compounds are \"on top of each other.\"\n\nWhile other properties can be similar among compounds, they are less relevant to this specific expression in the context of routine purification in a synthetic organic chemistry lab:\n*   **Similar boiling points** would be a problem for separation by distillation, but the phrasing \"on top of each other\" is characteristic of chromatographic separation.\n*   **Non-covalent/van der Waals interactions** are indeed the basis for how compounds interact with the chromatography medium, but stating the compounds have similar polarities is a more direct and common explanation for poor separation.\n*   **Similar optical rotations** are a characteristic of chiral compounds and are not the basis for separation in standard laboratory chromatography techniques like TLC or column chromatography.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate interpretation of the chemist's predicament is that the compounds in the mixture possess similar polarities, making their separation by chromatography challenging.\n\n<<<A>>>"
