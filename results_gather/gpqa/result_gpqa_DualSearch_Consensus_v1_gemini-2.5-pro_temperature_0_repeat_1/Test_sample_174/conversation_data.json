    "An oscillating charge distribution, particularly one with a defined axis of symmetry like a spheroid oscillating along its symmetry axis (the z-axis), can be modeled as an oscillating electric dipole. The principles of electric dipole radiation govern the characteristics of the emitted electromagnetic waves.\n\nThe power radiated per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) from an oscillating electric dipole is not uniform in all directions. It depends on the angle θ between the direction of observation and the axis of the dipole's oscillation. The formula for this angular distribution is:\n\ndP/dΩ ∝ sin²(θ)\n\nThe maximum radiated power, A, occurs where sin²(θ) is at its maximum value of 1, which happens at θ = 90 degrees (in the plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis).\n\nTo find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle of θ = 30°, we can set up a ratio:\n\n(Power at 30°) / (Maximum Power) = sin²(30°) / sin²(90°)\n\nSince sin(30°) = 1/2 and sin(90°) = 1, the calculation is:\n\n(1/2)² / 1² = 1/4\n\nTherefore, the power radiated at 30° is 1/4 of the maximum power A.\n\nNext, we consider the dependence of the radiated power on the wavelength (λ). The total power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of the angular frequency (ω) of oscillation. The relationship between angular frequency and wavelength is given by ω = 2πc/λ, where c is the speed of light.\n\nThis means the radiated power is proportional to (1/λ)⁴, or λ⁻⁴. This relationship, where the radiated power is strongly dependent on the frequency (and thus inversely on the wavelength), is a key characteristic of dipole radiation.\n\nCombining these two findings, the fraction of the maximum power A radiated at an angle of 30° is 1/4, and the possible form of the function f, representing the dependence on wavelength, is λ⁻⁴.\n\n<<<D>>>"
