    "The process taking place is **somatic hypermutation (SHM)**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the events described and why they point to somatic hypermutation:\n\n*   **Antigen Delivery to Peyer's Patches:** The oral gavage delivers the rotavirus proteins to the gut. Peyer's patches are a crucial part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), where immune responses to intestinal antigens are initiated. The fluorescence in these patches confirms the antigen has reached its target and is being processed.\n*   **Proliferating Cell Population:** When B cells in a secondary lymphoid organ like a Peyer's patch recognize an antigen, they become activated and start to proliferate rapidly within structures called germinal centers. This matches the isolation of a \"proliferating cell population.\"\n*   **High Variability in the Variable Heavy Chain Gene:** This is the most definitive clue. Somatic hypermutation is a process that deliberately introduces a high rate of point mutations specifically into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin (antibody) genes of proliferating B cells. This process diversifies the B cell receptors, allowing for the selection of cells that bind more strongly to the antigenâ€”a process called affinity maturation. The observation of \"high variability\" in the sequenced variable heavy chain gene is the direct result of SHM.\n\n### Why the other options are incorrect:\n\n*   **A) Class switching recombination:** This process changes the *constant* region of the heavy chain (e.g., from IgM to IgA), which alters the antibody's function, but it does not affect the *variable* region responsible for antigen binding. The high variability was observed in the variable region.\n*   **B) VDJ recombination:** This is the initial gene rearrangement process that creates the primary B cell receptor diversity in developing B cells *before* they encounter an antigen. It does not happen again in mature B cells that are proliferating in response to an antigen.\n*   **D) Complement activation:** This is a component of the innate and adaptive immune system involving a cascade of proteins that help clear pathogens. It does not involve genetic mutations in B cells.\n\nTherefore, the combination of a proliferating B cell population in a Peyer's patch after antigen stimulation, coupled with high mutation rates in the variable gene region, is the classic signature of somatic hypermutation occurring within a germinal center.\n\n<<<C>>>"
