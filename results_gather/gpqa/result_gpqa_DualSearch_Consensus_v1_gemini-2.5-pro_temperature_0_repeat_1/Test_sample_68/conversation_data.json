    "To solve this problem, we must first calculate the mean distance the particle X⁰ travels in the bubble chamber before it decays. This distance is known as the decay length.\n\n### 1. Interpretation of the Given Energy\nIn particle physics problems, \"energy\" can sometimes be ambiguous. It could refer to total energy or kinetic energy. Let's analyze both possibilities. The rest mass of the particle is given as $m_0 = 3.41 \\text{ GeV/c}^2$, which corresponds to a rest energy of $E_0 = 3.41 \\text{ GeV}$. The energy in the chamber is given as 27 GeV.\n\n*   **Case 1: 27 GeV is the total energy ($E_{total}$)**\n    The total energy is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy ($E_{total} = E_0 + K$). If $E_{total} = 27 \\text{ GeV}$, this is a valid physical scenario since $E_{total} > E_0$.\n\n*   **Case 2: 27 GeV is the kinetic energy (K)**\n    In this case, the total energy would be $E_{total} = K + E_0 = 27 \\text{ GeV} + 3.41 \\text{ GeV} = 30.41 \\text{ GeV}$.\n\nGiven the multiple-choice options, we will proceed by calculating the decay length for both cases and see which one matches an option.\n\n### 2. Calculation of the Mean Decay Length\nThe mean decay length ($\\lambda$) is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. For a relativistic particle, this is given by the formula $\\lambda = v \\cdot \\tau_{lab}$, where $v$ is the particle's velocity and $\\tau_{lab}$ is its lifetime as measured in the lab frame. The lab lifetime is dilated due to relativistic effects: $\\tau_{lab} = \\gamma \\cdot \\tau_0$, where $\\tau_0$ is the proper lifetime and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\nThe decay length can be calculated more directly using the particle's momentum ($p$) and mass ($m_0$) with the formula:\n$\\lambda = \\frac{p}{m_0} \\cdot c \\cdot \\tau_0$\n\nFirst, we need to find the momentum, which is related to total energy and rest energy by $E_{total}^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2$.\n\n**Calculation for Case 1 ($E_{total} = 27$ GeV):**\n*   Momentum: $(pc)^2 = E_{total}^2 - E_0^2 = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 \\text{ GeV}^2$.\n    $pc = \\sqrt{717.3719} \\approx 26.78 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Mean Decay Length:\n    $\\lambda = \\frac{26.78 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV/c}^2} \\cdot c \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) = 7.854 \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $\\lambda \\approx 1.88 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n\n**Calculation for Case 2 ($E_{total} = 30.41$ GeV):**\n*   Momentum: $(pc)^2 = E_{total}^2 - E_0^2 = (30.41)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 924.7681 - 11.6281 = 913.14 \\text{ GeV}^2$.\n    $pc = \\sqrt{913.14} \\approx 30.22 \\text{ GeV}$.\n*   Mean Decay Length:\n    $\\lambda = \\frac{30.22 \\text{ GeV}}{3.41 \\text{ GeV/c}^2} \\cdot c \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}) = 8.862 \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s})$\n    $\\lambda \\approx 2.13 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$.\n\nComparing our calculated values with the options, the value from Case 2 ($\\lambda \\approx 2.13 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$) is very close to option B ($2.08 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$). The small discrepancy is likely due to rounding of the initial mass and energy values in the problem statement. This suggests that the 27 GeV was intended to be the kinetic energy.\n\n### 3. Resolution and Probability of Observation\nThe question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. A decay is \"observed\" if the particle leaves a track of measurable length before it decays. This means the particle must travel a distance greater than the detector's resolution limit.\n\nParticle decay is an exponential process. The probability that a particle travels a distance $x$ or more before decaying is given by $P(d \\ge x) = e^{-x/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean decay length.\n\nWe need to find the resolution $L_{res}$ such that the probability of observation is at least 30%:\n$P(\\text{observation}) = P(d \\ge L_{res}) = e^{-L_{res}/\\lambda} \\ge 0.30$\n\nIf we set the resolution to be equal to the mean decay length ($L_{res} = \\lambda$), the fraction of observed decays would be:\n$P(d \\ge \\lambda) = e^{-\\lambda/\\lambda} = e^{-1} \\approx 0.368$\n\nA resolution of $\\lambda \\approx 2.13 \\times 10^{-6}$ m would allow for the observation of about 37% of the decays, which satisfies the condition of \"at least 30%\". The value from option B, $2.08 \\times 10^{-6}$ m, is the most plausible answer, representing the characteristic distance (mean decay length) the particle travels.\n\n<<<B>>>"
