    "The reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH₂) in condensed ammonia proceeds via an elimination-addition mechanism involving a benzyne intermediate. This reaction can produce three distinct organic products.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of how these products are formed:\n\n1.  **Formation of Benzyne Intermediates:** The strong base, amide anion (NH₂⁻), abstracts a proton from a carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the bromine-bearing carbon. In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there are two such ortho positions:\n    *   **Pathway A (H-abstraction):** The amide ion can remove a hydrogen atom (H) from position 6. This is generally faster than removing deuterium due to the kinetic isotope effect (the C-H bond is weaker than the C-D bond). This elimination of HBr leads to the formation of **3-deuterobenzyne**, where the triple bond is between carbons 1 and 6, and the deuterium remains at position 2.\n    *   **Pathway B (D-abstraction):** The amide ion can also remove the deuterium atom (D) from position 2. This is a slower process but still possible. This elimination of DBr results in a different benzyne intermediate with the triple bond between carbons 1 and 2. This benzyne intermediate does not contain deuterium.\n\n2.  **Nucleophilic Addition to Benzyne Intermediates:** The amide ion then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzyne intermediates.\n\n    *   **Products from 3-deuterobenzyne (from Pathway A):** The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) can attack either carbon of the triple bond.\n        *   Attack at carbon 1 leads to the formation of **2-deuterioaniline**.\n        *   Attack at carbon 6 leads to the formation of **3-deuterioaniline**.\n\n    *   **Product from the non-deuterated benzyne (from Pathway B):** The nucleophile (NH₂⁻) attacks the benzyne formed after the deuterium was removed.\n        *   Attack at either carbon 1 or 2, followed by protonation from the ammonia solvent, results in the formation of **aniline** (which contains no deuterium).\n\nTherefore, the three possible organic products from this reaction are 2-deuterioaniline, 3-deuterioaniline, and aniline.\n\n<<<C>>>"
