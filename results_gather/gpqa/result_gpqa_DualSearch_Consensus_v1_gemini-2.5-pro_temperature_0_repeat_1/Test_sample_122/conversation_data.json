    "This problem requires the application of the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\n1.  **Identify the given information:**\n    *   The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy (v) = 60,000 km/s.\n    *   The time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame (the proper time, Δt₀) = 50 s.\n    *   The speed of light (c) is approximately 300,000 km/s.\n\n2.  **Understand the concept:**\n    According to the theory of special relativity, an observer in a stationary frame of reference (the Galaxy) will measure time passing more slowly for a moving object (the ejecta). This phenomenon is called time dilation. The time measured in the stationary frame (Δt) will be longer than the proper time (Δt₀).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    The Lorentz factor relates the time in the two reference frames. It is calculated as:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)\n\n    First, find the ratio of the ejecta's velocity to the speed of light:\n    v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2\n\n    Now, calculate γ:\n    γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96\n    γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798\n    γ ≈ 1.0206\n\n4.  **Calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's reference frame (Δt):**\n    The formula for time dilation is:\n    Δt = γ * Δt₀\n    Δt ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s\n    Δt ≈ 51.03 s\n\n5.  **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's reference frame:**\n    The distance is the velocity multiplied by the time measured in the same reference frame (the Galaxy's frame).\n    Distance = v * Δt\n    Distance ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s\n    Distance ≈ 3,061,800 km\n\n    Alternatively, using the exact fraction for a more precise result:\n    Distance = v * (Δt₀ / √(1 - v²/c²))\n    Distance = 60,000 km/s * (50 s / √0.96)\n    Distance = 3,000,000 km / √0.96\n    Distance ≈ 3,061,862 km\n\n6.  **Compare with the options:**\n    The calculated distance of approximately 3,061,862 km is closest to option C.\n\n    *   A) 2,940,000 km (This would be the result if time were incorrectly contracted instead of dilated).\n    *   B) 2,880,000 km.\n    *   C) 3,060,000 km.\n    *   D) 3,000,000 km (This would be the result if relativistic effects were ignored).\n\nThe correct calculation, accounting for time dilation, yields a result that is extremely close to 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<C>>>"
