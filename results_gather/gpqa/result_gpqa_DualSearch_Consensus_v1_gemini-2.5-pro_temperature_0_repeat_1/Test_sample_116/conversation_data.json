    "Optical isomerism is a property exhibited by chiral molecules, which are non-superimposable on their mirror images. The most common sources of chirality in organic molecules are the presence of a chiral center (an atom, typically carbon, bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality, which can occur in molecules with hindered rotation about a single bond, such as in certain substituted biphenyls.\n\nHere is an analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This molecule is a substituted biphenyl. The presence of large groups (nitro and dimethyl dicarboxylate) in all four ortho-positions (the 2, 2', 6, and 6' positions) creates significant steric hindrance. This restricted rotation around the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings forces the rings to be non-coplanar. This arrangement results in a molecule that is not superimposable on its mirror image, a condition known as atropisomerism. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.\n\n2.  **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Also known as methyl lactate, this molecule contains a carbon atom (at position 2) that is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom (-H), a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃). A carbon atom with four different substituents is a chiral center. Molecules containing a single chiral center are chiral and thus optically active.\n\n3.  **benzophenone**: The chemical formula for benzophenone is (C₆H₅)₂CO. The central carbon atom is double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. Since it is not bonded to four different groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule possesses a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral, meaning it does not exhibit optical isomerism in solution.\n\n4.  **dimethyl fumarate**: This compound is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, the *trans*-isomer of butenedioic acid. The molecule is planar and has a center of symmetry, which makes it achiral. Consequently, it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis, dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate and methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate are the compounds that show optical isomerism.\n\n<<<C>>>"
