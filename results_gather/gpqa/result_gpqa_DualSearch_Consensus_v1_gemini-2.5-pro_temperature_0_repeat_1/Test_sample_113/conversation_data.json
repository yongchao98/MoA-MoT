    "**Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**\n\nThis reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone. The process involves the nucleophilic addition of a cyanide ion (CN⁻) to the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one. This forms a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate. Reagent 'A' is required to protonate this alkoxide intermediate to yield the final hydroxyl group (-OH) of the cyanohydrin product. This protonation is achieved by using an acid. While hydrogen cyanide (HCN) can be used directly, it is a highly toxic gas. A common and safer laboratory method involves using a salt like sodium cyanide (NaCN) in combination with a strong acid, such as HCl or H2SO4, which is represented generally as H3O⁺ (hydronium ion). The acid generates HCN in the reaction mixture and provides the necessary proton for the final step. Therefore, A = H3O⁺.\n\n**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**\n\nThis reaction shows the conversion of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This transformation is known as nitrile hydrolysis. The starting material is a cyanohydrin, and the product is an α-hydroxy acid. The hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid is typically carried out under vigorous conditions, requiring heating in the presence of a strong acid or a strong base. Reagent 'B', in conjunction with water, must be a strong acid catalyst to effectively hydrolyze the nitrile. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a strong mineral acid commonly used for this purpose. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is a weak acid and would not be sufficient to catalyze this reaction efficiently. Therefore, B = HCl.\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions, the suitable reagents are A = H3O⁺ and B = HCl.\n\n<<<B>>>"
