    "To find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx, we can calculate the expectation values for σz and σx separately and then combine them.\n\nThe state of the spin-half particle is given by the linear superposition:\n|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩\n\nHere, |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz. In matrix form, they are represented as:\n|↑⟩ =\n|↓⟩ =\n\nSo, the state vector |ψ⟩ is:\n|ψ⟩ = [0.5, (√3)/2]\n\nThe Pauli matrices σz and σx are:\nσz = [, [0, -1]]\nσx = [,]\n\n**1. Calculate the expectation value of σz (⟨σz⟩):**\n\nThe expectation value is calculated as ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩.\nFirst, we find σz|ψ⟩:\nσz|ψ⟩ = [, [0, -1]] * [0.5, (√3)/2] = [0.5, -(√3)/2]\n\nNow, we compute ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩:\n⟨σz⟩ = [0.5, (√3)/2] * [0.5, -(√3)/2]\n⟨σz⟩ = (0.5 * 0.5) + ((√3)/2 * -(√3)/2)\n⟨σz⟩ = 0.25 - 3/4 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5\n\n**2. Calculate the expectation value of σx (⟨σx⟩):**\n\nThe expectation value is calculated as ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.\nFirst, we find σx|ψ⟩:\nσx|ψ⟩ = [,] * [0.5, (√3)/2] = [(√3)/2, 0.5]\n\nNow, we compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩:\n⟨σx⟩ = [0.5, (√3)/2] * [(√3)/2, 0.5]\n⟨σx⟩ = (0.5 * (√3)/2) + ((√3)/2 * 0.5)\n⟨σx⟩ = (√3)/4 + (√3)/4 = (2√3)/4 = (√3)/2\n\n**3. Calculate the expectation value of the full operator:**\n\nThe expectation value of the operator O = 10σz + 5σx is given by ⟨O⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩.\n⟨O⟩ = 10 * (-0.5) + 5 * ((√3)/2)\n⟨O⟩ = -5 + 2.5 * √3\n\nUsing the approximation √3 ≈ 1.732:\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 2.5 * 1.732\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -5 + 4.33\n⟨O⟩ ≈ -0.67\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is -0.7.\n\n<<<D>>>"
