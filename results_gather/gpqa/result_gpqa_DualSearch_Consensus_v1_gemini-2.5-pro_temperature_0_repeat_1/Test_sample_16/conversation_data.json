    "To determine the concentration of free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) in the solution, we must consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\n**1. Reaction and Formation Constant:**\n\nThe formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is given by the equilibrium:\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ [Ca-EDTA]²⁻\n\nThe formation constant (K_f) for this reaction is:\nK_f = [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 5 x 10¹⁰\n\n**2. Dissociation of the Complex:**\n\nSince we start with the complex, we need to consider its dissociation, which is the reverse reaction:\n[Ca-EDTA]²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\n**3. Dissociation Constant (K_d):**\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the dissociation (K_d) is the inverse of the formation constant (K_f).\nK_d = 1 / K_f = 1 / (5 x 10¹⁰) = 2 x 10⁻¹¹\n\n**4. Equilibrium Calculation (ICE Table):**\n\nWe can set up an ICE (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) table to find the concentrations of the species at equilibrium. Let 'x' be the concentration of Ca²⁺ that forms from the dissociation of the complex.\n\n| Species | Initial (M) | Change (M) | Equilibrium (M) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| [Ca-EDTA]²⁻ | 0.02 | -x | 0.02 - x |\n| Ca²⁺ | 0 | +x | x |\n| EDTA⁴⁻ | 0 | +x | x |\n\n**5. Solving for 'x':**\n\nNow, we substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the dissociation constant expression:\nK_d = ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) / [[Ca-EDTA]²⁻]\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ = (x * x) / (0.02 - x)\n\nBecause the dissociation constant (K_d) is extremely small, the amount of the complex that dissociates ('x') will be negligible compared to the initial concentration (0.02 M). Therefore, we can simplify the denominator:\n0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nThe equation becomes:\n2 x 10⁻¹¹ ≈ x² / 0.02\n\nNow, we solve for x:\nx² ≈ (2 x 10⁻¹¹) * 0.02\nx² ≈ 4 x 10⁻¹³\nx = √(4 x 10⁻¹³)\nx ≈ 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions, [Ca²⁺], is equal to x.\n\nTherefore, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n<<<C>>>"
