    "To clearly distinguish between two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in their energy measurements. This is governed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time.\n\nThe principle states that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is greater than or equal to the reduced Planck constant (ħ) divided by 2. For practical purposes, the lifetime of a quantum state (τ) is used as the uncertainty in time (Δt), leading to the relationship ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. This ΔE is known as the natural line width of the energy state.\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy uncertainty (line width) for each quantum state using the given lifetimes and the value of the reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s.\n\n*   **For the first state (E1):**\n    *   Lifetime τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₁ ≈ ħ / τ₁ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁹ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV\n\n*   **For the second state (E2):**\n    *   Lifetime τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s\n    *   Energy uncertainty ΔE₂ ≈ ħ / τ₂ = (6.582 x 10⁻¹⁶ eV·s) / (10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁸ eV\n\nTo resolve the two energy levels, their energy separation must be larger than their individual energy widths. A common criterion is that the energy difference should be greater than the larger of the two widths. In this case, the larger width is ΔE₁ ≈ 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nWe now compare this required energy difference with the given options:\n*   A) 10⁻¹¹ eV is much smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   B) 10⁻⁴ eV is significantly larger than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   C) 10⁻⁸ eV is smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n*   D) 10⁻⁹ eV is much smaller than 6.582 x 10⁻⁷ eV.\n\nThe only option that provides a large enough energy difference to clearly distinguish the two energy levels is 10⁻⁴ eV.\n\n<<<B>>>"
