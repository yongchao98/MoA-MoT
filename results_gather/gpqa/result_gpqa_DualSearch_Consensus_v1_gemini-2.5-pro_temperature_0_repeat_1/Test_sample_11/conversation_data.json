    "To determine the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a stationary positive pion (π⁺) into a positive muon (μ⁺) and a muon neutrino (ν), we apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.\n\nThe decay process is:\nπ⁺ → μ⁺ + ν\n\nGiven:\n*   Rest mass of π⁺ (m_π) = 139.6 MeV/c²\n*   Rest mass of μ⁺ (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV/c²\n*   The rest mass of the neutrino (m_ν) is considered to be zero for this calculation.\n*   The pion is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero.\n\n**1. Conservation of Momentum:**\nSince the initial pion is at rest, the total momentum before the decay is zero. To conserve momentum, the muon and the neutrino must be emitted in opposite directions with equal magnitude of momentum.\n\np_μ = p_ν\n\n**2. Conservation of Energy:**\nThe total energy before the decay is the rest energy of the stationary pion. After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the total energies of the muon and the neutrino.\n\nE_π = E_μ + E_ν\n\nUsing the relativistic energy-momentum relation E² = (pc)² + (m₀c²)², we can express the energies:\n*   For the pion at rest: E_π = m_πc²\n*   For the muon: E_μ = KE_μ + m_μc²\n*   For the massless neutrino: E_ν = p_νc = KE_ν\n\nFrom momentum conservation, p_μc = p_νc. Therefore, E_ν = p_μc.\n\nNow, we can set up the energy conservation equation:\nm_πc² = E_μ + E_ν\n\nAnd the energy-momentum relation for the muon is:\nE_μ² = (p_μc)² + (m_μc²)²\n\nSubstituting E_ν for p_μc:\nE_μ² = E_ν² + (m_μc²)²\n\nFrom energy conservation, we have E_μ = m_πc² - E_ν. Substituting this into the equation above:\n(m_πc² - E_ν)² = E_ν² + (m_μc²)²\n(m_πc²)² - 2(m_πc²)E_ν + E_ν² = E_ν² + (m_μc²)²\n\nSolving for E_ν (which is the kinetic energy of the neutrino, KE_ν):\n(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)² = 2(m_πc²)KE_ν\nKE_ν = [(m_πc²)² - (m_μc²)²] / [2(m_πc²)]\n\nPlugging in the values:\nKE_ν = [(139.6)² - (105.7)²] / [2 * 139.6]\nKE_ν = [19488.16 - 11172.49] / 279.2\nKE_ν = 8315.67 / 279.2\n**KE_ν ≈ 29.8 MeV**\n\nNow, we can find the kinetic energy of the muon (KE_μ). The total energy released as kinetic energy (Q-value) is the difference in rest masses.\nQ = KE_μ + KE_ν = (m_π - m_μ)c²\nKE_μ = (m_π - m_μ)c² - KE_ν\nKE_μ = (139.6 - 105.7) - 29.8\nKE_μ = 33.9 - 29.8\n**KE_μ ≈ 4.1 MeV**\n\nA direct formula for the kinetic energy of the massive decay particle (muon) can also be derived:\nKE_μ = (m_πc² - m_μc²)² / (2m_πc²)\nKE_μ = (139.6 - 105.7)² / (2 * 139.6)\nKE_μ = (33.9)² / 279.2\nKE_μ = 1149.21 / 279.2\n**KE_μ ≈ 4.12 MeV**\n\nThe calculated kinetic energies are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. This matches one of the provided options. One source confirms the kinetic energy of the muon to be 4.13 MeV.\n\n<<<C>>>"
