    "To determine the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, a step-by-step analysis of the proposed reaction pathways is necessary.\n\nThe target molecule, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, is the product of a self-aldol condensation of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. In this reaction, the enolate of one cyclohexanecarbaldehyde molecule attacks the carbonyl group of a second molecule, forming a Î²-hydroxy aldehyde. The key to solving this problem is to identify a reaction sequence that first converts the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and then facilitates this aldol condensation.\n\nLet's analyze the provided options:\n\n*   **A) 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH:** The first step is incorrect. Sodium amide (NaNH2) is a strong base used to deprotonate the terminal alkyne, but adding methanol, a protic solvent, would immediately quench the resulting acetylide anion, regenerating the starting alkyne.\n*   **B) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 3. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O:** The second step involves catalytic hydrogenation with H2/Pd, which would reduce the alkyne completely to an alkane (1-cyclohexylpropane). It is not possible to form the target aldehyde from this alkane with the subsequent reagents.\n*   **C) 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH:** The third step uses ozonolysis with an oxidative workup (H2O), which would convert the intermediate alkene into carboxylic acids, not aldehydes.\n*   **D) 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2:** This sequence is chemically sound for producing the target molecule.\n    1.  **NaNH2, methyl chloride:** Ethynylcyclohexane is first deprotonated by sodium amide (NaNH2) to form a sodium acetylide. This acetylide then acts as a nucleophile, attacking methyl chloride to form 1-cyclohexylpropyne.\n    2.  **H2/Pd-calcium carbonate:** This reagent is Lindlar's catalyst, which is used for the partial hydrogenation of an alkyne to a *cis*-alkene. In this case, 1-cyclohexylpropyne is converted to *cis*-1-cyclohexylpropene.\n    3.  **O3/ (CH3)2S:** This is ozonolysis with a reductive workup. This reaction cleaves the double bond of *cis*-1-cyclohexylpropene to yield two carbonyl compounds: cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and acetaldehyde.\n    4.  **Ba(OH)2:** Barium hydroxide is a base that catalyzes the aldol condensation. In the mixture of aldehydes produced in the previous step, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde can undergo self-condensation to form the desired product, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Although other crossed-aldol and self-aldol products will also form, this pathway successfully generates the target molecule.\n\nBased on this analysis, sequence D provides a valid synthetic route.\n\n<<<D>>>"
