    "The decay of a hydrogen atom from an excited state to a lower energy state via electric dipole transitions is governed by specific selection rules for the quantum numbers *n*, *l*, and *m*.\n\nThe selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:\n*   Δ*l* = ±1\n*   Δ*m* = 0, ±1\n\nThe initial state is |*n*,*l*,*m*⟩ = |3,0,0⟩ and the final state is |1,0,0⟩. The decay must proceed through an intermediate state, which we can denote as |*n'*,*l'*,*m'*⟩. Since the energy must decrease at each step, the principal quantum number *n* must decrease.\n\n**First transition: |3,0,0⟩ → |*n'*,*l'*,*m'*⟩**\n\n*   According to the selection rule Δ*l* = ±1, since the initial *l* is 0, the intermediate state must have *l'* = 1.\n*   The principal quantum number must decrease, so *n'* must be less than 3. A transition to *n'*=2 is possible.\n*   The selection rule for the magnetic quantum number *m* is Δ*m* = 0, ±1. Since the initial *m* is 0, the possible values for *m'* are 0, +1, and -1.\n\nThus, the possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.\n\n**Second transition: |*n'*,*l'*,*m'*⟩ → |1,0,0⟩**\n\nLet's check if the transitions from the possible intermediate states to the final state |1,0,0⟩ are allowed:\n\n*   From |2,1,0⟩: Δ*l* = 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed) and Δ*m* = 0 - 0 = 0 (allowed).\n*   From |2,1,1⟩: Δ*l* = 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed) and Δ*m* = 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed).\n*   From |2,1,-1⟩: Δ*l* = 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed) and Δ*m* = 0 - (-1) = +1 (allowed).\n\nAll three decay routes are permitted by the selection rules.\n\nThe probability of the atom taking any one of these specific paths depends on the transition rates. For the initial transition from the spherically symmetric |3,0,0⟩ state, the transition rates to each of the |2,1,m'⟩ states (where m' = -1, 0, 1) are equal. Since there are three possible, equally probable decay channels for the first step, the probability of decaying through any single one of them is 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the three possible decay routes and their probabilities are:\n*   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$\n*   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$\n*   $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ with a probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ - This is a valid route with the correct probability.\nB) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ - The probability is incorrect.\nC) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - The probability is incorrect.\nD) $|3,0,0\\rangle\\rightarrow|2,1,-1\\rangle\\rightarrow|1,0,0\\rangle$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ - The probability is incorrect.\n\nThus, option A correctly identifies one of the possible transition routes and its corresponding probability.\n\n<<<A>>>"
