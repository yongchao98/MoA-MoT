    "### Superstring Theory Stands Apart in Not Requiring High-Energy Regularization\n\nAmong the listed physical theories, Superstring Theory is the one that is formulated to be free of the high-energy, or ultraviolet, divergences that plague other quantum field theories, and thus it does not inherently require regularization at these scales.\n\n**Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**, the theory of the strong nuclear force, necessitates regularization to handle the infinities that arise in perturbative calculations of particle interactions. Physicists employ various techniques to manage these divergences, including dimensional regularization and lattice regularization.\n\nSimilarly, **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**, which describes the interaction of light and matter, also encounters infinities in its calculations that must be tamed through the process of regularization.\n\nEven in the realm of classical physics, **Classical Electrodynamics** faces its own issues with infinities, particularly when considering the self-energy of point-like charged particles. This \"classical\" problem hints at the deeper issues that become more pronounced in its quantum counterpart.\n\nIn stark contrast, **Superstring Theory** is believed to be a consistent quantum theory of gravity that is free from ultraviolet divergences. This is a key feature of the theory, where the point-like particles of quantum field theory are replaced by one-dimensional \"strings.\" This fundamental change smooths out the short-distance interactions that lead to infinities in other theories. As a result, Superstring Theory is considered to be \"completely free of any ultraviolet divergences\" and does not need a regularization procedure for high energies.\n\n<<<D>>>"
