    "The inability to overexpress the GADD45G protein is due to a premature termination of translation by the ribosome.\n\nA detailed analysis of the provided DNA sequence reveals the issue. The sequence begins with `5'ATG...`, which is the correct start codon for translation. This is followed by the sequence `TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC`, which correctly codes for the intended influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigenic determinant (YPYDVPDYA).\n\nHowever, immediately following the HA tag sequence and a codon for the amino acid Lysine (`AAA`), the sequence reads `TGA`. In the genetic code, `TGA` is a stop codon. When the ribosome encounters this codon during translation, it terminates the synthesis of the polypeptide chain. This event is known as a nonsense mutation or the introduction of a premature termination codon (PTC).\n\nAs a result, instead of producing the full-length GADD45G protein, the cell is only producing a very short, non-functional peptide consisting of the HA tag and one additional amino acid before translation halts. This explains the observed failure to detect the overexpressed protein.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n*   **B) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** While linkers can be important, their absence does not explain the complete lack of protein expression. The primary issue is that the full protein is never synthesized in the first place.\n*   **C) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** The DNA sequence for the HA tag is correct and does not contain mutations. The problem lies in the sequence immediately following the tag.\n*   **D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This statement is biologically inaccurate. Stop codons (UAA, UAG, and the one present here, UGA) are recognized by protein release factors, not tRNAs, to terminate translation. Furthermore, the initial experiment was in hamster cells, not mouse cells.\n\n<<<A>>>"
