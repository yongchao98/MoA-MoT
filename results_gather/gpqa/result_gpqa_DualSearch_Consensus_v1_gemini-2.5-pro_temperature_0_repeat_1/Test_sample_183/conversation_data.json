    "After a thorough analysis of electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions and considering the directing effects of the various functional groups, a plausible high-yield synthesis route can be determined. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The key challenge is establishing the 1,2,3-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.\n\nLet's analyze the correct sequence of reactions, which corresponds to option D, with the understanding that some steps are standard multi-part procedures.\n\n*   **Step i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Benzene is alkylated to form tert-butylbenzene. The tert-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director, but due to its large size, it strongly favors substitution at the *para* position.\n\n*   **Step ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** This is a nitration reaction. The nitration of tert-butylbenzene yields primarily 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene because the bulky tert-butyl group sterically hinders the *ortho* positions.\n\n*   **Step iii) Fe/HCl:** This is the reduction of a nitro group to an amino group. 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene is reduced to 4-tert-butylaniline. The resulting amino group (-NH2) is a strong activating *ortho, para*-director.\n\n*   **Step iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** This step represents the nitration of 4-tert-butylaniline. Direct nitration of anilines can be problematic due to oxidation and the formation of anilinium ions in the strong acid, which would direct *meta*. To achieve the desired regiochemistry, the highly activating amino group is typically first protected by acetylation (e.g., with acetic anhydride) to form an acetanilide. This amide is still a potent *o,p*-director but is less prone to side reactions. The position *para* to the directing group is already occupied by the tert-butyl group, so nitration occurs at the *ortho* position, yielding 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroacetanilide. A subsequent hydrolysis step (acid or base-catalyzed) would then remove the acetyl protecting group to give **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**. This entire protection-nitration-deprotection sequence is often abbreviated in multi-step synthesis problems.\n\n*   **Step v) NaNO2/HCl:** This is a diazotization reaction. The primary aromatic amine, 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline, is converted into a diazonium salt at low temperatures.\n\n*   **Step vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** This step involves the hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol. The diazonium group is replaced by a hydroxyl (-OH) group, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n\n*   **Step vii) NaOH/EtBr:** This is a Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is first deprotonated by a base (NaOH) to form a more nucleophilic phenoxide ion. This ion then attacks the ethyl bromide (EtBr) in an SN2 reaction to form an ether. This converts 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol into **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n\nAt this point, the substituents are in a 1,2,4-arrangement (ethoxy, nitro, tert-butyl). The final two steps are designed to rearrange the substitution pattern to the desired 1,2,3-arrangement through a clever use of a blocking group and an *ipso*-substitution (substitution at a position already occupied by a non-hydrogen substituent).\n\n*   **Step viii) SO3/H2SO4:** This is a sulfonation reaction. The goal is to replace the tert-butyl group with a nitro group. To do this, the position *ortho* to the nitro group and *meta* to the ethoxy group (position 3) must be activated for a subsequent step. However, a more direct interpretation involves an *ipso*-nitration, where a bulky group like tert-butyl is replaced by the incoming nitro group. Often, sulfonation is used to block a position, but in this context, it's more likely that steps viii and ix are part of a more complex transformation or there is a flaw in the proposed sequence.\n\nHowever, if we re-evaluate the options and the target molecule, it becomes clear that there is a significant error in all the provided choices, as none of them logically lead to the final product 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The sequence in option D leads to 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene, which is an isomer of the target compound. The subsequent steps (viii and ix) in option D do not correct this.\n\nGiven the constraints of the multiple-choice question, there is likely an error in the question itself or the provided options. No sequence listed correctly and efficiently produces the target molecule. However, if forced to choose the \"best\" sequence that correctly assembles a trisubstituted benzene with the given reagents, option D is the most chemically plausible for the first seven steps, despite leading to the wrong isomer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
