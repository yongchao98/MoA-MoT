    "The reaction of saturated epoxides with organocuprates, such as lithium dimethylcuprate (Me2CuLi), is a well-established method in organic synthesis. The reaction proceeds via an SN2-type mechanism. This has two major consequences for the product's structure and stereochemistry, which are consistent with the information provided in the prompt and confirmed by chemical literature.\n\nFirst, regarding regioselectivity, the nucleophile (in this case, a methyl group from the organocuprate) attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. In the starting material, (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, the epoxide ring is formed by carbons C1 and C6 and the oxygen atom. Carbon C1 is a tertiary center, as it is bonded to a methyl group, whereas C6 is a secondary center. Therefore, the incoming methyl nucleophile will attack the less hindered C6.\n\nSecond, concerning the stereochemistry, SN2 reactions are characterized by an inversion of configuration at the carbon center that is attacked. The nucleophile approaches from the side opposite to the carbon-oxygen bond (backside attack), causing the stereochemical configuration at that carbon to flip. In this specific case, the methyl group attacks C6, which has an (S) configuration in the starting material. This attack inverts the stereocenter to an (R) configuration in the product. The configurations of the other chiral centers (C1, C3, and C4) are not affected by the reaction.\n\nThe ring-opening of the epoxide results in a cyclohexanol derivative. The original C1 becomes the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (-OH), and the new methyl group is attached to the adjacent carbon (the original C6). The other methyl groups remain at their original positions on the cyclohexane ring.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   **Reactant:** (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane\n*   **Attack at:** C6 (less hindered)\n*   **Stereochemical outcome:** Inversion at C6 (S â†’ R). Configurations at C1, C3, and C4 are retained (R, R, and R, respectively).\n*   **Product structure:** A tetramethylcyclohexanol with methyl groups at positions 1, 2 (from C6), 4 (from C3), and 5 (from C4).\n*   **Product stereochemistry:** The final stereoisomer is (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
