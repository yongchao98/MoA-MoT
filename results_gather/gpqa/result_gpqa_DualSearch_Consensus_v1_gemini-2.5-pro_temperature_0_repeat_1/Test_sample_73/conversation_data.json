    "The key principle in solving this problem is the memoryless nature of radioactive decay. Radioactive decay follows an exponential distribution, which is a memoryless process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has not decayed for 50 minutes does not change its probability of decaying in any future time period.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Define the survival probability.** The probability that an atom survives (does not decay) until time *t* is given by the exponential decay formula: P(survival) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.\n\n2.  **Use the given information to find the decay constant (λ).** We are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%. This means the probability of survival for 100 minutes is:\n    P(survival for 100 min) = 1 - P(decay within 100 min) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n\n    Using the survival formula:\n    0.68 = e^(-λ * 100)\n\n3.  **Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.** We need to find the probability that the atom, having survived for 50 minutes, will decay in the following 150 minutes. Because of the memoryless property, this is simply the probability that a new atom would decay within 150 minutes.\n\n    The probability of decay within 150 minutes is:\n    P(decay within 150 min) = 1 - P(survival for 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150).\n\n4.  **Solve for the unknown probability.** We can find the value of e^(-λ * 150) from the information we found in step 2:\n    From 0.68 = e^(-λ * 100), we can write e^(-λ) = 0.68^(1/100).\n\n    Now substitute this into the equation for 150 minutes:\n    P(survival for 150 min) = e^(-λ * 150) = (e^(-λ))^150 = (0.68^(1/100))^150 = 0.68^(150/100) = 0.68^1.5.\n\n    Calculating the value:\n    0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607\n\n    Finally, calculate the probability of decay:\n    P(decay within 150 min) = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393.\n\nThis probability is approximately 43.93%, which rounds to 44%.\n\n<<<A>>>"
