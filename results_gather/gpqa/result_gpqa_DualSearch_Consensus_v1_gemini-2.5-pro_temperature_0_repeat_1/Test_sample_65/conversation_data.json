    "### All Operators in Standard Model Effective Field Theory Must Respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT Symmetries\n\nAll operators within the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) are required to respect Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry. However, they are not all required to conserve CP symmetry.\n\nThe Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) extends the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators that are constructed from the Standard Model fields and are invariant under the Standard Model's gauge symmetries. A fundamental tenet of this construction is the preservation of Lorentz and Poincare invariance, which are foundational symmetries of spacetime in quantum field theory. The SMEFT Lagrangian is explicitly constructed to be invariant under these symmetries.\n\nIn contrast, CP (Charge-Parity) symmetry is not a mandatory symmetry for all SMEFT operators. The framework, in fact, provides a systematic way to parameterize potential new sources of CP violation beyond what is already present in the Standard Model. Numerous studies focus on identifying and constraining these \"CP-violating\" or \"CP-odd\" operators.\n\nThe CPT theorem, a cornerstone of quantum field theory, dictates that any Lorentz-invariant local quantum field theory must be invariant under the combined transformation of Charge conjugation (C), Parity inversion (P), and Time reversal (T). As SMEFT is formulated as a Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, it inherently respects CPT invariance. This implies that while individual symmetries like C, P, or CP may be violated, the combined CPT symmetry must hold.\n\nTherefore, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry.\n\n<<<C>>>"
