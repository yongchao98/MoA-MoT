    "The final product is identified by following a three-step reaction sequence starting from a compound identified by its molecular formula and NMR data.\n\n**Step 1: Identification of the Starting Material**\n\nThe molecular formula is C8H9NO, and the degree of unsaturation is 5, which suggests a benzene ring is present. The 1H-NMR data is analyzed as follows:\n*   **9.72 ppm (t, 1H):** An aldehyde proton (-CHO) coupled to an adjacent methylene (-CH2-) group.\n*   **6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H):** These signals are characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring.\n*   **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet for two protons is indicative of a primary amine (-NH2) group.\n*   **3.66 ppm (d, 2H):** A methylene group (-CH2-) coupled to the aldehyde proton.\n\nAssembling these fragments leads to the structure of 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde (p-NH2-C6H4-CH2-CHO).\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n1.  **NaNO2 + HCl:** These reagents generate nitrous acid (HNO2), which reacts with the primary aromatic amine to form a diazonium salt. The starting material is converted to 4-(formylmethyl)benzenediazonium chloride.\n2.  **H2O:** Adding water to the diazonium salt results in its hydrolysis, replacing the diazonium group (-N2+) with a hydroxyl group (-OH). This step yields 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (p-HO-C6H4-CH2-CHO).\n3.  **aq. KOH, Heat:** This step involves a base-catalyzed self-condensation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. In an aldol condensation, a base (KOH) removes an acidic alpha-proton from one aldehyde molecule to form an enolate. This enolate then attacks the carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule, leading to a β-hydroxy aldehyde after protonation. The \"Heat\" condition indicates that this intermediate will undergo dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form a more stable, conjugated α,β-unsaturated aldehyde.\n\n**Step 3: Determination of the Final Product**\n\nThe self-aldol condensation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde proceeds as follows:\n*   **Aldol Addition:** Two molecules of 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde react to form 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal. This corresponds to option A, but it is an intermediate because the reaction is heated.\n*   **Dehydration (Condensation):** The intermediate loses water, with the hydroxyl group from the C3 position and a proton from the C2 position being eliminated. This creates a double bond between C2 and C3.\n*   **Final Product:** The resulting structure is 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.\n\nThis structure matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
