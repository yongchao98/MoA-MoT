    "Here is a detailed analysis of the reactions and the resulting chromatographic separations:\n\n### **Reaction I: Reduction of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. The stereocenter at carbon 5 has the (S) configuration.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LAH), a strong reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. LAH will reduce the ketone at carbon 3 to a hydroxyl group.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the carbonyl group at C3 creates a new stereocenter. Since the starting material is chiral and the reducing agent (LAH) is achiral, the hydride can attack the planar carbonyl group from either face. This results in the formation of two products with different configurations (R or S) at the newly formed chiral center (C3).\n    *   Product 1: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n    *   Product 2: (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:** These two products are diastereomers because they have one stereocenter that is the same (5S) and one that is different (3R vs. 3S).\n\n### **Reaction II: Reduction of Pentane-2,4-dione**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Pentane-2,4-dione is an achiral diketone.\n*   **Reaction:** It is treated with excess Sodium Borohydride (NaBH4), a reducing agent, followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 will reduce both ketone groups at carbons 2 and 4 to hydroxyl groups.\n*   **Products:** The reduction of the two ketones creates two new stereocenters at C2 and C4. The possible stereoisomers are:\n    *   Product 3: (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Product 4: (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n    *   Product 5: (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n*   **Stereochemical Relationship:**\n    *   (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them a pair of enantiomers.\n    *   (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol has an internal plane of symmetry, which makes it a meso compound. It is achiral.\n    *   The meso compound is a diastereomer of the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers.\n    *   Therefore, this reaction produces three distinct stereoisomers.\n\n### **Analysis of the Combined Product Mixture**\n\nThe final mixture contains a total of five different stereoisomers:\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (meso)\n\n### **Chromatographic Separation**\n\n#### **Normal-Phase HPLC (Achiral Column)**\nA normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on differences in their physical properties, primarily polarity.\n*   **Enantiomers**, having identical physical properties in an achiral environment, will not be separated and will elute as a single peak.\n*   **Diastereomers** have different physical properties and can be separated.\n*   The two products from Reaction I, (3R, 5S)- and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, are diastereomers and will therefore produce **two separate peaks**.\n*   From Reaction II, the enantiomeric pair, (2R, 4R)- and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, will co-elute as **one peak**.\n*   The meso compound, (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol, is a diastereomer of the enantiomeric pair and will have a different polarity, resulting in a **separate, second peak** for the products of Reaction II.\n*   The products from Reaction I (C7 alcohols with an ether group) are structurally different from the products of Reaction II (C5 diols) and will have different retention times.\n*   Therefore, the total number of peaks observed will be 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = **4 peaks**.\n\n#### **Chiral HPLC**\nAn HPLC with a chiral stationary phase is designed to separate stereoisomers, including enantiomers. It can distinguish between all five unique stereoisomers present in the mixture.\n1.  (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol will give **one peak**.\n2.  (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol will give a **second peak**.\n3.  (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol will give a **third peak**.\n4.  (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol will give a **fourth peak**.\n5.  (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (the meso compound) is also a unique stereoisomer and will give a **fifth peak**.\n*   Therefore, the total number of peaks observed in the chiral HPLC chromatogram will be **5 peaks**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis predicts 5 peaks in the chiral HPLC chromatogram and 4 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC chromatogram.\n\n<<<D>>>"
