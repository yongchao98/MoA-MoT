    "The step-by-step synthesis of product 4 and the analysis of its chemically distinct hydrogens are as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine**\nThis reaction is an alpha-bromination of a ketone. A bromine atom replaces one of the hydrogen atoms on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group. This results in the formation of **2-bromocyclohexanone** (Product 1).\n\n**Step 2: Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide**\nWhen 2-bromocyclohexanone is heated with a strong base like sodium hydroxide, it undergoes a ring-contraction reaction known as the Favorskii rearrangement. This process yields **cyclopentanecarboxylic acid** (Product 2).\n\n**Step 3: Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine**\nCyclopentanecarboxylic acid reacts with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) to convert the carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) into an acid chloride (-COCl). Pyridine is used to neutralize the HCl produced during the reaction. The resulting compound is **cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride** (Product 3).\n\n**Step 4: Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride**\nLithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(OtBu)₃) is a mild reducing agent that is used to reduce acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is less reactive than lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄), which allows the reaction to stop at the aldehyde stage without further reduction to an alcohol. This reaction forms **cyclopentanecarbaldehyde** (Product 4).\n\n**Determining the Number of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\nThe final product is cyclopentanecarbaldehyde. To find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, we need to analyze the molecule's structure and symmetry. The structure consists of a cyclopentane ring attached to an aldehyde group (-CHO).\n\nOn the NMR timescale, due to rapid conformational changes, the cyclopentane ring can be considered to have an average plane of symmetry that passes through the aldehyde group and the C1 and C4 carbons of the ring. This symmetry helps determine which hydrogens are chemically equivalent.\n\nLet's count the sets of distinct hydrogens:\n1.  **The aldehyde proton (H-C=O):** This proton is in a unique chemical environment. (1 type)\n2.  **The proton on C1 (the carbon attached to the aldehyde group):** This methine proton is also in a unique environment. (1 type)\n3.  **The protons on C2 and C5:** These two carbons are adjacent to C1 and are equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. However, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic (they are not interchangeable by symmetry operations). This means the two protons on C2 are distinct from each other. By symmetry, the \"upper\" protons on C2 and C5 are equivalent, and the \"lower\" protons on C2 and C5 are equivalent. This gives two more types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n4.  **The protons on C3 and C4:** These two carbons are also equivalent due to the plane of symmetry. Similar to the C2/C5 protons, the two protons on each of these carbons are diastereotopic. The \"upper\" protons on C3 and C4 are equivalent, and the \"lower\" protons are equivalent. This results in another two types of hydrogens. (2 types)\n\nSumming these up: 1 (aldehyde) + 1 (C1-H) + 2 (C2/C5-H's) + 2 (C3/C4-H's) = **6** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n<<<A>>>"
