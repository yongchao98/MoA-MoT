    "To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we can use the principles of orbital mechanics and thermal equilibrium.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the energy it receives from its host star and its own physical properties. Assuming the planets are in thermal equilibrium and radiate as black bodies, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of its distance (r) from the star, given that other factors like stellar luminosity and planetary albedo are constant. The problem states that the planets have the same albedo. Therefore, we can write the relationship as:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1/√r\n\nThis means the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2 can be expressed as:\n\nT_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = √(r_2 / r_4)\n\nThe relationship between a planet's orbital period (P) and its semi-major axis (a) is described by Kepler's Third Law. For circular orbits, the semi-major axis is equal to the orbital radius (r). Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:\n\nP² ∝ r³\n\nFrom this law, we can establish a ratio of the orbital radii for Planet_4 and Planet_2 based on their orbital periods:\n\n(P_4 / P_2)² = (r_4 / r_3)³\n\nWe are given that the ratio of the orbital periods of the five planets (Planet_1 to Planet_5) is 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Therefore, the ratio of the orbital periods of Planet_4 to Planet_2 is:\n\nP_4 / P_2 = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of their orbital radii:\n\n(r_4 / r_2)³ = (1.75)² = 3.0625\nr_4 / r_2 = (3.0625)^(1/3) ≈ 1.452\n\nFinally, we can calculate the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n\nT_eq,4 / T_eq,2 = √(r_2 / r_4) = 1 / √(r_4 / r_2) = 1 / √1.452 ≈ 1 / 1.205 ≈ 0.83\n\nThus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83.\n\n<<<B>>>"
