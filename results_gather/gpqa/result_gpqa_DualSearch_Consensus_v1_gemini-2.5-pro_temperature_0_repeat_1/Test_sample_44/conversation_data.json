    "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the energy levels of a single particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well and then apply the Pauli exclusion principle for the four spin-1/2 particles.\n\n### Energy Levels of a Single Particle\n\nThe energy levels for a single particle of mass 'm' in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length 'L' are given by the formula:\n\nE_n = (n²π²ħ²) / (2mL²)\n\nwhere 'n' is the principal quantum number (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nThe problem defines a base energy unit E as:\n\nE = (π²ħ²) / (2mL²)\n\nTherefore, the energy of the nth level can be expressed as:\n\nE_n = n²E\n\n### System of Four Spin-1/2 Particles\n\nThe particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions. According to the Pauli exclusion principle, no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. A quantum state in this system is defined by the principal quantum number 'n' and the spin projection (spin-up or spin-down). Consequently, each energy level 'n' can accommodate a maximum of two particles, one with spin-up and one with spin-down.\n\n### Ground State Energy\n\nFor the ground state, the four particles occupy the lowest available energy levels.\n*   Two particles will fill the n=1 energy level. The energy for these two particles is 2 × E₁ = 2 × (1²E) = 2E.\n*   The remaining two particles will occupy the n=2 energy level. The energy for these two particles is 2 × E₂ = 2 × (2²E) = 2 × 4E = 8E.\n\nThe total energy of the ground state is the sum of the energies of all four particles:\nE_ground = 2E + 8E = 10E.\n\n### First Excited State Energy\n\nTo find the energy of the first excited state, we move one particle from the highest occupied energy level in the ground state (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied energy level (n=3).\n*   The new configuration will be: two particles in the n=1 level, one particle in the n=2 level, and one particle in the n=3 level.\n*   The energy for the two particles in n=1 is 2 × E₁ = 2 × (1²E) = 2E.\n*   The energy for the one particle in n=2 is 1 × E₂ = 1 × (2²E) = 4E.\n*   The energy for the one particle in n=3 is 1 × E₃ = 1 × (3²E) = 9E.\n\nThe total energy of the first excited state is:\nE_first_excited = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.\n\n### Second Excited State Energy\n\nThe second excited state is the configuration with the next lowest total energy above the first excited state. We need to consider the possible ways to excite the system from the ground state:\n1.  Move the second particle from the n=2 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, two particles in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1²E) + (2 × 3²E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.\n2.  Move one particle from the n=2 level to the n=4 level.\n    *   Configuration: Two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2, one particle in n=4.\n    *   Energy = (2 × 1²E) + (1 × 2²E) + (1 × 4²E) = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.\n3.  Move one particle from the n=1 level to the n=3 level.\n    *   Configuration: One particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, one particle in n=3.\n    *   Energy = (1 × 1²E) + (2 × 2²E) + (1 × 3²E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.\n\nComparing the energies of these possible configurations, the lowest energy for the second excited state is 18E.\n\nThus, the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are 10E, 15E, and 18E, respectively.\n\n<<<B>>>"
