    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reaction sequence to determine the class of compounds for Products 1, 2, and 3.**\n\n1.  **Product 1:** 1,3-dibromoadamantane (C₁₀H₁₄Br₂) is heated with excess KOH at 240°C. The product has an IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group, specifically a ketone. The provided ¹H NMR spectrum shows a total of 14 protons, indicating the adamantane C₁₀ skeleton is intact. The formula of Product 1 is therefore C₁₀H₁₄O.\n\n2.  **Product 2:** Product 1 is heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-iPr)₃. This is the standard reagent for a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reduction, which reduces a ketone (Product 1) to an alcohol (Product 2). Thus, Product 2 is an alcohol with the formula C₁₀H₁₆O.\n\n3.  **Product 3:** Product 2 is treated with ozone (O₃) followed by dimethylsulfide (DMS). This is a reductive ozonolysis reaction, which cleaves a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) and converts it into two carbonyl groups (ketones or aldehydes). The fact that ozonolysis occurs means that **Product 2 must contain a C=C double bond**. Consequently, **Product 1 must also contain a C=C double bond**.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can deduce the following:\n*   **Product 1** is an unsaturated ketone with the formula C₁₀H₁₄O.\n*   **Product 2** is an unsaturated alcohol with the formula C₁₀H₁₆O.\n*   **Product 3** is the ozonolysis product of Product 2. It is a dicarbonyl alcohol with the formula C₁₀H₁₆O₃ (ozonolysis adds two oxygen atoms without changing the C/H count).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the proton of interest in Product 3.**\n\nThe question asks for the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in Product 3, excluding those that exchange with a deuterated solvent (like an -OH proton).\n\nThe functional groups in Product 3 are two carbonyls (likely aldehydes, -CHO) and one alcohol (-CHOH).\n*   Aldehyde protons (H-C=O) are the most deshielded non-exchangeable protons, typically appearing at 9-10 ppm. However, they usually show simple coupling (singlet or doublet) and are unlikely to match the complex patterns given in the options (doublet of triplets, pentet, triplet of triplets).\n*   The next most deshielded proton would be the one on the carbon bearing the alcohol group (H-C-OH), which typically appears at 3.5-4.5 ppm. This proton's coupling pattern depends on the number of adjacent protons.\n\nGiven the answer choices, it is highly probable that the question refers to the **proton on the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group (the H-C-OH proton)**.\n\n**Step 3: Deduce the structure of Product 3 and the coupling pattern.**\n\nThe reaction starts with a highly symmetrical molecule (adamantane). It is plausible that the final product, despite the complex rearrangements, retains some symmetry. The simple coupling patterns suggested in the answer choices (pentet, triplet) also point towards a symmetrical structure for Product 3.\n\nLet's analyze the coupling pattern options for the H-C(OH) proton:\n*   A **triplet** would imply coupling to two equivalent neighboring protons.\n*   A **pentet** (or quintet) would imply coupling to four equivalent neighboring protons.\n*   A **doublet of triplets** would imply coupling to one proton and a set of two other equivalent protons.\n*   A **triplet of triplets** would imply coupling to two different sets of two equivalent protons.\n\nFor the H-C(OH) proton to appear as a **pentet**, it must be adjacent to four magnetically equivalent protons. This would occur in a structural fragment like **-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₂-** where the molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the C-OH bond, making the two adjacent CH₂ groups equivalent.\n\nLet's assume that the reaction sequence leads to a final product (Product 3) with this specific symmetrical feature. A plausible structure for Product 3 that is a C₁₀ dicarbonyl alcohol and possesses this symmetry is **cis,cis-1,5-diformyl-3-hydroxy-cyclooctane**.\n\n*   **Formula:** The cyclooctane ring has 8 carbons, and the two formyl (-CHO) groups add 2 more, for a total of 10 carbons (C₁₀). The hydrogen and oxygen count (C₁₀H₁₆O₃) also matches.\n*   **Symmetry:** This molecule has a plane of symmetry that passes through the C3-OH bond and bisects the C7-C8 bond.\n*   **Coupling:** The proton of interest is H3 (the one on the carbon with the OH group). It is adjacent to the two protons on C2 and the two protons on C4. Due to the plane of symmetry, the CH₂ group at C2 is equivalent to the CH₂ group at C4. Therefore, H3 is coupled to **four equivalent neighboring protons**.\n\nAccording to the n+1 rule, a proton coupled to four equivalent protons will appear as a **pentet** (or quintet).\n\nWhile the exact reaction pathway from 1,3-dibromoadamantane to this specific structure is complex and involves significant molecular rearrangement, the existence of a plausible, symmetrical final structure that perfectly explains one of the answer choices is a strong indicator in this type of chemical puzzle. The high symmetry of the starting material makes a symmetric fragmentation and rearrangement product plausible.\n\nTherefore, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded non-exchangeable C-H proton in product 3 is a pentet.\n\n<<<B>>>"
