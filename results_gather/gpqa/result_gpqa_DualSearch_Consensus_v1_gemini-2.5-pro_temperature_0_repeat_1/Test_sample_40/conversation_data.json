    "This problem requires the application of the relativistic velocity addition formula. This formula is a cornerstone of Einstein's theory of special relativity and describes how velocities combine in a way that is consistent with the principle that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all observers.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the reference frames:**\n    *   The laboratory frame, where the observer is stationary.\n    *   The rest frame of the glass, which is moving with a velocity `v` relative to the laboratory.\n\n2.  **Determine the velocities:**\n    *   The velocity of the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is `v`.\n    *   The speed of light *within* the glass, as measured in the glass's own rest frame, is `u' = c/n`. Since the problem states to take the speed of light in a vacuum `c=1`, the speed of light in the glass is `u' = 1/n`.\n\n3.  **Apply the relativistic velocity addition formula:**\n    The formula for adding velocities along the same direction is:\n    `u = (v + u') / (1 + v*u'/c^2)`\n\n    Where:\n    *   `u` is the speed of the light beam relative to the observer in the laboratory.\n    *   `v` is the speed of the glass relative to the laboratory.\n    *   `u'` is the speed of the light beam relative to the glass.\n    *   `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n4.  **Substitute the given values into the formula:**\n    *   `v = v`\n    *   `u' = 1/n`\n    *   `c = 1`\n\n    `u = (v + 1/n) / (1 + v*(1/n)/1^2)`\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    *   `u = (v + 1/n) / (1 + v/n)`\n    *   To clear the fraction in the numerator and denominator, multiply both by `n`:\n    *   `u = n * (v + 1/n) / n * (1 + v/n)`\n    *   `u = (n*v + 1) / (n + v)`\n\n6.  **Compare with the given options:**\n    The calculated speed `u = (1 + n*v) / (n + v)` matches option D. This result is a classic confirmation of special relativity, first observed experimentally in the Fizeau experiment.\n\n<<<D>>>"
