    "Here is a step-by-step determination of the correct IUPAC name for the described molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Parent Structure**\nThe molecule is a benzene ring containing a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the carboxylic acid group has the highest priority among the given functional groups (carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, cyano, hydroxyl, dimethylamino, methoxy). Therefore, the parent structure is **benzoic acid**. The carbon atom attached to the carboxylic acid group is assigned position 1.\n\n**2. Map the Substituents**\nBased on the problem description, we can place the substituents on the benzene ring relative to the carboxylic acid at position 1:\n*   **para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group**: The methoxy group (-OCH₃) is at position 4.\n*   **Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino**: The hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂) groups are at positions 2 and 6.\n*   **A carbaldehyde and a cyano group all meta to one another**: The carbaldehyde (-CHO, or formyl group) and cyano (-CN) groups are at positions 3 and 5.\n*   **The methoxy and the alcohol are also both ortho to the nitrile**: This is the key to placing the remaining groups. The methoxy group is at C4. For the methoxy group to be ortho to the cyano group (-CN), the cyano group must be at C3 or C5.\n    *   If the cyano group is at C3, its ortho positions are C2 and C4. This means the hydroxyl group (-OH) must be at C2.\n    *   If the cyano group is at C5, its ortho positions are C4 and C6. This means the hydroxyl group (-OH) must be at C6.\n\nBoth possibilities lead to the same molecule, just viewed from a different perspective (they are mirror images that are superimposable, meaning they are the same compound). Let's proceed with the first possibility for naming:\n*   C1: -COOH\n*   C2: -OH (hydroxyl)\n*   C3: -CN (cyano)\n*   C4: -OCH₃ (methoxy)\n*   C5: -CHO (formyl)\n*   C6: -N(CH₃)₂ (dimethylamino)\n\n**3. Determine the Correct Numbering**\nWith the principal functional group at C1, we must number the ring to give the lowest possible locants (numbers) to the other substituents.\n*   **Clockwise numbering**: The substituents are at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n*   **Counter-clockwise numbering**: This would also place substituents at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\nSince both numbering directions result in the identical locant set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, a tie-breaker rule is needed. The rule states that the lowest number is assigned to the substituent that comes first alphabetically.\n\n**4. Alphabetize the Substituents**\nThe prefixes for the substituent groups are:\n*   **c**yano\n*   **d**imethylamino\n*   **f**ormyl\n*   **h**ydroxy\n*   **m**ethoxy\n\nThe first substituent in alphabetical order is \"cyano\".\n\n**5. Apply the Tie-Breaker Rule**\nWe must choose the numbering direction that gives \"cyano\" the lowest possible number.\n*   In our chosen arrangement (which corresponds to clockwise numbering), the cyano group is at position **3**.\n*   In the alternative arrangement (counter-clockwise), the cyano group would be at position **5**.\n\nSince 3 is lower than 5, the clockwise numbering scheme is correct.\n\n**6. Assemble the Final Name**\nThe name is constructed by listing the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by its correct locant, followed by the parent name \"benzoic acid\".\n*   3-cyano\n*   6-(dimethylamino)\n*   5-formyl\n*   2-hydroxy\n*   4-methoxy\n\nCombining these gives the full IUPAC name: **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.\n\nThis name matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
