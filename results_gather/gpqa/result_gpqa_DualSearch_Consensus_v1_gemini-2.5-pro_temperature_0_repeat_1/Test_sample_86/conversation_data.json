    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the correct compound and its corresponding 1H NMR data:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecular Formula and Features:**\n    *   **6-membered aromatic ring:** This is a benzene ring, which accounts for 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Di-substituted:** There are two groups attached to the benzene ring.\n    *   **8 carbon atoms total:** Since the ring has 6 carbons, the two substituents together must contain 2 carbon atoms.\n    *   **Carbonyl group (C=O):** One of the substituents must contain a carbonyl functional group.\n    *   **Aromatic-halogen bond:** A halogen atom (like Cl, Br, or I) is directly bonded to the aromatic ring. This means one of the two substituents is a halogen (-X).\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Substituents:**\n    *   One substituent is a halogen (-X).\n    *   The other substituent must contain the remaining 2 carbons and the carbonyl group. The most common and stable group that fits this description is an **acetyl group (-COCH₃)**.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Final Molecule:**\n    *   Combining the pieces, we have a benzene ring substituted with a halogen and an acetyl group. This gives us a **haloacetophenone**. The molecular formula is C₈H₇XO.\n    *   The two substituents can be arranged in ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), or para (1,4) positions. A para-substituted ring leads to a highly symmetrical and easily identifiable NMR spectrum.\n\n4.  **Predict the ¹H NMR Spectrum for a para-Haloacetophenone:**\n    *   **Aromatic Protons:** In a para-substituted ring (1,4-disubstitution), the four protons on the ring are chemically divided into two equivalent sets. This results in two signals in the aromatic region (typically 6.5-8.0 ppm). Due to coupling with adjacent protons, these signals appear as two distinct **doublets**, each integrating to **2H**.\n    *   **Acetyl Group Protons (-COCH₃):** The three protons on the methyl group are equivalent and are attached to a carbonyl carbon, which has no protons. Therefore, they will appear as a **singlet** (no splitting) integrating to **3H**. The typical chemical shift for a methyl ketone is around 2.1-2.6 ppm.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given Options:**\n\n    *   **A) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n        *   This data does not match. The integration and splitting patterns are inconsistent with the proposed structure.\n\n    *   **B) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This is incorrect as it lacks any signals in the aromatic proton region (6.5-8.5 ppm).\n\n    *   **C) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n        *   The signal at 9.9 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde (-CHO), not a ketone. This would correspond to a (halophenyl)acetaldehyde, which is a possible structure. However, the multiplicities are unusual (the aldehyde and adjacent CH₂ are both singlets, implying no coupling).\n\n    *   **D) 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n        *   This spectrum is a perfect match for the predicted spectrum of a para-haloacetophenone.\n        *   **7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d):** These are the two doublets for the four protons on the para-substituted aromatic ring.\n        *   **2.3 (3H, s):** This is the singlet for the three protons of the methyl ketone group.\n\nThe compound is a para-substituted haloacetophenone, and the data in option D accurately describes its ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<D>>>"
