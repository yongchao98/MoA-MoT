    "The relationship between λ1 and λ2 is determined by the fundamental principles of the mean free path and the nature of particle collisions.\n\nThe mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. It is inversely proportional to the number density of particles (n) and the collision cross-section (σ), as described by the formula λ = 1/(nσ).\n\n*   **λ1 (Mean Free Path of Gas Molecules):** This value represents the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. The relevant collision cross-section, σ1, is the kinetic cross-section, which is related to the physical size of the gas molecules.\n\n*   **λ2 (Mean Free Path of Electrons):** This value represents the average distance an electron from the beam travels before scattering off a gas molecule. The relevant collision cross-section, σ2, is the electron scattering cross-section.\n\nIn the scenario described, the number density (n) of the remaining gas molecules is the same for both calculations. The key difference lies in the collision cross-section.\n\nThe interaction between a high-energy electron (1000 kV) and a gas molecule is fundamentally different from the collision between two neutral gas molecules. An electron interacts with the gas molecule via the electromagnetic force, scattering off the atom's nucleus and its electron cloud. This interaction area, or electron scattering cross-section (σ2), is significantly larger than the physical, hard-sphere kinetic cross-section (σ1) that governs gas-gas collisions.\n\nSince the mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (σ), and the electron scattering cross-section (σ2) is larger than the gas kinetic cross-section (σ1), the resulting mean free path for the electrons (λ2) must be shorter than the mean free path for the gas molecules (λ1).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that λ2 < λ1.\n\n<<<C>>>"
