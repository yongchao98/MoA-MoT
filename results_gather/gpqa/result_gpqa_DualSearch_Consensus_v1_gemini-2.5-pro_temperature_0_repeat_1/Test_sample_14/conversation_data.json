    "The search results confirm the fundamental principles used in the derivation.\n\n1.  **Transit Probability:** For a planet in a circular orbit, the geometric probability of it transiting its star is given by the ratio of the star's radius (R_s) to the planet's semi-major axis (a). The formula is P_transit ≈ R_s / a. The problem states the orbits are circular, so this simplified formula is appropriate.\n\n2.  **Kepler's Third Law:** The relationship between a planet's orbital period (P), its semi-major axis (a), and the mass of its host star (M_s) is described by Kepler's Third Law. The law can be expressed as P² is proportional to a³ / M_s. Rearranging this to solve for the semi-major axis gives a³ ∝ M_s * P², which means a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3).\n\nThe derivation performed in the thought process is as follows:\n\n*   **Ratio of Probabilities:**\n    *   Prob₁ / Prob₂ = (R_s1 / a₁) / (R_s2 / a₂)\n    *   Since R_s1 = R_s2, this simplifies to Prob₁ / Prob₂ = a₂ / a₁.\n\n*   **Ratio of Semi-Major Axes:**\n    *   From Kepler's Third Law, a ∝ (M_s * P²)^(1/3).\n    *   Therefore, a₂ / a₁ = [ (M_s2 * P₂²) / (M_s1 * P₁²) ]^(1/3).\n\n*   **Substituting Given Values:**\n    *   We are given M_s1 = 2 * M_s2 and P₂ = 3 * P₁.\n    *   a₂ / a₁ = [ (M_s2 * (3 * P₁)²) / ((2 * M_s2) * P₁²) ]^(1/3)\n    *   a₂ / a₁ = [ (M_s2 * 9 * P₁²) / (2 * M_s2 * P₁²) ]^(1/3)\n    *   a₂ / a₁ = (9 / 2)^(1/3)\n    *   a₂ / a₁ = (4.5)^(1/3)\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   (4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65096\n\nThis means Prob₁ / Prob₂ ≈ 1.65. Planet_1 has a transit probability that is approximately 1.65 times higher than Planet_2.\n\nThis matches option D. The logic and calculations are sound and confirmed by the search results.\n\nFinal Answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
