    "To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs, two main criteria must be met for each star: it must be visible from both observatories, and its apparent brightness must be within the detection limits of both instruments.\n\n**1. Visibility from Both Observatories:**\n*   The **Paranal Observatory**, home to ESPRESSO, is in the Southern Hemisphere in Chile (Latitude ~24.6° S). It can observe the entire southern celestial sphere and northern declinations up to about +65°.\n*   The **W. M. Keck Observatory**, home to HIRES, is in the Northern Hemisphere in Hawaii (Latitude ~19.8° N). It can observe the entire northern celestial sphere and southern declinations down to about -70°.\n*   Therefore, a star must have a declination (DEC) between approximately +65° and -70° to be visible from both locations.\n\n**2. Brightness Limits:**\n*   **ESPRESSO** can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude brighter than 17 (V < 17).\n*   **HIRES** can observe stars with an apparent V magnitude brighter than 16 (V < 16).\n*   For a star to be observable by **both**, it must satisfy the stricter limit, meaning its apparent V magnitude must be less than 16.\n\n### Analysis of Each Star:\n\n**Star 1:**\n*   **Visibility:** With a declination of -75°, this star is too far south to be observed from the Keck Observatory in the Northern Hemisphere.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n**Star 2:**\n*   **Visibility:** A declination of +55° is visible from both observatories.\n*   **Brightness:** The apparent V magnitude is given as 16.5. This is too faint for HIRES, which requires a magnitude brighter than 16.0.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n**Star 3:**\n*   **Visibility:** A declination of +48° is visible from both observatories.\n*   **Brightness:** The apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5. This value is brighter than the limit for both ESPRESSO (V < 17) and HIRES (V < 16). The information about color excess and extinction is not needed to determine the observed brightness, as the apparent magnitude is already provided.\n*   **Conclusion:** Can be observed by both.\n\n**Star 4:**\n*   **Visibility:** A declination of -48° is visible from both observatories.\n*   **Brightness:** The apparent magnitude must be calculated from the absolute magnitude, distance, and extinction.\n    *   The formula relating apparent magnitude (m), absolute magnitude (M), distance (d), and absorption (A) is: m = M - 5 + 5*log10(d) + A.\n    *   Given: M = 15.5 mag, d = 10 pc.\n    *   Absorption (Av) = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag.\n    *   m = 15.5 - 5 + 5*log10(10) + 1.24 = 15.5 - 5 + 5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag.\n    *   An apparent magnitude of 16.74 is too faint for HIRES.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be observed by both.\n\n**Star 5:**\n*   **Visibility:** A declination of +60° is visible from both observatories.\n*   **Brightness:** The apparent magnitude must be calculated from the absolute magnitude and distance.\n    *   The formula is: m = M - 5 + 5*log10(d).\n    *   Given: M = 16.5 mag, d = 5 pc.\n    *   m = 16.5 - 5 + 5*log10(5) ≈ 11.5 + 5*(0.699) = 11.5 + 3.495 = 14.995 mag.\n    *   An apparent magnitude of ~15.0 is brighter than the limit for both ESPRESSO and HIRES.\n*   **Conclusion:** Can be observed by both.\n\nBased on this analysis, only Star 3 and Star 5 meet both the visibility and brightness requirements for both observatories.\n\n<<<B>>>"
