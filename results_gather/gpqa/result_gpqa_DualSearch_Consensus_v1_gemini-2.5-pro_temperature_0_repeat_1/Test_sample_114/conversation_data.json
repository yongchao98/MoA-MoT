    "The problem describes an electron-positron annihilation, a process governed by the fundamental principles of conservation of energy and momentum. When an electron and its antiparticle, the positron, collide, they annihilate, converting their mass and kinetic energy into high-energy photons (gamma rays).\n\nTo determine the angle between the two resulting photons, we must apply these conservation laws to the collision.\n\n### Analysis of the Collision\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy before the collision must equal the total energy after the collision.\n    *   The initial energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of the electron and the positron. The energy of a particle is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.\n        *   Electron energy (E_e) = 4 * m_e * c²\n        *   Positron energy (E_p) = 2 * m_e * c²\n        *   Total initial energy (E_i) = (4 + 2) * m_e * c² = 6 * m_e * c²\n    *   The final energy is the sum of the energies of the two photons (E_f = E_ph1 + E_ph2). Since the problem states the photons have equal energy (E_ph1 = E_ph2 = E_ph), the total final energy is E_f = 2 * E_ph.\n    *   Equating initial and final energy: 6 * m_e * c² = 2 * E_ph, which gives the energy of a single photon as E_ph = 3 * m_e * c².\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The total momentum of the system is also conserved. Momentum is a vector, so we must consider its components. Let's assume the electron moves in the positive x-direction and the positron in the negative x-direction.\n    *   The momentum of a relativistic particle is p = √(γ² - 1) * mc.\n        *   Electron momentum (p_e) = √(4² - 1) * m_e * c = √15 * m_e * c (in the +x direction).\n        *   Positron momentum (p_p) = -√(2² - 1) * m_e * c = -√3 * m_e * c (in the -x direction).\n        *   Total initial momentum (p_ix) = (√15 - √3) * m_e * c. The initial momentum in the y-direction is zero.\n    *   The momentum of a photon is p = E/c. For each photon, the momentum magnitude is p_ph = (3 * m_e * c²) / c = 3 * m_e * c.\n    *   The photons are emitted in the upper-right and lower-right directions. Due to momentum conservation in the y-direction, their angles with the horizontal axis must be equal and opposite (θ and -θ).\n        *   The total final momentum in the x-direction is the sum of the x-components of each photon's momentum: p_fx = p_ph * cos(θ) + p_ph * cos(θ) = 2 * p_ph * cos(θ) = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ).\n        *   The total final momentum in the y-direction is p_fy = p_ph * sin(θ) - p_ph * sin(θ) = 0, which is consistent with the initial state.\n    *   Equating the initial and final momentum in the x-direction: (√15 - √3) * m_e * c = 6 * m_e * c * cos(θ).\n\n3.  **Calculating the Angle:**\n    *   From the momentum conservation equation, we can solve for the angle θ:\n        cos(θ) = (√15 - √3) / 6\n    *   Using the approximate values √15 ≈ 3.873 and √3 ≈ 1.732:\n        cos(θ) ≈ (3.873 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 0.357\n    *   Taking the arccosine gives θ ≈ 69.1°.\n    *   The question asks for the angle *between* the two photons, which is 2θ.\n        Angle = 2 * 69.1° = 138.2°.\n\nThis result is very close to 138. In cases where the initial net momentum is not zero, the angle between the emitted photons will deviate from 180 degrees.\n\n<<<B>>>"
