    "### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\nTo determine the momentum of the absorbed photon, we first need to calculate the energy change (ΔE) for the transition. The molecule starts in its fundamental state and moves to the next state with the lowest possible energy upon absorbing a photon.\n\n**1. Define the Energy Levels:**\nThe energy of a diatomic molecule in the quantum rotation-vibration model is given by the sum of its vibrational and rotational energies:\n*   E(v, J) = ħω(v + 1/2) + (ħ²/2I) * J(J + 1)\n    *   **v** is the vibrational quantum number (v = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n    *   **J** is the rotational quantum number (J = 0, 1, 2, ...).\n    *   **ħ** is the reduced Planck constant (≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n    *   **ω** is the angular frequency of vibration.\n    *   **I** is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n\n**2. Identify the Transition:**\n*   **Fundamental State:** The state with the lowest possible energy is the ground state, where both quantum numbers are at their minimum: v = 0 and J = 0.\n    *   E_initial = E(0, 0) = ħω(0 + 1/2) + 0 = (1/2)ħω.\n*   **Next Lowest Energy State (via Photon Absorption):** For a rovibrational transition initiated by photon absorption, the selection rules are Δv = +1 and ΔJ = ±1. Since the molecule starts at J=0, only a ΔJ = +1 transition is possible.\n    *   Therefore, the final state is v = 1 and J = 1.\n    *   E_final = E(1, 1) = ħω(1 + 1/2) + (ħ²/2I) * 1(1 + 1) = (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I.\n\n**3. Calculate the Energy of the Absorbed Photon (ΔE):**\nThe energy of the photon must equal the energy difference between the final and initial states.\n*   ΔE = E_final - E_initial\n*   ΔE = [ (3/2)ħω + ħ²/I ] - [ (1/2)ħω ]\n*   ΔE = ħω + ħ²/I\n\nTo calculate this, we need the moment of inertia, I.\n\n**4. Calculate the Reduced Mass (μ):**\nThe reduced mass is calculated using the masses of the two atoms, Mx and My.\n*   μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My)\n*   μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 amu + 2 amu) = 40 / 22 amu ≈ 1.818 amu\n*   Converting to kilograms (1 amu ≈ 1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg):\n*   μ ≈ 1.818 * (1.66054 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) ≈ 3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg\n\n**5. Calculate the Moment of Inertia (I):**\nThe moment of inertia for a diatomic molecule is I = μR², where R is the bond length.\n*   R = 2 angstroms = 2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m\n*   I = (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (2 x 10⁻¹⁰ m)²\n*   I = (3.019 x 10⁻²⁷ kg) * (4 x 10⁻²⁰ m²) ≈ 1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²\n\n**6. Calculate the Total Energy Change (ΔE):**\nNow we calculate the two components of the energy change:\n*   **Vibrational Energy Term (ħω):**\n    *   ΔE_vib = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) * (4 x 10¹⁴ rad/s) ≈ 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n*   **Rotational Energy Term (ħ²/I):**\n    *   ΔE_rot = (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)² / (1.2076 x 10⁻⁴⁶ kg·m²) ≈ 9.21 x 10⁻²³ J\n*   **Total Energy (ΔE):**\n    *   ΔE = ΔE_vib + ΔE_rot ≈ 4.216 x 10⁻²⁰ J + 0.00921 x 10⁻²⁰ J ≈ 4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J\n    (Note: The rotational energy contribution is very small compared to the vibrational energy).\n\n**7. Calculate the Photon's Momentum (p):**\nThe energy of a photon is related to its momentum by the equation E = pc, where c is the speed of light (≈ 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s).\n*   p = ΔE / c\n*   p = (4.225 x 10⁻²⁰ J) / (3.00 x 10⁸ m/s)\n*   p ≈ 1.408 x 10⁻²⁸ N·s\n\nThis calculated value is very close to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
