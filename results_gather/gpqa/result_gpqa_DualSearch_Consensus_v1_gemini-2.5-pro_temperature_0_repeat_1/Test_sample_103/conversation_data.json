    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the ratio of the orbital periods.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Radial Velocity (RV) Method\n\nThe radial velocity method detects exoplanets by observing the Doppler shift in the spectrum of their host star. A planet's gravitational pull causes its star to \"wobble\" around their common center of mass. This movement along our line of sight changes the wavelength of the light we observe from the star. The amplitude of this periodic wavelength shift (Δλ) is directly proportional to the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K).\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes of the two stars is equal to the ratio of their observed wavelength shifts:\n\n*K₁ / K₂ = Δλ₁ / Δλ₂ = 5 milliangstrom / 7 milliangstrom = 5/7*\n\n### 2. The Radial Velocity Formula\n\nFor a planet in a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity (K) is given by the formula:\n\nK = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / Mₛ^(2/3))\n\nWhere:\n*   **P** is the orbital period of the planet.\n*   **G** is the gravitational constant.\n*   **mₚ** is the mass of the planet.\n*   **Mₛ** is the mass of the star.\n*   **i** is the inclination of the planet's orbit relative to our line of sight.\n\nThe term **mₚ sin(i)** is known as the \"minimum mass\" of the planet, which is the quantity that can be determined from RV measurements without knowing the inclination.\n\n### 3. Applying the Formula to the Two Systems\n\nWe are given the following information:\n*   The stars have the same mass: Mₛ₁ = Mₛ₂.\n*   The planets were \"detected\" with \"masses similar to that of Neptune.\" In the context of the RV method, this implies that their minimum masses are similar: mₚ₁ sin(i₁) ≈ mₚ₂ sin(i₂).\n\nBased on these conditions, the term `(2πG)^(1/3) * (mₚ sin(i) / Mₛ^(2/3))` is constant for both systems. This simplifies the relationship between the radial velocity (K) and the orbital period (P) to:\n\n*K ∝ P^(-1/3)*\n\n### 4. Calculating the Ratio of the Orbital Periods\n\nWe can establish a relationship between the two systems:\n\n*K₁ * P₁^(1/3) = K₂ * P₂^(1/3)*\n\nTo find how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1 (P₂/P₁), we can rearrange the equation:\n\n*(P₂ / P₁)^(1/3) = K₁ / K₂*\n\nNow, we solve for the ratio P₂ / P₁:\n\n*P₂ / P₁ = (K₁ / K₂)³*\n\nSubstituting the ratio of the radial velocities we found in the first step:\n\n*P₂ / P₁ = (5 / 7)³ = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364*\n\nThus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.\n\n<<<B>>>"
