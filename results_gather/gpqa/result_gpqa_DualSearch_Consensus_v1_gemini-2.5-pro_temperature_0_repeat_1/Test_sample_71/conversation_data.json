    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the structure of the final product and the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Product 1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene and 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene.\n*   **Reagents:** Sodium iodide (NaI) at an elevated temperature.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with sodium iodide is a known method for generating a reactive diene in situ. This occurs through debromination to form 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene. This molecule, an isomer of C8H8, acts as the diene in a subsequent reaction.\n*   The generated diene, 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene, then reacts with the dienophile, 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Since two equivalents of the diene precursor are used, a double Diels-Alder reaction occurs, with one molecule of the generated diene adding to each of the two double bonds of the norbornadiene derivative. This complex cycloaddition yields Product 1.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Product 2**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 1.\n*   **Reagent:** Aqueous sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard acid-catalyzed deprotection of a tert-butyl ether. The tert-butoxy group is protonated and leaves as tert-butanol, forming a secondary alcohol at the 7-position of the central norbornane skeleton. This yields Product 2.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Product 3**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 2.\n*   **Reagent:** SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO (Parikh-Doering oxidation).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a mild oxidation of the secondary alcohol at the C7 position to a ketone. This reaction yields Product 3, which is a 7-keto-norbornane derivative with large polycyclic systems fused to it.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of Product 4**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Product 3.\n*   **Condition:** Heating at 150°C.\n*   **Reaction:** Heating a Diels-Alder adduct can induce a retro-Diels-Alder reaction. In this case, Product 3 is a double adduct. Heating will cause a double retro-Diels-Alder reaction, regenerating the original diene and dienophile components.\n    *   The dienophile that is regenerated is bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-dien-7-one. This molecule is known to be unstable and readily decomposes upon heating to eliminate a molecule of carbon monoxide (CO) and form the very stable aromatic molecule, benzene.\n    *   The diene that is regenerated is 5,6-dimethylidenecyclohexa-1,3-diene (DMCD). Two molecules of this diene are released.\n*   **Identification of Final Product 4:** The decomposition of Product 3 yields three substances: benzene, carbon monoxide, and DMCD. The reactive diene DMCD, being generated at a high temperature, is unlikely to be the final stable product. It will likely undergo further reaction. A plausible transformation for such a C₈H₈ isomer under thermal conditions is rearrangement to a more stable isomer. One such known product from the rearrangement of related systems is a fulvene derivative. In this case, DMCD can rearrange to 2-vinylfulvene (more systematically named 2-ethenyl-5-methylidenecyclopenta-1,3-diene). This rearranged, more stable molecule is considered the final product, 4.\n\n**Determining the Number of Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms in Product 4**\n\n*   **Structure of Product 4:** The final product is 2-vinylfulvene. Its structure consists of a five-membered ring with two double bonds inside the ring, one exocyclic double bond, and a vinyl group substituent.\n*   **Proton Count:**\n    *   Ring protons: There are hydrogens on carbons 1, 3, and 4. (3 protons)\n    *   Exocyclic methylene protons: There is a =CH₂ group at position 5. (2 protons)\n    *   Vinyl group protons: The -CH=CH₂ group has 3 protons.\n    *   The total number of hydrogen atoms is 3 + 2 + 3 = 8.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** The molecule 2-vinylfulvene possesses no elements of symmetry (such as a plane or axis of rotation). In an asymmetrical molecule, all hydrogen atoms are in unique chemical environments.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since there are 8 hydrogen atoms and no symmetry, there are **8** chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. Each of these would give a separate signal in a ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA) 8\nB) 7\nC) 10\nD) 4\n\nThe calculated number of distinct hydrogen atoms matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
