    "To determine the time it will take for the astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective, we need to use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation.\n\nFirst, we establish the necessary information:\n*   **Distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (d):** The Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately 163,000 light-years away from Earth. For the purpose of this calculation, we will use the slightly rounded figure of 160,000 light-years, which has also been a historically cited distance.\n*   **Speed of the spacecraft (v):** The problem states the speed is a constant 0.99999987% of the speed of light (c).\n*   **Time Dilation Formula:** The relationship between time measured by a stationary observer (t) and time measured by a moving observer (t₀, or proper time) is given by the formula: t = γ * t₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.\n*   **Lorentz Factor (γ):** The Lorentz factor is calculated as γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Calculate the time of the journey from Earth's perspective (t):**\n    This is the time it would take for the spacecraft to travel the distance as measured by an observer on Earth.\n    *   Time = Distance / Speed\n    *   t = 160,000 light-years / (0.99999987 * c)\n    *   Since a light-year is the distance light travels in one year, the calculation simplifies to:\n    *   t ≈ 160,000.02 years\n\n2.  **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n    This factor quantifies the magnitude of time dilation.\n    *   v/c = 0.99999987\n    *   γ = 1 / √(1 - (0.99999987)²)\n    *   γ ≈ 1 / √(1 - 0.99999974)\n    *   γ ≈ 1 / √0.00000026\n    *   γ ≈ 1 / 0.0005099\n    *   γ ≈ 1961.17\n\n3.  **Calculate the time experienced by the astronaut (t₀):**\n    This is the proper time, which is the time that actually passes for the astronaut on the spacecraft.\n    *   t₀ = t / γ\n    *   t₀ ≈ 160,000.02 years / 1961.17\n    *   t₀ ≈ 81.58 years\n\nThis result is approximately 81.58 years. Upon arrival, the astronaut's age would be 22 + 81.58 = 103.58 years, which is well within their 150-year lifespan.\n\nComparing our result with the given options:\nA) 72 years\nB) The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth.\nC) 77 years\nD) 81 years\n\nThe calculated travel time for the astronaut (81.58 years) is closest to 81 years.\n\n<<<D>>>"
