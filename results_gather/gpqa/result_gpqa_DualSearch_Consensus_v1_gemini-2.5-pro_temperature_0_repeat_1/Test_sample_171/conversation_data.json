    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the correct equation:\n\n1.  **The Boltzmann Equation**: Under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the population of atoms in a specific energy level is described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in an excited state (N_i) to the number of atoms in the ground state (N_0) is given by:\n\n    N_i / N_0 = (g_i / g_0) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))\n\n    where:\n    *   `g_i` and `g_0` are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of the excited and ground states, respectively.\n    *   `ΔE` is the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state.\n    *   `k` is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n    *   `T` is the temperature of the photosphere.\n\n2.  **Applying to Star 1 and Star 2**: We can write the Boltzmann equation for each star:\n\n    *   For Star 1 (temperature T_1): (N_i / N_0)_1 = (g_i / g_0) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1))\n    *   For Star 2 (temperature T_2): (N_i / N_0)_2 = (g_i / g_0) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n3.  **Using the Observational Data**: The problem states that the excitation in star 1 is twice that in star 2. This means the ratio of the population in the excited state to the ground state for star 1 is double that for star 2:\n\n    (N_i / N_0)_1 = 2 * (N_i / N_0)_2\n\n4.  **Formulating the Equation**: By substituting the Boltzmann expressions into the observational relationship, we get:\n\n    (g_i / g_0) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * [(g_i / g_0) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))]\n\n5.  **Simplifying the Expression**: The term for the statistical weights (g_i / g_0) is a property of the iron atom and is the same for both stars, so it cancels out:\n\n    exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2))\n\n    Rearranging the terms to isolate the constant '2':\n\n    exp(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) / exp(-ΔE / (k * T_2)) = 2\n\n    Using the property of exponents (e^a / e^b = e^(a-b)):\n\n    exp[(-ΔE / (k * T_1)) - (-ΔE / (k * T_2))] = 2\n    exp[(ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)] = 2\n\n6.  **Taking the Natural Logarithm**: To remove the exponential, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\n    ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\n7.  **Using the Given Energy Value**: The problem states the energy difference `ΔE` is approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J. The Boltzmann constant `k` is also approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K. Therefore, the ratio `ΔE / k` is approximately 1.\n\n    ln(2) = 1 * (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)\n\n8.  **Final Algebraic Step**: Combine the fractions in the parenthesis:\n\n    ln(2) = (T_1 - T_2) / (T_1 * T_2)\n\nThis equation matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
