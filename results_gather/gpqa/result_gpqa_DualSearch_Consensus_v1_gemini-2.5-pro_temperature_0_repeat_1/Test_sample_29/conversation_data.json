    "To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we first need to calculate the wavelength of the emitted light and then relate it to the absorbed light.\n\n1.  **Calculate the wavelength of the emitted light:**\n    The relationship between the energy (E) of a photon and its wavelength (λ) is given by the formula E = hc/λ, where 'h' is Planck's constant and 'c' is the speed of light. A convenient formula for converting energy in electronvolts (eV) to wavelength in nanometers (nm) is:\n    λ (nm) ≈ 1240 / E (eV)\n\n    Given the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV:\n    λ ≈ 1240 / 2.3393 eV\n    λ ≈ 530 nm\n\n2.  **Identify the color of the emitted light:**\n    A wavelength of approximately 530 nm corresponds to green light in the visible spectrum.\n\n3.  **Determine the color of the absorbed light:**\n    The problem states that the textile dye *emits* light after absorbing energy. This process is known as fluorescence. In fluorescence, a molecule absorbs a high-energy photon and then emits a lower-energy photon. According to the energy-wavelength relationship (E = hc/λ), lower energy corresponds to a longer wavelength. This phenomenon is called the Stokes shift.\n\n    Therefore, the absorbed light must have a higher energy and a shorter wavelength than the emitted green light (530 nm).\n\n4.  **Evaluate the given options:**\n    *   **Emitted light:** Green (λ ≈ 530 nm)\n    *   **A) Red:** Wavelength is approximately 620-750 nm. This is a longer wavelength (lower energy) than the emitted light, so it cannot be the absorbed color.\n    *   **B) Yellow:** Wavelength is approximately 570-590 nm. This is also a longer wavelength (lower energy) than the emitted light.\n    *   **C) Blue:** Wavelength is approximately 450-495 nm. This is a shorter wavelength (higher energy) than the emitted green light.\n    *   **D) Violet:** Wavelength is approximately 380-450 nm. This is also a shorter wavelength (higher energy) than the emitted green light.\n\n    Both blue and violet light have enough energy to cause the green fluorescence. However, the color that is absorbed is often the complementary color of the color the substance appears. A substance that absorbs blue light typically appears yellow. It is very common for a compound that absorbs blue light to then fluoresce at a slightly longer wavelength, such as green. For example, the common fluorescent dye fluorescein absorbs blue light and emits green light. Therefore, blue is the most probable color of light absorbed by the compound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
