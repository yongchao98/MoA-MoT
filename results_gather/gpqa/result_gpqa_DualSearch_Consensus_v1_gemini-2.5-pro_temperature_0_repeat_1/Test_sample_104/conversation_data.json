    "To determine the relative radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, we must first calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spotted star and then equate it to the dimming caused by a planetary transit.\n\n### Step 1: Amplitude from Starspot Variation\n\nThe brightness of the star changes as it rotates, showing its maximum brightness when the unspotted hemisphere faces the observer and its minimum brightness when the spotted hemisphere is in view.\n\nThe flux (F) emitted per unit area of a star is proportional to the fourth power of its effective temperature (T), according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law (F ∝ T⁴).\n\n*   **Maximum Flux (F_max):** This occurs when the unspotted hemisphere, with a uniform temperature T_eff = 6000K, faces the observer. We can represent this flux as:\n    F_max ∝ T_eff⁴\n\n*   **Minimum Flux (F_min):** This occurs when the spotted hemisphere faces the observer. This hemisphere has a spot filling factor (f) of 20% (or 0.2). The spots have a temperature (T_spot) of 6000K - 1000K = 5000K. The remaining 80% of this hemisphere is at the star's effective temperature (T_eff). The total flux from this hemisphere is a weighted average:\n    F_min ∝ (1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴\n\nThe amplitude of the photometric variation is the fractional drop in flux:\n\nAmplitude = (F_max - F_min) / F_max\nAmplitude = (T_eff⁴ - [(1 - f) * T_eff⁴ + f * T_spot⁴]) / T_eff⁴\nAmplitude = (f * T_eff⁴ - f * T_spot⁴) / T_eff⁴\nAmplitude = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff)⁴)\n\nNow, we plug in the given values:\n*   f = 0.20\n*   T_eff = 6000 K\n*   T_spot = 5000 K\n\nAmplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5000 / 6000)⁴)\nAmplitude = 0.20 * (1 - (5/6)⁴)\nAmplitude = 0.20 * (1 - 625 / 1296)\nAmplitude = 0.20 * (671 / 1296)\nAmplitude ≈ 0.10355\n\nSo, the star's brightness varies by approximately 10.36% due to the rotating spotty hemisphere.\n\n### Step 2: Equivalent Exoplanet Transit Depth\n\nAn exoplanet passing in front of its star causes a dip in brightness known as a transit. The depth of this transit is approximately the ratio of the planet's disk area (πR_pl²) to the star's disk area (πR_star²).\n\nTransit Depth = (πR_pl²) / (πR_star²) = (R_pl / R_star)²\n\n### Step 3: Equating the Signals and Solving\n\nTo find the exoplanet size that would produce the same amplitude, we set the transit depth equal to the calculated amplitude from the starspots:\n\n(R_pl / R_star)² = Amplitude\n(R_pl / R_star)² ≈ 0.10355\n\nNow, we solve for the relative radius (R_pl / R_star) by taking the square root:\n\nR_pl / R_star = √0.10355\nR_pl / R_star ≈ 0.3218\n\nThis value is approximately 0.32.\n\n<<<D>>>"
