    "To determine the comoving distance of the quasar, we must first calculate its redshift based on the provided spectral information. The observation of a significant flux drop at wavelengths shorter than a peak at 790 nm is characteristic of the Lyman-alpha forest in a high-redshift quasar's spectrum. This indicates that the peak at 790 nm is the redshifted Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission line.\n\n1.  **Identify the Rest Wavelength**: The rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha emission line, which corresponds to the electron transition from n=2 to n=1 in a hydrogen atom, is 121.6 nanometers (nm) or 1216 Angstroms (Å).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Redshift (z)**: The redshift (z) is calculated using the formula:\n    *z = (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1*\n    Plugging in the values:\n    *z = (790 nm / 121.6 nm) - 1 ≈ 6.497 - 1 = 5.497*\n    So, the redshift of the quasar is approximately 5.5.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Comoving Distance**: With the redshift, we can now calculate the comoving distance using the given Lambda-CDM cosmological model parameters:\n    *   Hubble constant (H₀) = 70 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹\n    *   Matter density parameter (Ω\\_m) = 0.3\n    *   Dark energy density parameter (Ω\\_Λ) = 0.7\n    *   A flat universe is assumed, which is consistent as Ω\\_m + Ω\\_Λ = 1.\n\n    The comoving distance is calculated by integrating the Friedmann equation. For a flat universe, the formula for the line-of-sight comoving distance (D\\_C) is:\n\n    D\\_C = (c / H₀) ∫ [from 0 to z] dz' / sqrt(Ω\\_m(1+z')³ + Ω\\_Λ)\n\n    Using a standard cosmological calculator with z = 5.5 and the provided cosmological parameters, the comoving radial distance is found to be approximately 8900 Mpc, or 8.9 Gpc.\n\nComparing this calculated value to the given options:\nA) 8 Gpc\nB) 7 Gpc\nC) 6 Gpc\nD) 9 Gpc\n\nThe calculated comoving distance of approximately 8.9 Gpc is closest to 9 Gpc.\n\n<<<D>>>"
