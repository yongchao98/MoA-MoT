    "To determine how the number of stars per unit range of distance changes, we first need to understand the relationship between distance and parallax.\n\nStellar parallax (`plx`) is inversely proportional to the distance (`r`) of a star. This can be expressed as:\n`plx ∝ 1/r`\n\nThis also means that distance is inversely proportional to parallax:\n`r ∝ 1/plx`\n\nThe problem states that the number of stars (`N`) varies with parallax as `1/plx^5`. This is best interpreted as the number of stars per unit interval of parallax (`dN/d(plx)`). So, we have:\n`dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5`\n\nWe want to find how the number of stars per unit range of distance (`dN/dr`) changes with distance (`r`). To convert from the parallax derivative to the distance derivative, we can use the chain rule from calculus:\n`dN/dr = (dN/d(plx)) * (d(plx)/dr)`\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of parallax with respect to distance, `d(plx)/dr`. Since `plx = k/r` (where `k` is a constant of proportionality), the derivative is:\n`d(plx)/dr = -k/r^2`\nThis shows that `d(plx)/dr ∝ -1/r^2`.\n\nNow we can substitute our known proportionalities into the chain rule equation. We need to express the right side of the equation in terms of `r`. We already have `d(plx)/dr` in terms of `r`. For the `dN/d(plx)` term, we substitute `plx ∝ 1/r` into the given relation:\n`dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx^5 ∝ 1/(1/r)^5 = r^5`\n\nNow, we combine these parts:\n`dN/dr ∝ (r^5) * (-1/r^2)`\n`dN/dr ∝ -r^3`\n\nThe negative sign indicates that as the distance `r` increases, the parallax `plx` decreases. We are interested in the magnitude of the relationship, so the number of stars per unit range of distance varies as the cube of the distance.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance per unit range of distance as `r^3`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
