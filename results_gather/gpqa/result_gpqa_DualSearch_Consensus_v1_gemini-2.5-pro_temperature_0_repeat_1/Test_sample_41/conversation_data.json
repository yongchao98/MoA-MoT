    "To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Relate Equilibrium Temperature to Orbital Distance\n\nThe equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet in a circular orbit is determined by the balance between the energy absorbed from its star and the energy it radiates away. The formula is:\n\nT_eq ∝ (1 - A)^(1/4) / √a\n\nWhere:\n*   `A` is the albedo (the fraction of light reflected).\n*   `a` is the semi-major axis, or the orbital distance for a circular orbit.\n\nSince the albedo `A` is the same for all three planets, the formula simplifies the relationship between the equilibrium temperature and the orbital distance to:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1/√a\n\nThis means that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of two planets is inversely proportional to the square root of the ratio of their orbital distances.\n\n(T_eq_x / T_eq_y) = √(a_y / a_x)\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Ratios of the Orbital Distances\n\nWe are given the ratios of the equilibrium temperatures:\n*   T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 1.4\n*   T_eq2 / T_eq3 ≈ 2.3\n\nUsing the relationship from Step 1, we can find the ratios of the orbital distances:\n\nFor Planet 1 and Planet 2:\n(T_eq1 / T_eq2) = √(a2 / a1)\n1.4 ≈ √(a2 / a1)\n(a2 / a1) ≈ 1.4² = 1.96\n\nFor Planet 2 and Planet 3:\n(T_eq2 / T_eq3) = √(a3 / a2)\n2.3 ≈ √(a3 / a2)\n(a3 / a2) ≈ 2.3² = 5.29\n\nNow, to find the ratio of the orbital distance of Planet3 to Planet1 (a3 / a1), we multiply the two calculated ratios:\n\n(a3 / a1) = (a2 / a1) * (a3 / a2) ≈ 1.96 * 5.29 = 10.3684\n\n### Step 3: Apply Kepler's Third Law\n\nKepler's Third Law of planetary motion states that the square of a planet's orbital period (`P`) is directly proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (`a`).\n\nP² ∝ a³\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the orbital periods can be related to the ratio of their orbital distances as follows:\n\n(P3 / P1)² = (a3 / a1)³\nP3 / P1 = (a3 / a1)^(3/2)\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Ratio of the Orbital Periods\n\nUsing the value of (a3 / a1) calculated in Step 2:\n\nP3 / P1 ≈ (10.3684)^(3/2)\nP3 / P1 ≈ (10.3684)^1.5\nP3 / P1 ≈ 33.3856\n\nThis value is approximately 33.4. The information regarding the planets' masses and the TTV detection method is not necessary for this calculation.\n\nTherefore, the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of approximately 33.4.\n\n<<<A>>>"
