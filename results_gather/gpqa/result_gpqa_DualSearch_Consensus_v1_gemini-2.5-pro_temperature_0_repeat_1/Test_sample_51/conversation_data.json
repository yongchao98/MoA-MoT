    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral titanium atoms changes.\n\n**1. Understand the Governing Physics**\n\nUnder the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the ratio of the number of atoms in two different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the population of a higher energy level (N₁) to a lower energy level (N₂) is given by:\n\n*Ratio (R) = N₁ / N₂ = (g₁ / g₂) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T))*\n\nWhere:\n*   **g₁** and **g₂** are the statistical weights of the two levels.\n*   **ΔE** is the energy difference between the two levels (E₁ - E₂).\n*   **k** is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K).\n*   **T** is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe problem states that the ratio of Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2 *decreases* when the star has spots. Since spots make the star cooler, this means the ratio decreases as the temperature (T) decreases. For this to be true, the exponent (-ΔE / (kT)) must decrease as T decreases. This can only happen if the term -ΔE is negative, which implies that ΔE (E₁ - E₂) must be positive. Therefore, level 1 is the higher energy level.\n\n**2. Determine the Temperatures**\n\nWe are given the temperatures for the two scenarios:\n*   **No spots:** T_nospots = 6000 K\n*   **With spots:** The overall effective temperature is T_spots = 5500 K. This integrated temperature is the appropriate one to use for the entire photosphere as observed.\n\n**3. Calculate the Transition Energy**\n\nThe energy difference (ΔE) corresponds to the given wavelength (λ) of the transition, which is 1448 Å. The relationship between energy and wavelength is given by the Planck-Einstein relation.\n\n*ΔE = h * c / λ*\n\nWhere:\n*   **h** is the Planck constant (approximately 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s).\n*   **c** is the speed of light (approximately 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s).\n*   **λ** is the wavelength (1448 Å = 1.448 x 10⁻⁷ m).\n\nFor use in the Boltzmann equation, it is convenient to calculate the term ΔE/k:\n\n*ΔE / k = (h * c) / (λ * k)*\n\n*ΔE / k = (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s * 3.0 x 10⁸ m/s) / (1.448 x 10⁻⁷ m * 1.38 x 10⁻²³ J/K)*\n\n*ΔE / k ≈ 99,477 K*\n\n**4. Calculate the Factor of Change**\n\nWe need to find the factor by which the ratio changes, which is the ratio without spots divided by the ratio with spots (F = R_nospots / R_spots).\n\n*F = [ (g₁/g₂) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_nospots)) ] / [ (g₁/g₂) * exp(-ΔE / (k * T_spots)) ]*\n\nThe statistical weights (g₁/g₂) cancel out:\n\n*F = exp [ (-ΔE / k) * (1/T_nospots - 1/T_spots) ]*\n\n*F = exp [ (ΔE / k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_nospots) ]*\n\nNow, we substitute the known values:\n\n*F = exp [ 99,477 K * (1/5500 K - 1/6000 K) ]*\n\n*F = exp [ 99,477 * ( (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) ) ]*\n\n*F = exp [ 99,477 * (500 / 33,000,000) ]*\n\n*F = exp [ 99,477 / 66,000 ]*\n\n*F = exp(1.507)*\n\n*F ≈ 4.51*\n\nThe calculated factor is approximately 4.5.\n\n<<<B>>>"
