    "To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization for the given mixture, we will follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the total moles of H+ ions from the acids.\n*   **From HCl (a strong acid):**\n    *   Moles of H+ = Molarity × Volume\n    *   Moles of H+ = 0.2 mol/L × 0.500 L = 0.10 mol\n*   **From H2SO4 (a strong acid):**\n    *   H2SO4 provides two H+ ions per molecule.\n    *   Moles of H+ = Molarity × Volume × 2\n    *   Moles of H+ = 0.3 mol/L × 0.300 L × 2 = 0.18 mol\n*   **Total moles of H+:**\n    *   Total H+ = 0.10 mol + 0.18 mol = 0.28 mol\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the total moles of OH- ions from the base.\n*   **From Ba(OH)2 (a strong base):**\n    *   Ba(OH)2 provides two OH- ions per molecule.\n    *   Moles of OH- = Molarity × Volume × 2\n    *   Moles of OH- = 0.5 mol/L × 0.200 L × 2 = 0.20 mol\n\n### Step 3: Determine the limiting reactant and moles of water formed.\nThe neutralization reaction is: H+ + OH- → H2O\n*   We have 0.28 moles of H+ and 0.20 moles of OH-.\n*   The OH- ions are the limiting reactant, as there are fewer of them.\n*   Therefore, a maximum of 0.20 moles of water (H2O) will be formed during the neutralization.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the total enthalpy of neutralization.\nThe standard enthalpy of neutralization for the reaction between a strong acid and a strong base is the heat released when one mole of water is formed, which is approximately -13.6 to -13.7 kcal/mol. Using the value -13.6 kcal/mol:\n*   Total Enthalpy = Moles of H2O formed × Enthalpy of Neutralization per mole\n*   Total Enthalpy = 0.20 mol × (-13.6 kcal/mol)\n*   Total Enthalpy = -2.72 kcal\n\nThis calculation considers only the heat evolved from the formation of water (neutralization). While a precipitation reaction (Ba2+ + SO42- → BaSO4) also occurs and releases heat, the question specifically asks for the \"enthalpy of neutralization,\" and the calculated value matches one of the options perfectly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
