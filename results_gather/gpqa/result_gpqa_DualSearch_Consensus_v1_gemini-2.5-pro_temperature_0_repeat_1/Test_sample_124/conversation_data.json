    "The problem describes a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues for such a system are given by the formula:\n\n$E_n = (n + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega$\n\nwhere $n = n_x + n_y + n_z = 0, 1, 2, ...$ is the principal quantum number.\n\nThe energy levels are:\n*   **Ground state (n=0):** This is the lowest energy state. $E_0 = (0 + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega = (3/2) \\hbar \\omega$.\n*   **First excited state (n=1):** $E_1 = (1 + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega = (5/2) \\hbar \\omega$.\n*   **Second excited state (n=2):** $E_2 = (2 + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega = (7/2) \\hbar \\omega$.\n*   **Third excited state (n=3):** $E_3 = (3 + 3/2) \\hbar \\omega = (9/2) \\hbar \\omega$.\n\nThe energy of the third excited state is therefore $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$.\n\nThe number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given energy level $E_n$, known as the degeneracy ($g_n$), is the number of ways the integer $n$ can be written as the sum of three non-negative integers ($n_x, n_y, n_z$). The formula for the degeneracy is:\n\n$g_n = (n+1)(n+2)/2$\n\nFor the third excited state, $n=3$. The degeneracy is:\n\n$g_3 = (3+1)(3+2)/2 = (4)(5)/2 = 10$.\n\nThese 10 independent states correspond to the different combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that sum to 3:\n*   (3,0,0) and its 2 permutations: 3 states.\n*   (2,1,0) and its 5 permutations: 6 states.\n*   (1,1,1): 1 state.\n\nThe total number of linearly independent eigenfunctions is $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$.\n\nThus, the energy of the third excited state is $(9/2) \\hbar \\omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for this energy.\n\n<<<C>>>"
