    "To solve this problem, we need to use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and the formula for exponential decay.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Physics\n\n1.  **Particle Decay:** The number of particles, N, that survive after a time, t, in the laboratory's frame of reference is given by the exponential decay law:\n    N(t) = N₀ * exp(-t / τ_lab)\n    where N₀ is the initial number of particles and τ_lab is the average lifetime of the particles in the lab frame.\n\n2.  **Time Dilation:** The lifetime of a particle as measured in the lab frame (τ_lab) is longer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (the proper lifetime, τ₀) due to time dilation. This relationship is defined by the Lorentz factor (γ):\n    τ_lab = γ * τ₀\n    This phenomenon is a key prediction of special relativity and has been experimentally verified numerous times.\n\n3.  **Time of Flight:** The particles are produced at the center of the detector and travel to the inner wall. The time it takes for them to travel the radius (R) of the detector is:\n    t = R / v\n    Since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic velocities, their speed (v) is approximately the speed of light (c). So, we can write:\n    t ≈ R / c\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Equation for Particle Survival\n\nBy combining the equations from Step 1, we can find the fraction of particles (N/N₀) that reach the detector wall:\n\nFraction surviving = N(t) / N₀ = exp(-t / τ_lab)\n\nSubstitute the expressions for t and τ_lab:\n\nFraction surviving = exp(-(R / c) / (γ * τ₀)) = exp(-R / (γ * c * τ₀))\n\n### Step 3: Use the Initial Conditions\n\nWe are given the following initial conditions:\n*   Detector radius, R = 30 m\n*   Lorentz factor, γ₁ = 20\n*   Fraction of surviving particles = 1/3\n\nPlugging these values into our equation:\n\n1/3 = exp(-30 / (20 * c * τ₀))\n\nTo solve for the unknown constant part (c * τ₀), we can take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(1/3) = -30 / (20 * c * τ₀)\n-ln(3) = -1.5 / (c * τ₀)\nln(3) = 1.5 / (c * τ₀)\n\nThis allows us to find the value of the term `1 / (c * τ₀)`:\n\n1 / (c * τ₀) = ln(3) / 1.5\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Required Lorentz Factor\n\nNow, we need to find the new Lorentz factor (γ₂) that allows two-thirds (2/3) of the particles to reach the detector.\n\nThe new condition is:\n*   Fraction of surviving particles = 2/3\n*   Lorentz factor = γ₂\n\nUsing the same survival equation:\n\n2/3 = exp(-30 / (γ₂ * c * τ₀))\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\n2/3 = exp((-30) * (1 / (c * τ₀)) / γ₂)\n\nNow, substitute the expression for `1 / (c * τ₀)` that we found in Step 3:\n\n2/3 = exp((-30) * (ln(3) / 1.5) / γ₂)\n2/3 = exp(-20 * ln(3) / γ₂)\n\nAgain, take the natural logarithm of both sides to solve for γ₂:\n\nln(2/3) = -20 * ln(3) / γ₂\n-ln(3/2) = -20 * ln(3) / γ₂\nln(1.5) = 20 * ln(3) / γ₂\n\nFinally, rearrange the equation to solve for γ₂:\n\nγ₂ = 20 * ln(3) / ln(1.5)\n\nUsing the approximate values for the natural logarithms (ln(3) ≈ 1.0986 and ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055):\n\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055)\nγ₂ ≈ 20 * 2.709\nγ₂ ≈ 54.18\n\nThis value is approximately 54.\n\n<<<A>>>"
