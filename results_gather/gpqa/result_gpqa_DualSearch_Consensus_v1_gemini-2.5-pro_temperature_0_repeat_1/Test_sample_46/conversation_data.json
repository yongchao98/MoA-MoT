    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to identify the unknown compound C9H11NO2.\n\n### 1. Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n\nThe degree of unsaturation indicates the total number of rings and π bonds within a molecule. It is calculated using the formula:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2)\n\nFor the molecular formula C9H11NO2:\nDoU = 9 + 1 - (11/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 5.5 + 0.5 = 5\n\nA degree of unsaturation of 5 is characteristic of a substituted benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees: 1 ring and 3 double bonds) plus one additional double bond, typically a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n\n*   **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹ (medium to strong):** The presence of two distinct bands in this region is a clear indication of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **1720 cm⁻¹ (strong):** This strong absorption is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration. This frequency is typical for an ester.\n\n### 3. ¹H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Analysis\n\n*   **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):** A triplet integrating to three protons suggests a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):** A quartet integrating to two protons indicates a methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to a methyl group (-CH₃). The combination of the triplet at 1.20 ppm and this quartet at 4.5 ppm confirms the presence of an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃). The significant downfield chemical shift (4.5 ppm) suggests this methylene group is bonded to a highly electronegative atom, such as the oxygen of an ester (-O-CH₂CH₃).\n*   **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):** A broad singlet integrating to two protons is characteristic of the protons of a primary amine (-NH₂). The signal is often broad due to nitrogen's quadrupolar moment and chemical exchange.\n*   **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):** The presence of two doublets in the aromatic region (6.5-8.5 ppm) is a classic pattern for a 1,4-disubstituted (para) benzene ring. The two protons on the ring ortho to the electron-donating amino group are shifted upfield (7.0 ppm), while the two protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group are shifted downfield (8.0 ppm).\n\n### 4. Structure Determination\n\nBased on the analysis of the spectral data, we can assemble the following fragments:\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂)\n*   An ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃)\n*   A para-disubstituted benzene ring\n\nConnecting these fragments results in the structure of **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. This structure is consistent with the molecular formula (C9H11NO2) and all the spectroscopic data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing our deduced structure with the given options:\n*   **A) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:** Matches our findings perfectly.\n*   **B) 4-aminophenyl propionate:** Would have a different ester group and thus a different NMR pattern for the alkyl chain.\n*   **C) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:** Is an amide, which would show a different C=O stretch in the IR and would lack the two N-H stretches of a primary amine.\n*   **D) 3-ethoxybenzamide:** Is meta-substituted, which would produce a more complex splitting pattern in the aromatic region of the NMR spectrum.\n\nTherefore, the correct compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n<<<A>>>"
