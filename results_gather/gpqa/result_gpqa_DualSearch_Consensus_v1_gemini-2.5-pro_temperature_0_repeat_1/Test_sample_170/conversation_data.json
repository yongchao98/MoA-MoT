    "To arrange the given substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer in an electrophilic bromination reaction, we need to analyze the directing effects and steric hindrance of each substituent on the benzene ring.\n\n### Step 1: Classify the Substituents\n\nFirst, we classify the substituents based on their effect on the benzene ring's reactivity and their directing properties.\n\n*   **Group 1: Ortho-, Para-Directing Substituents**\n    *   These groups direct the incoming electrophile (bromine) to the ortho and para positions.\n    *   1) **-CH₃** (in Toluene): Activating group.\n    *   5) **-C₂H₅** (in Ethylbenzene): Activating group.\n    *   3) **-Cl** (in Chlorobenzene): Deactivating group, but still ortho-, para-directing.\n\n*   **Group 2: Meta-Directing Substituents**\n    *   These groups are all deactivating and direct the incoming electrophile to the meta position.\n    *   4) **-NO₂** (in Nitrobenzene): Strongly deactivating.\n    *   6) **-COOH** (in Benzoic acid): Strongly deactivating.\n    *   2) **-COOC₂H₅** (in Ethyl benzoate): Strongly deactivating.\n\n### Step 2: Compare Para-Isomer Yield Between Groups\n\nSubstances with meta-directing groups will produce very low yields of the para-isomer, as the main product will be the meta-isomer. For example, the bromination of nitrobenzene and benzoic acid predominantly yields the meta-bromo derivative. In contrast, substances with ortho-, para-directing groups will produce significant amounts of the para-isomer. Therefore, the substances in Group 2 will have a lower weight fraction of the para-isomer than the substances in Group 1.\n\nThe overall order will be: **{Group 2} < {Group 1}**\n\n### Step 3: Order Substances within Group 2 (Meta-Directors)\n\nWe need to arrange nitrobenzene (4), benzoic acid (6), and ethyl benzoate (2) in order of increasing para-isomer yield. These groups are strongly deactivating, and the para-product is formed in very small amounts. The order depends on the strength of the deactivating and meta-directing effect. Stronger deactivation leads to a lower proportion of ortho and para products.\n\n*   **-NO₂ (4):** This is one of the most powerful deactivating groups. It directs very strongly to the meta position, resulting in a minuscule yield of the para-isomer (typically <1%).\n*   **-COOH (6):** This is also a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Its deactivating effect is comparable to, but generally considered slightly less powerful than, the nitro group. The para yield is extremely low.\n*   **-COOC₂H₅ (2):** This ester group is strongly deactivating and meta-directing, similar to the carboxylic acid group. Data from nitration reactions, which follow similar principles, show that ethyl benzoate yields a slightly higher percentage of the para-isomer (around 5%) compared to nitrobenzene or benzoic acid (around 1-2%).\n\nBased on the deactivating strength (-NO₂ > -COOH > -COOC₂H₅), the yield of the para-isomer will increase in the reverse order.\nOrder of increasing para yield: **4 (-NO₂) < 6 (-COOH) < 2 (-COOC₂H₅)**\n\n### Step 4: Order Substances within Group 1 (Ortho-, Para-Directors)\n\nFor toluene (1), ethylbenzene (5), and chlorobenzene (3), the yield of the para-isomer relative to the ortho-isomer is primarily determined by **steric hindrance**. A larger substituent will block the adjacent ortho positions, making an attack at the more distant para position more favorable.\n\n*   **-CH₃ (1):** The methyl group is relatively small. It provides some steric hindrance, but a significant amount of ortho-product is still formed. For bromination of toluene, the para-isomer yield is high (around 67%), but the ortho-isomer yield is also significant (around 33%).\n*   **-C₂H₅ (5):** The ethyl group is bulkier than the methyl group. This increased size causes more steric hindrance at the ortho positions, leading to a higher proportion of the para-isomer compared to toluene.\n*   **-Cl (3):** The chloro group, although a single atom, is sterically demanding. It strongly favors the formation of the para-isomer. For example, in the nitration of chlorobenzene, the para-isomer is the major product with a yield of about 70%. In the bromination of bromobenzene, the para-product can be as high as 85%. This indicates a very strong preference for the para position.\n\nComparing the steric bulk and resulting para-preference: -CH₃ < -C₂H₅ < -Cl.\nOrder of increasing para yield: **1 (-CH₃) < 5 (-C₂H₅) < 3 (-Cl)**\n\n### Step 5: Combine the Orders\n\nBy combining the ordered groups, we get the final sequence for the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n\n**4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3**\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
