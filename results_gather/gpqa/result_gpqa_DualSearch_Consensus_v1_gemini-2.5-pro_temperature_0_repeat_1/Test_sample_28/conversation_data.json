    "To eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, the goal is to create a non-functional protein. This is most effectively achieved by a mutation that causes a drastic change in the protein's structure or leads to its premature termination. Let's analyze the effect of each mutation based on the provided sequences.\n\nThe intact gene's initial codons are:\n**5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...-3’**\nThis translates to the amino acid sequence: Methionine - Phenylalanine - Leucine - Alanine - Glycine - Threonine - Serine...\n\nNow let's examine each mutant:\n\n*   **Mutant 1:** 5’-ATG TT**C** TA**C** GCT GGT ACT TCT...-3’\n    *   The second codon `TTT` (Phenylalanine) changes to `TTC` (Phenylalanine). This is a **silent mutation** because the amino acid does not change.\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAC` (Tyrosine). This is a **missense mutation**, which changes one amino acid for another.\n    *   **Effect:** The resulting protein has one amino acid changed. This *might* affect its function, but it is not guaranteed to eliminate it.\n\n*   **Mutant 2:** 5’-ATG TT**C** T**AA** GCT GGT ACT TCT...-3’\n    *   The second codon `TTT` (Phenylalanine) changes to `TTC` (Phenylalanine), which is a silent mutation.\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAA`. `TAA` is a **stop codon**.\n    *   **Effect:** This is a **nonsense mutation**. It causes protein synthesis to stop prematurely after only two amino acids. The resulting protein will be extremely short and non-functional. This is the most likely mutation to completely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 3:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT **GTC AC**T TCT...-3’\n    *   This sequence appears to have a complex mutation involving substitutions and insertions that result in a **frameshift mutation**. A frameshift alters the three-base-pair reading frame for all subsequent codons.\n    *   **Effect:** A frameshift mutation leads to a completely different and usually non-functional amino acid sequence from the point of the mutation onward, often encountering a premature stop codon in the new reading frame. This is also very likely to eliminate the compound.\n\n*   **Mutant 4:** 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT **A**CT TCT...-3’\n    *   The third codon `CTC` (Leucine) changes to `TAC` (Tyrosine).\n    *   The fifth codon `GGT` (Glycine) changes to `ACT` (Threonine).\n    *   **Effect:** These are two **missense mutations**. The protein will be produced with two amino acid changes. Similar to Mutant 1, this might alter the protein's function, but it is less certain to eliminate it completely compared to a nonsense or frameshift mutation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth a nonsense mutation (Mutant 2) and a frameshift mutation (Mutant 3) are highly likely to produce a non-functional protein. However, a nonsense mutation that introduces a stop codon at the very beginning of the gene (the third codon in this case) is arguably the most definitive and certain way to ensure a truncated, non-functional product. Therefore, Mutant 2 represents the most probable successful outcome for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n<<<A>>>"
