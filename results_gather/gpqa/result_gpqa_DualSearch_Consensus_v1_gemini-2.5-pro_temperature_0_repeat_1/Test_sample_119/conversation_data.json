    "Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars within a certain volume is proportional to that volume. To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with parallax, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Relating Distance and Parallax:** The distance to a star (`d`) is inversely proportional to its parallax (`plx`). This relationship is given by the formula `d = 1/plx`, where `d` is in parsecs and `plx` is in arcseconds.\n\n2.  **Number of Stars at a Given Distance:** For a uniform distribution of stars, the number of stars (`N`) up to a certain distance `d` is proportional to the volume of a sphere with radius `d`. The volume of a sphere is `(4/3)πd³`. Therefore, `N ∝ d³`.\n\n3.  **Number of Stars in a Distance Range:** To find the number of stars (`dN`) within a small range of distance (`dd`) at a distance `d`, we can consider a thin spherical shell of radius `d` and thickness `dd`. The volume of this shell (`dV`) is its surface area (`4πd²`) multiplied by its thickness (`dd`). So, `dV = 4πd² dd`. With a uniform stellar density (`ρ`), the number of stars in this shell is `dN = ρ * dV = 4πρd² dd`. Thus, `dN ∝ d² dd`.\n\n4.  **Relating the Change in Distance to the Change in Parallax:** We need to express `dd` in terms of `d(plx)`. Starting from `d = 1/plx`, we can differentiate `d` with respect to `plx` to find the relationship between their differentials:\n    `dd/d(plx) = -1/plx²`\n    Therefore, `dd = -(1/plx²) d(plx)`. The negative sign indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. For our analysis of the magnitude, we can consider the absolute value: `|dd| = (1/plx²) |d(plx)|`.\n\n5.  **Combining the Relationships:** Now, we substitute the expressions for `d` and `dd` in terms of `plx` into the proportionality for `dN`:\n    `dN ∝ (1/plx)² * (1/plx²) d(plx)`\n    `dN ∝ (1/plx⁴) d(plx)`\n\n6.  **Finding the Number of Stars per Unit Parallax:** The number of stars per unit range of parallax is `dN/d(plx)`. From the relationship derived in the previous step, we can see that:\n    `dN/d(plx) ∝ 1/plx⁴`\n\nThis means that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as the fourth power of the parallax.\n\n<<<A>>>"
