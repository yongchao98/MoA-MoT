    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Temperature Ratio**\n    The equilibrium temperature (T_eq) of a planet is determined by the star's effective temperature (T_eff_star), the star's radius (R_star), the planet's semi-major axis (a), and the planet's albedo (A). The formula is:\n    `T_eq = T_eff_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - A)^(1/4)`\n\n    We want to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 (T_eq1 / T_eq2).\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = [T_eff_star * (R_star / (2*a1))^(1/2) * (1 - A1)^(1/4)] / [T_eff_star * (R_star / (2*a2))^(1/2) * (1 - A2)^(1/4)]`\n\n    Since the star's properties (T_eff_star, R_star) are the same for both planets and it is given that their albedos are the same (A1 = A2), these terms cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (1/a1)^(1/2) / (1/a2)^(1/2) = (a2 / a1)^(1/2)`\n\n2.  **Relating Semi-Major Axis to Radial Velocity**\n    The problem provides the Doppler shifts caused by the planets, which relate to the star's radial velocity (RV). The semi-amplitude of the RV (K) for a planet in a circular orbit is given by:\n    `K = (M_p / M_star) * (G * M_star / a)^(1/2)`\n    (Assuming the planet's mass M_p is much smaller than the star's mass M_star, and the orbital inclination is ~90° because the planet was also detected via the transit method).\n\n    We can rearrange this formula to solve for the semi-major axis (a):\n    `K^2 = (M_p^2 / M_star^2) * (G * M_star / a)`\n    `a = (M_p^2 * G) / (M_star * K^2)`\n\n3.  **Calculating the Ratio of the Semi-Major Axes**\n    Now we can find the ratio `a2 / a1`:\n    `a2 / a1 = [(M_p2^2 * G) / (M_star * K2^2)] / [(M_p1^2 * G) / (M_star * K1^2)]`\n\n    The gravitational constant (G) and the star's mass (M_star) cancel out:\n    `a2 / a1 = (M_p2^2 / K2^2) / (M_p1^2 / K1^2) = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (K1 / K2)^2`\n\n4.  **Relating RV Semi-Amplitude (K) to Doppler Shift (Δλ)**\n    The Doppler shift `Δλ` is directly proportional to the radial velocity `v_r` (`Δλ / λ = v_r / c`). Therefore, the RV semi-amplitude `K` is directly proportional to the maximum Doppler shift `Δλ_max`.\n    `K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2`\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**\n    Substitute the relationship from step 4 into the equation for `a2 / a1` from step 3:\n    `a2 / a1 = (M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2`\n\n    Now, substitute this into the temperature ratio equation from step 1:\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt((M_p2 / M_p1)^2 * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)^2)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (Δλ1 / Δλ2)`\n\n    Plug in the given values:\n    *   M_p1 = 7 Earth masses\n    *   M_p2 = 5 Earth masses\n    *   Δλ1 = 0.03 Å\n    *   Δλ2 = 0.04 Å\n\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (0.03 / 0.04)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = (5 / 7) * (3 / 4)`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 = 15 / 28`\n    `T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357`\n\nThis value is approximately 0.53.\n\n<<<D>>>"
