    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to solve the chemical puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction 4:** D (gas) + B (gas) → H (solvent) in a 1:1 ratio. A plausible reaction that fits this description is the synthesis of 1,2-dichloroethane, a solvent.\n    *   C₂H₄ (ethene) + Cl₂ (chlorine) → C₂H₄Cl₂ (1,2-dichloroethane)\n    *   This identifies:\n        *   **B = Cl₂** (chlorine gas)\n        *   **D = C₂H₄** (ethene gas)\n        *   **H = C₂H₄Cl₂** (1,2-dichloroethane solvent)\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 1:** A (solid) + 8 equivalents of B (Cl₂) → C (bright red product).\n    *   We are looking for a solid A that reacts with a large amount of chlorine to form a red product C. Let's consider elemental sulfur.\n    *   **A = S₈** (elemental sulfur is a solid).\n    *   The reaction S₈ + 8Cl₂ → 8SCl₂ uses 1 mole of S₈ and 8 moles of Cl₂. This matches the 1:8 stoichiometry if we consider one mole of the S₈ ring.\n    *   The product is **C = SCl₂** (sulfur dichloride), which is a cherry-red liquid. We'll assume the puzzle allows for a liquid product described as \"bright red product C\".\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 3:** C (SCl₂) + H₂O → A (S₈) + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).\n    *   The hydrolysis of sulfur chlorides is complex but is known to produce elemental sulfur, hydrochloric acid, and sulfur dioxide.\n    *   SCl₂ reacts with water, ultimately producing:\n        *   Elemental sulfur, which is solid **A (S₈)**, thus reforming the starting material.\n        *   **F = HCl** (hydrochloric acid), which is a strong acid.\n        *   SO₂ (sulfur dioxide), which dissolves in water to form **G = H₂SO₃** (sulfurous acid), a weak acid.\n    *   This reaction perfectly matches the description.\n\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 2:** C (SCl₂) + 2 equivalents of D (C₂H₄) → E (extremely hazardous product).\n    *   The reaction is: SCl₂ + 2C₂H₄ → E.\n    *   This is the well-known Levinstein process for the synthesis of mustard gas.\n    *   **E = (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S** (bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide, or mustard gas). Mustard gas is an extremely hazardous chemical warfare agent.\n\n5.  **Determine the Molecular Symmetry Group of E:**\n    *   E is mustard gas, (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S.\n    *   To determine its point group, we must consider its three-dimensional shape. The molecule is flexible due to rotation around the single bonds. We consider its most stable, highest-symmetry conformation.\n    *   The molecule has a central sulfur atom bonded to two chloroethyl groups. It is not planar.\n    *   The only symmetry element present in the stable conformation of the molecule is a two-fold rotational axis (C₂) that passes through the sulfur atom and bisects the C-S-C angle.\n    *   A molecule that only possesses an identity element (E) and a single C₂ axis belongs to the **C2** point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of the extremely hazardous product E (mustard gas) is C2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
