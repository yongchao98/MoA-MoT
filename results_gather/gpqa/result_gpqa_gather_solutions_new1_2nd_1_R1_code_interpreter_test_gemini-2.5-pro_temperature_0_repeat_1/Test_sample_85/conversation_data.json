Therefore, the isobutyl ester group (`-COOiBu`) is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The physical arrangement of atoms around the chiral center (C3) is retained. However, we must check if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the attached groups change, which would affect the R/S label.\n        *   **Starting Material Groups on C3:** H, `-CH₂CH₃`, `-CH₂COOH`, and `-CH₂COOiBu`.\n        *   **CIP Priority (Start):** `(-CH₂COOiBu)` > `(-CH₂COOH)` > `(-CH₂CH₃)` > `(H)`.\n        *   **Intermediate Groups on C3:** H, `-CH₂CH₃`, `-CH₂COOH`, and `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n        *   **CIP Priority (Intermediate):** `(-CH₂COOH)` > `(-CH₂CH₂OH)` > `(-CH₂CH₃)` > `(H)`.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. A single swap of priorities inverts the R/S designation. Therefore, to obtain an **(R)**-product, the starting material A must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n2.  **Reaction B: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone**\n    *   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) selectively reduces carboxylic acids to alcohols in the presence of esters. Therefore, the carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** We again check the CIP priorities.\n        *   **Starting Material Groups on C3:** H, `-CH₂CH₃`, `-CH₂COOH`, and `-CH₂COOiBu`.\n        *   **CIP Priority (Start):** `(-CH₂COOiBu)` > `(-CH₂COOH)` > `(-CH₂CH₃)` > `(H)`.\n        *   **Intermediate Groups on C3:** H, `-CH₂CH₃`, `-CH₂CH₂OH`, and `-CH₂COOiBu`.\n        *   **CIP Priority (Intermediate):** `(-CH₂COOiBu)` > `(-CH₂CH₂OH)` > `(-CH₂CH₃)` > `(H)`.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The priority order of the groups does not change. Therefore, the R/S designation is retained. To obtain an **(S)**-product, the starting material B must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe rigorous chemical analysis shows:\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis conclusion matches the reasoning provided in **Answer 8** and my own final analysis. Most other candidate answers make the common error of assuming the R/S label is always retained without checking for changes in CIP priorities. The most chemically sound reasoning leads to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, highlighting the careful points required to reach the correct solution.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Structures and Overall Transformation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options indicate the starting material is an enantiomer of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`). It possesses a single chiral center at the C3 position, which is bonded to the ethyl group.\n*   **Product:** The product is an enantiomer of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a delta-lactone. The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4).\n*   **Transformation:** The overall process involves the reduction of one of the carbonyl groups to a primary alcohol, followed by an acid-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) to form the final product.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction A and the Selectivity of LiBH₄**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Chemoselectivity):** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a well-known reducing agent that selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to a carboxylate, which is resistant to reduction by LiBH₄.\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The resulting intermediate is a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes the cyclization to form the lactone.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction B and the Selectivity of BH₃**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Chemoselectivity):** Borane (BH₃) exhibits the opposite selectivity to LiBH₄. It is highly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols while leaving esters largely unaffected under the same conditions.\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The resulting intermediate is an isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate. The acidic workup then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification, where the new alcohol attacks the ester carbonyl to form the lactone and release isobutanol.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Stereochemistry (The Most Critical Point)**\n\nThe common mistake is to assume that because the reaction does not occur *at* the chiral center, the R/S descriptor is automatically retained. The descriptor depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center. We must check if this priority order changes.\n\n*   **Groups on the Chiral Center (C3) of the Starting Material:**\n    1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side)\n    2.  `-CH₂COOH` (acid side)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl group)\n    4.  `-H`\n*   **CIP Priority Order (Start):** The ester-containing group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) has higher priority than the acid-containing group (`-CH₂COOH`) because the oxygen in the ester is bonded to a carbon (isobutyl), while the oxygen in the acid is bonded to a hydrogen. Thus, the initial priority order is: `-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂COOH` > `-CH₂CH₃` > `-H`.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction A (LiBH₄ reduction):**\n    *   The highest priority group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is converted to `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   We now compare the priorities of the groups in the intermediate: `-CH₂COOH` vs. `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   The `-CH₂COOH` group has higher priority than the `-CH₂CH₂OH` group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The original second-priority group has become the new first-priority group. The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. A swap in the priority of two groups **inverts the R/S descriptor**. Therefore, to obtain an **(R)**-product, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction B (BH₃ reduction):**\n    *   The second priority group (`-CH₂COOH`) is converted to `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   We now compare the priorities of the groups in the intermediate: `-CH₂COOiBu` vs. `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   The `-CH₂COOiBu` group still has higher priority than the `-CH₂CH₂OH` group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The original highest-priority group remains the highest-priority group. The priority order is unchanged. Therefore, the **R/S descriptor is retained**. To obtain an **(S)**-product, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis:\n*   Starting Material A must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting Material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Structures and Reactions**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options provide stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule has a single chiral center at carbon-3 (C3) and two different functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu).\n    *   Structure: `iBuOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`\n*   **Product:** The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, a six-membered cyclic ester (lactone). The chiral center from C3 of the starting material becomes C4 in the lactone product.\n*   **Reactions:** The problem involves two different reductions followed by cyclization. The key is the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents.\n\n### **2. Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a well-known reducing agent that selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol.\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group remains unchanged.\n    3.  The resulting intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization steps do not break any bonds at the C3 chiral center. However, we must check if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the groups attached to the chiral center change.\n    *   **In the starting material (A):** The groups attached to the chiral center are -H, -CH₂CH₃, -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂COOiBu. The priority order is: `-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂COOH` > `-CH₂CH₃` > `-H`.\n    *   **In the hydroxy-acid intermediate:** The `-CH₂COOiBu` group has become `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The new priority order is: `-CH₂COOH` > `-CH₂CH₂OH` > `-CH₂CH₃` > `-H`.\n    *   The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. A swap in the priority of two groups at a chiral center inverts the R/S designation, even though the 3D arrangement of atoms is unchanged.\n    *   Therefore, to obtain an **(R)**-product, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n### **3. Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to alcohols in the presence of esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol.\n    2.  The isobutyl ester group remains unchanged.\n    3.  The resulting intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Let's check the CIP priorities again.\n    *   **In the starting material (B):** The priority order is: `-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂COOH` > `-CH₂CH₃` > `-H`.\n    *   **In the hydroxy-ester intermediate:** The `-CH₂COOH` group has become `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The new priority order is: `-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂CH₂OH` > `-CH₂CH₃` > `-H`.\n    *   The relative priority order of the groups has not changed.\n    *   Therefore, the R/S designation is retained throughout the reaction. To obtain an **(S)**-product, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\n*   To produce the (R)-lactone via the LiBH₄ pathway, starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   To produce the (S)-lactone via the BH₃ pathway, starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth starting materials are the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Starting Material and Product Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options provided are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has a five-carbon chain. At one end (C1), there is a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`). At the other end (C5), there is an isobutyl ester group (`-COOCH₂CH(CH₃)₂`). The molecule has a single chiral center at C3, which has an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`).\n*   **Product:** The product of both reactions is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a delta-lactone. The chiral center from the starting material (C3) corresponds to the C4 position in the lactone product.\n\n### **2. Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Careful Point 1: Chemoselectivity of LiBH₄.** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a well-established reducing agent that selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid group is deprotonated to a carboxylate, which is unreactive towards LiBH₄.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid at C1 remains unchanged.\n    3.  The resulting intermediate is a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization), where the C5-hydroxyl group attacks the C1-carboxylic acid to form the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Stereochemistry.** The reduction and cyclization reactions occur at the functional groups (C1 and C5), which are remote from the chiral center (C3). No bonds at the chiral center are broken or formed. Therefore, the absolute configuration of the chiral center is retained throughout the reaction.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must also have the (R) configuration. Thus, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **3. Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Careful Point 3: Chemoselectivity of BH₃.** Borane (BH₃) exhibits the opposite selectivity to LiBH₄. It is highly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols while leaving esters largely unaffected under the same conditions.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The isobutyl ester at C5 remains unchanged.\n    3.  The resulting intermediate is an isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Stereochemistry.** As in Reaction A, the chemical transformations do not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemical configuration is retained.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration. Thus, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **4. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting Material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting Material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options provide stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has a five-carbon chain. At one end (C1) is a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`). At the other end (C5) is an isobutyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH(CH₃)₂`). It has a single chiral center at C3, which has an ethyl group attached.\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone). The chiral center from C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the lactone ring.\n\n**2. Analyze the Key Chemical Principle: Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThe core of the problem is the different chemoselectivity of the two reducing agents when faced with a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester.\n\n*   **Lithium Borohydride (LiBH₄):** This reagent is known to selectively reduce esters to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids (which are deprotonated to unreactive carboxylates) untouched.\n*   **Borane (BH₃):** This reagent is known for its high selectivity in reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while leaving esters largely unaffected under the same conditions.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group at C1 remains.\n    3.  The resulting intermediate is a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) causes this intermediate to cyclize (intramolecular esterification) to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization reactions occur at the functional groups (C1 and C5), not at the chiral center (C3). Therefore, the stereochemical configuration of the starting material is retained in the product. To obtain the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material **A** must have the **(R)** configuration.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The isobutyl ester group at C5 remains.\n    3.  The resulting intermediate is an isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) causes this intermediate to cyclize via intramolecular transesterification (the new alcohol attacks the ester), forming the lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the chiral center at C3 is not involved in the reaction. The stereochemical configuration is retained. To obtain the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material **B** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   For Reaction A, to get the (R)-product, the starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   For Reaction B, to get the (S)-product, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis combination matches option D.\n\n*   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has a five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) at one end (C1) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`) at the other end (C5). It has a single chiral center at C3, which is bonded to an ethyl group.\n    *   Structure: `iBuOOC-CH₂(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). The chiral center from C3 of the starting material becomes C4 in the lactone ring.\n\n### **2. Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Careful Point 1: Chemoselectivity of LiBH₄.** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a selective reducing agent that reduces esters to primary alcohols but does not reduce carboxylic acids under the same conditions.\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the carboxylic acid at C1 intact. The resulting intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The acidic workup (H⁺) then causes this intermediate to cyclize into the lactone.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Stereochemistry and Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities.** The reaction does not occur at the chiral center (C3), so the 3D arrangement of atoms is retained. However, we must check if the R/S designation changes due to a change in group priorities.\n    *   **In Starting Material A:** The groups attached to the chiral C3 are: H, `-CH₂CH₃`, `-CH₂COOH`, and `-CH₂COOiBu`. The CIP priority order is: `-CH₂COOiBu` (1) > `-CH₂COOH` (2) > `-CH₂CH₃` (3) > H (4).\n    *   **In the Intermediate:** The `-CH₂COOiBu` group (priority 1) is converted to `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The new priority order for the intermediate is: `-CH₂COOH` (new 1) > `-CH₂CH₂OH` (new 2) > `-CH₂CH₃` (3) > H (4).\n    *   The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. A swap in the priority of two groups **inverts the R/S designation**, even though the reaction did not touch the chiral center.\n    *   Therefore, to produce an (R)-lactone, the intermediate must have an (R) configuration. To get an (R) intermediate, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n### **3. Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Careful Point 3: Chemoselectivity of BH₃.** Borane (BH₃) is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the ester at C5 intact. The resulting intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate. The acidic workup then causes intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Stereochemistry and CIP Priorities.** Again, we check for changes in group priorities.\n    *   **In Starting Material B:** The priority order is: `-CH₂COOiBu` (1) > `-CH₂COOH` (2) > `-CH₂CH₃` (3) > H (4).\n    *   **In the Intermediate:** The `-CH₂COOH` group (priority 2) is converted to `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The `-CH₂COOiBu` group (priority 1) is unchanged. The new priority order is: `-CH₂COOiBu` (1) > `-CH₂CH₂OH` (new 2) > `-CH₂CH₃` (3) > H (4).\n    *   The priority order of the groups has not changed. The highest priority group remains the same. Therefore, the **R/S designation is retained**.\n    *   To produce an (S)-lactone, the intermediate must be (S), and therefore the starting material B must also be **(S)**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of reagent selectivity and the crucial effect of changing CIP priorities:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Starting Material and Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options provide stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This is a molecule with a five-carbon chain that has two different functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) at one end (C1) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`) at the other end (C5). It has a single chiral center at C3, which is bonded to an ethyl group.\n    *   Structure: `iBuOOC-CH₂(5-4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone). The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4). This lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` intermediate.\n\n### **2. Analyzing the Chemoselectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n\nThe core of the problem is the different selectivity of the two reducing agents.\n\n*   **Reaction A (LiBH₄):** Lithium borohydride is a selective reducing agent that reduces **esters** to primary alcohols but does not reduce carboxylic acids under the same conditions.\n    *   **Pathway:** The ester group at C5 is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The carboxylic acid at C1 is untouched. The resulting intermediate is `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`, which cyclizes under acidic workup (H⁺) to form the lactone.\n*   **Reaction B (BH₃):** Borane is a highly selective reducing agent that reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols but does not readily reduce esters.\n    *   **Pathway:** The carboxylic acid group at C1 is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The ester group at C5 is untouched. The resulting intermediate is `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`. This hydroxy-ester then cyclizes via intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone.\n\n### **3. Analyzing the Stereochemistry (The Critical Step)**\n\nThe reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3), so the 3D spatial arrangement of the groups is retained. However, the R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center. We must check if the reactions change these priorities.\n\nThe four groups attached to the chiral center (C3) in the starting material are:\n1.  `-H` (lowest priority, #4)\n2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl group)\n3.  `-CH₂COOH` (the acid-side chain)\n4.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (the ester-side chain)\n\nTo rank the acid and ester chains, we compare them atom by atom. The ester chain (`-CH₂-C(=O)O-C₄H₉`) has priority over the acid chain (`-CH₂-C(=O)O-H`) because the oxygen in the ester is bonded to a carbon, while the oxygen in the acid is bonded to a hydrogen.\n*   **Starting Priority Order:** `-CH₂COOiBu` (1) > `-CH₂COOH` (2) > `-CH₂CH₃` (3) > `-H` (4).\n\n**Stereochemistry of Reaction A (LiBH₄):**\n*   The ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`, priority #1) is reduced to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n*   The acid group (`-CH₂COOH`, priority #2) is unchanged.\n*   In the resulting hydroxy-acid intermediate, we compare the new priorities: `-CH₂COOH` vs. `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The acid group now has higher priority than the alcohol group.\n*   **The priorities of the top two groups have swapped.** A swap in the priority of two groups at a chiral center **inverts the R/S designation**, even though the reaction mechanism involves retention of configuration.\n*   Therefore, to obtain the **(R)-product**, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n    *   Path: `(S)-Starting Material` → `(R)-Intermediate` → `(R)-Lactone`\n\n**Stereochemistry of Reaction B (BH₃):**\n*   The acid group (`-CH₂COOH`, priority #2) is reduced to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n*   The ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`, priority #1) is unchanged.\n*   In the resulting hydroxy-ester intermediate, we compare the priorities: `-CH₂COOiBu` vs. `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The ester group still has higher priority than the alcohol group.\n*   **The priority order has not changed.** The group that was #1 is still #1.\n*   Therefore, the R/S designation is **retained** throughout this reaction.\n*   To obtain the **(S)-product**, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n    *   Path: `(S)-Starting Material` → `(S)-Intermediate` → `(S)-Lactone`\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   For Reaction A to yield the (R)-product, starting material **A must be (S)**.\n*   For Reaction B to yield the (S)-product, starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has a five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) at one end (C1) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`) at the other end (C5). It has a single chiral center at C3, which is bonded to an ethyl group.\n    *   Structure: `iBuOOC-CH₂(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone). The chiral center is at C4 of the lactone ring.\n*   **Transformation:** A lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a molecule that contains both a hydroxyl group and a carboxylic acid group. In this case, the precursor is `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`. The chiral C3 of this precursor becomes the chiral C4 of the lactone product.\n\n### **2. Analyzing the Reactions and Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThe key to this problem is the different selectivity of the two reducing agents.\n\n*   **Reaction A: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone**\n    *   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a well-known reducing agent that selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to a carboxylate, which is resistant to reduction by LiBH₄.\n    *   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The carboxylic acid at C1 is left untouched. The resulting intermediate is a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, which cyclizes under acidic workup (H⁺) to form the lactone.\n\n*   **Reaction B: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone**\n    *   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while leaving esters largely unaffected under the same conditions.\n    *   **Mechanism:** BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The isobutyl ester at C5 is left untouched. The resulting intermediate is an isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate. This hydroxy-ester then undergoes intramolecular transesterification (the new -OH attacks the ester) under acidic workup to form the lactone and release isobutanol.\n\n### **3. Analyzing the Stereochemistry**\n\nThis is the most critical and subtle part of the problem. The reactions do not occur at the chiral center (C3), so the spatial arrangement of the atoms around it is preserved. However, the R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center, and these priorities can change when the functional groups are modified.\n\nLet's analyze the groups attached to the chiral C3:\n*   Group 1: `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl)\n*   Group 2: `-H`\n*   Group 3: `-CH₂COOH` (the acid side)\n*   Group 4: `-CH₂COOiBu` (the ester side)\n\n**CIP Priority in the Starting Material:** The ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) has higher priority than the carboxylic acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) because the oxygen in the ester is bonded to a carbon (from isobutyl), while the oxygen in the acid is bonded to a hydrogen. Thus, the priority order is: `-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂COOH` > `-CH₂CH₃` > `-H`.\n\n**Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction A (LiBH₄ reduction):**\n*   The ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is reduced to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n*   The priorities in the hydroxy-acid intermediate become: `-CH₂COOH` > `-CH₂CH₂OH` > `-CH₂CH₃` > `-H`.\n*   **Result:** The priority order of the two main side chains has swapped. A swap in the priority of two groups inverts the R/S designation. Therefore, to obtain an **(R)**-product, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n    *   `(S)-A` → `(R)-intermediate` → `(R)-lactone`\n\n**Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction B (BH₃ reduction):**\n*   The carboxylic acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) is reduced to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n*   The priorities in the hydroxy-ester intermediate become: `-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂CH₂OH` > `-CH₂CH₃` > `-H`.\n*   **Result:** The priority order of the groups does not change compared to the starting material. Therefore, the R/S designation is retained throughout the reaction. To obtain an **(S)**-product, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n    *   `(S)-B` → `(S)-intermediate` → `(S)-lactone`\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\nBased on the rigorous stereochemical analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Core Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the correct stereoisomers of a starting material, **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**, which will produce specific stereoisomers of a product, **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**, under two different reaction conditions.\n\nThe solution requires understanding three key aspects:\n1.  The selectivity of the reducing agents (LiBH₄ vs. BH₃).\n2.  The reaction pathway (reduction followed by cyclization).\n3.  The stereochemical outcome, which requires careful analysis.\n\n### **2. Analyzing the Structures and the Chiral Center**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** `iBuOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`. This molecule has a single chiral center at Carbon-3 (C3), the carbon bonded to the ethyl group.\n*   **Product:** A six-membered lactone. The chiral center from C3 of the starting material becomes C4 in the lactone product.\n*   **Groups attached to the chiral center (C3):**\n    1.  `-H` (Hydrogen)\n    2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n    3.  `-CH₂COOH` (Carboxylic acid side)\n    4.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (Isobutyl ester side)\n\n### **3. Careful Point 1: Chemoselectivity of the Reagents**\n\nThis is the first critical step, correctly identified by most candidate answers.\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** Selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** Selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n\n### **4. Careful Point 2: Retention of Configuration**\n\nIn both reaction pathways, the chemical transformations (reduction and cyclization) occur at the functional groups (ester and acid), which are not directly attached to the chiral center. The bonds at the chiral C3 are not broken or formed. Therefore, the 3D spatial arrangement of the groups around the chiral center is preserved. This is known as **retention of configuration**.\n\n### **5. Careful Point 3: Configuration vs. R/S Label (The Decisive Step)**\n\nThis is the most subtle and important point, which most candidate answers missed. The R/S designation is a *label* based on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center. If a reaction changes the chemical nature of these groups, their priorities can change, which can cause the R/S label to flip, even if the 3D configuration is retained.\n\nLet's analyze the CIP priorities for each reaction.\n\n**Priority of groups in the starting material:**\nComparing the two main side chains: `-CH₂COOiBu` vs. `-CH₂COOH`. The ester group outranks the carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Priority Order:** `-CH₂COOiBu` (High) > `-CH₂COOH` (Mid) > `-CH₂CH₃` (Low) > `-H` (Lowest)\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of Reaction A: A + LiBH₄ → (R)-Product**\n\n1.  **Transformation:** LiBH₄ reduces the ester group: `-CH₂COOiBu` becomes `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) is unchanged.\n2.  **Priorities in Intermediate:** We now compare the new group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`) with the unchanged acid group (`-CH₂COOH`). The acid group outranks the new alcohol group.\n3.  **Priority Change:**\n    *   **Before:** Ester side > Acid side\n    *   **After:** Acid side > Alcohol side (from original ester side)\n    *   The priorities of the two highest-ranking groups have **swapped**.\n4.  **Stereochemical Conclusion:** When the 3D configuration is retained but the priorities of two groups swap, the R/S label **inverts**. Therefore, to obtain an **(R)**-product, the starting material **A** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of Reaction B: B + BH₃ → (S)-Product**\n\n1.  **Transformation:** BH₃ reduces the acid group: `-CH₂COOH` becomes `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is unchanged.\n2.  **Priorities in Intermediate:** We compare the unchanged ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) with the new alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group still outranks the alcohol group.\n3.  **Priority Change:**\n    *   **Before:** Ester side > Acid side\n    *   **After:** Ester side > Alcohol side (from original acid side)\n    *   The priority order of the two highest-ranking groups is **maintained**.\n4.  **Stereochemical Conclusion:** When the 3D configuration is retained and the priority order does not change, the R/S label is **retained**. Therefore, to obtain an **(S)**-product, the starting material **B** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n*   For Reaction A, the starting material must be **(S)**.\n*   For Reaction B, the starting material must be **(S)**.\n\nThis means both A and B are the same enantiomer: **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This corresponds to option B.\n\nMost candidate answers incorrectly assume that \"retention of configuration\" automatically means \"retention of the R/S label,\" leading them to the wrong conclusion for starting material A. Answer 8 correctly identifies the need to analyze CIP priorities but is internally inconsistent in its final conclusion. The correct, careful analysis leads unambiguously to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nTo determine the proper starting materials, we must analyze the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents and the resulting stereochemistry.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Structure of Starting Material and Product**\n*   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule has a chiral center at carbon 3 (C3), which is bonded to an ethyl group. It contains two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu).\n*   **Product:** The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, a six-membered cyclic ester (lactone). The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4). The lactone is formed by the cyclization of a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid intermediate.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Chemoselectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n*   **Lithium Borohydride (LiBH₄):** This reagent is known to selectively reduce esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to a carboxylate, which is unreactive to LiBH₄.\n*   **Borane (BH₃):** This reagent is highly selective for the reduction of carboxylic acids to alcohols, being much faster at reducing acids than esters.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction A**\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Pathway:** LiBH₄ selectively reduces the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group is untouched. The resulting intermediate, 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, cyclizes under acidic workup to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry (Careful Point 3: Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Priorities):** We must check if the R/S designation changes due to a change in group priorities (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules) around the chiral center.\n    *   **In Starting Material A:** The groups attached to the chiral C3 are: -H, -CH₂CH₃, -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂COOiBu. The priority order is: (1) -CH₂COOiBu > (2) -CH₂COOH > (3) -CH₂CH₃ > (4) -H.\n    *   **In the Intermediate (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid):** The ester group has been reduced to -CH₂CH₂OH. The groups on C3 are now: -H, -CH₂CH₃, -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂CH₂OH. The new priority order is: (1) -CH₂COOH > (2) -CH₂CH₂OH > (3) -CH₂CH₃ > (4) -H.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. A swap in the priority of any two groups inverts the R/S designation. Therefore, to obtain an **(R)**-product, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction B**\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Pathway:** BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol. The isobutyl ester group is untouched. The resulting intermediate, isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate, undergoes intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   **In Starting Material B:** The priorities are the same as for A: (1) -CH₂COOiBu > (2) -CH₂COOH > (3) -CH₂CH₃ > (4) -H.\n    *   **In the Intermediate (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate):** The acid group has been reduced to -CH₂CH₂OH. The groups on C3 are now: -H, -CH₂CH₃, -CH₂COOiBu, and -CH₂CH₂OH. The new priority order is: (1) -CH₂COOiBu > (2) -CH₂CH₂OH > (3) -CH₂CH₃ > (4) -H.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The relative priority order of the groups has not changed. The highest priority group remains the highest. Therefore, the R/S designation is retained. To obtain an **(S)**-product, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n*   Starting material A must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the key points from the provided answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Structures and Overall Transformation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options provide stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.

The chiral C3 of the starting acid becomes the chiral C4 of the lactone product.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Constraint 1 (Chemoselectivity):** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a well-known reducing agent that selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids. Therefore, it will reduce the isobutyl ester at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the carboxylic acid at C1 intact.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:** The reduction creates a `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` intermediate. The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final product.\n*   **Constraint 2 (Stereochemistry):** This is the most critical point. While the reaction does not occur *at* the chiral center (C3), the functional group transformation can change the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the substituents, which can change the R/S designation.\n    *   **Substituents on C3 (Starting Material):**\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side)\n        2.  `-CH₂COOH` (acid side)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl)\n        4.  `-H`\n        The ester group has higher priority than the acid group.\n    *   **Substituents on C3 (Intermediate):** The ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is converted to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n        1.  `-CH₂COOH` (acid side)\n        2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (alcohol side)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl)\n        4.  `-H`\n        The acid group now has higher priority than the alcohol group.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. A swap in group priorities inverts the R/S designation. Therefore, to obtain an (R)-product, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n    *   **Pass/Fail per Constraint:**\n        *   Chemoselectivity of LiBH₄: Pass. Reduces the ester.\n        *   Stereochemical Outcome: Pass. An (S) starting material is required to form an (R) product due to the change in CIP priorities.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Constraint 1 (Chemoselectivity):** Borane (BH₃) is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids in the presence of esters. It will reduce the carboxylic acid at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the ester at C5 intact.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:** The reduction creates an `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate` intermediate. The acidic workup then catalyzes intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone.\n*   **Constraint 2 (Stereochemistry):** We must again analyze the CIP priorities.\n    *   **Substituents on C3 (Starting Material):** Same as above. The ester side has higher priority than the acid side.\n    *   **Substituents on C3 (Intermediate):** The acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) is converted to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side)\n        2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (alcohol side)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl)\n        4.  `-H`\n        The priority order of the substituents does not change. The ester group remains higher priority than the newly formed alcohol group.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Since the priority order is unchanged, the R/S designation is retained throughout the reaction. To obtain an (S)-product, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **Pass/Fail per Constraint:**\n        *   Chemoselectivity of BH₃: Pass. Reduces the carboxylic acid.\n        *   Stereochemical Outcome: Pass. An (S) starting material is required to form an (S) product as the CIP priorities are retained.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   For Reaction A, starting material A must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   For Reaction B, starting material B must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, highlighting the careful points required to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Structures and Transformations**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options provide stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has a five-carbon main chain with a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) at one end (C1) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`) at the other (C5). It has a single chiral center at C3, which is bonded to an ethyl group.\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone). The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4).\n*   **Overall Transformation:** Both reactions involve the reduction of one of the two carbonyl groups to a primary alcohol, followed by an acid-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) to form the final product.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction A and its Stereochemistry**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Reagent Selectivity):** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a selective reducing agent. It reduces esters to primary alcohols but does not reduce carboxylic acids under these conditions. Therefore, the isobutyl ester group at C5 is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), while the carboxylic acid at C1 remains.\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Stereochemical Designation):** We must analyze how the reduction affects the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center (C3).\n    *   **Groups on C3 in Starting Material A:**\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side)\n        2.  `-CH₂COOH` (acid side)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl group)\n        4.  `-H`\n    *   The priority order is: `-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂COOH` > `-CH₂CH₃`.\n    *   **Groups on C3 in the Intermediate (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid):**\n        1.  `-CH₂COOH` (acid side, unchanged)\n        2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (reduced ester side)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl group, unchanged)\n    *   The new priority order is: `-CH₂COOH` > `-CH₂CH₂OH` > `-CH₂CH₃`.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. A single swap of priorities at a chiral center inverts the R/S designation, even though the 3D arrangement of atoms is retained. Therefore, to obtain an **(R)**-product, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n    *   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction B and its Stereochemistry**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Careful Point 3 (Reagent Selectivity):** Borane (BH₃) is also a selective reducing agent, but its preference is opposite to LiBH₄. It selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters. Therefore, the carboxylic acid group at C1 is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), while the isobutyl ester at C5 remains.\n*   **Careful Point 4 (Stereochemical Designation):** We again analyze the CIP priorities.\n    *   **Groups on C3 in Starting Material B:** Same as A: `-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂COOH` > `-CH₂CH₃`.\n    *   **Groups on C3 in the Intermediate (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate):**\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side, unchanged)\n        2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (reduced acid side)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl group, unchanged)\n    *   The new priority order is: `-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂CH₂OH` > `-CH₂CH₃`.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** The priority order of the groups attached to the chiral center does not change. Therefore, the R/S designation is retained throughout the reaction. To obtain an **(S)**-product, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n### **Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of reagent selectivity and the resulting change (or lack thereof) in CIP priorities:\n*   Starting Material A must be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n*   Starting Material B must be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo decide the final answer, a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem is required, paying close attention to several key points that were handled with varying success by the different agents.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options provide stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`). It possesses a single chiral center at carbon-3 (C3), which is bonded to an ethyl group.\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone). The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction A and its Reagent (LiBH₄)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Careful Point 1: Chemoselectivity of LiBH₄.** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a well-known reducing agent that selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to a carboxylate salt, which is resistant to reduction by LiBH₄.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol.\n    2.  The molecule becomes a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    3.  Acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final product.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction B and its Reagent (BH₃)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Careful Point 2: Chemoselectivity of BH₃.** Borane (BH₃) exhibits the opposite selectivity to LiBH₄. It is highly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols while leaving esters largely unaffected under the same conditions.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol.\n    2.  The molecule becomes an isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    3.  Acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification, where the new alcohol attacks the ester carbonyl to form the lactone and release isobutanol.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Stereochemistry (The Most Critical Point)**\n\nMany of the provided answers incorrectly assume that because the bonds at the chiral center are not broken, the R/S designation is automatically retained. This is a common oversimplification. The R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center. If a reaction changes a functional group, it can change its priority, which may invert the R/S label even if the 3D arrangement of atoms (the absolute configuration) is unchanged.\n\nLet's analyze the groups attached to the chiral C3:\n*   Group 1: `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side)\n*   Group 2: `-CH₂COOH` (acid side)\n*   Group 3: `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl)\n*   Group 4: `-H`\n\n**Initial CIP Priority:** The ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) has a higher priority than the carboxylic acid group (`-CH₂COOH`). So, the initial priority order is: **Group 1 > Group 2 > Group 3 > Group 4**.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction A (LiBH₄):**\n    *   The higher-priority Group 1 (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is reduced to `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   The lower-priority Group 2 (`-CH₂COOH`) is unchanged.\n    *   In the resulting hydroxy-acid intermediate, the acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) now has a higher priority than the new alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n    *   **Result:** The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. A single swap of priorities inverts the R/S designation. Therefore, to obtain an **(R)**-lactone, the starting material A must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction B (BH₃):**\n    *   The lower-priority Group 2 (`-CH₂COOH`) is reduced to `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   The higher-priority Group 1 (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is unchanged.\n    *   In the resulting hydroxy-ester intermediate, the ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) still has a higher priority than the new alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n    *   **Result:** The priority order of the groups has not changed. Therefore, the R/S designation is retained. To obtain an **(S)**-lactone, the starting material B must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBased on a rigorous analysis of chemoselectivity and the change in CIP priorities:\n*   Starting Material **A** must be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n*   Starting Material **B** must also be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "To determine the correct starting materials, a careful step-by-step analysis of both reactions is required, focusing on reagent selectivity and the stereochemical consequences.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Structures and Overall Transformation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options provide stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has a five-carbon chain with two different functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) at one end and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`) at the other. It has a single chiral center at carbon 3 (C3), which is bonded to an ethyl group.\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone). The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4).\n*   **Transformation:** Both reactions involve the reduction of one of the two carbonyl groups to a primary alcohol, followed by an acid-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization to form the lactone.\n\n### **2. Careful Point 1: Chemoselectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the different selectivity of the two reducing agents.\n*   **Lithium Borohydride (LiBH₄):** This reagent is known to selectively reduce **esters** to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids untouched (as they are deprotonated to unreactive carboxylates).\n*   **Borane (BH₃):** This reagent is highly selective for reducing **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols, while leaving esters largely unaffected under the same conditions.\n\n### **3. Careful Point 2: Stereochemistry and Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities**\n\nThis is the most critical and subtle part of the problem. The reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3), so the 3D spatial arrangement of the groups is retained. However, the R/S designation is a *label* based on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center. If a reaction changes the chemical nature of these groups, their priorities can change, which can cause the R/S label to flip, even if the 3D configuration is retained.\n\nLet's establish the initial priorities of the groups attached to the chiral C3:\n1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (the ester side)\n2.  `-CH₂COOH` (the acid side)\n3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl group)\n4.  `-H` (hydrogen)\n\nThe ester group has a higher priority than the carboxylic acid group because the oxygen in the ester is bonded to a carbon (from the isobutyl group), while the oxygen in the acid is bonded to a hydrogen. Thus, the initial priority order is: **Ester side > Acid side > Ethyl > Hydrogen**.\n\n### **4. Analysis of Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Pathway:** LiBH₄ reduces the **ester** group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) is unchanged.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    *   The original highest-priority group (ester side) is converted to an alcohol group.\n    *   In the resulting intermediate, we compare the priorities of the `-CH₂COOH` group and the new `-CH₂CH₂OH` group. The acid group now has a higher priority than the alcohol group.\n    *   **Result:** The priorities of the top two groups have **swapped**. A swap in the priority of two groups at a chiral center **inverts the R/S designation**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** To obtain an **(R)**-product, the starting material **A** must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n### **5. Analysis of Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Pathway:** BH₃ reduces the **carboxylic acid** group (`-CH₂COOH`) to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is unchanged.\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    *   The original second-priority group (acid side) is converted to an alcohol group.\n    *   The original highest-priority group (ester side) is unchanged.\n    *   In the resulting intermediate, the ester group remains the highest priority group.\n    *   **Result:** The priority order of the groups has **not changed**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since the priority order is maintained, the R/S designation is **retained**. To obtain an **(S)**-product, the starting material **B** must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\n*   For Reaction A, starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   For Reaction B, starting material **B** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nBoth starting materials are the (S)-enantiomer. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"

Therefore, the R/S designation is retained. To obtain an **(S)**-product, the starting material B must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nThe rigorous chemical analysis shows:\n*   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n*   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\nThis conclusion matches the reasoning provided in **Answer 8** and my own final analysis. Most other candidate answers make the common error of assuming the R/S label is always retained without checking for changes in CIP priorities. The most chemically sound reasoning leads to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, highlighting the careful points required to reach the correct solution.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Structures and Overall Transformation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options indicate the starting material is an enantiomer of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`). It possesses a single chiral center at the C3 position, which is bonded to the ethyl group.\n*   **Product:** The product is an enantiomer of `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a delta-lactone. The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4).\n*   **Transformation:** The overall process involves the reduction of one of the carbonyl groups to a primary alcohol, followed by an acid-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization (lactonization) to form the final product.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction A and the Selectivity of LiBH₄**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Chemoselectivity):** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a well-known reducing agent that selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to a carboxylate, which is resistant to reduction by LiBH₄.\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The resulting intermediate is a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The acidic workup (H⁺) then catalyzes the cyclization to form the lactone.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction B and the Selectivity of BH₃**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Chemoselectivity):** Borane (BH₃) exhibits the opposite selectivity to LiBH₄. It is highly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols while leaving esters largely unaffected under the same conditions.\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The resulting intermediate is an isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate. The acidic workup then catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification, where the new alcohol attacks the ester carbonyl to form the lactone and release isobutanol.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Stereochemistry (The Most Critical Point)**\n\nThe common mistake is to assume that because the reaction does not occur *at* the chiral center, the R/S descriptor is automatically retained. The descriptor depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center. We must check if this priority order changes.\n\n*   **Groups on the Chiral Center (C3) of the Starting Material:**\n    1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side)\n    2.  `-CH₂COOH` (acid side)\n    3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl group)\n    4.  `-H`\n*   **CIP Priority Order (Start):** The ester-containing group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) has higher priority than the acid-containing group (`-CH₂COOH`) because the oxygen in the ester is bonded to a carbon (isobutyl), while the oxygen in the acid is bonded to a hydrogen. Thus, the initial priority order is: `-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂COOH` > `-CH₂CH₃` > `-H`.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction A (LiBH₄ reduction):**\n    *   The highest priority group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is converted to `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   We now compare the priorities of the groups in the intermediate: `-CH₂COOH` vs. `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   The `-CH₂COOH` group has higher priority than the `-CH₂CH₂OH` group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The original second-priority group has become the new first-priority group. The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. A swap in the priority of two groups **inverts the R/S descriptor**. Therefore, to obtain an **(R)**-product, the starting material **A** must be **(S)**.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction B (BH₃ reduction):**\n    *   The second priority group (`-CH₂COOH`) is converted to `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   We now compare the priorities of the groups in the intermediate: `-CH₂COOiBu` vs. `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   The `-CH₂COOiBu` group still has higher priority than the `-CH₂CH₂OH` group.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The original highest-priority group remains the highest-priority group. The priority order is unchanged. Therefore, the **R/S descriptor is retained**. To obtain an **(S)**-product, the starting material **B** must be **(S)**.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis:\n*   Starting Material A must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting Material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Structures and Reactions**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options provide stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule has a single chiral center at carbon-3 (C3) and two different functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu).\n    *   Structure: `iBuOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`\n*   **Product:** The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, a six-membered cyclic ester (lactone). The chiral center from C3 of the starting material becomes C4 in the lactone product.\n*   **Reactions:** The problem involves two different reductions followed by cyclization. The key is the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents.\n\n### **2. Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a well-known reducing agent that selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol.\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group remains unchanged.\n    3.  The resulting intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization steps do not break any bonds at the C3 chiral center. However, we must check if the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the groups attached to the chiral center change.\n    *   **In the starting material (A):** The groups attached to the chiral center are -H, -CH₂CH₃, -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂COOiBu. The priority order is: `-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂COOH` > `-CH₂CH₃` > `-H`.\n    *   **In the hydroxy-acid intermediate:** The `-CH₂COOiBu` group has become `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The new priority order is: `-CH₂COOH` > `-CH₂CH₂OH` > `-CH₂CH₃` > `-H`.\n    *   The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. A swap in the priority of two groups at a chiral center inverts the R/S designation, even though the 3D arrangement of atoms is unchanged.\n    *   Therefore, to obtain an **(R)**-product, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n### **3. Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to alcohols in the presence of esters.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol.\n    2.  The isobutyl ester group remains unchanged.\n    3.  The resulting intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** Let's check the CIP priorities again.\n    *   **In the starting material (B):** The priority order is: `-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂COOH` > `-CH₂CH₃` > `-H`.\n    *   **In the hydroxy-ester intermediate:** The `-CH₂COOH` group has become `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The new priority order is: `-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂CH₂OH` > `-CH₂CH₃` > `-H`.\n    *   The relative priority order of the groups has not changed.\n    *   Therefore, the R/S designation is retained throughout the reaction. To obtain an **(S)**-product, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\n*   To produce the (R)-lactone via the LiBH₄ pathway, starting material **A** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   To produce the (S)-lactone via the BH₃ pathway, starting material **B** must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nBoth starting materials are the (S)-enantiomer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Starting Material and Product Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options provided are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has a five-carbon chain. At one end (C1), there is a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`). At the other end (C5), there is an isobutyl ester group (`-COOCH₂CH(CH₃)₂`). The molecule has a single chiral center at C3, which has an ethyl group (`-CH₂CH₃`).\n*   **Product:** The product of both reactions is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester, also known as a delta-lactone. The chiral center from the starting material (C3) corresponds to the C4 position in the lactone product.\n\n### **2. Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Careful Point 1: Chemoselectivity of LiBH₄.** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a well-established reducing agent that selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid group is deprotonated to a carboxylate, which is unreactive towards LiBH₄.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid at C1 remains unchanged.\n    3.  The resulting intermediate is a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular esterification (lactonization), where the C5-hydroxyl group attacks the C1-carboxylic acid to form the six-membered lactone.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Stereochemistry.** The reduction and cyclization reactions occur at the functional groups (C1 and C5), which are remote from the chiral center (C3). No bonds at the chiral center are broken or formed. Therefore, the absolute configuration of the chiral center is retained throughout the reaction.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the (R)-lactone, the starting material A must also have the (R) configuration. Thus, **A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **3. Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Careful Point 3: Chemoselectivity of BH₃.** Borane (BH₃) exhibits the opposite selectivity to LiBH₄. It is highly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols while leaving esters largely unaffected under the same conditions.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The isobutyl ester at C5 remains unchanged.\n    3.  The resulting intermediate is an isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification, where the newly formed hydroxyl group attacks the ester carbonyl, forming the lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Stereochemistry.** As in Reaction A, the chemical transformations do not affect the chiral center at C3. The stereochemical configuration is retained.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the (S)-lactone, the starting material B must have the (S) configuration. Thus, **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\n### **4. Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of both reactions:\n*   Starting Material **A** is **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting Material **B** is **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis combination corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Understand the Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options provide stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has a five-carbon chain. At one end (C1) is a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`). At the other end (C5) is an isobutyl ester (`-COOCH₂CH(CH₃)₂`). It has a single chiral center at C3, which has an ethyl group attached.\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone). The chiral center from C3 of the starting material becomes the C4 of the lactone ring.\n\n**2. Analyze the Key Chemical Principle: Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThe core of the problem is the different chemoselectivity of the two reducing agents when faced with a molecule containing both a carboxylic acid and an ester.\n\n*   **Lithium Borohydride (LiBH₄):** This reagent is known to selectively reduce esters to primary alcohols while leaving carboxylic acids (which are deprotonated to unreactive carboxylates) untouched.\n*   **Borane (BH₃):** This reagent is known for its high selectivity in reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while leaving esters largely unaffected under the same conditions.\n\n**3. Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ selectively reduces the isobutyl ester group at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group at C1 remains.\n    3.  The resulting intermediate is a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) causes this intermediate to cyclize (intramolecular esterification) to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The reduction and cyclization reactions occur at the functional groups (C1 and C5), not at the chiral center (C3). Therefore, the stereochemical configuration of the starting material is retained in the product. To obtain the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material **A** must have the **(R)** configuration.\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`).\n    2.  The isobutyl ester group at C5 remains.\n    3.  The resulting intermediate is an isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) causes this intermediate to cyclize via intramolecular transesterification (the new alcohol attacks the ester), forming the lactone and releasing isobutanol.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As in the first reaction, the chiral center at C3 is not involved in the reaction. The stereochemical configuration is retained. To obtain the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material **B** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   For Reaction A, to get the (R)-product, the starting material A must be **(R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   For Reaction B, to get the (S)-product, the starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis combination matches option D.\n\n*   A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n*   B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has a five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) at one end (C1) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`) at the other end (C5). It has a single chiral center at C3, which is bonded to an ethyl group.\n    *   Structure: `iBuOOC-CH₂(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a δ-lactone). The chiral center from C3 of the starting material becomes C4 in the lactone ring.\n\n### **2. Analyze Reaction A**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Careful Point 1: Chemoselectivity of LiBH₄.** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a selective reducing agent that reduces esters to primary alcohols but does not reduce carboxylic acids under the same conditions.\n*   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the carboxylic acid at C1 intact. The resulting intermediate is 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid. The acidic workup (H⁺) then causes this intermediate to cyclize into the lactone.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Stereochemistry and Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Priorities.** The reaction does not occur at the chiral center (C3), so the 3D arrangement of atoms is retained. However, we must check if the R/S designation changes due to a change in group priorities.\n    *   **In Starting Material A:** The groups attached to the chiral C3 are: H, `-CH₂CH₃`, `-CH₂COOH`, and `-CH₂COOiBu`. The CIP priority order is: `-CH₂COOiBu` (1) > `-CH₂COOH` (2) > `-CH₂CH₃` (3) > H (4).\n    *   **In the Intermediate:** The `-CH₂COOiBu` group (priority 1) is converted to `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The new priority order for the intermediate is: `-CH₂COOH` (new 1) > `-CH₂CH₂OH` (new 2) > `-CH₂CH₃` (3) > H (4).\n    *   The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. A swap in the priority of two groups **inverts the R/S designation**, even though the reaction did not touch the chiral center.\n    *   Therefore, to produce an (R)-lactone, the intermediate must have an (R) configuration. To get an (R) intermediate, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n### **3. Analyze Reaction B**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Careful Point 3: Chemoselectivity of BH₃.** Borane (BH₃) is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters.\n*   **Mechanism:** BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), leaving the ester at C5 intact. The resulting intermediate is isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate. The acidic workup then causes intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Stereochemistry and CIP Priorities.** Again, we check for changes in group priorities.\n    *   **In Starting Material B:** The priority order is: `-CH₂COOiBu` (1) > `-CH₂COOH` (2) > `-CH₂CH₃` (3) > H (4).\n    *   **In the Intermediate:** The `-CH₂COOH` group (priority 2) is converted to `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The `-CH₂COOiBu` group (priority 1) is unchanged. The new priority order is: `-CH₂COOiBu` (1) > `-CH₂CH₂OH` (new 2) > `-CH₂CH₃` (3) > H (4).\n    *   The priority order of the groups has not changed. The highest priority group remains the same. Therefore, the **R/S designation is retained**.\n    *   To produce an (S)-lactone, the intermediate must be (S), and therefore the starting material B must also be **(S)**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of reagent selectivity and the crucial effect of changing CIP priorities:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Starting Material and Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options provide stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This is a molecule with a five-carbon chain that has two different functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) at one end (C1) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`) at the other end (C5). It has a single chiral center at C3, which is bonded to an ethyl group.\n    *   Structure: `iBuOOC-CH₂(5-4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone). The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4). This lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` intermediate.\n\n### **2. Analyzing the Chemoselectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n\nThe core of the problem is the different selectivity of the two reducing agents.\n\n*   **Reaction A (LiBH₄):** Lithium borohydride is a selective reducing agent that reduces **esters** to primary alcohols but does not reduce carboxylic acids under the same conditions.\n    *   **Pathway:** The ester group at C5 is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The carboxylic acid at C1 is untouched. The resulting intermediate is `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`, which cyclizes under acidic workup (H⁺) to form the lactone.\n*   **Reaction B (BH₃):** Borane is a highly selective reducing agent that reduces **carboxylic acids** to primary alcohols but does not readily reduce esters.\n    *   **Pathway:** The carboxylic acid group at C1 is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The ester group at C5 is untouched. The resulting intermediate is `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`. This hydroxy-ester then cyclizes via intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone.\n\n### **3. Analyzing the Stereochemistry (The Critical Step)**\n\nThe reactions do not break any bonds at the chiral center (C3), so the 3D spatial arrangement of the groups is retained. However, the R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center. We must check if the reactions change these priorities.\n\nThe four groups attached to the chiral center (C3) in the starting material are:\n1.  `-H` (lowest priority, #4)\n2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl group)\n3.  `-CH₂COOH` (the acid-side chain)\n4.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (the ester-side chain)\n\nTo rank the acid and ester chains, we compare them atom by atom. The ester chain (`-CH₂-C(=O)O-C₄H₉`) has priority over the acid chain (`-CH₂-C(=O)O-H`) because the oxygen in the ester is bonded to a carbon, while the oxygen in the acid is bonded to a hydrogen.\n*   **Starting Priority Order:** `-CH₂COOiBu` (1) > `-CH₂COOH` (2) > `-CH₂CH₃` (3) > `-H` (4).\n\n**Stereochemistry of Reaction A (LiBH₄):**\n*   The ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`, priority #1) is reduced to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n*   The acid group (`-CH₂COOH`, priority #2) is unchanged.\n*   In the resulting hydroxy-acid intermediate, we compare the new priorities: `-CH₂COOH` vs. `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The acid group now has higher priority than the alcohol group.\n*   **The priorities of the top two groups have swapped.** A swap in the priority of two groups at a chiral center **inverts the R/S designation**, even though the reaction mechanism involves retention of configuration.\n*   Therefore, to obtain the **(R)-product**, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n    *   Path: `(S)-Starting Material` → `(R)-Intermediate` → `(R)-Lactone`\n\n**Stereochemistry of Reaction B (BH₃):**\n*   The acid group (`-CH₂COOH`, priority #2) is reduced to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n*   The ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`, priority #1) is unchanged.\n*   In the resulting hydroxy-ester intermediate, we compare the priorities: `-CH₂COOiBu` vs. `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The ester group still has higher priority than the alcohol group.\n*   **The priority order has not changed.** The group that was #1 is still #1.\n*   Therefore, the R/S designation is **retained** throughout this reaction.\n*   To obtain the **(S)-product**, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n    *   Path: `(S)-Starting Material` → `(S)-Intermediate` → `(S)-Lactone`\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   For Reaction A to yield the (R)-product, starting material **A must be (S)**.\n*   For Reaction B to yield the (S)-product, starting material **B must be (S)**.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct starting materials.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has a five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) at one end (C1) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`) at the other end (C5). It has a single chiral center at C3, which is bonded to an ethyl group.\n    *   Structure: `iBuOOC-CH₂(5)-CH₂(4)-CH(Et)(3)-CH₂(2)-COOH(1)`\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`. This is a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone). The chiral center is at C4 of the lactone ring.\n*   **Transformation:** A lactone is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of a molecule that contains both a hydroxyl group and a carboxylic acid group. In this case, the precursor is `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`. The chiral C3 of this precursor becomes the chiral C4 of the lactone product.\n\n### **2. Analyzing the Reactions and Reagent Selectivity**\n\nThe key to this problem is the different selectivity of the two reducing agents.\n\n*   **Reaction A: A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-lactone**\n    *   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a well-known reducing agent that selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to a carboxylate, which is resistant to reduction by LiBH₄.\n    *   **Mechanism:** LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester at C5 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The carboxylic acid at C1 is left untouched. The resulting intermediate is a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, which cyclizes under acidic workup (H⁺) to form the lactone.\n\n*   **Reaction B: B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-lactone**\n    *   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is highly selective for reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while leaving esters largely unaffected under the same conditions.\n    *   **Mechanism:** BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid at C1 to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`). The isobutyl ester at C5 is left untouched. The resulting intermediate is an isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate. This hydroxy-ester then undergoes intramolecular transesterification (the new -OH attacks the ester) under acidic workup to form the lactone and release isobutanol.\n\n### **3. Analyzing the Stereochemistry**\n\nThis is the most critical and subtle part of the problem. The reactions do not occur at the chiral center (C3), so the spatial arrangement of the atoms around it is preserved. However, the R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center, and these priorities can change when the functional groups are modified.\n\nLet's analyze the groups attached to the chiral C3:\n*   Group 1: `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl)\n*   Group 2: `-H`\n*   Group 3: `-CH₂COOH` (the acid side)\n*   Group 4: `-CH₂COOiBu` (the ester side)\n\n**CIP Priority in the Starting Material:** The ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) has higher priority than the carboxylic acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) because the oxygen in the ester is bonded to a carbon (from isobutyl), while the oxygen in the acid is bonded to a hydrogen. Thus, the priority order is: `-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂COOH` > `-CH₂CH₃` > `-H`.\n\n**Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction A (LiBH₄ reduction):**\n*   The ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is reduced to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n*   The priorities in the hydroxy-acid intermediate become: `-CH₂COOH` > `-CH₂CH₂OH` > `-CH₂CH₃` > `-H`.\n*   **Result:** The priority order of the two main side chains has swapped. A swap in the priority of two groups inverts the R/S designation. Therefore, to obtain an **(R)**-product, the starting material **A must be (S)**.\n    *   `(S)-A` → `(R)-intermediate` → `(R)-lactone`\n\n**Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction B (BH₃ reduction):**\n*   The carboxylic acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) is reduced to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n*   The priorities in the hydroxy-ester intermediate become: `-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂CH₂OH` > `-CH₂CH₃` > `-H`.\n*   **Result:** The priority order of the groups does not change compared to the starting material. Therefore, the R/S designation is retained throughout the reaction. To obtain an **(S)**-product, the starting material **B must be (S)**.\n    *   `(S)-B` → `(S)-intermediate` → `(S)-lactone`\n\n### **4. Conclusion**\n\nBased on the rigorous stereochemical analysis:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Core Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the correct stereoisomers of a starting material, **3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**, which will produce specific stereoisomers of a product, **4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one**, under two different reaction conditions.\n\nThe solution requires understanding three key aspects:\n1.  The selectivity of the reducing agents (LiBH₄ vs. BH₃).\n2.  The reaction pathway (reduction followed by cyclization).\n3.  The stereochemical outcome, which requires careful analysis.\n\n### **2. Analyzing the Structures and the Chiral Center**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** `iBuOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`. This molecule has a single chiral center at Carbon-3 (C3), the carbon bonded to the ethyl group.\n*   **Product:** A six-membered lactone. The chiral center from C3 of the starting material becomes C4 in the lactone product.\n*   **Groups attached to the chiral center (C3):**\n    1.  `-H` (Hydrogen)\n    2.  `-CH₂CH₃` (Ethyl group)\n    3.  `-CH₂COOH` (Carboxylic acid side)\n    4.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (Isobutyl ester side)\n\n### **3. Careful Point 1: Chemoselectivity of the Reagents**\n\nThis is the first critical step, correctly identified by most candidate answers.\n*   **LiBH₄ (Lithium borohydride):** Selectively reduces esters in the presence of carboxylic acids.\n*   **BH₃ (Borane):** Selectively reduces carboxylic acids in the presence of esters.\n\n### **4. Careful Point 2: Retention of Configuration**\n\nIn both reaction pathways, the chemical transformations (reduction and cyclization) occur at the functional groups (ester and acid), which are not directly attached to the chiral center. The bonds at the chiral C3 are not broken or formed. Therefore, the 3D spatial arrangement of the groups around the chiral center is preserved. This is known as **retention of configuration**.\n\n### **5. Careful Point 3: Configuration vs. R/S Label (The Decisive Step)**\n\nThis is the most subtle and important point, which most candidate answers missed. The R/S designation is a *label* based on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center. If a reaction changes the chemical nature of these groups, their priorities can change, which can cause the R/S label to flip, even if the 3D configuration is retained.\n\nLet's analyze the CIP priorities for each reaction.\n\n**Priority of groups in the starting material:**\nComparing the two main side chains: `-CH₂COOiBu` vs. `-CH₂COOH`. The ester group outranks the carboxylic acid group.\n*   **Priority Order:** `-CH₂COOiBu` (High) > `-CH₂COOH` (Mid) > `-CH₂CH₃` (Low) > `-H` (Lowest)\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of Reaction A: A + LiBH₄ → (R)-Product**\n\n1.  **Transformation:** LiBH₄ reduces the ester group: `-CH₂COOiBu` becomes `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) is unchanged.\n2.  **Priorities in Intermediate:** We now compare the new group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`) with the unchanged acid group (`-CH₂COOH`). The acid group outranks the new alcohol group.\n3.  **Priority Change:**\n    *   **Before:** Ester side > Acid side\n    *   **After:** Acid side > Alcohol side (from original ester side)\n    *   The priorities of the two highest-ranking groups have **swapped**.\n4.  **Stereochemical Conclusion:** When the 3D configuration is retained but the priorities of two groups swap, the R/S label **inverts**. Therefore, to obtain an **(R)**-product, the starting material **A** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of Reaction B: B + BH₃ → (S)-Product**\n\n1.  **Transformation:** BH₃ reduces the acid group: `-CH₂COOH` becomes `-CH₂CH₂OH`. The ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is unchanged.\n2.  **Priorities in Intermediate:** We compare the unchanged ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) with the new alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`). The ester group still outranks the alcohol group.\n3.  **Priority Change:**\n    *   **Before:** Ester side > Acid side\n    *   **After:** Ester side > Alcohol side (from original acid side)\n    *   The priority order of the two highest-ranking groups is **maintained**.\n4.  **Stereochemical Conclusion:** When the 3D configuration is retained and the priority order does not change, the R/S label is **retained**. Therefore, to obtain an **(S)**-product, the starting material **B** must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n*   For Reaction A, the starting material must be **(S)**.\n*   For Reaction B, the starting material must be **(S)**.\n\nThis means both A and B are the same enantiomer: **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**. This corresponds to option B.\n\nMost candidate answers incorrectly assume that \"retention of configuration\" automatically means \"retention of the R/S label,\" leading them to the wrong conclusion for starting material A. Answer 8 correctly identifies the need to analyze CIP priorities but is internally inconsistent in its final conclusion. The correct, careful analysis leads unambiguously to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nTo determine the proper starting materials, we must analyze the chemoselectivity of the reducing agents and the resulting stereochemistry.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Structure of Starting Material and Product**\n*   **Starting Material:** The options are stereoisomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This molecule has a chiral center at carbon 3 (C3), which is bonded to an ethyl group. It contains two different carbonyl functional groups: a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an isobutyl ester (-COOiBu).\n*   **Product:** The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, a six-membered cyclic ester (lactone). The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4). The lactone is formed by the cyclization of a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid intermediate.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Chemoselectivity of the Reducing Agents**\n*   **Lithium Borohydride (LiBH₄):** This reagent is known to selectively reduce esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to a carboxylate, which is unreactive to LiBH₄.\n*   **Borane (BH₃):** This reagent is highly selective for the reduction of carboxylic acids to alcohols, being much faster at reducing acids than esters.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Reaction A**\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Pathway:** LiBH₄ selectively reduces the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol. The carboxylic acid group is untouched. The resulting intermediate, 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid, cyclizes under acidic workup to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry (Careful Point 3: Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Priorities):** We must check if the R/S designation changes due to a change in group priorities (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules) around the chiral center.\n    *   **In Starting Material A:** The groups attached to the chiral C3 are: -H, -CH₂CH₃, -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂COOiBu. The priority order is: (1) -CH₂COOiBu > (2) -CH₂COOH > (3) -CH₂CH₃ > (4) -H.\n    *   **In the Intermediate (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid):** The ester group has been reduced to -CH₂CH₂OH. The groups on C3 are now: -H, -CH₂CH₃, -CH₂COOH, and -CH₂CH₂OH. The new priority order is: (1) -CH₂COOH > (2) -CH₂CH₂OH > (3) -CH₂CH₃ > (4) -H.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. A swap in the priority of any two groups inverts the R/S designation. Therefore, to obtain an **(R)**-product, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction B**\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Pathway:** BH₃ selectively reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol. The isobutyl ester group is untouched. The resulting intermediate, isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate, undergoes intramolecular transesterification to form the lactone.\n*   **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   **In Starting Material B:** The priorities are the same as for A: (1) -CH₂COOiBu > (2) -CH₂COOH > (3) -CH₂CH₃ > (4) -H.\n    *   **In the Intermediate (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate):** The acid group has been reduced to -CH₂CH₂OH. The groups on C3 are now: -H, -CH₂CH₃, -CH₂COOiBu, and -CH₂CH₂OH. The new priority order is: (1) -CH₂COOiBu > (2) -CH₂CH₂OH > (3) -CH₂CH₃ > (4) -H.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The relative priority order of the groups has not changed. The highest priority group remains the highest. Therefore, the R/S designation is retained. To obtain an **(S)**-product, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n*   Starting material A must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n*   Starting material B must be **(S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, incorporating the key points from the provided answers.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Structures and Overall Transformation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options provide stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has a five-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) at one end and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`) at the other. It possesses a single chiral center at carbon 3 (C3), which is bonded to an ethyl group.\n    *   Structure: `iBuOOC-CH₂-CH(Et)-CH₂-COOH`\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone). The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4).\n*   **Transformation:** The overall reaction involves the reduction of one of the two carbonyl groups (either the ester or the carboxylic acid) to a primary alcohol, followed by an acid-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization to form the lactone.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction A and the Selectivity of LiBH₄**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a well-known reducing agent that selectively reduces esters to alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to a carboxylate, which is resistant to reduction by LiBH₄.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol.\n    2.  The carboxylic acid group remains intact.\n    3.  The resulting intermediate is `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid`.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes the cyclization (lactonization) of this intermediate to form the product.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction B and the Selectivity of BH₃**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Reagent Selectivity:** Borane (BH₃) is highly selective for the reduction of carboxylic acids to primary alcohols, while leaving esters largely unaffected under the same conditions.\n*   **Mechanism:**\n    1.  BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol.\n    2.  The isobutyl ester group remains intact.\n    3.  The resulting intermediate is `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate`.\n    4.  The acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes an intramolecular transesterification, where the new alcohol attacks the ester carbonyl to form the lactone and release isobutanol.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Stereochemistry (The Critical Step)**\n\nThe reaction mechanisms do not break any bonds at the chiral center, so the 3D arrangement of atoms is retained. However, the R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center, and these priorities can change as the functional groups are modified.\n\nThe groups attached to the chiral C3 are: `-H`, `-CH₂CH₃`, `-CH₂COOH` (acid side), and `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side).\n*   **Initial Priority:** The ester side (`-CH₂COOiBu`) has a higher CIP priority than the acid side (`-CH₂COOH`).\n\n**Stereochemical Outcome for Reaction A (LiBH₄):**\n1.  The higher-priority ester side is reduced to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n2.  The lower-priority acid side (`-CH₂COOH`) is unchanged.\n3.  In the resulting `5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid` intermediate, the acid side (`-CH₂COOH`) now has a higher priority than the new alcohol side (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n4.  **Result:** The priorities of the two main side chains have swapped. A swap in the priority of two groups while retaining the 3D arrangement causes the R/S **designator to invert**.\n5.  **Conclusion for A:** To obtain the **(R)**-lactone, the starting material A must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n**Stereochemical Outcome for Reaction B (BH₃):**\n1.  The lower-priority acid side is reduced to an alcohol (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n2.  The higher-priority ester side (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is unchanged.\n3.  In the resulting `isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate` intermediate, the ester side remains the higher-priority group compared to the new alcohol side.\n4.  **Result:** The priority order of the groups does not change. Therefore, the R/S **designator is retained**.\n5.  **Conclusion for B:** To obtain the **(S)**-lactone, the starting material B must have the **(S)** configuration.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on a rigorous analysis of the reaction mechanisms and the change in CIP priorities:\n*   Starting material **A** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n*   Starting material **B** must be **(S)**-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the question, highlighting the careful points required to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Structures and Overall Transformation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options provide stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`.

It reduces esters to primary alcohols but does not reduce carboxylic acids under these conditions. Therefore, the isobutyl ester group at C5 is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), while the carboxylic acid at C1 remains.\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Stereochemical Designation):** We must analyze how the reduction affects the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center (C3).\n    *   **Groups on C3 in Starting Material A:**\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side)\n        2.  `-CH₂COOH` (acid side)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl group)\n        4.  `-H`\n    *   The priority order is: `-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂COOH` > `-CH₂CH₃`.\n    *   **Groups on C3 in the Intermediate (5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid):**\n        1.  `-CH₂COOH` (acid side, unchanged)\n        2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (reduced ester side)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl group, unchanged)\n    *   The new priority order is: `-CH₂COOH` > `-CH₂CH₂OH` > `-CH₂CH₃`.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. A single swap of priorities at a chiral center inverts the R/S designation, even though the 3D arrangement of atoms is retained. Therefore, to obtain an **(R)**-product, the starting material A must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n    *   **A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction B and its Stereochemistry**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`\n*   **Careful Point 3 (Reagent Selectivity):** Borane (BH₃) is also a selective reducing agent, but its preference is opposite to LiBH₄. It selectively reduces carboxylic acids to primary alcohols in the presence of esters. Therefore, the carboxylic acid group at C1 is reduced to a primary alcohol (`-CH₂OH`), while the isobutyl ester at C5 remains.\n*   **Careful Point 4 (Stereochemical Designation):** We again analyze the CIP priorities.\n    *   **Groups on C3 in Starting Material B:** Same as A: `-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂COOH` > `-CH₂CH₃`.\n    *   **Groups on C3 in the Intermediate (isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate):**\n        1.  `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side, unchanged)\n        2.  `-CH₂CH₂OH` (reduced acid side)\n        3.  `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl group, unchanged)\n    *   The new priority order is: `-CH₂COOiBu` > `-CH₂CH₂OH` > `-CH₂CH₃`.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** The priority order of the groups attached to the chiral center does not change. Therefore, the R/S designation is retained throughout the reaction. To obtain an **(S)**-product, the starting material B must also have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid**\n\n### **Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of reagent selectivity and the resulting change (or lack thereof) in CIP priorities:\n*   Starting Material A must be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n*   Starting Material B must be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nTo decide the final answer, a step-by-step analysis of the chemical problem is required, paying close attention to several key points that were handled with varying success by the different agents.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Structures**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The options provide stereoisomers of `3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid`. This molecule has two key functional groups: a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an isobutyl ester (`-COOiBu`). It possesses a single chiral center at carbon-3 (C3), which is bonded to an ethyl group.\n*   **Product:** The product is `4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one`, a six-membered cyclic ester (a delta-lactone). The chiral center from the starting material (C3) becomes the chiral center in the product (C4).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Reaction A and its Reagent (LiBH₄)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** A + LiBH₄ + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Careful Point 1: Chemoselectivity of LiBH₄.** Lithium borohydride (LiBH₄) is a well-known reducing agent that selectively reduces esters to primary alcohols in the presence of carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated to a carboxylate salt, which is resistant to reduction by LiBH₄.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  LiBH₄ reduces the isobutyl ester group to a primary alcohol.\n    2.  The molecule becomes a 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoic acid.\n    3.  Acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular esterification (lactonization) to form the final product.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Reaction B and its Reagent (BH₃)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** B + BH₃ + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one\n*   **Careful Point 2: Chemoselectivity of BH₃.** Borane (BH₃) exhibits the opposite selectivity to LiBH₄. It is highly effective at reducing carboxylic acids to primary alcohols while leaving esters largely unaffected under the same conditions.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:**\n    1.  BH₃ reduces the carboxylic acid group to a primary alcohol.\n    2.  The molecule becomes an isobutyl 5-hydroxy-3-ethylpentanoate.\n    3.  Acidic workup (H⁺) catalyzes intramolecular transesterification, where the new alcohol attacks the ester carbonyl to form the lactone and release isobutanol.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Stereochemistry (The Most Critical Point)**\n\nMany of the provided answers incorrectly assume that because the bonds at the chiral center are not broken, the R/S designation is automatically retained. This is a common oversimplification. The R/S designation depends on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the groups attached to the chiral center. If a reaction changes a functional group, it can change its priority, which may invert the R/S label even if the 3D arrangement of atoms (the absolute configuration) is unchanged.\n\nLet's analyze the groups attached to the chiral C3:\n*   Group 1: `-CH₂COOiBu` (ester side)\n*   Group 2: `-CH₂COOH` (acid side)\n*   Group 3: `-CH₂CH₃` (ethyl)\n*   Group 4: `-H`\n\n**Initial CIP Priority:** The ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) has a higher priority than the carboxylic acid group (`-CH₂COOH`). So, the initial priority order is: **Group 1 > Group 2 > Group 3 > Group 4**.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction A (LiBH₄):**\n    *   The higher-priority Group 1 (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is reduced to `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   The lower-priority Group 2 (`-CH₂COOH`) is unchanged.\n    *   In the resulting hydroxy-acid intermediate, the acid group (`-CH₂COOH`) now has a higher priority than the new alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n    *   **Result:** The priorities of the top two groups have swapped. A single swap of priorities inverts the R/S designation. Therefore, to obtain an **(R)**-lactone, the starting material A must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Outcome of Reaction B (BH₃):**\n    *   The lower-priority Group 2 (`-CH₂COOH`) is reduced to `-CH₂CH₂OH`.\n    *   The higher-priority Group 1 (`-CH₂COOiBu`) is unchanged.\n    *   In the resulting hydroxy-ester intermediate, the ester group (`-CH₂COOiBu`) still has a higher priority than the new alcohol group (`-CH₂CH₂OH`).\n    *   **Result:** The priority order of the groups has not changed. Therefore, the R/S designation is retained. To obtain an **(S)**-lactone, the starting material B must have the **(S)** configuration.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\nBased on a rigorous analysis of chemoselectivity and the change in CIP priorities:\n*   Starting Material **A** must be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n*   Starting Material **B** must also be the **(S)** enantiomer.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
