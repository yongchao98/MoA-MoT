A step-by-step verification confirms the correct methodology and result.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Calculate Moles of Each Component**: First, determine the number of moles of the acid (H₂PO₄⁻ from KH₂PO₄) and its conjugate base (HPO₄²⁻ from Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O).\n    *   Moles of KH₂PO₄ = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol\n    *   Moles of Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O = Mass / Molar Mass = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol\n\n2.  **Calculate Initial Concentrations**: Convert the moles to molarity using the solution volume of 200.00 cm³ (0.20000 L).\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n3.  **Calculate Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]**: The solution is a buffer system composed of the H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ conjugate pair. The hydrogen ion concentration is determined by the second dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid, governed by Ka₂.\n    *   Equilibrium: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n        [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n4.  **Calculate Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]**: The concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is determined by the third dissociation equilibrium, which is governed by Ka₃.\n    *   Equilibrium: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n        [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M) ≈ 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n5.  **Compare with Options**: The calculated concentration is 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M, which rounds to 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M. This value matches option A.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Correct Molar Mass**: It is essential to use the molar mass for the hydrated salt, Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (177.99 g/mol), as specified.\n*   **Correct Equilibria**: The problem requires a two-step equilibrium calculation. The [H⁺] must first be determined from the primary buffer system (governed by Ka₂) before it can be used to find the concentration of a minor species ([PO₄³⁻]) from a subsequent equilibrium (governed by Ka₃).\n*   **Approximation Validity**: The assumption that the initial concentrations of the buffer components equal their equilibrium concentrations is valid because they are part of a buffer and their concentrations are much larger than the Ka values.\n*   **Matching Result to Option**: The most common error among the candidate answers was correctly calculating the value (~6.24x10⁻⁷ M) but then incorrectly assigning it to option B, C, or D.

Calculate Initial Concentrations**\nNext, we find the initial molar concentrations of these ions in the 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.20000 L) solution.\n\n*   **Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻:**\n    [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M\n*   **Concentration of HPO₄²⁻:**\n    [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M\n\n**3. Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]**\nThe solution is a buffer system composed of the H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ conjugate pair. The pH (and thus the [H⁺]) is governed by the second dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid, which has the constant Ka₂.\n\n*   **Equilibrium:** H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n*   **Equilibrium Constant:** Ka₂ = 6.2x10⁻⁸\n\nWe can rearrange the Ka₂ expression to solve for [H⁺]:\nKa₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n[H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n[H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M)\n[H⁺] ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**4. Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion [PO₄³⁻] Concentration**\nThe orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is produced in the third dissociation step, which is governed by Ka₃. We use the [H⁺] established by the buffer to find the [PO₄³⁻] at equilibrium.\n\n*   **Equilibrium:** HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n*   **Equilibrium Constant:** Ka₃ = 1.8x10⁻¹²\n\nRearranging the Ka₃ expression to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\nKa₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n[PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n[PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M)\n[PO₄³⁻] ≈ 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n**5. Compare with Options and Conclude**\nThe calculated concentration of orthophosphate ions is 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M. Comparing this to the given options:\nA) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\nB) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\nC) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\nD) 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated value is extremely close to 6.24x10⁻⁷ M. The minor difference is due to rounding of the given constants in the problem statement.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Molar Mass:** It is crucial to use the molar mass of the hydrated salt, Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (177.99 g/mol), not the anhydrous form.\n*   **Equilibrium Selection:** The [H⁺] is determined by the main buffer components (H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻), which corresponds to the Ka₂ equilibrium. The target ion, PO₄³⁻, is found using the Ka₃ equilibrium.\n*   **Approximations:** The initial concentrations of the buffer components can be used as their equilibrium concentrations because they are in a buffer and their concentrations are much larger than the Ka values. This is a standard and valid approximation.\n*   **Candidate Answer Analysis:** The majority of the candidate answers arrive at the correct numerical result (~6.24x10⁻⁷ M). The discrepancies in the final letter choice (A, B, C, or D) appear to stem from inconsistent labeling of the options, not from errors in the chemical calculation. Based on the options provided in the prompt, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nBased on an analysis of the provided answers and a step-by-step re-evaluation of the chemistry problem, here is a breakdown of the correct approach and a final decision.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe core of this problem is to calculate the concentration of a minor species (PO₄³⁻) in a buffer solution. The correct method involves a two-step equilibrium calculation.\n\n1.  **Identify Components and Calculate Moles:**\n    *   The solution contains KH₂PO₄, which provides the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻.\n        *   Moles H₂PO₄⁻ = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol.\n    *   The solution also contains Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O, which provides the conjugate base HPO₄²⁻.\n        *   Moles HPO₄²⁻ = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol.\n\n2.  **Calculate Initial Concentrations:**\n    *   The volume is 200.00 cm³, which must be converted to liters: 0.20000 L.\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M.\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M.\n\n3.  **Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]:**\n    *   The H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ pair constitutes a buffer. The pH and [H⁺] are governed by the second dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid (Ka₂).\n    *   Equilibrium: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   The equilibrium expression is: Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   Solving for [H⁺]: [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]:**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is produced in the third dissociation step, which is dependent on the [H⁺] established by the buffer.\n    *   Equilibrium: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   The equilibrium expression is: Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   Solving for [PO₄³⁻]: [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M) ≈ 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Correct Molar Mass:** It is crucial to use the molar mass of the hydrated salt, Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (177.99 g/mol), as specified in the problem.\n*   **Correct Ka Values:** The problem involves three dissociation steps, but only two are needed for the calculation. Ka₂ must be used to find the [H⁺] of the buffer, and Ka₃ must be used to find the final [PO₄³⁻].\n*   **Approximation Validity:** The concentrations of the buffer components [H₂PO₄⁻] and [HPO₄²⁻] are significantly larger than the Ka values. Therefore, it is a valid approximation to assume their equilibrium concentrations are equal to their initial calculated concentrations.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** Most of the provided answers perform the calculation correctly and arrive at a value of approximately 6.24x10⁻⁷ M. However, many of them incorrectly map this numerical result to the final lettered option (e.g., calculating 6.24x10⁻⁷ M but choosing 'B' or 'D'). The calculation itself is robust and consistently reproduced.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe calculation consistently and correctly yields a concentration of approximately 6.24x10⁻⁷ M for the orthophosphate ion. Comparing this value to the given options:\n\n*   A) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\n*   B) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\n*   C) 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n*   D) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

The hydrogen ion concentration is determined by the second dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid, governed by Ka₂.\n    *   Equilibrium: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [H⁺]:\n        [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n        [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n4.  **Calculate Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]**: The concentration of the orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is determined by the third dissociation equilibrium, which is governed by Ka₃.\n    *   Equilibrium: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   Rearranging to solve for [PO₄³⁻]:\n        [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n        [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M) ≈ 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M\n\n5.  **Compare with Options**: The calculated concentration is 6.236 x 10⁻⁷ M, which rounds to 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.

The correct method involves a two-step equilibrium calculation.\n\n1.  **Identify Components and Calculate Moles:**\n    *   The solution contains KH₂PO₄, which provides the weak acid H₂PO₄⁻.\n        *   Moles H₂PO₄⁻ = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007348 mol.\n    *   The solution also contains Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O, which provides the conjugate base HPO₄²⁻.\n        *   Moles HPO₄²⁻ = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005618 mol.\n\n2.  **Calculate Initial Concentrations:**\n    *   The volume is 200.00 cm³, which must be converted to liters: 0.20000 L.\n    *   [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.007348 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.03674 M.\n    *   [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.005618 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.02809 M.\n\n3.  **Determine the Hydrogen Ion Concentration [H⁺]:**\n    *   The H₂PO₄⁻/HPO₄²⁻ pair constitutes a buffer. The pH and [H⁺] are governed by the second dissociation equilibrium of phosphoric acid (Ka₂).\n    *   Equilibrium: H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻\n    *   The equilibrium expression is: Ka₂ = [H⁺][HPO₄²⁻] / [H₂PO₄⁻]\n    *   Solving for [H⁺]: [H⁺] = Ka₂ * ([H₂PO₄⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻])\n    *   [H⁺] = (6.2x10⁻⁸) * (0.03674 M / 0.02809 M) ≈ 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Orthophosphate Ion Concentration [PO₄³⁻]:**\n    *   The orthophosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) is produced in the third dissociation step, which is dependent on the [H⁺] established by the buffer.\n    *   Equilibrium: HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻\n    *   The equilibrium expression is: Ka₃ = [H⁺][PO₄³⁻] / [HPO₄²⁻]\n    *   Solving for [PO₄³⁻]: [PO₄³⁻] = Ka₃ * ([HPO₄²⁻] / [H⁺])\n    *   [PO₄³⁻] = (1.8x10⁻¹²) * (0.02809 M / 8.11 x 10⁻⁸ M) ≈ 6.24 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Correct Molar Mass:** It is crucial to use the molar mass of the hydrated salt, Na₂HPO₄●2H₂O (177.99 g/mol), as specified in the problem.\n*   **Correct Ka Values:** The problem involves three dissociation steps, but only two are needed for the calculation. Ka₂ must be used to find the [H⁺] of the buffer, and Ka₃ must be used to find the final [PO₄³⁻].\n*   **Approximation Validity:** The concentrations of the buffer components [H₂PO₄⁻] and [HPO₄²⁻] are significantly larger than the Ka values. Therefore, it is a valid approximation to assume their equilibrium concentrations are equal to their initial calculated concentrations.\n*   **Analysis of Candidate Answers:** Most of the provided answers perform the calculation correctly and arrive at a value of approximately 6.24x10⁻⁷ M. However, many of them incorrectly map this numerical result to the final lettered option (e.g., calculating 6.24x10⁻⁷ M but choosing 'B' or 'D'). The calculation itself is robust and consistently reproduced.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe calculation consistently and correctly yields a concentration of approximately 6.24x10⁻⁷ M for the orthophosphate ion. Comparing this value to the given options:\n\n*   A) 2.81x10⁻⁷ M\n*   B) 5.48x10⁻⁷ M\n*   C) 6.24x10⁻⁷ M\n*   D) 3.97x10⁻⁷ M\n\nThe calculated result matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",
