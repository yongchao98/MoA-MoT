The total energy of the system before the annihilation must equal the total energy of the system after the annihilation.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$):**\n    *   The initial system consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$).\n    *   The problem states the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which is a common simplification in physics problems. It implies that the initial kinetic energy of the particles is negligible compared to their rest mass energy. We can therefore consider the annihilation to happen from a state of rest.\n    *   The total initial energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the proton and the antiproton. A particle and its antiparticle have identical mass.\n    *   The rest mass energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.3 MeV.\n    *   $E_{initial} = (m_p c^2) + (m_{\\bar{p}} c^2) = 938.3 \\text{ MeV} + 938.3 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.6 \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n3.  **Define the Final Energy ($E_{final}$):**\n    *   The final state consists of four particles ($2A^{+}$ and $2A^{-}$). All four have the same rest mass energy, given as $m_A c^2 = 300 \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   Since the initial energy is converted into these particles, they will be moving at high speeds. Therefore, we must use the formula for relativistic energy: $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\n    *   Because the initial momentum was zero, the final total momentum must also be zero. By symmetry, the energy is distributed equally among the four identical-mass particles, meaning they all travel at the same speed, $v$.\n    *   The total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n    *   $E_{final} = 4 \\times (\\gamma m_A c^2) = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV}) = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$.\n\n4.  **Apply Energy Conservation to Find γ:**\n    *   Set the initial energy equal to the final energy: $E_{initial} = E_{final}$.\n    *   $1876.6 \\text{ MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$.\n    *   Solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$:\n    *   $\\gamma = \\frac{1876.6}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Velocity (v) from γ:**\n    *   The Lorentz factor is defined as $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}$.

Conservation of momentum is also implicitly used to justify the symmetric distribution of energy among the final particles.\n*   **Relativistic Mechanics:** The resulting particles are moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light ($v > 0.1c$). Therefore, using relativistic formulas for energy ($E=\\gamma mc^2$) is mandatory.

Determine the Initial Energy ($E_{initial}$)**\nThe initial state consists of a proton ($p$) and an antiproton ($\\bar{p}$). The problem specifies that the antiproton is \"slowly moving,\" which in this context implies its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. We can therefore assume the system is effectively at rest in the center-of-mass frame, and the total initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the two particles.\n\n*   The rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.27 MeV.\n*   A particle and its antiparticle have identical mass, so the rest energy of an antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$) is also 938.27 MeV.\n\n$E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 938.27 \\text{ MeV} + 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**2. Determine the Final Energy ($E_{final}$)**\nThe final state consists of four particles ($2A^{+}$ and $2A^{-}$), which are the products of the annihilation.\n*   The rest energy of each particle A ($m_A c^2$) is given as 300 MeV.\n*   The initial energy is converted into the total energy of these four particles. Since the initial momentum was zero, the final momentum must also be zero. By symmetry, the energy will be distributed equally among the four identical-mass particles, meaning they will all have the same speed, $v$.\n*   The total energy of a single moving particle A is given by the relativistic formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}$.\n\nThe total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n$E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n$E_{final} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV}) = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Energy**\nBy equating the initial and final energies, we can solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n$1876.54 \\text{ MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**4. Solve for the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876.54}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n**5. Solve for the Velocity (v)**\nNow, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n\nRearranging to solve for $\\beta$:\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n$\\beta \\approx 0.7688$\n\nThe velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.7688c$. This value is best approximated by **0.77c**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Interpretation of \"Slowly Moving\"**: This phrase is crucial. It allows us to assume the initial kinetic energy of the system is negligible, simplifying the initial energy calculation to only the rest mass energies.\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum**: While the calculation focuses on energy, conservation of momentum is implicitly used. The assumption that the initial momentum is zero leads to the conclusion that the final energy is distributed symmetrically among the four particles, ensuring they all have the same speed.\n3.  **Relativistic Effects**: The energy released is substantial, accelerating the resulting particles to a significant fraction of the speed of light. It is essential to use the relativistic formula for energy ($E = \\gamma mc^2$) and not classical kinetic energy.\n4.  **Consistency of Constants**: Using a standard, precise value for the proton's rest mass energy (e.g., ~938.27 MeV from CODATA) ensures an accurate result. Using a rounded value like 938 MeV yields a nearly identical answer, but precision is good practice.\n5.  **Option Mapping**: The provided candidate answers show significant confusion in mapping the calculated value (0.77c) to the correct letter option (A, B, C, or D). This is likely due to inconsistent ordering of the options in their individual prompts. Based on the options provided in *this* problem description (A: 0.91c, B: 0.77c, C: 0.86c, D: 0.96c), the calculated velocity of ~0.77c corresponds directly to option B.\n\nThe overwhelming consensus from the calculations in the candidate answers is that the velocity is approximately 0.77c.

We can therefore assume the system is effectively at rest in the center-of-mass frame, and the total initial energy is the sum of the rest energies of the two particles.\n\n*   The rest energy of a proton ($m_p c^2$) is approximately 938.27 MeV.\n*   A particle and its antiparticle have identical mass, so the rest energy of an antiproton ($m_{\\bar{p}} c^2$) is also 938.27 MeV.\n\n$E_{initial} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 938.27 \\text{ MeV} + 938.27 \\text{ MeV} = 1876.54 \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**2. Determine the Final Energy ($E_{final}$)**\nThe final state consists of four particles ($2A^{+}$ and $2A^{-}$), which are the products of the annihilation.\n*   The rest energy of each particle A ($m_A c^2$) is given as 300 MeV.\n*   The initial energy is converted into the total energy of these four particles. Since the initial momentum was zero, the final momentum must also be zero. By symmetry, the energy will be distributed equally among the four identical-mass particles, meaning they will all have the same speed, $v$.\n*   The total energy of a single moving particle A is given by the relativistic formula $E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma = 1 / \\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}$.\n\nThe total final energy is the sum of the energies of the four A particles:\n$E_{final} = 4 \\times E_A = 4 \\gamma m_A c^2$\n$E_{final} = 4 \\times \\gamma \\times (300 \\text{ MeV}) = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**3. Apply Conservation of Energy**\nBy equating the initial and final energies, we can solve for the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$.\n$E_{initial} = E_{final}$\n$1876.54 \\text{ MeV} = 1200\\gamma \\text{ MeV}$\n\n**4. Solve for the Lorentz Factor ($\\gamma$)**\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1876.54}{1200} \\approx 1.5638$\n\n**5. Solve for the Velocity (v)**\nNow, we use the definition of the Lorentz factor to find the velocity. Let $\\beta = v/c$.\n$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$\n\nRearranging to solve for $\\beta$:\n$\\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}$\n\nSubstitute the calculated value of $\\gamma$:\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5638)^2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4455}}$\n$\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4089} = \\sqrt{0.5911}$\n$\\beta \\approx 0.7688$\n\nThe velocity of particle A is $v \\approx 0.7688c$. This value is best approximated by **0.77c**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Interpretation of \"Slowly Moving\"**: This phrase is crucial. It allows us to assume the initial kinetic energy of the system is negligible, simplifying the initial energy calculation to only the rest mass energies.\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum**: While the calculation focuses on energy, conservation of momentum is implicitly used. The assumption that the initial momentum is zero leads to the conclusion that the final energy is distributed symmetrically among the four particles, ensuring they all have the same speed.\n3.  **Relativistic Effects**: The energy released is substantial, accelerating the resulting particles to a significant fraction of the speed of light. It is essential to use the relativistic formula for energy ($E = \\gamma mc^2$) and not classical kinetic energy.\n4.  **Consistency of Constants**: Using a standard, precise value for the proton's rest mass energy (e.g., ~938.27 MeV from CODATA) ensures an accurate result. Using a rounded value like 938 MeV yields a nearly identical answer, but precision is good practice.\n5.  **Option Mapping**: The provided candidate answers show significant confusion in mapping the calculated value (0.77c) to the correct letter option (A, B, C, or D). This is likely due to inconsistent ordering of the options in their individual prompts. Based on the options provided in *this* problem description (A: 0.91c, B: 0.77c, C: 0.86c, D: 0.96c), the calculated velocity of ~0.77c corresponds directly to option B.\n\nThe overwhelming consensus from the calculations in the candidate answers is that the velocity is approximately 0.77c. The discrepancies in the final letter choice are due to inconsistent option labeling, not errors in the physics calculation.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
