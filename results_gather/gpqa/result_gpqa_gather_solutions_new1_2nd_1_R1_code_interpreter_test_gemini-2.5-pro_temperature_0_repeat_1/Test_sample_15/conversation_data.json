This aligns with the reasoning of the most accurate candidate answers (e.g., Answers 10 and 11), even though many other candidates had contradictions between their reasoning and their final letter choice.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nTo determine the final answer, a step-by-step analysis of each compound's potential for optical activity is required. A compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral and not present as a 50:50 racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This usually means it lacks any internal elements of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is a careful analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This is an alkene. The atoms involved in the carbon-carbon double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name of this complex molecule includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This explicitly defines a single, specific stereoisomer. The presence of these R/S designations confirms the molecule has chiral centers and is itself chiral. Since a single enantiomer is specified, it is by definition **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (at carbons C2 and C3). However, the molecule is symmetric, with identical groups (`-COOH` and `-CH3`) on both chiral carbons. The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry, making the molecule a **meso compound**. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers and are therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration does not possess an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and its mirror image is the non-superimposable `(2S,3S)` enantiomer. As a specific, single enantiomer is named, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1, which is bonded to the hydroxyl group (-OH), is a chiral center. It is attached to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, and two different pathways around the ring (`-CH=CH-` and `-CH2-CH2-`). The `(R)` designation specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral molecule. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the all-cis isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement results in a highly symmetric molecule that possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For example, a plane passing through one C-OH bond and the opposite CH2 group bisects the molecule into identical halves. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. To check for chirality, we look for a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups, and the rest of the molecule. Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center. No other carbon in the molecule is a chiral center. The molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary of Optically Active Compounds:**\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nTo determine the number of optically active compounds, we must analyze each molecule for chirality. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a 50:50 racemic mixture.

This indicates that the molecule has chiral centers and that a specific, single stereoisomer is being described. A single enantiomer (or diastereomer) of a chiral compound is by definition optically active. Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (at carbons C2 and C3). However, the molecule is symmetric, and the `(2R,3S)` configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry that makes one half of the molecule the mirror image of the other. This is a classic example of a **meso compound**. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a stereoisomer of the previous compound. The `(2R,3R)` configuration does not have an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and its mirror image is the non-superimposable `(2S,3S)` enantiomer.

Select the Final Answer**\nThe count of 3 corresponds to option C.\n\nA) 4\nB) 2\nC) 3\nD) 5\n\nThe correct choice is C. This aligns with the reasoning of the most accurate candidate answers (e.g., Answers 10 and 11), even though many other candidates had contradictions between their reasoning and their final letter choice.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nTo determine the final answer, a step-by-step analysis of each compound's potential for optical activity is required. A compound will exhibit optical activity if it is chiral and not present as a 50:50 racemic mixture. A molecule is chiral if it is non-superimposable on its mirror image. This usually means it lacks any internal elements of symmetry, such as a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion.\n\nHere is a careful analysis of each compound:\n\n1.  **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: This is an alkene. The atoms involved in the carbon-carbon double bond and the atoms directly attached to them lie in a single plane. This plane of the molecule acts as a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n2.  **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: The name of this complex molecule includes the stereochemical descriptors `(3aR,7aS)`. This explicitly defines a single, specific stereoisomer. The presence of these R/S designations confirms the molecule has chiral centers and is itself chiral. Since a single enantiomer is specified, it is by definition **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (at carbons C2 and C3). However, the molecule is symmetric, with identical groups (`-COOH` and `-CH3`) on both chiral carbons. The `(2R,3S)` configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry, making the molecule a **meso compound**. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers and are therefore **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a diastereomer of the meso compound above. The `(2R,3R)` configuration does not possess an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and its mirror image is the non-superimposable `(2S,3S)` enantiomer. As a specific, single enantiomer is named, it is **optically active**.\n\n5.  **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: The carbon atom at position 1, which is bonded to the hydroxyl group (-OH), is a chiral center. It is attached to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, and two different pathways around the ring (`-CH=CH-` and `-CH2-CH2-`). The `(R)` designation specifies a single enantiomer of this chiral molecule. Therefore, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This name describes the all-cis isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This arrangement results in a highly symmetric molecule that possesses multiple planes of symmetry. For example, a plane passing through one C-OH bond and the opposite CH2 group bisects the molecule into identical halves. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH3)2CH-CH2-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`. To check for chirality, we look for a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The carbon at position 3 of the butane chain is bonded to a hydrogen, two identical methyl groups, and the rest of the molecule. Since it is bonded to two identical groups, it is not a chiral center. No other carbon in the molecule is a chiral center. The molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n**Summary of Optically Active Compounds:**\n*   (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n*   (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n*   (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n\nThere are a total of **3** optically active compounds. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nTo determine the number of optically active compounds, we must analyze each molecule for chirality. A compound is optically active if it is chiral and not present as a 50:50 racemic mixture.

This indicates that the molecule has chiral centers and that a specific, single stereoisomer is being described. A single enantiomer (or diastereomer) of a chiral compound is by definition optically active. Therefore, this compound is **optically active**.\n\n3.  **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This molecule has two chiral centers (at carbons C2 and C3). However, the molecule is symmetric, and the `(2R,3S)` configuration results in an internal plane of symmetry that makes one half of the molecule the mirror image of the other. This is a classic example of a **meso compound**. Meso compounds are achiral despite having chiral centers. Therefore, it is **optically inactive**.\n\n4.  **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: This is a stereoisomer of the previous compound. The `(2R,3R)` configuration does not have an internal plane of symmetry. It is a chiral molecule, and its mirror image is the non-superimposable `(2S,3S)` enantiomer.

The carbon atom at position 1 is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group (-OH), and two different carbon pathways within the ring (`-CH=CH-` and `-CH2-CH2-`). As a single enantiomer of a chiral molecule, it is **optically active**.\n\n6.  **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This notation describes the all-*cis* isomer, where all three hydroxyl groups are on the same side of the cyclohexane ring. This highly symmetric arrangement results in multiple planes of symmetry. For instance, a plane passing through one C-OH bond and the opposite CH₂ group bisects the molecule into identical halves. Due to these symmetry elements, the molecule is achiral and **optically inactive**.\n\n7.  **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is `(CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(=O)-Cyclopentyl`.
