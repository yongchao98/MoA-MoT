It was therefore pruned for producing the incorrect product.\n    *   **Hypothesis B** was pruned for chemical infeasibility. It proposed a diazotization reaction (step iv) on an intermediate that lacked the necessary primary amine group.\n    *   **Hypothesis D** was also pruned for chemical infeasibility.

The analysis showed that it correctly employs a sophisticated blocking group strategy (sulfonation followed by later desulfonation) to achieve the difficult 1,2,3-substitution pattern. While one step (nitration of a diazonium salt) is chemically unusual, the overall sequence is the only one that is strategically sound and leads to the correct target molecule.\n\nThe script concluded that Option C is the only viable choice.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer from the provided options.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Target Molecule\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Parent Ring:** Benzene\n*   **Substituents and Positions:**\n    *   C1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   C2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   C3: Nitro group (-NO₂)\n*   **Key Structural Features:**\n    *   This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (three adjacent groups) benzene ring.\n    *   The structure is sterically crowded due to the bulky tert-butyl group being positioned between the other two substituents.\n    *   The directing effects of the groups are in conflict. For example, the strongly activating -OEt group is *meta* to the -NO₂ group, an arrangement that is very difficult to achieve by direct nitration of an ethoxy-substituted benzene ring.\n\nThese features strongly indicate that a simple, linear sequence of electrophilic substitutions will not work. A more sophisticated strategy, likely involving blocking groups and/or functional group interconversions, is necessary to control the regiochemistry and achieve a high yield.\n\n### 2. Evaluation of the Proposed Options\n\nWe must analyze each sequence of reactions for chemical feasibility and its ability to produce the target isomer.\n\n*   **Options with Fundamental Flaws:**\n    *   **Option B:** As noted by several candidate answers, this sequence attempts to use a diazotization reagent (`NaNO₂/HCl`) on an intermediate that does not contain a primary amine (-NH₂) group. This is a chemically impossible step, invalidating the entire sequence.\n    *   **Option C:** This option also contains impossible steps. Depending on the exact interpretation, it either attempts diazotization without an amine or tries to perform an unstable reaction on a diazonium salt (e.g., sulfonation). This sequence is not chemically viable.\n\n*   **Analysis of Option D:**\n    *   This sequence begins with Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form tert-butylbenzene, followed by nitration. Due to the steric bulk of the -tBu group, this nitration overwhelmingly produces the *para* isomer (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene).\n    *   Subsequent steps (reduction to an amine, another nitration, diazotization, hydrolysis to a phenol, and etherification) are individually plausible.\n    *   However, as correctly traced by multiple candidate answers (e.g., 7, 9), this pathway leads to **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** or a similar isomer. It does not produce the target 1,2,3-substituted product. The final two steps (sulfonation/desulfonation) are illogical and would not induce the necessary skeletal rearrangement. Therefore, Option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Analysis of Option A:**\n    *   This sequence is the most complex but also the most strategically sound. It is the only option that correctly employs a sulfonic acid (-SO₃H) as a removable blocking group, which is the classic strategy for synthesizing complex isomers.\n    *   Let's trace the path as detailed by the most thorough analyses (e.g., Answer 8):\n        1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Forms **tert-butylbenzene**.\n        2.  **ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄:** Sulfonation occurs at the sterically accessible *para* position, forming **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This blocks the para position from further reaction.\n        3.  **iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration. Both the -tBu group (*ortho*-directing) and the -SO₃H group (*meta*-directing) direct the incoming -NO₂ group to the same position (C2). This is a highly regioselective step yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n        4.  **iv) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine, yielding **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n        5.  **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** The amine is converted to a diazonium salt.\n        6.  **vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** A second nitration occurs. At this stage, all three existing groups (-tBu, -N₂⁺, -SO₃H) direct the new nitro group to the only remaining open position (C6). This is another highly specific step.\n        7.  **vii) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat:** Heating in aqueous acid accomplishes two crucial transformations simultaneously: the diazonium salt at C2 is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group (-OH), and the sulfonic acid blocking group at C4 is removed (desulfonation). The product is **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**.\n        8.  **viii) dilute H₂SO₄:** This is a redundant step, likely ensuring the completion of step vii.\n        9.  **ix) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol into an ether. The -OH group is converted to an -OEt group.\n    *   **Final Product Check:** The resulting molecule has -OEt, -tBu, and -NO₂ groups. By IUPAC naming rules, the carbon with the -OEt group is C1. Numbering towards the next substituent gives the -tBu group at C2 and the -NO₂ group at C3. The final product is indeed **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile complex and containing an uncommon step (nitration of a diazonium salt), the reaction sequence in Option A is the only one that is chemically sound and leads precisely to the named target molecule. The strategy of using a blocking group is essential for this synthesis, and only Option A employs it correctly. Options B and C contain impossible chemical steps, and Option D leads to the wrong isomer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents**: An ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   **Positions**: The groups are on adjacent carbons, C1, C2, and C3. This is a sterically crowded 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n*   **Directing Effects**:\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are activating, *ortho, para*-directing groups.\n    *   -NO2 is a deactivating, *meta*-directing group.\n*   **Key Relationships**: The -OEt (strong *o,p*-director) is *meta* to the -NO2 group. This is difficult to achieve via direct nitration of a corresponding phenol or ethoxybenzene, suggesting a more complex strategy is required.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Plausibility of Each Option\n\nA high-yield synthesis of such a complex molecule requires careful control of regiochemistry. We will evaluate each option for chemical feasibility.\n\n*   **Option A**: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence begins by forming aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction is not feasible because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the aromatic ring towards electrophilic substitution. Therefore, **Option A is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option B**: `... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    This sequence attempts to use a diazotization reagent (`NaNO2/HCl`) in step (iv). However, the intermediate produced after step (iii) is a sulfonic acid of a nitro compound; it does not contain the primary aromatic amine (-NH2) required for diazotization. Therefore, **Option B is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option D**: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This sequence is composed of plausible reactions, but it does not lead to the target product.\n    *   Steps (i) and (ii) produce primarily *p*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   Following the sequence through reduction (iii), a second nitration (iv), diazotization (v), hydrolysis (vi), and etherification (vii) correctly leads to the synthesis of **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   This is an isomer of the target molecule. The final steps (viii and ix) involve sulfonation and desulfonation, which cannot induce the necessary rearrangement from the C4 position to the highly hindered C2 position. Therefore, **Option D is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option C**: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ; ix) NaOH/EtBr`\n    This sequence outlines a sophisticated and correct pathway using a blocking group strategy.\n    *   **i-ii**: Benzene is alkylated to form tert-butylbenzene, and then the *para* position is blocked by sulfonation, yielding **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   **iii**: Nitration occurs. The -tBu group (*o,p*-director) and the -SO3H group (*m*-director) both direct the incoming -NO2 group to position 2, giving **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid** with high regioselectivity.\n    *   **iv**: The nitro group is reduced to an amine (-NH2).\n    *   **v**: The amine is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+). The intermediate is **4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   **vi**: A second nitration is performed. The existing substituents (-tBu, -N2+, and -SO3H) all cooperatively direct the new -NO2 group to the only available position, C6.\n    *   **vii-viii**: Heating in aqueous acid accomplishes two crucial transformations: the diazonium group at C2 is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group (-OH), and the sulfonic acid blocking group at C4 is removed (desulfonation). The resulting product is **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**.\n    *   **ix**: A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol's -OH group to an -OEt group. The product is **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-6-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   **Final Naming**: According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon with the -OEt group is C1. Numbering towards the next substituent gives the -tBu group at C2 and the -NO2 group at C3. The final name is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**, which matches the target molecule.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile containing an advanced step (nitration of a diazonium salt intermediate), Option C is the only sequence that correctly employs a blocking group strategy and subsequent functional group interconversions to achieve the required, complex 1,2,3-substitution pattern in a regiochemically controlled manner. The other options contain fundamental chemical errors or lead to the wrong isomer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents and Positions:**\n    *   C1: Ethoxy (-OEt)\n    *   C2: tert-Butyl (-tBu)\n    *   C3: Nitro (-NO₂)\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene, where all three groups are adjacent. This is a sterically crowded arrangement that is difficult to synthesize directly.\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS):**\n    *   -OEt: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -tBu: Weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director. Its large size sterically hinders the *ortho* positions.\n    *   -NO₂: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\n### 2. Evaluation of the Proposed Options\n\nThe core of this problem is to identify a sequence of reactions that is chemically sound and leads to the correct arrangement of substituents (regiochemistry).\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   This option is nonsensically written with duplicate step numbers. Furthermore, step (iv) `NaNO2/HCl` is for diazotization, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂). The preceding steps do not produce an amine, making this sequence chemically impossible as written.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   This sequence begins by forming nitrobenzene (i) and then reducing it to aniline (ii).\n    *   Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation (`tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`) on aniline. This reaction is known to fail. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring towards further electrophilic substitution. This option is not a viable synthetic route.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v). Step (vi) then attempts to react this diazonium salt with a nitrating mixture (`HNO₃/H₂SO₄`). Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable intermediates; reacting them under harsh nitrating conditions is not a standard or viable synthetic transformation. They would likely decompose. This option is chemically flawed.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    *   Let's trace this sequence step-by-step, as it does not contain any immediately obvious impossible reactions like the others.\n    1.  **i) tBuCl/AlCl₃:** Forms **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  **ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, the major product is **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amine. Product: **p-tert-butylaniline**.\n    4.  **iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The t-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the position *ortho* to the t-butyl group and *meta* to the anilinium group. Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**.\n    5.  **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** Diazotization of the amine. Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenediazonium salt**.\n    6.  **vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat:** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol. Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson ether synthesis. Product: **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n\n### 3. Final Conclusion\n\nThe sequence of reactions in **Option D** is the only one that is chemically plausible from start to finish (steps i-vii). The other options contain steps that are fundamentally flawed (e.g., Friedel-Crafts on aniline, nitration of a diazonium salt).\n\nHowever, it is crucial to note that the product of sequence D is **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, which is an *isomer* of the target molecule, not the target molecule itself. The final two steps in option D (sulfonation and desulfonation) are illogical and would not cause the necessary rearrangement to form the desired product.\n\nTherefore, the question is flawed, as none of the options correctly produce the named target molecule in high yield. However, in the context of selecting the \"best\" option from a flawed set, Option D is the only one that describes a coherent and viable sequence of chemical reactions. The errors in Options A, B, and C are based on impossible chemical transformations, while the error in Option D is one of regiochemical outcome. Thus, Option D is the most plausible intended answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** An ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene, meaning all three groups are adjacent.\n*   **Relative Positions & Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt (at C1) and -tBu (at C2) are *ortho*. Both are *ortho, para*-directors.\n    *   -tBu (at C2) and -NO2 (at C3) are *ortho*. -tBu is an *o,p*-director, while -NO2 is a *meta*-director.\n    *   -OEt (at C1) and -NO2 (at C3) are *meta*. This is a key challenge, as the powerful *o,p*-directing -OEt group is *meta* to the -NO2 group, an arrangement not easily achieved by direct nitration of an ethoxy-substituted ring.\n\nThis complex and sterically hindered arrangement suggests that a simple sequence of electrophilic substitutions will not work. A more sophisticated strategy involving blocking groups and careful manipulation of functional groups is required.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Proposed Options\n\nLet's analyze each option for chemical feasibility and its ability to produce the correct isomer.\n\n*   **Option D: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`**\n    This sequence starts by making aniline. Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction is known to be very inefficient. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring towards the desired C-alkylation. This is not a high-yield pathway. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C: `... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`**\n    This sequence is chemically impossible as written. Step (iv) is a diazotization reaction (`NaNO2/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) as the starting material. The product from the preceding step (iii) is a sulfonic acid, not an amine. **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ...`**\n    This sequence starts by making tert-butylbenzene, then nitrating it. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the major product of nitration is the *para* isomer, **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**. For a \"high-yield\" synthesis, the pathway must proceed through the major isomer. Subsequent steps (reduction, another nitration, etc.) starting from this 1,4-disubstituted compound will not lead to the desired 1,2,3-trisubstituted product. The final product would be an isomer, likely **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr`**\n    This sequence is the most complex, but it employs a blocking group strategy, which is appropriate for this challenge. Let's trace the pathway carefully.\n    1.  **i) Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene**: Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    2.  **ii) → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**: Sulfonation occurs at the *para* position due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group. This blocks the para position.\n    3.  **iii) → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**: Nitration. The t-butyl group directs *ortho*, and the sulfonic acid group directs *meta*. Both direct to the same position (C2), making this a highly regioselective step.\n    4.  **iv) → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**: The nitro group is reduced to an amine.\n    5.  **v) → Diazonium salt**: The amine is converted to a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺). The intermediate is **4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    6.  **vi) → Nitration of the diazonium salt**: This is a key, non-obvious step. We must analyze the directing effects on the intermediate from step (v).\n        *   -tBu (at C1) directs *ortho, para* (to C6, since C2/C4 are blocked).\n        *   -N₂⁺ (at C2) directs *meta* (to C4/C6, since C4 is blocked).\n        *   -SO₃H (at C4) directs *meta* (to C2/C6, since C2 is blocked).\n        *   All three groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position C6. This is another highly regioselective step. The product is **4-tert-butyl-2-diazonium-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    7.  **vii) & viii) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat & dilute H₂SO₄**: Heating in aqueous acid accomplishes two transformations simultaneously:\n        *   The diazonium group (-N₂⁺) at C2 is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n        *   The sulfonic acid blocking group (-SO₃H) at C4 is removed (desulfonation).\n        *   The resulting product is **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**.\n    8.  **ix) NaOH/EtBr**: Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol (-OH) is converted to an ethoxy group (-OEt). The product is **2-tert-butyl-6-nitro-1-ethoxybenzene**.\n    9.  **Final Naming**: According to IUPAC rules, the -OEt group gets priority, so its carbon is C1. Numbering towards the next substituent gives the t-butyl group at C2 and the nitro group at C3. The final name is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis sequence, while complex, is chemically sound and leads directly to the target molecule with high regioselectivity at each step. It is the only option that correctly navigates the challenging synthesis.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** An ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The groups are at positions 1, 2, and 3, respectively. This is a sterically crowded arrangement of three adjacent substituents.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are activating, *ortho, para*-directing groups.\n    *   -NO2 is a deactivating, *meta*-directing group.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The synthesis must overcome standard directing effects to place all three groups adjacent to one another. A simple sequence of electrophilic substitutions is unlikely to work, suggesting that a more sophisticated strategy involving blocking groups and/or functional group interconversions is necessary for a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\n### 2. Evaluation of the Proposed Options\n\nA careful analysis of the options reveals that most contain significant flaws, either by proposing chemically impossible steps or by leading to the wrong isomer.\n\n*   **Options leading to the wrong isomer:** Several analyses (e.g., for options C and D) show that plausible interpretations of their reaction sequences lead to isomers, such as 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene or 1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene. These pathways fail because they do not correctly position the bulky tert-butyl group at the start. For example, nitrating tert-butylbenzene first leads primarily to the *para* product, which sets up a 1,4-substitution pattern that is difficult to convert to the desired 1,2,3-pattern.\n\n*   **Options with chemically impossible steps:** Several options contain sequences that are not viable. For example, attempting to perform a diazotization reaction (using NaNO2/HCl) on a molecule that does not contain a primary amine is a common flaw identified in the candidate answers. Another identified flaw is attempting to perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on a strongly deactivated ring like nitrobenzene or on aniline without considering the side reaction with the Lewis acid catalyst.\n\n### 3. Identification of the Most Viable Strategy\n\nThe synthesis of a complex, sterically hindered molecule like the target often requires a **blocking group strategy**. The sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) is ideal for this purpose because it can be introduced to block a reactive position (typically the *para* position) and then removed later in the synthesis by heating with dilute acid (desulfonation).\n\nOption A is the only sequence that correctly employs this advanced strategy in a way that leads to the target molecule. Let's trace this successful pathway:\n\n1.  **i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ → tert-Butylbenzene.**\n    *   A standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add the tert-butyl group.\n\n2.  **ii) tert-Butylbenzene + SO₃/H₂SO₄ → 4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   Sulfonation. The bulky -tBu group directs the incoming -SO₃H group to the sterically accessible *para* position. This crucial step blocks the para position from further reaction.\n\n3.  **iii) 4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   Nitration. The -tBu group (an *o,p*-director) and the -SO₃H group (a *m*-director) both direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (C2). This results in a highly regioselective reaction.\n\n4.  **iv) ... + Fe/HCl → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   The nitro group is selectively reduced to a primary amine (-NH2).\n\n5.  **v) ... + NaNO₂/HCl → 4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   The primary amine is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺), a versatile intermediate.\n\n6.  **vi) ... + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 4-tert-butyl-2-diazonium-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   This is a second, non-obvious nitration. The directing effects of the three existing groups (-tBu, -N₂⁺, and -SO₃H) all align to direct the new nitro group to the only available position, C6. This is another highly specific step.\n\n7.  **vii) & viii) ... + H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat & dilute H₂SO₄ → 2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol.**\n    *   Heating in aqueous acid accomplishes two transformations simultaneously: the diazonium group at C2 is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH), and the sulfonic acid blocking group at C4 is removed.\n\n8.  **ix) ... + NaOH/EtBr → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.**\n    *   A standard Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is converted to an ethoxy ether. When naming this final molecule according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OEt group is C1, which makes the -tBu group at C2 and the -NO2 group at C3. This matches the target molecule precisely.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile several options contain plausible individual reactions, only the sequence in Option A provides a complete and chemically sound, albeit advanced, pathway to the specifically named target molecule in high yield. It correctly utilizes a blocking group strategy to control the regiochemistry, a necessary approach for this complex synthesis.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule and the Synthetic Challenge**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Structure:** It is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring. This means all three substituents are adjacent to each other.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   C1: -OEt (ethoxy group): A strong activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   C2: -tBu (tert-butyl group): A weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director. It is very bulky, which sterically hinders adjacent positions.\n    *   C3: -NO2 (nitro group): A strong deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **The Challenge:** Synthesizing a 1,2,3-substituted ring is difficult due to steric hindrance. Furthermore, the electronic properties present a conflict: the strong *ortho, para*-directing ethoxy group is *meta* to the nitro group. A simple sequence of electrophilic substitutions on a benzene ring will not produce this arrangement in high yield. This implies that a more complex strategy, likely involving functional group interconversions or the use of blocking groups, is necessary.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility**\n\nWe will examine each proposed reaction sequence for any steps that are chemically impossible, illogical, or would lead to very low yields.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   Steps (i) and (ii) correctly form aniline from benzene.\n    *   Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction is known to fail. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) is a strong acid that reacts with the basic amino group (-NH₂) of aniline. This forms a complex that deactivates the ring, preventing the alkylation from occurring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is not a viable synthetic route.\n\n*   **Option C:** `... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence correctly reduces a nitro group to an amine (iv) and then converts the amine to a diazonium salt (v).\n    *   Step (vi) attempts to nitrate the diazonium salt. Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates that are typically used immediately in reactions like Sandmeyer reactions or hydrolysis. Subjecting them to harsh nitrating conditions (concentrated nitric and sulfuric acids) is not a standard or feasible synthetic step; the salt would likely decompose violently.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C contains a chemically unfeasible step and is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ... viii) Fe/HCl ...`\n    *   This sequence is presented in a completely illogical order. For example, it attempts a diazotization reaction (step iv, `NaNO2/HCl`), which requires a primary amine, before the step that would form the amine (step viii, `Fe/HCl`).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is nonsensical as written and is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    *   Let's trace this path. Unlike the other options, this sequence does not contain any fundamentally impossible steps. Each step is a known chemical reaction.\n    *   i) Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n    *   ii) Nitration of tert-butylbenzene → **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** (this is the major product due to the steric bulk of the t-Bu group).\n    *   iii) Reduction → **p-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   iv) Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The t-Bu group at the para position is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the position *ortho* to the amine and *meta* to the t-Bu group. This yields **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**.\n    *   v) Diazotization → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenediazonium salt**.\n    *   vi) Hydrolysis → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n    *   vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis → **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   The final two steps (viii and ix) are sulfonation and desulfonation, which are redundant at the end of the synthesis.\n\n**3. Final Decision**\n\nThe analysis shows that Options B, C, and D contain chemically impossible or illogical steps, making them incorrect. Option A describes a coherent, multi-step synthesis where each transformation is valid.\n\nHowever, the product of the synthesis in Option A is **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, which is an *isomer* of the target molecule, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis indicates a flaw in the question itself—either the name of the target molecule is incorrect, or all the options are flawed. In a forced-choice scenario, the best answer is the one that represents a chemically sound and logical synthetic sequence, even if it doesn't lead to the exact named product. Option A is the only choice that meets this criterion. The other options are invalid on more fundamental grounds.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the most plausible intended answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nAnswering this question requires a detailed step-by-step analysis of each proposed synthetic route, paying close attention to the principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), including directing effects and steric hindrance, as well as the feasibility of each reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe target is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** -OEt (ethoxy), -tBu (tert-butyl), -NO2 (nitro).\n*   **Positions:** 1, 2, and 3 (all adjacent). This is a sterically crowded arrangement.\n*   **Relative Positions & Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt (strong o,p-director) and -tBu (o,p-director) are *ortho*.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 (m-director) are *ortho*.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta*.\nThe synthesis of such a 1,2,3-trisubstituted ring is non-trivial and standard EAS sequences are unlikely to work, suggesting a more complex strategy or a flaw in the question. The final step is almost certainly a Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr`) on the corresponding phenol, **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Option as Written**\n\n*   **Option A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   This sequence begins by forming nitrobenzene (i), then aniline (ii).\n    *   Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction is known to fail or give very poor yields because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) complexes with the basic amino group, strongly deactivating the ring towards electrophilic attack.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is not a viable high-yield synthesis.\n\n*   **Option D) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ... iv) NaNO2/HCl ... viii) Fe/HCl ...**\n    *   This sequence has an impossible order of reactions. Step (iv) is a diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine as the starting material. However, the amine is not formed until step (viii) (`Fe/HCl`).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is chemically illogical and incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    *   This sequence employs a blocking group strategy, which is a sound approach for complex substitutions. Steps (i) through (v) generate a diazonium salt (`4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid`).\n    *   Step (vi) attempts to nitrate this diazonium salt. Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable intermediates. Reacting them with a harsh nitrating mixture (HNO3/H2SO4) is not a standard, safe, or predictable synthetic transformation. They are typically used immediately in replacement (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis) or coupling reactions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C contains a chemically unsound and highly improbable step, making it an incorrect choice.\n\n*   **Option B) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4**\n    *   Let's trace this sequence:\n        1.  `i)`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n        2.  `ii)`: Nitration → **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** (major product due to sterics).\n        3.  `iii)`: Reduction → **p-tert-butylaniline**.\n        4.  `iv)`: Nitration of the aniline. The amino group (protonated to -NH3+ in acid) is a meta-director, and the t-butyl group is an ortho,para-director. Both direct the incoming nitro group to the position ortho to the amine and meta to the t-butyl group, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**.\n        5.  `v)`: Diazotization → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenediazonium salt**.\n        6.  `vi)`: Hydrolysis → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n        7.  `vii)`: Williamson Ether Synthesis → **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   This sequence of reactions (i-vii) is entirely composed of standard, chemically plausible transformations. It represents a valid synthesis.\n    *   However, the product is an isomer of the target molecule, not the target itself. The final two steps (viii, ix) are redundant and do not alter the product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Among the four options, Option B is the only one that describes a chemically coherent and plausible sequence of reactions from start to finish. The other options contain steps that are either impossible, fail, or are not synthetically viable. The fact that Option B leads to an isomer indicates a flaw in the question itself (likely an incorrect name for the target product). In a multiple-choice context where one must select the \"best\" answer, the option that is free of fundamental chemical errors is the correct choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenge**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** An ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene, meaning all three groups are adjacent. This is a sterically crowded and synthetically challenging arrangement.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho, para*-directors (activating).\n    *   -NO2 is a *meta*-director (deactivating).\n*   **Key Relationships:** The -OEt and -tBu groups are *ortho* to each other, as are the -tBu and -NO2 groups. The strong activating -OEt group is *meta* to the -NO2 group, which is an arrangement that is very difficult to achieve by direct nitration of the corresponding ether. This strongly suggests that a complex, multi-step strategy involving blocking groups and/or functional group interconversions is required for a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Candidate Options**\n\nWe will analyze each option for chemical feasibility. The order of reactions is critical.\n\n*   **Option D:** This pathway starts by making 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene (the major product of nitrating tert-butylbenzene), which is then converted to 4-tert-butylaniline. A second nitration would occur *ortho* to the amino group, leading to 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline. Subsequent steps (diazotization, hydrolysis, etherification) would yield **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. This is an isomer of the target molecule, but it is not the correct product, and the final steps cannot induce the necessary rearrangement. Therefore, Option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B and Option C:** These options contain sequences with fundamental chemical errors. For example, Option B as written (`...ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4...`) is illogical. Option C as written (`...iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl...`) attempts a diazotization reaction (NaNO2/HCl) on a sulfonic acid intermediate that does not contain an amino group. Such steps are chemically impossible. Therefore, Options B and C are incorrect.\n\n**3. Detailed Analysis of Option A**\n\nThis option presents the most complex but also the most chemically sound pathway. It utilizes a sulfonic acid blocking group, a classic strategy for achieving difficult substitution patterns.\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Forms **tert-butylbenzene**.\n*   **ii) SO3/H2SO4:** Sulfonation. The bulky -tBu group directs the -SO3H group to the sterically accessible *para* position, forming **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This blocks the para position from further reaction.\n*   **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration. The -tBu group (an *o,p*-director) and the -SO3H group (a *m*-director) both direct the incoming -NO2 group to the same position (C2). This is a highly regioselective step that yields **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This correctly establishes the required *ortho* relationship between the t-butyl and nitro groups.\n*   **iv) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amine, yielding **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization of the amine to form a diazonium salt: **4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **vi) HNO3/H2SO4:** This is the key, non-obvious step: a second nitration. On the intermediate from step (v), all existing substituents (-tBu at C1, -N2+ at C2, -SO3H at C4) direct the incoming nitro group to the C6 position. This is another highly regioselective step, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-diazonium-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** Heating in aqueous acid accomplishes two transformations simultaneously:\n    1.  The diazonium group (-N2+) at C2 is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    2.  The sulfonic acid blocking group (-SO3H) at C4 is removed (desulfonation).\n    The product is **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**.\n*   **viii) dilute H2SO4:** This step is redundant, likely ensuring the completion of the desulfonation.\n*   **ix) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol (-OH) is converted to an ethoxy group (-OEt). The product is **2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-6-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Final Naming:** According to IUPAC rules, the -OEt group receives the highest priority, so its carbon is C1. Numbering towards the next substituent gives the t-butyl group at C2 and the nitro group at C3. The final product name is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe sequence of reactions in Option A is the only one that provides a chemically sound, high-yield pathway to the exact target molecule. It correctly employs a sophisticated strategy involving a blocking group and multiple directed substitutions to overcome the steric and electronic challenges of the synthesis.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenge\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene** from benzene.\n\n*   **Structure:** The benzene ring has three adjacent substituents:\n    *   C1: -OEt (ethoxy)\n    *   C2: -tBu (tert-butyl)\n    *   C3: -NO2 (nitro)\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are activating, *ortho, para*-directing groups.\n    *   -NO2 is a deactivating, *meta*-directing group.\n*   **Challenge:** This 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded and electronically difficult to achieve. The *meta* relationship between the strong activating group (-OEt) and the deactivating group (-NO2) is particularly challenging and suggests that a simple sequence of electrophilic substitutions will not work. A more sophisticated strategy involving functional group interconversions and/or the use of blocking groups is almost certainly required.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Candidate Options\n\nLet's analyze each option for chemical feasibility. A common approach is to first identify any sequences with fundamentally impossible steps.\n\n*   **Option B:** This sequence includes `... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`. Step (v) correctly forms a diazonium salt from an amine. However, step (vi) attempts to nitrate this unstable diazonium salt intermediate under harsh conditions. This is not a standard or viable reaction. Diazonium salts are typically used immediately for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer or hydrolysis). This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence includes `... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`. Step (iv) attempts to perform a diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), but the substrate at that point is a sulfonic acid, not a primary aromatic amine. This step is chemically impossible. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence starts with nitration, then reduction to aniline. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction is known to fail or be very low-yield because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring towards alkylation. This is not a \"high-yield\" pathway. This option is incorrect.\n\n### 3. Detailed Analysis of Option A\n\nSince options B, C, and D contain clear chemical flaws, let's analyze Option A in detail. This sequence is complex but does not contain any fundamentally impossible steps. It notably includes sulfonation and desulfonation, a hallmark of a blocking group strategy.\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene.\n    *   Product: **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n\n*   **ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄:** Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky -tBu group is an *o,p*-director, but sterics strongly favor substitution at the *para* position.\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This blocks the para position.\n\n*   **iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration. The -tBu group directs *ortho* (to C2), and the -SO₃H group directs *meta* (also to C2). The directing effects are cooperative.\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n*   **iv) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amine.\n    *   Product: **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n*   **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** Diazotization of the primary amine.\n    *   Intermediate: **4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n*   **vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** A second nitration. This is an unusual but critical step. Let's analyze the directing effects on the diazonium salt intermediate:\n    *   The -tBu group (at C4) is an *o,p*-director, directing to C3 and C5.\n    *   The -N₂⁺ group (at C2) is a strong *m*-director, directing to C4 (blocked) and C6.\n    *   The -SO₃H group (at C1) is a *m*-director, directing to C3 and C5.\n    *   This is a complex case. However, a more careful analysis (as performed by agent 8) shows that if we number with tBu at C1, N₂⁺ at C2, and SO₃H at C4, all three groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same available position, C6.\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-diazonium-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n*   **vii) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat:** Heating in aqueous acid causes two reactions:\n    1.  Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt (-N₂⁺ is replaced by -OH).\n    2.  Desulfonation (-SO₃H is replaced by -H).\n    *   Product: **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**.\n\n*   **viii) dilute H₂SO₄:** This step is redundant, likely ensuring completion of the previous step.\n\n*   **ix) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson ether synthesis. The phenolic -OH is converted to an -OEt group.\n    *   Product: **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-6-nitrobenzene**.\n\n*   **Final IUPAC Naming:** According to IUPAC rules, the -OEt group receives the highest priority for numbering.\n    *   The carbon with -OEt is C1.\n    *   The adjacent carbon with -tBu is C2.\n    *   The next carbon with -NO₂ is C3.\n    *   The final name is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis sequence, while complex and containing an uncommon step, is chemically sound and leads precisely to the target molecule. It is the only option that does not contain a fundamental chemical error.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a careful step-by-step analysis of each proposed pathway is necessary. The target molecule has a 1,2,3-substitution pattern, which is sterically crowded and often requires a sophisticated synthetic strategy to control the position of the substituents (regiochemistry).\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents:\n    *   C1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strong activator and *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   C2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu), a weak activator and *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   C3: Nitro group (-NO2), a strong deactivator and *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The arrangement is difficult to achieve via simple electrophilic aromatic substitution. The *meta* relationship between the powerful activating -OEt group and the -NO2 group is particularly challenging, suggesting that a simple nitration of an ethoxy-containing precursor is not the final step. This points towards a strategy involving blocking groups or the conversion of functional groups to alter their directing effects.\n\n### **2. Evaluation of the Candidate Options**\n\nA critical evaluation of the options reveals that most contain fundamental chemical errors or lead to incorrect products.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence starts by making 4-tert-butylaniline, then nitrating it. The directing effects of the -NH3+ (meta-director) and -tBu (ortho,para-director) groups would indeed lead to **4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. Subsequent steps (diazotization, hydrolysis, etherification) would produce **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**, which is an isomer of the target molecule, not the target itself. The final sulfonation/desulfonation steps are illogical and would not cause the necessary rearrangement.\n*   **Options B and C:** These options contain chemically impossible steps in the order they are written. For example, they attempt to perform a diazotization reaction (`NaNO2/HCl`) on an intermediate that does not possess a primary amine (-NH2) group. Therefore, these sequences are invalid.\n\n### **3. Detailed Analysis of Option A**\n\nOption A presents a complex but chemically sound pathway that correctly utilizes a blocking group strategy and exploits the additive directing effects of multiple substituents to achieve the difficult 1,2,3-pattern.\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene produces **tert-butylbenzene**.\n*   **ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄:** Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the large steric bulk of the t-butyl group, the sulfonic acid group (-SO₃H) is directed to the *para* position, forming **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This step effectively \"blocks\" the reactive para position.\n*   **iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of the blocked intermediate. The t-butyl group (an *o,p*-director) and the sulfonic acid group (a *m*-director) both direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (C2). This highly regioselective step yields **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **iv) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is selectively reduced to a primary amine, yielding **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** The primary amine is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺), forming **4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** This is a second, crucial nitration step. On the intermediate from step (v), all three existing substituents (-tBu, -N₂⁺, and -SO₃H) cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to the only remaining activated position, C6. This results in the formation of **4-tert-butyl-2-diazonium-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **vii) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat:** Heating in aqueous acid accomplishes two transformations simultaneously:\n    1.  The diazonium salt at C2 is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    2.  The sulfonic acid blocking group at C4 is removed (desulfonation).\n    The product is **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**.\n*   **viii) dilute H₂SO₄:** This step is redundant and likely ensures the complete desulfonation from the previous step.\n*   **ix) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis is performed. The phenolic -OH group is converted to an ethoxy (-OEt) group. The product is **1-tert-butyl-2-ethoxy-6-nitrobenzene**.\n\nFinally, according to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the ring is numbered to give the highest priority functional group (the ether) the lowest possible number. This renumbers the substituents as follows: -OEt at C1, -tBu at C2, and -NO2 at C3. The final product is indeed **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis detailed analysis shows that Option A, despite its complexity and an unusual nitration step, is the only chemically correct sequence that leads to the desired product in high yield.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reactions for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Strategy\n*   **Target Molecule**: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Substitution Pattern**: The benzene ring has three adjacent substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3.\n    *   C1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strong activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   C2: Tert-butyl group (-tBu), a bulky, activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   C3: Nitro group (-NO2), a strong deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Challenge**: Synthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted ring is difficult due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects. For instance, the strong activating -OEt group is *meta* to the -NO2 group, an arrangement not easily achieved by direct nitration of a ring containing an ethoxy group. This complexity strongly suggests that a sophisticated strategy involving blocking groups and multiple functional group interconversions is required.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Plausibility of Each Option\n\nA valid synthesis must follow logical chemical principles. We can eliminate options that contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps.\n\n*   **Option B**: This sequence involves nitrating tert-butylbenzene (step ii), which would primarily yield the *para* isomer (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene). Starting with a 1,4-disubstituted compound makes it impossible to achieve the desired 1,2,3-pattern in high yield. This option is strategically flawed from the beginning for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n*   **Option C**: This sequence attempts a diazotization reaction (step v, `NaNO2/HCl`) on an intermediate that does not contain a primary amine (-NH2) group. This is a chemically impossible step. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D**: This sequence involves nitrating p-tert-butylaniline (step iv). The resulting product is 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline. Following the subsequent steps (diazotization, hydrolysis, etherification) leads to the synthesis of **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, which is an isomer of the target molecule, not the target itself. The final two steps (sulfonation and desulfonation) are illogical and would not cause the necessary skeletal rearrangement. Therefore, this option does not lead to the correct product.\n\n### 3. Detailed Analysis of Option A\n\nThis leaves Option A as the only remaining possibility. Let's trace its reaction path step-by-step to verify its validity.\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene yields **tert-butylbenzene**.\n*   **ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄**: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, the sulfonic acid group (-SO₃H) is directed to the *para* position. This forms **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**, which acts as a \"blocking group\" to prevent reactions at the para position.\n*   **iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. The t-butyl group (an *o,p*-director) and the sulfonic acid group (a *m*-director) both direct the incoming nitro group to the same position: C2. This is a highly regioselective step that yields **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This correctly establishes the crucial *ortho* relationship between the future t-butyl and nitro groups.\n*   **iv) Fe/HCl**: The nitro group is reduced to a primary amine, yielding **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **v) NaNO₂/HCl**: The primary amine is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺), forming **4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: This is a second nitration step. While nitrating a diazonium salt is unusual, the directing effects of all three existing groups (-tBu, -N₂⁺, -SO₃H) converge to strongly direct the incoming nitro group to the only available activated position, C6. This forms **4-tert-butyl-2-diazonium-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **vii) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat**: Heating in aqueous acid accomplishes two transformations simultaneously:\n    1.  The diazonium salt at C2 is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    2.  The sulfonic acid blocking group at C4 is removed (desulfonation).\n    The product is **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**.\n*   **viii) dilute H₂SO₄**: This step is redundant and ensures the completion of the previous step.\n*   **ix) NaOH/EtBr**: Williamson ether synthesis. The phenolic -OH group is converted to an ethoxy (-OEt) group. The product is **2-tert-butyl-6-nitro-1-ethoxybenzene**.\n\n**Final Check**: Let's assign the IUPAC name to the final product. The ethoxy group has priority, so its carbon is C1. Numbering towards the next substituent gives the t-butyl group position C2 and the nitro group position C3. The final name is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**, which exactly matches the target molecule.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile containing a non-standard step, the sequence in Option A is the only one that is strategically sound and leads to the correct 1,2,3-trisubstituted product. It correctly employs a blocking group strategy to control regiochemistry and follows a logical series of functional group transformations. The other options are invalidated by impossible chemical steps or lead to incorrect isomers.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, considering all careful points to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Structure:** It is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Substituent Properties:**\n    *   -OEt: Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -tBu: Weak activator, *ortho, para*-director, very bulky.\n    *   -NO2: Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded and electronically complex to achieve. A simple sequence of substitutions is unlikely to work. A high-yield synthesis will almost certainly require a more advanced strategy, such as using a \"blocking group\" that can be added to direct other substituents and then removed later.\n\n### 2. Constraint-Based Pruning of Options\n\nWe will evaluate each option against fundamental chemical principles to prune the search space.\n\n*   **Constraint 1: Feasibility of Friedel-Crafts Reactions.**\n    *   The Friedel-Crafts alkylation (using `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`) is an electrophilic aromatic substitution that fails on strongly deactivated rings (like nitrobenzene) and reacts with basic groups (like aniline).\n    *   **Option D** starts with `i) HNO3/H2SO4` (forms nitrobenzene), then `ii) Fe/HCl` (forms aniline), and then `iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`. Attempting a Friedel-Crafts reaction on aniline is not a viable, high-yield process because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring.\n    *   **Result:** Option D is eliminated.\n\n*   **Constraint 2: Logical Order of Functional Group Interconversions.**\n    *   Certain reaction sequences must follow a specific order. For example, to convert a nitro group to a different substituent via a diazonium salt, the order must be: Reduction (-NO₂ → -NH₂) followed by Diazotization (-NH₂ → -N₂⁺).\n    *   **Option C** has `iv) NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization) listed before `viii) Fe/HCl` (reduction). It is impossible to perform a diazotization reaction before the amine has been formed.\n    *   **Result:** Option C is eliminated.\n\n*   **Constraint 3: Correct Regiochemical Outcome.**\n    *   We must trace the substitution pattern to see if it leads to the 1,2,3-target isomer.\n    *   **Option B** has the sequence: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` → tert-butylbenzene. `ii) HNO3/H2SO4` → nitration. Due to the bulk of the -tBu group, the major product is **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** (a 1,4-disubstituted ring). Subsequent steps (`iii) Fe/HCl` → p-tert-butylaniline; `iv) HNO3/H2SO4` → 4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline) will build upon this 1,4-pattern. This pathway will ultimately lead to an isomer like **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**, not the desired 1,2,3-isomer.\n    *   **Result:** Option B is eliminated as it cannot produce the correct isomer in high yield.\n\n### 3. Detailed Analysis of the Remaining Option (Option A)\n\nOnly Option A remains. We must verify if its complex sequence is chemically sound and leads to the correct product.\n\n*   **A) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr**\n\n1.  **i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl₃ → tert-Butylbenzene.** (Standard alkylation).\n2.  **ii) ... + SO₃/H₂SO₄ → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.** (Sulfonation. The bulky -tBu group directs the -SO₃H group to the *para* position. This is a classic \"blocking group\" strategy).\n3.  **iii) ... + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.** (Nitration. The -tBu group directs *ortho* and the -SO₃H group directs *meta*. Both direct the incoming -NO₂ group to position 2. This is a highly selective step that correctly establishes the *ortho* relationship between the eventual -tBu and one -NO₂ group).\n4.  **iv) ... + Fe/HCl → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.** (Standard reduction of the nitro group).\n5.  **v) ... + NaNO₂/HCl → 4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid.** (Standard diazotization of the amine).\n6.  **vi) ... + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 4-tert-butyl-2-diazonium-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.** (This is a second nitration on a complex intermediate. Let's check the directing effects: the -tBu at C1, -N₂⁺ at C2, and -SO₃H at C4 all direct the incoming -NO₂ group to the same available position, C6. This is a plausible, highly specific reaction).\n7.  **vii) & viii) ... + H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat & dilute H₂SO₄ → 2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol.** (Heating in aqueous acid accomplishes two things: 1. The diazonium group at C2 is replaced by an -OH group. 2. The sulfonic acid blocking group at C4 is removed (desulfonation). The product is 2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol).\n8.  **ix) ... + NaOH/EtBr → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.** (Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol (-OH) to an ethoxy ether (-OEt). We must now name the final product according to IUPAC rules. The -OEt group gets priority for numbering (C1). Numbering towards the next substituent gives the -tBu group position C2 and the -NO₂ group position C3).\n\n**Final Product Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n**Pass/Fail:** The sequence in Option A, while complex, is chemically sound and leads directly to the target molecule.\n\n### Final Decision\n\n*   **Option A:** A complex but chemically valid pathway that correctly uses a blocking group strategy to produce the target molecule. **PASS**\n*   **Option B:** Leads to the wrong isomer. **FAIL**\n*   **Option C:** Contains an impossible reaction order. **FAIL**\n*   **Option D:** Contains an unfeasible reaction step. **FAIL**\n\nThe only viable sequence is Option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenge\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** An ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** 1, 2, 3 (all adjacent). This is a sterically crowded arrangement.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are activating, *ortho, para*-directing groups.\n    *   -NO2 is a deactivating, *meta*-directing group.\n*   **Key Relationships:**\n    *   The activating -OEt group is *meta* to the deactivating -NO2 group.\n    *   The bulky -tBu group is *ortho* to both the -OEt and -NO2 groups.\n\nA simple electrophilic aromatic substitution strategy will not work. For example, nitrating 2-tert-butylethoxybenzene would place the nitro group at the 4 or 6 positions, not the 3 position. This indicates that a more sophisticated strategy, likely involving **blocking groups** and/or **functional group interconversions**, is required to control the regiochemistry.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Options Based on Chemical Logic\n\nThe final step is almost certainly a Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr`) to form the ethoxy group from a phenol. This means the immediate precursor must be **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. The core of the problem is synthesizing this specific phenol.\n\nLet's evaluate each option for fundamental flaws:\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence fails at step (iii). It attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing the reaction. This is not a viable high-yield pathway.\n\n*   **Option C:** `... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ; ... viii) Fe/HCl ...`\n    This sequence is chemically illogical. It attempts a diazotization reaction (step iv) *before* the necessary amine has been formed (step viii). This is impossible.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This sequence starts by nitrating tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, the major product is the *para* isomer (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene). Following this pathway with the major isomer will ultimately lead to **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**, which is an isomer of the target but not the correct product. Starting with the minor *ortho* isomer from step (ii) would violate the \"high-yield\" requirement of the question.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This is the only option that employs a **blocking group strategy**, which is the classic method for solving such complex regiochemical problems. Let's trace the pathway carefully, as interpreted by the most successful analyses.\n\n### 3. Detailed Analysis of the Correct Pathway (Option A)\n\n1.  **i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl₃ → tert-Butylbenzene.** Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n2.  **ii) Sulfonation → 4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid.** The bulky t-butyl group directs the incoming -SO₃H group to the sterically accessible *para* position. This \"blocks\" the para position from further reaction.\n3.  **iii) Nitration → 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.** Now, nitration occurs. The t-butyl group directs *ortho* (to C2), and the sulfonic acid group directs *meta* (also to C2). Both groups cooperatively direct the nitro group to a single position, making this a highly regioselective step. This correctly establishes the *ortho* relationship between the t-butyl group and a precursor to the ethoxy group.\n4.  **iv) Reduction (Fe/HCl) → 2-Amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group.\n5.  **v) Diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl) → Diazonium salt.** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺).\n6.  **vi) Second Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) → 4-tert-Butyl-2-diazonium-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.** This is an unusual but plausible step. The directing effects of all three existing groups (-tBu, -N₂⁺, -SO₃H) converge to direct the new nitro group to the only remaining activated position, C6. This establishes the final 1,2,3-relationship between the substituent precursors.\n7.  **vii) & viii) Hydrolysis and Desulfonation (H₃O⁺/Heat, dilute H₂SO₄) → 2-tert-Butyl-6-nitrophenol.** Heating in aqueous acid accomplishes two things: the diazonium salt at C2 is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group (-OH), and the sulfonic acid blocking group at C4 is removed (desulfonation).\n8.  **ix) Ether Synthesis (NaOH/EtBr) → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.** The phenol is converted to an ethoxy ether. When the resulting molecule (1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-6-nitrobenzene) is named according to IUPAC rules, it is correctly named **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis sequence is chemically sound, highly strategic, and the only one that leads to the correct target molecule in high yield.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the arguments from the provided answers to arrive at the most logical conclusion.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule and the Synthetic Challenge\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The molecule has three adjacent substituents (a 1,2,3-pattern) on the benzene ring:\n    *   C1: -OEt (ethoxy)\n    *   C2: -tBu (tert-butyl)\n    *   C3: -NO2 (nitro)\n*   **Directing Effects:** The directing effects of these groups for electrophilic aromatic substitution are crucial:\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are activating, *ortho, para*-directing groups.\n    *   -NO2 is a deactivating, *meta*-directing group.\n*   **The Challenge:** Achieving a 1,2,3-substitution pattern is difficult, especially when it involves placing a group between two existing substituents. The *meta* relationship between the strong *ortho, para*-directing ethoxy group and the nitro group is particularly hard to achieve directly, suggesting a complex synthesis involving functional group interconversions or blocking groups. The question's requirement for a \"high-yield\" synthesis makes pathways relying on the separation of minor isomers unlikely.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\n\nA robust method for solving such problems is to first eliminate options that contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence begins with nitration, then reduction to aniline, followed by Friedel-Crafts alkylation (`iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`). Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on anilines because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. This makes Option C an invalid pathway.\n\n*   **Option B:** The sequence as written is `...iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4...`. Step (v) correctly forms a diazonium salt from an amine. However, step (vi) attempts to nitrate this unstable diazonium salt with a harsh nitrating mixture. This is not a standard or viable reaction; the diazonium salt would decompose. Therefore, Option B is chemically invalid as written.\n\n*   **Option D:** The sequence of reagents is completely jumbled. For example, it performs diazotization (`iv) NaNO2/HCl`) before the amine is even formed (`viii) Fe/HCl`). This sequence is not chemically logical and must be discarded.\n\n*   **Option A:** This is the only option remaining. Let's trace its reaction path to see if it is plausible.\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Plausible)\n    2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, the major product is **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**. This is a high-yield step. (Plausible)\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group. This forms **p-tert-butylaniline**. (Plausible)\n    4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. The t-butyl group is an *o,p*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (the position *meta* to -NH3+ and *ortho* to -tBu). This yields **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**. (Plausible and regiochemically sound).\n    5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization of the amine to form a diazonium salt. (Plausible)\n    6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**. (Plausible)\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol to an ether, yielding **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. (Plausible)\n\n### 3. Final Conclusion\n\nThe sequence of reactions (i) through (vii) in **Option A** describes a coherent, high-yield, and chemically plausible synthesis. However, it produces **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, which is an *isomer* of the target molecule, not the target molecule itself. The final two steps listed in Option A (`viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`) are sulfonation and desulfonation, which are redundant and would not cause the major skeletal rearrangement needed to convert the product into the desired target.\n\nThis indicates a fundamental flaw in the question itself—either the name of the target molecule is incorrect, or all the options are wrong. However, in a multiple-choice context, the task is to select the *best possible answer*.\n\n*   Options B, C, and D are invalid because they contain chemically impossible or illogical steps.\n*   Option A describes a complete, logical, and high-yield synthesis of a closely related trisubstituted benzene isomer. It is the only option that is free of fundamental chemical errors in its core sequence.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the most plausible intended answer, assuming an error in the problem statement.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer based on the provided candidate responses.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenge\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n*   **Structure:** The molecule has three adjacent substituents on a benzene ring (a 1,2,3-substitution pattern).\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Substituent Properties (Directing Effects for Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution):**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are activating, *ortho, para*-directing groups.\n    *   -NO2 is a deactivating, *meta*-directing group.\n*   **The Core Challenge:** This specific 1,2,3-pattern is sterically crowded and electronically difficult to achieve. A simple sequence of substitutions will not work. For example, the strong activating -OEt group is *meta* to the -NO2 group, an arrangement that cannot be formed by directly nitrating a ring with an -OEt group. This indicates that a sophisticated strategy involving **blocking groups** and/or **functional group interconversions** is necessary for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n### 2. Evaluation of the Proposed Options by Eliminating Flawed Pathways\n\nA reliable method is to first identify and eliminate options that contain chemically impossible or illogical steps.\n\n*   **Option C: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`**\n    This sequence fails at step (iii). It attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline (formed in steps i and ii). This reaction is not viable for a high-yield synthesis because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring towards electrophilic substitution. **Therefore, Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`**\n    This option is nonsensically written with duplicate step numbers. More importantly, it attempts a diazotization reaction (`NaNO2/HCl`) on an intermediate that does not contain a primary amine (-NH₂) group. This step is chemically impossible. **Therefore, Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option D: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`**\n    This sequence is composed of plausible reactions, but it does not lead to the target product.\n    1.  Steps (i) and (ii) produce primarily *p*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group.\n    2.  Following the sequence through reduction, a second nitration, diazotization, hydrolysis, and etherification leads to an isomer, **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n    3.  This pathway establishes a 1,2,4-substitution pattern, which cannot be converted to the desired 1,2,3-pattern. **Therefore, Option D is incorrect.**\n\n### 3. Detailed Verification of the Correct Pathway (Option A)\n\nSince options B, C, and D are flawed, we must verify that Option A provides a chemically sound and successful route. This sequence correctly employs a blocking group strategy.\n\n1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Forms **tert-butylbenzene**.\n2.  **ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄:** Sulfonation. The bulky -tBu group directs the -SO₃H group to the sterically accessible *para* position, forming **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This crucial step **blocks** the para position.\n3.  **iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration. The -tBu group (an *o,p*-director) and the -SO₃H group (a *m*-director) both direct the incoming -NO₂ group to the same position (C2). This is a highly regioselective step yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n4.  **iv) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to a primary amine, yielding **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n5.  **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** The amine is converted to a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺), forming **4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n6.  **vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** A second nitration. This is an advanced but plausible step. The directing effects of all three existing groups (-tBu, -N₂⁺, and -SO₃H) cooperatively direct the new -NO₂ group to the only remaining available position, C6.\n7.  **vii) & viii) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat & dilute H₂SO₄:** Heating in aqueous acid accomplishes two key transformations simultaneously: the diazonium group at C2 is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group (-OH), and the sulfonic acid blocking group at C4 is removed (desulfonation). The product is **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**.\n8.  **ix) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol's -OH group to an -OEt group.\n9.  **Final Product Check:** The resulting molecule is 1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-6-nitrobenzene. According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the ring is numbered to give the highest priority functional group (the ether) the lowest number. This makes the -OEt group C1, the -tBu group C2, and the -NO₂ group C3. The final name is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**, which exactly matches the target molecule.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe sequence of reactions in Option A is the only one that provides a complete, chemically sound, and strategically correct pathway to the target molecule. It correctly uses a blocking group to control the regiochemistry, which is essential for this complex synthesis.\n\n<<<A>>>"

It was therefore pruned for producing the incorrect product.\n    *   **Hypothesis B** was pruned for chemical infeasibility. It proposed a diazotization reaction (step iv) on an intermediate that lacked the necessary primary amine group.\n    *   **Hypothesis D** was also pruned for chemical infeasibility. It proposed a Friedel-Crafts alkylation (step iii) on aniline, a reaction that does not proceed in high yield because the Lewis acid catalyst deactivates the ring.\n\n2.  **Surviving Candidate:**\n    *   **Hypothesis C** was the only route to survive the pruning process. The analysis showed that it correctly employs a sophisticated blocking group strategy (sulfonation followed by later desulfonation) to achieve the difficult 1,2,3-substitution pattern. While one step (nitration of a diazonium salt) is chemically unusual, the overall sequence is the only one that is strategically sound and leads to the correct target molecule.\n\nThe script concluded that Option C is the only viable choice.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer from the provided options.\n\n### 1. Deconstruction of the Target Molecule\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Parent Ring:** Benzene\n*   **Substituents and Positions:**\n    *   C1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   C2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   C3: Nitro group (-NO₂)\n*   **Key Structural Features:**\n    *   This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted (three adjacent groups) benzene ring.\n    *   The structure is sterically crowded due to the bulky tert-butyl group being positioned between the other two substituents.\n    *   The directing effects of the groups are in conflict. For example, the strongly activating -OEt group is *meta* to the -NO₂ group, an arrangement that is very difficult to achieve by direct nitration of an ethoxy-substituted benzene ring.\n\nThese features strongly indicate that a simple, linear sequence of electrophilic substitutions will not work. A more sophisticated strategy, likely involving blocking groups and/or functional group interconversions, is necessary to control the regiochemistry and achieve a high yield.\n\n### 2. Evaluation of the Proposed Options\n\nWe must analyze each sequence of reactions for chemical feasibility and its ability to produce the target isomer.\n\n*   **Options with Fundamental Flaws:**\n    *   **Option B:** As noted by several candidate answers, this sequence attempts to use a diazotization reagent (`NaNO₂/HCl`) on an intermediate that does not contain a primary amine (-NH₂) group. This is a chemically impossible step, invalidating the entire sequence.\n    *   **Option C:** This option also contains impossible steps. Depending on the exact interpretation, it either attempts diazotization without an amine or tries to perform an unstable reaction on a diazonium salt (e.g., sulfonation). This sequence is not chemically viable.\n\n*   **Analysis of Option D:**\n    *   This sequence begins with Friedel-Crafts alkylation to form tert-butylbenzene, followed by nitration. Due to the steric bulk of the -tBu group, this nitration overwhelmingly produces the *para* isomer (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene).\n    *   Subsequent steps (reduction to an amine, another nitration, diazotization, hydrolysis to a phenol, and etherification) are individually plausible.\n    *   However, as correctly traced by multiple candidate answers (e.g., 7, 9), this pathway leads to **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene** or a similar isomer. It does not produce the target 1,2,3-substituted product. The final two steps (sulfonation/desulfonation) are illogical and would not induce the necessary skeletal rearrangement. Therefore, Option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Analysis of Option A:**\n    *   This sequence is the most complex but also the most strategically sound. It is the only option that correctly employs a sulfonic acid (-SO₃H) as a removable blocking group, which is the classic strategy for synthesizing complex isomers.\n    *   Let's trace the path as detailed by the most thorough analyses (e.g., Answer 8):\n        1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Forms **tert-butylbenzene**.\n        2.  **ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄:** Sulfonation occurs at the sterically accessible *para* position, forming **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This blocks the para position from further reaction.\n        3.  **iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration. Both the -tBu group (*ortho*-directing) and the -SO₃H group (*meta*-directing) direct the incoming -NO₂ group to the same position (C2). This is a highly regioselective step yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n        4.  **iv) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is reduced to an amine, yielding **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n        5.  **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** The amine is converted to a diazonium salt.\n        6.  **vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** A second nitration occurs. At this stage, all three existing groups (-tBu, -N₂⁺, -SO₃H) direct the new nitro group to the only remaining open position (C6). This is another highly specific step.\n        7.  **vii) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat:** Heating in aqueous acid accomplishes two crucial transformations simultaneously: the diazonium salt at C2 is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group (-OH), and the sulfonic acid blocking group at C4 is removed (desulfonation). The product is **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**.\n        8.  **viii) dilute H₂SO₄:** This is a redundant step, likely ensuring the completion of step vii.\n        9.  **ix) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol into an ether. The -OH group is converted to an -OEt group.\n    *   **Final Product Check:** The resulting molecule has -OEt, -tBu, and -NO₂ groups. By IUPAC naming rules, the carbon with the -OEt group is C1. Numbering towards the next substituent gives the -tBu group at C2 and the -NO₂ group at C3. The final product is indeed **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile complex and containing an uncommon step (nitration of a diazonium salt), the reaction sequence in Option A is the only one that is chemically sound and leads precisely to the named target molecule. The strategy of using a blocking group is essential for this synthesis, and only Option A employs it correctly. Options B and C contain impossible chemical steps, and Option D leads to the wrong isomer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents**: An ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   **Positions**: The groups are on adjacent carbons, C1, C2, and C3. This is a sterically crowded 1,2,3-substitution pattern.\n*   **Directing Effects**:\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are activating, *ortho, para*-directing groups.\n    *   -NO2 is a deactivating, *meta*-directing group.\n*   **Key Relationships**: The -OEt (strong *o,p*-director) is *meta* to the -NO2 group. This is difficult to achieve via direct nitration of a corresponding phenol or ethoxybenzene, suggesting a more complex strategy is required.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Plausibility of Each Option\n\nA high-yield synthesis of such a complex molecule requires careful control of regiochemistry. We will evaluate each option for chemical feasibility.\n\n*   **Option A**: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence begins by forming aniline (steps i and ii). Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. This reaction is not feasible because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the aromatic ring towards electrophilic substitution. Therefore, **Option A is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option B**: `... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    This sequence attempts to use a diazotization reagent (`NaNO2/HCl`) in step (iv). However, the intermediate produced after step (iii) is a sulfonic acid of a nitro compound; it does not contain the primary aromatic amine (-NH2) required for diazotization. Therefore, **Option B is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option D**: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This sequence is composed of plausible reactions, but it does not lead to the target product.\n    *   Steps (i) and (ii) produce primarily *p*-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.\n    *   Following the sequence through reduction (iii), a second nitration (iv), diazotization (v), hydrolysis (vi), and etherification (vii) correctly leads to the synthesis of **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   This is an isomer of the target molecule. The final steps (viii and ix) involve sulfonation and desulfonation, which cannot induce the necessary rearrangement from the C4 position to the highly hindered C2 position. Therefore, **Option D is incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option C**: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ; ix) NaOH/EtBr`\n    This sequence outlines a sophisticated and correct pathway using a blocking group strategy.\n    *   **i-ii**: Benzene is alkylated to form tert-butylbenzene, and then the *para* position is blocked by sulfonation, yielding **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   **iii**: Nitration occurs. The -tBu group (*o,p*-director) and the -SO3H group (*m*-director) both direct the incoming -NO2 group to position 2, giving **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid** with high regioselectivity.\n    *   **iv**: The nitro group is reduced to an amine (-NH2).\n    *   **v**: The amine is converted to a diazonium salt (-N2+). The intermediate is **4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    *   **vi**: A second nitration is performed. The existing substituents (-tBu, -N2+, and -SO3H) all cooperatively direct the new -NO2 group to the only available position, C6.\n    *   **vii-viii**: Heating in aqueous acid accomplishes two crucial transformations: the diazonium group at C2 is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group (-OH), and the sulfonic acid blocking group at C4 is removed (desulfonation). The resulting product is **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**.\n    *   **ix**: A Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol's -OH group to an -OEt group. The product is **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-6-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   **Final Naming**: According to IUPAC nomenclature, the carbon with the -OEt group is C1. Numbering towards the next substituent gives the -tBu group at C2 and the -NO2 group at C3. The final name is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**, which matches the target molecule.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile containing an advanced step (nitration of a diazonium salt intermediate), Option C is the only sequence that correctly employs a blocking group strategy and subsequent functional group interconversions to achieve the required, complex 1,2,3-substitution pattern in a regiochemically controlled manner. The other options contain fundamental chemical errors or lead to the wrong isomer.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents and Positions:**\n    *   C1: Ethoxy (-OEt)\n    *   C2: tert-Butyl (-tBu)\n    *   C3: Nitro (-NO₂)\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene, where all three groups are adjacent. This is a sterically crowded arrangement that is difficult to synthesize directly.\n*   **Directing Effects of Substituents in Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS):**\n    *   -OEt: Strongly activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -tBu: Weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director. Its large size sterically hinders the *ortho* positions.\n    *   -NO₂: Strongly deactivating, *meta*-director.\n\n### 2. Evaluation of the Proposed Options\n\nThe core of this problem is to identify a sequence of reactions that is chemically sound and leads to the correct arrangement of substituents (regiochemistry).\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`\n    *   This option is nonsensically written with duplicate step numbers. Furthermore, step (iv) `NaNO2/HCl` is for diazotization, which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH₂). The preceding steps do not produce an amine, making this sequence chemically impossible as written.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   This sequence begins by forming nitrobenzene (i) and then reducing it to aniline (ii).\n    *   Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation (`tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`) on aniline. This reaction is known to fail. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, forming a complex that strongly deactivates the ring towards further electrophilic substitution. This option is not a viable synthetic route.\n\n*   **Option C:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence forms a diazonium salt in step (v). Step (vi) then attempts to react this diazonium salt with a nitrating mixture (`HNO₃/H₂SO₄`). Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable intermediates; reacting them under harsh nitrating conditions is not a standard or viable synthetic transformation. They would likely decompose. This option is chemically flawed.\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    *   Let's trace this sequence step-by-step, as it does not contain any immediately obvious impossible reactions like the others.\n    1.  **i) tBuCl/AlCl₃:** Forms **tert-butylbenzene**.\n    2.  **ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, the major product is **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**.\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amine. Product: **p-tert-butylaniline**.\n    4.  **iv) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The t-butyl group is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the position *ortho* to the t-butyl group and *meta* to the anilinium group. Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**.\n    5.  **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** Diazotization of the amine. Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenediazonium salt**.\n    6.  **vi) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat:** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol. Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson ether synthesis. Product: **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n\n### 3. Final Conclusion\n\nThe sequence of reactions in **Option D** is the only one that is chemically plausible from start to finish (steps i-vii). The other options contain steps that are fundamentally flawed (e.g., Friedel-Crafts on aniline, nitration of a diazonium salt).\n\nHowever, it is crucial to note that the product of sequence D is **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, which is an *isomer* of the target molecule, not the target molecule itself. The final two steps in option D (sulfonation and desulfonation) are illogical and would not cause the necessary rearrangement to form the desired product.\n\nTherefore, the question is flawed, as none of the options correctly produce the named target molecule in high yield. However, in the context of selecting the \"best\" option from a flawed set, Option D is the only one that describes a coherent and viable sequence of chemical reactions. The errors in Options A, B, and C are based on impossible chemical transformations, while the error in Option D is one of regiochemical outcome. Thus, Option D is the most plausible intended answer.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** An ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene, meaning all three groups are adjacent.\n*   **Relative Positions & Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt (at C1) and -tBu (at C2) are *ortho*. Both are *ortho, para*-directors.\n    *   -tBu (at C2) and -NO2 (at C3) are *ortho*. -tBu is an *o,p*-director, while -NO2 is a *meta*-director.\n    *   -OEt (at C1) and -NO2 (at C3) are *meta*. This is a key challenge, as the powerful *o,p*-directing -OEt group is *meta* to the -NO2 group, an arrangement not easily achieved by direct nitration of an ethoxy-substituted ring.\n\nThis complex and sterically hindered arrangement suggests that a simple sequence of electrophilic substitutions will not work. A more sophisticated strategy involving blocking groups and careful manipulation of functional groups is required.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Proposed Options\n\nLet's analyze each option for chemical feasibility and its ability to produce the correct isomer.\n\n*   **Option D: `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`**\n    This sequence starts by making aniline. Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction is known to be very inefficient. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring towards the desired C-alkylation. This is not a high-yield pathway. **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option C: `... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`**\n    This sequence is chemically impossible as written. Step (iv) is a diazotization reaction (`NaNO2/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine (-NH2) as the starting material. The product from the preceding step (iii) is a sulfonic acid, not an amine. **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option B: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ...`**\n    This sequence starts by making tert-butylbenzene, then nitrating it. Due to the steric bulk of the tert-butyl group, the major product of nitration is the *para* isomer, **1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene**. For a \"high-yield\" synthesis, the pathway must proceed through the major isomer. Subsequent steps (reduction, another nitration, etc.) starting from this 1,4-disubstituted compound will not lead to the desired 1,2,3-trisubstituted product. The final product would be an isomer, likely **1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene**. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n*   **Option A: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr`**\n    This sequence is the most complex, but it employs a blocking group strategy, which is appropriate for this challenge. Let's trace the pathway carefully.\n    1.  **i) Benzene → tert-Butylbenzene**: Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n    2.  **ii) → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**: Sulfonation occurs at the *para* position due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group. This blocks the para position.\n    3.  **iii) → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**: Nitration. The t-butyl group directs *ortho*, and the sulfonic acid group directs *meta*. Both direct to the same position (C2), making this a highly regioselective step.\n    4.  **iv) → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**: The nitro group is reduced to an amine.\n    5.  **v) → Diazonium salt**: The amine is converted to a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺). The intermediate is **4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    6.  **vi) → Nitration of the diazonium salt**: This is a key, non-obvious step. We must analyze the directing effects on the intermediate from step (v).\n        *   -tBu (at C1) directs *ortho, para* (to C6, since C2/C4 are blocked).\n        *   -N₂⁺ (at C2) directs *meta* (to C4/C6, since C4 is blocked).\n        *   -SO₃H (at C4) directs *meta* (to C2/C6, since C2 is blocked).\n        *   All three groups cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to position C6. This is another highly regioselective step. The product is **4-tert-butyl-2-diazonium-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n    7.  **vii) & viii) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat & dilute H₂SO₄**: Heating in aqueous acid accomplishes two transformations simultaneously:\n        *   The diazonium group (-N₂⁺) at C2 is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n        *   The sulfonic acid blocking group (-SO₃H) at C4 is removed (desulfonation).\n        *   The resulting product is **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**.\n    8.  **ix) NaOH/EtBr**: Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol (-OH) is converted to an ethoxy group (-OEt). The product is **2-tert-butyl-6-nitro-1-ethoxybenzene**.\n    9.  **Final Naming**: According to IUPAC rules, the -OEt group gets priority, so its carbon is C1. Numbering towards the next substituent gives the t-butyl group at C2 and the nitro group at C3. The final name is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis sequence, while complex, is chemically sound and leads directly to the target molecule with high regioselectivity at each step. It is the only option that correctly navigates the challenging synthesis.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reaction sequence for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** An ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The groups are at positions 1, 2, and 3, respectively. This is a sterically crowded arrangement of three adjacent substituents.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are activating, *ortho, para*-directing groups.\n    *   -NO2 is a deactivating, *meta*-directing group.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The synthesis must overcome standard directing effects to place all three groups adjacent to one another. A simple sequence of electrophilic substitutions is unlikely to work, suggesting that a more sophisticated strategy involving blocking groups and/or functional group interconversions is necessary for a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\n### 2. Evaluation of the Proposed Options\n\nA careful analysis of the options reveals that most contain significant flaws, either by proposing chemically impossible steps or by leading to the wrong isomer.\n\n*   **Options leading to the wrong isomer:** Several analyses (e.g., for options C and D) show that plausible interpretations of their reaction sequences lead to isomers, such as 1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene or 1-ethoxy-2-nitro-4-tert-butylbenzene. These pathways fail because they do not correctly position the bulky tert-butyl group at the start. For example, nitrating tert-butylbenzene first leads primarily to the *para* product, which sets up a 1,4-substitution pattern that is difficult to convert to the desired 1,2,3-pattern.\n\n*   **Options with chemically impossible steps:** Several options contain sequences that are not viable. For example, attempting to perform a diazotization reaction (using NaNO2/HCl) on a molecule that does not contain a primary amine is a common flaw identified in the candidate answers. Another identified flaw is attempting to perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on a strongly deactivated ring like nitrobenzene or on aniline without considering the side reaction with the Lewis acid catalyst.\n\n### 3. Identification of the Most Viable Strategy\n\nThe synthesis of a complex, sterically hindered molecule like the target often requires a **blocking group strategy**. The sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) is ideal for this purpose because it can be introduced to block a reactive position (typically the *para* position) and then removed later in the synthesis by heating with dilute acid (desulfonation).\n\nOption A is the only sequence that correctly employs this advanced strategy in a way that leads to the target molecule. Let's trace this successful pathway:\n\n1.  **i) Benzene + tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃ → tert-Butylbenzene.**\n    *   A standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add the tert-butyl group.\n\n2.  **ii) tert-Butylbenzene + SO₃/H₂SO₄ → 4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   Sulfonation. The bulky -tBu group directs the incoming -SO₃H group to the sterically accessible *para* position. This crucial step blocks the para position from further reaction.\n\n3.  **iii) 4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   Nitration. The -tBu group (an *o,p*-director) and the -SO₃H group (a *m*-director) both direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (C2). This results in a highly regioselective reaction.\n\n4.  **iv) ... + Fe/HCl → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   The nitro group is selectively reduced to a primary amine (-NH2).\n\n5.  **v) ... + NaNO₂/HCl → 4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   The primary amine is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺), a versatile intermediate.\n\n6.  **vi) ... + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 4-tert-butyl-2-diazonium-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.**\n    *   This is a second, non-obvious nitration. The directing effects of the three existing groups (-tBu, -N₂⁺, and -SO₃H) all align to direct the new nitro group to the only available position, C6. This is another highly specific step.\n\n7.  **vii) & viii) ... + H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat & dilute H₂SO₄ → 2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol.**\n    *   Heating in aqueous acid accomplishes two transformations simultaneously: the diazonium group at C2 is replaced by a hydroxyl group (-OH), and the sulfonic acid blocking group at C4 is removed.\n\n8.  **ix) ... + NaOH/EtBr → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.**\n    *   A standard Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol is converted to an ethoxy ether. When naming this final molecule according to IUPAC rules, the carbon bearing the -OEt group is C1, which makes the -tBu group at C2 and the -NO2 group at C3. This matches the target molecule precisely.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile several options contain plausible individual reactions, only the sequence in Option A provides a complete and chemically sound, albeit advanced, pathway to the specifically named target molecule in high yield. It correctly utilizes a blocking group strategy to control the regiochemistry, a necessary approach for this complex synthesis.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule and the Synthetic Challenge**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Structure:** It is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring. This means all three substituents are adjacent to each other.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   C1: -OEt (ethoxy group): A strong activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   C2: -tBu (tert-butyl group): A weakly activating, *ortho, para*-director. It is very bulky, which sterically hinders adjacent positions.\n    *   C3: -NO2 (nitro group): A strong deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **The Challenge:** Synthesizing a 1,2,3-substituted ring is difficult due to steric hindrance. Furthermore, the electronic properties present a conflict: the strong *ortho, para*-directing ethoxy group is *meta* to the nitro group. A simple sequence of electrophilic substitutions on a benzene ring will not produce this arrangement in high yield. This implies that a more complex strategy, likely involving functional group interconversions or the use of blocking groups, is necessary.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility**\n\nWe will examine each proposed reaction sequence for any steps that are chemically impossible, illogical, or would lead to very low yields.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    *   Steps (i) and (ii) correctly form aniline from benzene.\n    *   Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction is known to fail. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) is a strong acid that reacts with the basic amino group (-NH₂) of aniline. This forms a complex that deactivates the ring, preventing the alkylation from occurring.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option B is not a viable synthetic route.\n\n*   **Option C:** `... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    *   This sequence correctly reduces a nitro group to an amine (iv) and then converts the amine to a diazonium salt (v).\n    *   Step (vi) attempts to nitrate the diazonium salt. Diazonium salts are highly unstable intermediates that are typically used immediately in reactions like Sandmeyer reactions or hydrolysis. Subjecting them to harsh nitrating conditions (concentrated nitric and sulfuric acids) is not a standard or feasible synthetic step; the salt would likely decompose violently.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C contains a chemically unfeasible step and is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** `... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ... viii) Fe/HCl ...`\n    *   This sequence is presented in a completely illogical order. For example, it attempts a diazotization reaction (step iv, `NaNO2/HCl`), which requires a primary amine, before the step that would form the amine (step viii, `Fe/HCl`).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is nonsensical as written and is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`\n    *   Let's trace this path. Unlike the other options, this sequence does not contain any fundamentally impossible steps. Each step is a known chemical reaction.\n    *   i) Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n    *   ii) Nitration of tert-butylbenzene → **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** (this is the major product due to the steric bulk of the t-Bu group).\n    *   iii) Reduction → **p-tert-butylaniline**.\n    *   iv) Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH₃⁺), which is a *meta*-director. The t-Bu group at the para position is an *ortho, para*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the position *ortho* to the amine and *meta* to the t-Bu group. This yields **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**.\n    *   v) Diazotization → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenediazonium salt**.\n    *   vi) Hydrolysis → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n    *   vii) Williamson Ether Synthesis → **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   The final two steps (viii and ix) are sulfonation and desulfonation, which are redundant at the end of the synthesis.\n\n**3. Final Decision**\n\nThe analysis shows that Options B, C, and D contain chemically impossible or illogical steps, making them incorrect. Option A describes a coherent, multi-step synthesis where each transformation is valid.\n\nHowever, the product of the synthesis in Option A is **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, which is an *isomer* of the target molecule, **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis indicates a flaw in the question itself—either the name of the target molecule is incorrect, or all the options are flawed. In a forced-choice scenario, the best answer is the one that represents a chemically sound and logical synthetic sequence, even if it doesn't lead to the exact named product. Option A is the only choice that meets this criterion. The other options are invalid on more fundamental grounds.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the most plausible intended answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nAnswering this question requires a detailed step-by-step analysis of each proposed synthetic route, paying close attention to the principles of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), including directing effects and steric hindrance, as well as the feasibility of each reaction.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule**\nThe target is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** -OEt (ethoxy), -tBu (tert-butyl), -NO2 (nitro).\n*   **Positions:** 1, 2, and 3 (all adjacent). This is a sterically crowded arrangement.\n*   **Relative Positions & Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt (strong o,p-director) and -tBu (o,p-director) are *ortho*.\n    *   -tBu and -NO2 (m-director) are *ortho*.\n    *   -OEt and -NO2 are *meta*.\nThe synthesis of such a 1,2,3-trisubstituted ring is non-trivial and standard EAS sequences are unlikely to work, suggesting a more complex strategy or a flaw in the question. The final step is almost certainly a Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr`) on the corresponding phenol, **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**.\n\n**2. Evaluate Each Option as Written**\n\n*   **Option A) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...**\n    *   This sequence begins by forming nitrobenzene (i), then aniline (ii).\n    *   Step (iii) is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction is known to fail or give very poor yields because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) complexes with the basic amino group, strongly deactivating the ring towards electrophilic attack.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option A is not a viable high-yield synthesis.\n\n*   **Option D) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ... iv) NaNO2/HCl ... viii) Fe/HCl ...**\n    *   This sequence has an impossible order of reactions. Step (iv) is a diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), which requires a primary aromatic amine as the starting material. However, the amine is not formed until step (viii) (`Fe/HCl`).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option D is chemically illogical and incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ... v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...**\n    *   This sequence employs a blocking group strategy, which is a sound approach for complex substitutions. Steps (i) through (v) generate a diazonium salt (`4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid`).\n    *   Step (vi) attempts to nitrate this diazonium salt. Diazonium salts are highly reactive and unstable intermediates. Reacting them with a harsh nitrating mixture (HNO3/H2SO4) is not a standard, safe, or predictable synthetic transformation. They are typically used immediately in replacement (e.g., Sandmeyer, hydrolysis) or coupling reactions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Option C contains a chemically unsound and highly improbable step, making it an incorrect choice.\n\n*   **Option B) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4**\n    *   Let's trace this sequence:\n        1.  `i)`: Benzene → **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n        2.  `ii)`: Nitration → **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** (major product due to sterics).\n        3.  `iii)`: Reduction → **p-tert-butylaniline**.\n        4.  `iv)`: Nitration of the aniline. The amino group (protonated to -NH3+ in acid) is a meta-director, and the t-butyl group is an ortho,para-director. Both direct the incoming nitro group to the position ortho to the amine and meta to the t-butyl group, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**.\n        5.  `v)`: Diazotization → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenediazonium salt**.\n        6.  `vi)`: Hydrolysis → **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**.\n        7.  `vii)`: Williamson Ether Synthesis → **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**.\n    *   This sequence of reactions (i-vii) is entirely composed of standard, chemically plausible transformations. It represents a valid synthesis.\n    *   However, the product is an isomer of the target molecule, not the target itself. The final two steps (viii, ix) are redundant and do not alter the product.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Among the four options, Option B is the only one that describes a chemically coherent and plausible sequence of reactions from start to finish. The other options contain steps that are either impossible, fail, or are not synthetically viable. The fact that Option B leads to an isomer indicates a flaw in the question itself (likely an incorrect name for the target product). In a multiple-choice context where one must select the \"best\" answer, the option that is free of fundamental chemical errors is the correct choice.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenge**\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** An ethoxy group (-OEt) at C1, a tert-butyl group (-tBu) at C2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at C3.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** This is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene, meaning all three groups are adjacent. This is a sterically crowded and synthetically challenging arrangement.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are *ortho, para*-directors (activating).\n    *   -NO2 is a *meta*-director (deactivating).\n*   **Key Relationships:** The -OEt and -tBu groups are *ortho* to each other, as are the -tBu and -NO2 groups. The strong activating -OEt group is *meta* to the -NO2 group, which is an arrangement that is very difficult to achieve by direct nitration of the corresponding ether. This strongly suggests that a complex, multi-step strategy involving blocking groups and/or functional group interconversions is required for a \"high-yield\" synthesis.\n\n**2. Evaluate the Candidate Options**\n\nWe will analyze each option for chemical feasibility. The order of reactions is critical.\n\n*   **Option D:** This pathway starts by making 1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene (the major product of nitrating tert-butylbenzene), which is then converted to 4-tert-butylaniline. A second nitration would occur *ortho* to the amino group, leading to 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline. Subsequent steps (diazotization, hydrolysis, etherification) would yield **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. This is an isomer of the target molecule, but it is not the correct product, and the final steps cannot induce the necessary rearrangement. Therefore, Option D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option B and Option C:** These options contain sequences with fundamental chemical errors. For example, Option B as written (`...ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4...`) is illogical. Option C as written (`...iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl...`) attempts a diazotization reaction (NaNO2/HCl) on a sulfonic acid intermediate that does not contain an amino group. Such steps are chemically impossible. Therefore, Options B and C are incorrect.\n\n**3. Detailed Analysis of Option A**\n\nThis option presents the most complex but also the most chemically sound pathway. It utilizes a sulfonic acid blocking group, a classic strategy for achieving difficult substitution patterns.\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Forms **tert-butylbenzene**.\n*   **ii) SO3/H2SO4:** Sulfonation. The bulky -tBu group directs the -SO3H group to the sterically accessible *para* position, forming **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This blocks the para position from further reaction.\n*   **iii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration. The -tBu group (an *o,p*-director) and the -SO3H group (a *m*-director) both direct the incoming -NO2 group to the same position (C2). This is a highly regioselective step that yields **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This correctly establishes the required *ortho* relationship between the t-butyl and nitro groups.\n*   **iv) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amine, yielding **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization of the amine to form a diazonium salt: **4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **vi) HNO3/H2SO4:** This is the key, non-obvious step: a second nitration. On the intermediate from step (v), all existing substituents (-tBu at C1, -N2+ at C2, -SO3H at C4) direct the incoming nitro group to the C6 position. This is another highly regioselective step, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-diazonium-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** Heating in aqueous acid accomplishes two transformations simultaneously:\n    1.  The diazonium group (-N2+) at C2 is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    2.  The sulfonic acid blocking group (-SO3H) at C4 is removed (desulfonation).\n    The product is **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**.\n*   **viii) dilute H2SO4:** This step is redundant, likely ensuring the completion of the desulfonation.\n*   **ix) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson ether synthesis. The phenol (-OH) is converted to an ethoxy group (-OEt). The product is **2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-6-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Final Naming:** According to IUPAC rules, the -OEt group receives the highest priority, so its carbon is C1. Numbering towards the next substituent gives the t-butyl group at C2 and the nitro group at C3. The final product name is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe sequence of reactions in Option A is the only one that provides a chemically sound, high-yield pathway to the exact target molecule. It correctly employs a sophisticated strategy involving a blocking group and multiple directed substitutions to overcome the steric and electronic challenges of the synthesis.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenge\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene** from benzene.\n\n*   **Structure:** The benzene ring has three adjacent substituents:\n    *   C1: -OEt (ethoxy)\n    *   C2: -tBu (tert-butyl)\n    *   C3: -NO2 (nitro)\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are activating, *ortho, para*-directing groups.\n    *   -NO2 is a deactivating, *meta*-directing group.\n*   **Challenge:** This 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded and electronically difficult to achieve. The *meta* relationship between the strong activating group (-OEt) and the deactivating group (-NO2) is particularly challenging and suggests that a simple sequence of electrophilic substitutions will not work. A more sophisticated strategy involving functional group interconversions and/or the use of blocking groups is almost certainly required.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Candidate Options\n\nLet's analyze each option for chemical feasibility. A common approach is to first identify any sequences with fundamentally impossible steps.\n\n*   **Option B:** This sequence includes `... iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`. Step (v) correctly forms a diazonium salt from an amine. However, step (vi) attempts to nitrate this unstable diazonium salt intermediate under harsh conditions. This is not a standard or viable reaction. Diazonium salts are typically used immediately for replacement reactions (e.g., Sandmeyer or hydrolysis). This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence includes `... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ...`. Step (iv) attempts to perform a diazotization (`NaNO2/HCl`), but the substrate at that point is a sulfonic acid, not a primary aromatic amine. This step is chemically impossible. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence starts with nitration, then reduction to aniline. Step (iii) is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aniline. This reaction is known to fail or be very low-yield because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) complexes with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring towards alkylation. This is not a \"high-yield\" pathway. This option is incorrect.\n\n### 3. Detailed Analysis of Option A\n\nSince options B, C, and D contain clear chemical flaws, let's analyze Option A in detail. This sequence is complex but does not contain any fundamentally impossible steps. It notably includes sulfonation and desulfonation, a hallmark of a blocking group strategy.\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene.\n    *   Product: **tert-Butylbenzene**.\n\n*   **ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄:** Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. The bulky -tBu group is an *o,p*-director, but sterics strongly favor substitution at the *para* position.\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This blocks the para position.\n\n*   **iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration. The -tBu group directs *ortho* (to C2), and the -SO₃H group directs *meta* (also to C2). The directing effects are cooperative.\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n*   **iv) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group to an amine.\n    *   Product: **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n*   **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** Diazotization of the primary amine.\n    *   Intermediate: **4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n*   **vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** A second nitration. This is an unusual but critical step. Let's analyze the directing effects on the diazonium salt intermediate:\n    *   The -tBu group (at C4) is an *o,p*-director, directing to C3 and C5.\n    *   The -N₂⁺ group (at C2) is a strong *m*-director, directing to C4 (blocked) and C6.\n    *   The -SO₃H group (at C1) is a *m*-director, directing to C3 and C5.\n    *   This is a complex case. However, a more careful analysis (as performed by agent 8) shows that if we number with tBu at C1, N₂⁺ at C2, and SO₃H at C4, all three groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same available position, C6.\n    *   Product: **4-tert-butyl-2-diazonium-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n\n*   **vii) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat:** Heating in aqueous acid causes two reactions:\n    1.  Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt (-N₂⁺ is replaced by -OH).\n    2.  Desulfonation (-SO₃H is replaced by -H).\n    *   Product: **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**.\n\n*   **viii) dilute H₂SO₄:** This step is redundant, likely ensuring completion of the previous step.\n\n*   **ix) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson ether synthesis. The phenolic -OH is converted to an -OEt group.\n    *   Product: **1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-6-nitrobenzene**.\n\n*   **Final IUPAC Naming:** According to IUPAC rules, the -OEt group receives the highest priority for numbering.\n    *   The carbon with -OEt is C1.\n    *   The adjacent carbon with -tBu is C2.\n    *   The next carbon with -NO₂ is C3.\n    *   The final name is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis sequence, while complex and containing an uncommon step, is chemically sound and leads precisely to the target molecule. It is the only option that does not contain a fundamental chemical error.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nTo determine the correct sequence of reactions for the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene, a careful step-by-step analysis of each proposed pathway is necessary. The target molecule has a 1,2,3-substitution pattern, which is sterically crowded and often requires a sophisticated synthetic strategy to control the position of the substituents (regiochemistry).\n\n### **1. Analysis of the Target Molecule**\n\n*   **Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring with three adjacent substituents:\n    *   C1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strong activator and *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   C2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu), a weak activator and *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   C3: Nitro group (-NO2), a strong deactivator and *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The arrangement is difficult to achieve via simple electrophilic aromatic substitution. The *meta* relationship between the powerful activating -OEt group and the -NO2 group is particularly challenging, suggesting that a simple nitration of an ethoxy-containing precursor is not the final step. This points towards a strategy involving blocking groups or the conversion of functional groups to alter their directing effects.\n\n### **2. Evaluation of the Candidate Options**\n\nA critical evaluation of the options reveals that most contain fundamental chemical errors or lead to incorrect products.\n\n*   **Option D:** This sequence starts by making 4-tert-butylaniline, then nitrating it. The directing effects of the -NH3+ (meta-director) and -tBu (ortho,para-director) groups would indeed lead to **4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline**. Subsequent steps (diazotization, hydrolysis, etherification) would produce **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**, which is an isomer of the target molecule, not the target itself. The final sulfonation/desulfonation steps are illogical and would not cause the necessary rearrangement.\n*   **Options B and C:** These options contain chemically impossible steps in the order they are written. For example, they attempt to perform a diazotization reaction (`NaNO2/HCl`) on an intermediate that does not possess a primary amine (-NH2) group. Therefore, these sequences are invalid.\n\n### **3. Detailed Analysis of Option A**\n\nOption A presents a complex but chemically sound pathway that correctly utilizes a blocking group strategy and exploits the additive directing effects of multiple substituents to achieve the difficult 1,2,3-pattern.\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃:** Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene produces **tert-butylbenzene**.\n*   **ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄:** Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the large steric bulk of the t-butyl group, the sulfonic acid group (-SO₃H) is directed to the *para* position, forming **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**. This step effectively \"blocks\" the reactive para position.\n*   **iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** Nitration of the blocked intermediate. The t-butyl group (an *o,p*-director) and the sulfonic acid group (a *m*-director) both direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (C2). This highly regioselective step yields **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **iv) Fe/HCl:** The nitro group is selectively reduced to a primary amine, yielding **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **v) NaNO₂/HCl:** The primary amine is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺), forming **4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄:** This is a second, crucial nitration step. On the intermediate from step (v), all three existing substituents (-tBu, -N₂⁺, and -SO₃H) cooperatively direct the incoming nitro group to the only remaining activated position, C6. This results in the formation of **4-tert-butyl-2-diazonium-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **vii) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat:** Heating in aqueous acid accomplishes two transformations simultaneously:\n    1.  The diazonium salt at C2 is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n    2.  The sulfonic acid blocking group at C4 is removed (desulfonation).\n    The product is **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**.\n*   **viii) dilute H₂SO₄:** This step is redundant and likely ensures the complete desulfonation from the previous step.\n*   **ix) NaOH/EtBr:** A Williamson ether synthesis is performed. The phenolic -OH group is converted to an ethoxy (-OEt) group. The product is **1-tert-butyl-2-ethoxy-6-nitrobenzene**.\n\nFinally, according to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the ring is numbered to give the highest priority functional group (the ether) the lowest possible number. This renumbers the substituents as follows: -OEt at C1, -tBu at C2, and -NO2 at C3. The final product is indeed **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis detailed analysis shows that Option A, despite its complexity and an unusual nitration step, is the only chemically correct sequence that leads to the desired product in high yield.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct sequence of reactions for the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Strategy\n*   **Target Molecule**: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Substitution Pattern**: The benzene ring has three adjacent substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3.\n    *   C1: Ethoxy group (-OEt), a strong activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   C2: Tert-butyl group (-tBu), a bulky, activating, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   C3: Nitro group (-NO2), a strong deactivating, *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Challenge**: Synthesizing a 1,2,3-trisubstituted ring is difficult due to steric hindrance and conflicting directing effects. For instance, the strong activating -OEt group is *meta* to the -NO2 group, an arrangement not easily achieved by direct nitration of a ring containing an ethoxy group. This complexity strongly suggests that a sophisticated strategy involving blocking groups and multiple functional group interconversions is required.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Plausibility of Each Option\n\nA valid synthesis must follow logical chemical principles. We can eliminate options that contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps.\n\n*   **Option B**: This sequence involves nitrating tert-butylbenzene (step ii), which would primarily yield the *para* isomer (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene). Starting with a 1,4-disubstituted compound makes it impossible to achieve the desired 1,2,3-pattern in high yield. This option is strategically flawed from the beginning for a high-yield synthesis.\n\n*   **Option C**: This sequence attempts a diazotization reaction (step v, `NaNO2/HCl`) on an intermediate that does not contain a primary amine (-NH2) group. This is a chemically impossible step. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Option D**: This sequence involves nitrating p-tert-butylaniline (step iv). The resulting product is 4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline. Following the subsequent steps (diazotization, hydrolysis, etherification) leads to the synthesis of **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, which is an isomer of the target molecule, not the target itself. The final two steps (sulfonation and desulfonation) are illogical and would not cause the necessary skeletal rearrangement. Therefore, this option does not lead to the correct product.\n\n### 3. Detailed Analysis of Option A\n\nThis leaves Option A as the only remaining possibility. Let's trace its reaction path step-by-step to verify its validity.\n\n*   **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene yields **tert-butylbenzene**.\n*   **ii) SO₃/H₂SO₄**: Sulfonation of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, the sulfonic acid group (-SO₃H) is directed to the *para* position. This forms **4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**, which acts as a \"blocking group\" to prevent reactions at the para position.\n*   **iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration of 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. The t-butyl group (an *o,p*-director) and the sulfonic acid group (a *m*-director) both direct the incoming nitro group to the same position: C2. This is a highly regioselective step that yields **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**. This correctly establishes the crucial *ortho* relationship between the future t-butyl and nitro groups.\n*   **iv) Fe/HCl**: The nitro group is reduced to a primary amine, yielding **2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **v) NaNO₂/HCl**: The primary amine is converted into a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺), forming **4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **vi) HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: This is a second nitration step. While nitrating a diazonium salt is unusual, the directing effects of all three existing groups (-tBu, -N₂⁺, -SO₃H) converge to strongly direct the incoming nitro group to the only available activated position, C6. This forms **4-tert-butyl-2-diazonium-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid**.\n*   **vii) H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat**: Heating in aqueous acid accomplishes two transformations simultaneously:\n    1.  The diazonium salt at C2 is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    2.  The sulfonic acid blocking group at C4 is removed (desulfonation).\n    The product is **2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol**.\n*   **viii) dilute H₂SO₄**: This step is redundant and ensures the completion of the previous step.\n*   **ix) NaOH/EtBr**: Williamson ether synthesis. The phenolic -OH group is converted to an ethoxy (-OEt) group. The product is **2-tert-butyl-6-nitro-1-ethoxybenzene**.\n\n**Final Check**: Let's assign the IUPAC name to the final product. The ethoxy group has priority, so its carbon is C1. Numbering towards the next substituent gives the t-butyl group position C2 and the nitro group position C3. The final name is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**, which exactly matches the target molecule.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile containing a non-standard step, the sequence in Option A is the only one that is strategically sound and leads to the correct 1,2,3-trisubstituted product. It correctly employs a blocking group strategy to control regiochemistry and follows a logical series of functional group transformations. The other options are invalidated by impossible chemical steps or lead to incorrect isomers.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, considering all careful points to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Target Molecule\n\nThe goal is to synthesize **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Structure:** It is a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring.\n    *   Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)\n    *   Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-tBu)\n    *   Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)\n*   **Substituent Properties:**\n    *   -OEt: Strong activator, *ortho, para*-director.\n    *   -tBu: Weak activator, *ortho, para*-director, very bulky.\n    *   -NO2: Strong deactivator, *meta*-director.\n*   **Key Challenge:** The 1,2,3-substitution pattern is sterically crowded and electronically complex to achieve. A simple sequence of substitutions is unlikely to work. A high-yield synthesis will almost certainly require a more advanced strategy, such as using a \"blocking group\" that can be added to direct other substituents and then removed later.\n\n### 2. Constraint-Based Pruning of Options\n\nWe will evaluate each option against fundamental chemical principles to prune the search space.\n\n*   **Constraint 1: Feasibility of Friedel-Crafts Reactions.**\n    *   The Friedel-Crafts alkylation (using `tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`) is an electrophilic aromatic substitution that fails on strongly deactivated rings (like nitrobenzene) and reacts with basic groups (like aniline).\n    *   **Option D** starts with `i) HNO3/H2SO4` (forms nitrobenzene), then `ii) Fe/HCl` (forms aniline), and then `iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`. Attempting a Friedel-Crafts reaction on aniline is not a viable, high-yield process because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring.\n    *   **Result:** Option D is eliminated.\n\n*   **Constraint 2: Logical Order of Functional Group Interconversions.**\n    *   Certain reaction sequences must follow a specific order. For example, to convert a nitro group to a different substituent via a diazonium salt, the order must be: Reduction (-NO₂ → -NH₂) followed by Diazotization (-NH₂ → -N₂⁺).\n    *   **Option C** has `iv) NaNO2/HCl` (diazotization) listed before `viii) Fe/HCl` (reduction). It is impossible to perform a diazotization reaction before the amine has been formed.\n    *   **Result:** Option C is eliminated.\n\n*   **Constraint 3: Correct Regiochemical Outcome.**\n    *   We must trace the substitution pattern to see if it leads to the 1,2,3-target isomer.\n    *   **Option B** has the sequence: `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3` → tert-butylbenzene. `ii) HNO3/H2SO4` → nitration. Due to the bulk of the -tBu group, the major product is **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene** (a 1,4-disubstituted ring). Subsequent steps (`iii) Fe/HCl` → p-tert-butylaniline; `iv) HNO3/H2SO4` → 4-tert-butyl-3-nitroaniline) will build upon this 1,4-pattern. This pathway will ultimately lead to an isomer like **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**, not the desired 1,2,3-isomer.\n    *   **Result:** Option B is eliminated as it cannot produce the correct isomer in high yield.\n\n### 3. Detailed Analysis of the Remaining Option (Option A)\n\nOnly Option A remains. We must verify if its complex sequence is chemically sound and leads to the correct product.\n\n*   **A) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr**\n\n1.  **i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl₃ → tert-Butylbenzene.** (Standard alkylation).\n2.  **ii) ... + SO₃/H₂SO₄ → 4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.** (Sulfonation. The bulky -tBu group directs the -SO₃H group to the *para* position. This is a classic \"blocking group\" strategy).\n3.  **iii) ... + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.** (Nitration. The -tBu group directs *ortho* and the -SO₃H group directs *meta*. Both direct the incoming -NO₂ group to position 2. This is a highly selective step that correctly establishes the *ortho* relationship between the eventual -tBu and one -NO₂ group).\n4.  **iv) ... + Fe/HCl → 2-amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.** (Standard reduction of the nitro group).\n5.  **v) ... + NaNO₂/HCl → 4-tert-butyl-2-diazoniumbenzenesulfonic acid.** (Standard diazotization of the amine).\n6.  **vi) ... + HNO₃/H₂SO₄ → 4-tert-butyl-2-diazonium-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.** (This is a second nitration on a complex intermediate. Let's check the directing effects: the -tBu at C1, -N₂⁺ at C2, and -SO₃H at C4 all direct the incoming -NO₂ group to the same available position, C6. This is a plausible, highly specific reaction).\n7.  **vii) & viii) ... + H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat & dilute H₂SO₄ → 2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol.** (Heating in aqueous acid accomplishes two things: 1. The diazonium group at C2 is replaced by an -OH group. 2. The sulfonic acid blocking group at C4 is removed (desulfonation). The product is 2-tert-butyl-6-nitrophenol).\n8.  **ix) ... + NaOH/EtBr → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.** (Williamson ether synthesis converts the phenol (-OH) to an ethoxy ether (-OEt). We must now name the final product according to IUPAC rules. The -OEt group gets priority for numbering (C1). Numbering towards the next substituent gives the -tBu group position C2 and the -NO₂ group position C3).\n\n**Final Product Name:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n**Pass/Fail:** The sequence in Option A, while complex, is chemically sound and leads directly to the target molecule.\n\n### Final Decision\n\n*   **Option A:** A complex but chemically valid pathway that correctly uses a blocking group strategy to produce the target molecule. **PASS**\n*   **Option B:** Leads to the wrong isomer. **FAIL**\n*   **Option C:** Contains an impossible reaction order. **FAIL**\n*   **Option D:** Contains an unfeasible reaction step. **FAIL**\n\nThe only viable sequence is Option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the correct reaction sequence.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthetic Challenge\n\nThe target molecule is **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n*   **Substituents:** An ethoxy group (-OEt), a tert-butyl group (-tBu), and a nitro group (-NO2).\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** 1, 2, 3 (all adjacent). This is a sterically crowded arrangement.\n*   **Directing Effects:**\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are activating, *ortho, para*-directing groups.\n    *   -NO2 is a deactivating, *meta*-directing group.\n*   **Key Relationships:**\n    *   The activating -OEt group is *meta* to the deactivating -NO2 group.\n    *   The bulky -tBu group is *ortho* to both the -OEt and -NO2 groups.\n\nA simple electrophilic aromatic substitution strategy will not work. For example, nitrating 2-tert-butylethoxybenzene would place the nitro group at the 4 or 6 positions, not the 3 position. This indicates that a more sophisticated strategy, likely involving **blocking groups** and/or **functional group interconversions**, is required to control the regiochemistry.\n\n### 2. Evaluate the Options Based on Chemical Logic\n\nThe final step is almost certainly a Williamson ether synthesis (`NaOH/EtBr`) to form the ethoxy group from a phenol. This means the immediate precursor must be **2-(tert-butyl)-3-nitrophenol**. The core of the problem is synthesizing this specific phenol.\n\nLet's evaluate each option for fundamental flaws:\n\n*   **Option D:** `i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ...`\n    This sequence fails at step (iii). It attempts a Friedel-Crafts alkylation on aniline. The Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring and preventing the reaction. This is not a viable high-yield pathway.\n\n*   **Option C:** `... iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ; ... viii) Fe/HCl ...`\n    This sequence is chemically illogical. It attempts a diazotization reaction (step iv) *before* the necessary amine has been formed (step viii). This is impossible.\n\n*   **Option B:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This sequence starts by nitrating tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, the major product is the *para* isomer (1-tert-butyl-4-nitrobenzene). Following this pathway with the major isomer will ultimately lead to **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-3-nitrobenzene**, which is an isomer of the target but not the correct product. Starting with the minor *ortho* isomer from step (ii) would violate the \"high-yield\" requirement of the question.\n\n*   **Option A:** `i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ...`\n    This is the only option that employs a **blocking group strategy**, which is the classic method for solving such complex regiochemical problems. Let's trace the pathway carefully, as interpreted by the most successful analyses.\n\n### 3. Detailed Analysis of the Correct Pathway (Option A)\n\n1.  **i) Benzene + tBuCl/AlCl₃ → tert-Butylbenzene.** Standard Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n2.  **ii) Sulfonation → 4-tert-Butylbenzenesulfonic acid.** The bulky t-butyl group directs the incoming -SO₃H group to the sterically accessible *para* position. This \"blocks\" the para position from further reaction.\n3.  **iii) Nitration → 4-tert-Butyl-2-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.** Now, nitration occurs. The t-butyl group directs *ortho* (to C2), and the sulfonic acid group directs *meta* (also to C2). Both groups cooperatively direct the nitro group to a single position, making this a highly regioselective step. This correctly establishes the *ortho* relationship between the t-butyl group and a precursor to the ethoxy group.\n4.  **iv) Reduction (Fe/HCl) → 2-Amino-4-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.** The nitro group is reduced to an amino group.\n5.  **v) Diazotization (NaNO₂/HCl) → Diazonium salt.** The amino group is converted to a diazonium salt (-N₂⁺).\n6.  **vi) Second Nitration (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) → 4-tert-Butyl-2-diazonium-6-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.** This is an unusual but plausible step. The directing effects of all three existing groups (-tBu, -N₂⁺, -SO₃H) converge to direct the new nitro group to the only remaining activated position, C6. This establishes the final 1,2,3-relationship between the substituent precursors.\n7.  **vii) & viii) Hydrolysis and Desulfonation (H₃O⁺/Heat, dilute H₂SO₄) → 2-tert-Butyl-6-nitrophenol.** Heating in aqueous acid accomplishes two things: the diazonium salt at C2 is hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group (-OH), and the sulfonic acid blocking group at C4 is removed (desulfonation).\n8.  **ix) Ether Synthesis (NaOH/EtBr) → 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.** The phenol is converted to an ethoxy ether. When the resulting molecule (1-ethoxy-2-tert-butyl-6-nitrobenzene) is named according to IUPAC rules, it is correctly named **2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene**.\n\nThis sequence is chemically sound, highly strategic, and the only one that leads to the correct target molecule in high yield.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the arguments from the provided answers to arrive at the most logical conclusion.\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Molecule and the Synthetic Challenge\n\n*   **Target Molecule:** 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.\n*   **Substitution Pattern:** The molecule has three adjacent substituents (a 1,2,3-pattern) on the benzene ring:\n    *   C1: -OEt (ethoxy)\n    *   C2: -tBu (tert-butyl)\n    *   C3: -NO2 (nitro)\n*   **Directing Effects:** The directing effects of these groups for electrophilic aromatic substitution are crucial:\n    *   -OEt and -tBu are activating, *ortho, para*-directing groups.\n    *   -NO2 is a deactivating, *meta*-directing group.\n*   **The Challenge:** Achieving a 1,2,3-substitution pattern is difficult, especially when it involves placing a group between two existing substituents. The *meta* relationship between the strong *ortho, para*-directing ethoxy group and the nitro group is particularly hard to achieve directly, suggesting a complex synthesis involving functional group interconversions or blocking groups. The question's requirement for a \"high-yield\" synthesis makes pathways relying on the separation of minor isomers unlikely.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Each Option for Chemical Feasibility\n\nA robust method for solving such problems is to first eliminate options that contain chemically impossible or nonsensical steps.\n\n*   **Option C:** This sequence begins with nitration, then reduction to aniline, followed by Friedel-Crafts alkylation (`iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3`). Friedel-Crafts reactions fail on anilines because the Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl3) reacts with the basic amino group, deactivating the ring. This makes Option C an invalid pathway.\n\n*   **Option B:** The sequence as written is `...iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4...`. Step (v) correctly forms a diazonium salt from an amine. However, step (vi) attempts to nitrate this unstable diazonium salt with a harsh nitrating mixture. This is not a standard or viable reaction; the diazonium salt would decompose. Therefore, Option B is chemically invalid as written.\n\n*   **Option D:** The sequence of reagents is completely jumbled. For example, it performs diazotization (`iv) NaNO2/HCl`) before the amine is even formed (`viii) Fe/HCl`). This sequence is not chemically logical and must be discarded.\n\n*   **Option A:** This is the only option remaining. Let's trace its reaction path to see if it is plausible.\n    1.  **i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3:** Forms **tert-butylbenzene**. (Plausible)\n    2.  **ii) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of tert-butylbenzene. Due to the steric bulk of the t-butyl group, the major product is **p-nitro-tert-butylbenzene**. This is a high-yield step. (Plausible)\n    3.  **iii) Fe/HCl:** Reduction of the nitro group. This forms **p-tert-butylaniline**. (Plausible)\n    4.  **iv) HNO3/H2SO4:** Nitration of p-tert-butylaniline. In strong acid, the amine is protonated to the anilinium ion (-NH3+), which is a *meta*-director. The t-butyl group is an *o,p*-director. Both groups direct the incoming nitro group to the same position (the position *meta* to -NH3+ and *ortho* to -tBu). This yields **4-tert-butyl-2-nitroaniline**. (Plausible and regiochemically sound).\n    5.  **v) NaNO2/HCl:** Diazotization of the amine to form a diazonium salt. (Plausible)\n    6.  **vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat:** Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol, yielding **4-tert-butyl-2-nitrophenol**. (Plausible)\n    7.  **vii) NaOH/EtBr:** Williamson ether synthesis to convert the phenol to an ether, yielding **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**. (Plausible)\n\n### 3. Final Conclusion\n\nThe sequence of reactions (i) through (vii) in **Option A** describes a coherent, high-yield, and chemically plausible synthesis. However, it produces **1-ethoxy-4-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene**, which is an *isomer* of the target molecule, not the target molecule itself. The final two steps listed in Option A (`viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4`) are sulfonation and desulfonation, which are redundant and would not cause the major skeletal rearrangement needed to convert the product into the desired target.\n\nThis indicates a fundamental flaw in the question itself—either the name of the target molecule is incorrect, or all the options are wrong. However, in a multiple-choice context, the task is to select the *best possible answer*.\n\n*   Options B, C, and D are invalid because they contain chemically impossible or illogical steps.\n*   Option A describes a complete, logical, and high-yield synthesis of a closely related trisubstituted benzene isomer. It is the only option that is free of fundamental chemical errors in its core sequence.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the most plausible intended answer, assuming an error in the problem statement.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.\n"
