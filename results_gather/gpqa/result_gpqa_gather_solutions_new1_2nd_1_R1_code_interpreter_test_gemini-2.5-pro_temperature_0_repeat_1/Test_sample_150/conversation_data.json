The script correctly set up the state vector `|ψ⟩` and the observable operator `P`. It then found the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of `P`. The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 was identified as `[1/√2, 0, -1/√2]`.

Understand the Physical Principle**\nThe question asks for the probability of measuring a specific outcome (0) for an observable (`P`) when a quantum system is in a given state (`|ψ⟩`). According to the postulates of quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the observable's operator. The probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue `λ` is the squared magnitude of the projection of the state vector onto the eigenvector corresponding to that eigenvalue.\n\n**2. The Mathematical Formula**\nThe probability `Prob(λ)` can be calculated using the following formula, which correctly handles vectors that are not normalized:\n\n`Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `|ψ⟩` is the state vector of the system: `[-1, 2, 1]^T`.\n*   `|v_λ⟩` is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ`.\n*   `⟨v_λ|ψ⟩` is the inner product of the two vectors.\n*   `⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩` and `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` are the squared norms of the respective vectors.\n\n**3. Step 1: Find the Eigenvalues of P**\nThis step confirms that 0 is a possible measurement outcome. We must solve the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n*   **Operator P**: `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n*   **Characteristic Equation**: `det([[ -λ, 1/√2,  0 ], [1/√2,  -λ, 1/√2], [ 0, 1/√2,  -λ]]) = 0`\n*   **Solving the determinant**: `-λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ = 0`.\n*   **Eigenvalues**: Factoring `λ(1 - λ²) = 0` gives the eigenvalues `λ = 0`, `λ = 1`, and `λ = -1`.\nThis confirms that 0 is a possible result.\n\n**4. Step 2: Find the Eigenvector for λ = 0**\nWe need to find the vector `|v₀⟩` such that `P|v₀⟩ = 0`. Let `|v₀⟩ = [x, y, z]^T`.\n*   **Matrix Equation**: `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]^T = [0, 0, 0]^T`\n*   **System of Equations**:\n    1.  `(1/√2)y = 0`  ⇒ `y = 0`\n    2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` ⇒ `x + z = 0` ⇒ `x = -z`\n*   **Eigenvector Form**: The eigenvector is of the form `[c, 0, -c]^T`. We can choose a simple, unnormalized representative by setting `c=1`, so `|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]^T`.\n\n**5. Step 3: Calculate the Components for the Probability Formula**\nWe use the unnormalized vectors `|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]^T` and `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T`.\n\n*   **Inner Product `⟨v₀|ψ⟩`**:\n    `⟨v₀|ψ⟩ = (1)*(-1) + (0)*(2) + (-1)*(1) = -1 - 1 = -2`.\n    The squared magnitude is `|⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² = (-2)² = 4`.\n\n*   **Squared Norm of the Eigenvector `⟨v₀|v₀⟩`**:\n    `⟨v₀|v₀⟩ = (1)² + (0)² + (-1)² = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\n*   **Squared Norm of the State Vector `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`**:\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + (2)² + (1)² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n\n**6. Step 4: Calculate the Final Probability**\nNow, we plug these values into the formula:\n`Prob(0) = |⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v₀|v₀⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩) = 4 / (2 * 6) = 4 / 12 = 1/3`.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Normalization**: It is crucial to account for the fact that the given state vector `|ψ⟩` is not normalized. The chosen eigenvector `|v₀⟩` was also not normalized. The formula used correctly handles this by dividing by the squared norms of both vectors. Forgetting this is a common error.\n*   **Algebraic Accuracy**: The calculations for the determinant, eigenvector, and inner products must be performed carefully to avoid simple arithmetic mistakes.\n*   **Matching to Options**: After arriving at the numerical answer `1/3`, it is essential to correctly match it to the given options. `1/3` corresponds to option C.

This is done by solving the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n`det([[ -λ, 1/√2,  0 ], [1/√2,  -λ, 1/√2], [ 0, 1/√2,  -λ]]) = -λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = -λ³ + λ`\nSetting `-λ³ + λ = 0` gives `λ(1 - λ²) = 0`, so the eigenvalues are `λ = 0, 1, -1`. Thus, 0 is a possible measurement outcome.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Find the correct eigenvector.**\nWe need to find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` corresponding to `λ = 0` by solving `P|v₀⟩ = 0`.\n`[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] [x, y, z]ᵀ = [0, 0, 0]ᵀ`\nThis gives the equations `(1/√2)y = 0` (so `y=0`) and `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` (so `x=-z`).\nThe eigenvector is of the form `[c, 0, -c]`. We can choose a simple, unnormalized eigenvector by setting `c=1`: `|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]ᵀ`.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Account for normalization.**\nThe given state vector `|ψ⟩` and our chosen eigenvector `|v₀⟩` are not normalized.

According to the postulates of quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of such a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator `P`. The probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue `λ` is the squared magnitude of the projection of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector.\n\nThe formula for this probability is:\n`Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|² / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩`\nwhere:\n*   `|ψ⟩` is the state vector of the system.\n*   `|v_λ⟩` is the normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ`.\n*   `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` is the squared norm of the state vector. This denominator is crucial because the given state vector may not be normalized.\n\n### Step 2: Find the Eigenvalues of the Operator P\n\nFirst, we must confirm that 0 is a possible measurement outcome by finding the eigenvalues of `P`. We solve the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n\n*   **Operator P**:\n    ```\n    [[0, 1/√2, 0],\n     [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],\n     [0, 1/√2, 0]]\n    ```\n*   **Characteristic Equation**:\n    `det([[ -λ, 1/√2,  0 ], [1/√2,  -λ, 1/√2], [ 0, 1/√2,  -λ]]) = 0`\n    ` -λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = 0`\n    ` -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = 0`\n    ` -λ³ + λ = 0`\n    ` λ(1 - λ²) = 0`\n\nThe eigenvalues are `λ = 0`, `λ = 1`, and `λ = -1`.\n**Careful Point 1**: Since 0 is an eigenvalue, it is a possible result of the measurement.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Eigenvector for the Eigenvalue λ = 0\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` that satisfies the equation `P|v₀⟩ = 0`. Let `|v₀⟩ = [x, y, z]ᵀ`.\n\n`[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] [x, y, z]ᵀ = [0, 0, 0]ᵀ`\n\nThis gives a system of linear equations:\n1.  `(1/√2)y = 0`  => `y = 0`\n2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\n\nThe eigenvector is of the form `[c, 0, -c]ᵀ`.\n**Careful Point 2**: We must use a normalized eigenvector for the probability calculation.

Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the probability that a measurement of the observable `P` on a system in state `|ψ⟩` will yield the value 0. According to the principles of quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of such a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator `P`. The probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue is the squared magnitude of the projection of the system's state vector onto the eigenvector corresponding to that eigenvalue.\n\n**2.

We must find the eigenvalues of `P` to confirm that 0 is among them.\n2.  **Find the corresponding eigenvector:** For the eigenvalue `λ = 0`, we must find its corresponding eigenvector, `|v₀⟩`.\n3.  **Calculate the probability:** The probability is the squared magnitude of the projection of the system's state vector `|ψ⟩` onto the eigenvector `|v₀⟩`.

Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the probability of measuring a specific value (an eigenvalue) for a given observable. This probability is found by projecting the system's state vector onto the eigenvector corresponding to that specific value. The formula is:\n`Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|² / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩`\nwhere `|ψ⟩` is the state vector, `|v_λ⟩` is the normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue `λ`, and `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` is the squared norm of the state vector (which is needed because `|ψ⟩` is not given as a normalized vector).\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n*   **Step a: Find the eigenvalues of the operator P to confirm 0 is a possible outcome.**\n    We need to solve the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n    `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n    `det([[ -λ, 1/√2,  0 ], [1/√2,  -λ, 1/√2], [ 0, 1/√2,  -λ]]) = 0`\n    Expanding the determinant:\n    `-λ((-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)) - (1/√2)((1/√2)(-λ) - 0) = 0`\n    `-λ(λ² - 1/2) + λ/2 = 0`\n    `-λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = 0`\n    `-λ³ + λ = 0`\n    `λ(1 - λ²) = 0`\n    The eigenvalues are `λ = 0`, `λ = 1`, and `λ = -1`.

The Underlying Principle**\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring an eigenvalue `λ` of an observable is the squared magnitude of the projection of the system's state vector onto the eigenvector corresponding to that eigenvalue. Since the given vectors may not be normalized, the general formula is:\n\n`Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `|ψ⟩` is the state vector of the system: `[-1, 2, 1]ᵀ`.\n*   `|v_λ⟩` is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ`.\n*   `⟨v_λ|ψ⟩` is the inner product of the two vectors.\n*   `⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩` and `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` are the squared norms of the respective vectors.\n\n**2. Careful Point 1: Verify that 0 is a possible outcome.**\nA measurement can only yield an eigenvalue of the observable's operator. We must first find the eigenvalues of `P` by solving the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n\n*   `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n*   The characteristic equation is `det([[ -λ, 1/√2,  0 ], [1/√2,  -λ, 1/√2], [ 0, 1/√2,  -λ]]) = 0`.\n*   This expands to `-λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = -λ³ + λ = 0`.\n*   Factoring gives `λ(1 - λ²) = 0`, so the eigenvalues are `λ = 0, 1, -1`.\n\nSince 0 is an eigenvalue, it is a possible measurement outcome.\n\n**3. Careful Point 2: Find the correct eigenvector.**\nWe need to find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ = 0` by solving `P|v₀⟩ = 0`.\n\n*   Let `|v₀⟩ = [x, y, z]ᵀ`.\n*   The matrix equation `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] [x, y, z]ᵀ = [0, 0, 0]ᵀ` gives a system of linear equations:\n    1.  `(1/√2)y = 0`  ⇒ `y = 0`\n    2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` ⇒ `x + z = 0` ⇒ `x = -z`\n*   The eigenvector is of the form `[c, 0, -c]`. We can choose a simple, unnormalized representative by setting `c = 1`, which gives `|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]ᵀ`.\n\n**4. Careful Point 3: Correctly calculate all components for the probability formula.**\nUsing the unnormalized eigenvector `|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]ᵀ` and the given state vector `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ`:\n\n*   **Numerator `|⟨v₀|ψ⟩|²`**:\n    *   The inner product is `⟨v₀|ψ⟩ = (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) = -1 - 1 = -2`.\n    *   The squared magnitude is `|-2|² = 4`.\n\n*   **Denominator `⟨v₀|v₀⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩`**:\n    *   The squared norm of the eigenvector is `⟨v₀|v₀⟩ = 1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2`.\n    *   The squared norm of the state vector is `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n    *   The complete denominator is `2 * 6 = 12`.\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\nPlugging these values into the probability formula:\n\n`Prob(0) = 4 / 12 = 1/3`\n\nThe probability that the measurement will yield 0 is 1/3.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe mathematical calculation consistently yields a probability of 1/3.

Understand the Physical Principle**\nThe question asks for the probability of measuring a specific outcome (0) for an observable (`P`) when a quantum system is in a given state (`|ψ⟩`). According to the postulates of quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the observable's operator. The probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue `λ` is the squared magnitude of the projection of the state vector onto the eigenvector corresponding to that eigenvalue.\n\n**2. The Mathematical Formula**\nThe probability `Prob(λ)` can be calculated using the following formula, which correctly handles vectors that are not normalized:\n\n`Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `|ψ⟩` is the state vector of the system: `[-1, 2, 1]^T`.\n*   `|v_λ⟩` is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ`.\n*   `⟨v_λ|ψ⟩` is the inner product of the two vectors.\n*   `⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩` and `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` are the squared norms of the respective vectors.\n\n**3. Step 1: Find the Eigenvalues of P**\nThis step confirms that 0 is a possible measurement outcome. We must solve the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n*   **Operator P**: `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n*   **Characteristic Equation**: `det([[ -λ, 1/√2,  0 ], [1/√2,  -λ, 1/√2], [ 0, 1/√2,  -λ]]) = 0`\n*   **Solving the determinant**: `-λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ = 0`.\n*   **Eigenvalues**: Factoring `λ(1 - λ²) = 0` gives the eigenvalues `λ = 0`, `λ = 1`, and `λ = -1`.\nThis confirms that 0 is a possible result.\n\n**4. Step 2: Find the Eigenvector for λ = 0**\nWe need to find the vector `|v₀⟩` such that `P|v₀⟩ = 0`. Let `|v₀⟩ = [x, y, z]^T`.\n*   **Matrix Equation**: `[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]^T = [0, 0, 0]^T`\n*   **System of Equations**:\n    1.  `(1/√2)y = 0`  ⇒ `y = 0`\n    2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` ⇒ `x + z = 0` ⇒ `x = -z`\n*   **Eigenvector Form**: The eigenvector is of the form `[c, 0, -c]^T`. We can choose a simple, unnormalized representative by setting `c=1`, so `|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]^T`.\n\n**5. Step 3: Calculate the Components for the Probability Formula**\nWe use the unnormalized vectors `|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]^T` and `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T`.\n\n*   **Inner Product `⟨v₀|ψ⟩`**:\n    `⟨v₀|ψ⟩ = (1)*(-1) + (0)*(2) + (-1)*(1) = -1 - 1 = -2`.\n    The squared magnitude is `|⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² = (-2)² = 4`.\n\n*   **Squared Norm of the Eigenvector `⟨v₀|v₀⟩`**:\n    `⟨v₀|v₀⟩ = (1)² + (0)² + (-1)² = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\n*   **Squared Norm of the State Vector `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`**:\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + (2)² + (1)² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n\n**6. Step 4: Calculate the Final Probability**\nNow, we plug these values into the formula:\n`Prob(0) = |⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v₀|v₀⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩) = 4 / (2 * 6) = 4 / 12 = 1/3`.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Normalization**: It is crucial to account for the fact that the given state vector `|ψ⟩` is not normalized. The chosen eigenvector `|v₀⟩` was also not normalized. The formula used correctly handles this by dividing by the squared norms of both vectors. Forgetting this is a common error.\n*   **Algebraic Accuracy**: The calculations for the determinant, eigenvector, and inner products must be performed carefully to avoid simple arithmetic mistakes.\n*   **Matching to Options**: After arriving at the numerical answer `1/3`, it is essential to correctly match it to the given options. `1/3` corresponds to option C.

Since the given state vector and the chosen eigenvector may not be normalized, the general formula is:\n`Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\nwhere `|v_λ⟩` is the eigenvector for eigenvalue `λ`.\n\n### Careful Points and Calculation\n\n**Careful Point 1: Verify that 0 is an eigenvalue.**\nWe must first confirm that 0 is a possible outcome by finding the eigenvalues of `P`. This is done by solving the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n`det([[ -λ, 1/√2,  0 ], [1/√2,  -λ, 1/√2], [ 0, 1/√2,  -λ]]) = -λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = -λ³ + λ`\nSetting `-λ³ + λ = 0` gives `λ(1 - λ²) = 0`, so the eigenvalues are `λ = 0, 1, -1`. Thus, 0 is a possible measurement outcome.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Find the correct eigenvector.**\nWe need to find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` corresponding to `λ = 0` by solving `P|v₀⟩ = 0`.\n`[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] [x, y, z]ᵀ = [0, 0, 0]ᵀ`\nThis gives the equations `(1/√2)y = 0` (so `y=0`) and `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` (so `x=-z`).\nThe eigenvector is of the form `[c, 0, -c]`. We can choose a simple, unnormalized eigenvector by setting `c=1`: `|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]ᵀ`.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Account for normalization.**\nThe given state vector `|ψ⟩` and our chosen eigenvector `|v₀⟩` are not normalized.

According to the postulates of quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of such a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator `P`. The probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue `λ` is the squared magnitude of the projection of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector.\n\nThe formula for this probability is:\n`Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|² / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩`\nwhere:\n*   `|ψ⟩` is the state vector of the system.\n*   `|v_λ⟩` is the normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ`.\n*   `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` is the squared norm of the state vector. This denominator is crucial because the given state vector may not be normalized.\n\n### Step 2: Find the Eigenvalues of the Operator P\n\nFirst, we must confirm that 0 is a possible measurement outcome by finding the eigenvalues of `P`. We solve the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n\n*   **Operator P**:\n    ```\n    [[0, 1/√2, 0],\n     [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],\n     [0, 1/√2, 0]]\n    ```\n*   **Characteristic Equation**:\n    `det([[ -λ, 1/√2,  0 ], [1/√2,  -λ, 1/√2], [ 0, 1/√2,  -λ]]) = 0`\n    ` -λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = 0`\n    ` -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = 0`\n    ` -λ³ + λ = 0`\n    ` λ(1 - λ²) = 0`\n\nThe eigenvalues are `λ = 0`, `λ = 1`, and `λ = -1`.\n**Careful Point 1**: Since 0 is an eigenvalue, it is a possible result of the measurement.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Eigenvector for the Eigenvalue λ = 0\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` that satisfies the equation `P|v₀⟩ = 0`. Let `|v₀⟩ = [x, y, z]ᵀ`.\n\n`[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] [x, y, z]ᵀ = [0, 0, 0]ᵀ`\n\nThis gives a system of linear equations:\n1.  `(1/√2)y = 0`  => `y = 0`\n2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\n\nThe eigenvector is of the form `[c, 0, -c]ᵀ`.\n**Careful Point 2**: We must use a normalized eigenvector for the probability calculation. Let's choose `c = 1` to get a simple unnormalized vector `[1, 0, -1]ᵀ` and normalize it.\n*   Squared norm = `1² + 0² + (-1)² = 2`.\n*   The normalized eigenvector `|v₀⟩` is `(1/√2) * [1, 0, -1]ᵀ`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Probability\n\nNow we apply the probability formula `Prob(0) = |⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩`.\n\n*   **State Vector**: `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ`.\n*   **Calculate the squared norm of the state vector `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`**:\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n    **Careful Point 3**: It is essential to include this normalization factor because the initial state `|ψ⟩` is not normalized.\n\n*   **Calculate the inner product `⟨v₀|ψ⟩`**:\n    `⟨v₀|ψ⟩ = ( (1/√2) * [1, 0, -1] ) · [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ`\n    `= (1/√2) * [ (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) ]`\n    `= (1/√2) * (-1 - 1) = -2/√2 = -√2`.\n\n*   **Calculate the squared magnitude `|⟨v₀|ψ⟩|²`**:\n    `|⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² = (-√2)² = 2`.\n\n*   **Calculate the final probability**:\n    `Prob(0) = |⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 2 / 6 = 1/3`.\n\nThe probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 is 1/3.

Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the probability that a measurement of the observable `P` on a system in state `|ψ⟩` will yield the value 0. According to the principles of quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of such a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator `P`. The probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue is the squared magnitude of the projection of the system's state vector onto the eigenvector corresponding to that eigenvalue.\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information**\n*   **State vector:** `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]^T` (a column matrix).\n*   **Observable operator:** `P` =\n    ```\n    [[0,   1/√2,  0  ],\n     [1/√2, 0,   1/√2],\n     [0,   1/√2,  0  ]]\n    ```\n*   **Value to be measured:** The eigenvalue `λ = 0`.\n\n**3. The General Formula for Probability**\nThe probability `Prob(λ)` of measuring an eigenvalue `λ` of an observable `P` for a system in a state `|ψ⟩` is given by the formula:\n`Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\nwhere:\n*   `|v_λ⟩` is any non-zero eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ`.\n*   `⟨v_λ|ψ⟩` is the inner product of the eigenvector and the state vector.\n*   `⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩` is the squared norm of the eigenvector.\n*   `⟨ψ|ψ⟩` is the squared norm of the state vector.\nThis formula correctly handles the case where the vectors are not normalized.\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 1: Find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` for the eigenvalue `λ = 0`.**\nFirst, we must confirm that 0 is an eigenvalue. We solve the characteristic equation `det(P - λI) = 0`.\n`det(P - λI) = -λ(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = -λ³ + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ`.\nSetting this to zero, `λ(1 - λ²) = 0`, gives the eigenvalues `λ = 0, 1, -1`. So, 0 is a valid outcome.\n\nNow, we find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩ = [x, y, z]^T` by solving `P|v₀⟩ = 0|v₀⟩ = 0`.\n```\n[[0,   1/√2,  0  ],\n [1/√2, 0,   1/√2],\n [0,   1/√2,  0  ]] * [x, y, z]^T = [0, 0, 0]^T\n```\nThis gives a system of linear equations:\n1.  `(1/√2)y = 0`  => `y = 0`\n2.  `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0` => `x + z = 0` => `x = -z`\n\nThe eigenvector has the form `[c, 0, -c]^T`. We can choose a simple, unnormalized eigenvector by setting `c=1`:\n`|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]^T`.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the required norms and inner products.**\n*   **Inner product `⟨v₀|ψ⟩`:**\n    `⟨v₀|ψ⟩ = [1, 0, -1] · [-1, 2, 1]^T = (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) = -1 - 1 = -2`.\n\n*   **Squared norm of the eigenvector `⟨v₀|v₀⟩`:**\n    `⟨v₀|v₀⟩ = 1² + 0² + (-1)² = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`.\n\n*   **Squared norm of the state vector `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`:**\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the final probability.**\nNow we plug these values into the general probability formula:\n`Prob(0) = |⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v₀|v₀⟩ * ⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\n`Prob(0) = |-2|² / (2 * 6)`\n`Prob(0) = 4 / 12`\n`Prob(0) = 1/3`\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 is 1/3. This corresponds to option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nTo decide the final answer, I will analyze the problem step-by-step, highlighting the key principles and calculations.

According to the postulates of quantum mechanics, this requires the following steps:\n\n1.  **Confirm 0 is a possible outcome:** The possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the observable's operator. We must find the eigenvalues of `P` to confirm that 0 is among them.\n2.  **Find the corresponding eigenvector:** For the eigenvalue `λ = 0`, we must find its corresponding eigenvector, `|v₀⟩`.\n3.  **Calculate the probability:** The probability is the squared magnitude of the projection of the system's state vector `|ψ⟩` onto the eigenvector `|v₀⟩`. The formula must account for the fact that the given state vector `|ψ⟩` is not normalized.\n\nThe probability `Prob(λ)` is given by the formula:\n`Prob(λ) = |⟨v_λ|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v_λ|v_λ⟩⟨ψ|ψ⟩)`\nwhere `|v_λ⟩` is the unnormalized eigenvector and `|ψ⟩` is the unnormalized state vector.\n\n### Careful Points and Calculation\n\n*   **State Vector:** `|ψ⟩ = [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ`\n*   **Observable Operator:** `P = [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]`\n\n**1. Find the Eigenvector for λ = 0:**\nFirst, we must find the eigenvector `|v₀⟩` such that `P|v₀⟩ = 0`. Let `|v₀⟩ = [x, y, z]ᵀ`.\n```\n[[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]] * [x, y, z]ᵀ = [0, 0, 0]ᵀ\n```\nThis matrix equation gives a system of linear equations:\n*   From the first and third rows: `(1/√2)y = 0`, which implies `y = 0`.\n*   From the second row: `(1/√2)x + (1/√2)z = 0`, which implies `x + z = 0` or `x = -z`.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The eigenvector is of the form `[c, 0, -c]` for any non-zero constant `c`. We can choose a simple representative, such as `c=1`. So, an unnormalized eigenvector is `|v₀⟩ = [1, 0, -1]ᵀ`.\n\n**2. Calculate the Terms for the Probability Formula:**\n\n*   **Inner Product `⟨v₀|ψ⟩`:**\n    `⟨v₀|ψ⟩ = [1, 0, -1] ⋅ [-1, 2, 1]ᵀ = (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) = -1 - 1 = -2`.\n\n*   **Squared Magnitude of the Inner Product `|⟨v₀|ψ⟩|²`:**\n    `|⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² = |-2|² = 4`.\n\n*   **Squared Norm of the Eigenvector `⟨v₀|v₀⟩`:**\n    `⟨v₀|v₀⟩ = 1² + 0² + (-1)² = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\n*   **Squared Norm of the State Vector `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`:**\n    **Careful Point 2:** The given state vector is not normalized, so we must calculate its norm. Forgetting this step is a common error.\n    `⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Final Probability:**\nNow, we plug these values into the formula:\n`Prob(0) = |⟨v₀|ψ⟩|² / (⟨v₀|v₀⟩⟨ψ|ψ⟩) = 4 / (2 * 6) = 4 / 12 = 1/3`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe calculation consistently and correctly yields a probability of `1/3`.\n\n**Matching with Options:**\nThe provided options are:\nA) 2/3\nB) √2/3\nC) 1\nD) 1/3\n\n**Careful Point 3:** The final step is to correctly match the calculated value to the given options.
