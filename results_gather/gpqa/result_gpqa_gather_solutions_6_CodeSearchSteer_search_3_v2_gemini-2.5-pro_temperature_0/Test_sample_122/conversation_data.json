Part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference. From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60 000 km/s (sixty thousand kilometers per second) towards it.\nWhat distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\n\n(Note: Gravity can be ignored, and rotation and revolution of the Galaxy can be ignored.)\n\nA) 3 060 000 km.\nB) 2 940 000 km.\nC) 2 880 000 km.\nD) 3 000 000 km.\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics Principle:** The supernova ejecta is moving at a velocity of 60,000 km/s. The speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. The ejecta's speed is therefore `60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2` times the speed of light (20% of c). At such high speeds, the effects of special relativity are significant and must be accounted for. The key principle to apply is **time dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. The question asks for the distance traveled as measured in this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame. The 50-second time interval is measured in this frame.\n\n3.  **Identify Given Information and the Goal:**\n    *   Relative velocity: `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Time in the moving frame (proper time): `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock that is at rest within its own reference frame.\n    *   Goal: Calculate the distance `d` traveled by the ejecta as measured in the Galaxy's frame. The formula is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame.\n\n4.  **Apply the Time Dilation Formula:**\n    According to special relativity, an observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) for an event that takes a proper time (`Δt₀`) in the moving frame. The relationship is:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    The Lorentz factor is calculated using the formula:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    *   First, calculate the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, substitute this into the formula for `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Distance (`d`):**\n    We can combine the formulas to solve for the distance directly, which avoids intermediate rounding errors:\n    `d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀)`\n    `d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    `d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √0.96`\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96`\n    *   Calculating the final value:\n        `√0.96 ≈ 0.9798`\n        `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:**\n    The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this to the options provided in the question:\n    *   A) 2,880,000 km\n    *   B) 3,000,000 km\n    *   C) 2,940,000 km\n    *   D) 3,060,000 km\n\n    The calculated value of 3,061,862 km is closest to option **D) 3,060,000 km**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Relativistic vs. Classical Calculation:** A common mistake is to ignore relativity and use the classical formula `distance = velocity × time`. This would give `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`, which corresponds to option B. This is incorrect because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light.\n*   **Proper Time Identification:** It is crucial to correctly identify that the 50 seconds is the \"proper time\" (`Δt₀`) because it is measured in the moving frame of the ejecta.\n*   **Correct Application of the Lorentz Factor:** Time in the stationary frame is always *dilated* (longer) than the proper time. Therefore, one must multiply the proper time by `γ` (which is greater than 1). A common error is to invert the factor (i.e., multiply by `1/γ`), which would imply time \"contraction\" and lead to an incorrect answer of `3,000,000 * √0.96 ≈ 2,939,388 km`, which is close to option C.\n*   **Logical Check:** Because of time dilation, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame must be *longer* than 50 seconds. Therefore, the distance traveled as measured from the Galaxy must be *greater* than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km. Looking at the options, only D (3,060,000 km) is greater than 3,000,000 km. This logical check strongly confirms that D is the only plausible answer, even without performing the full calculation.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nBased on the analysis of the provided answers and a step-by-step re-evaluation of the problem, here is the definitive solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principle:** The velocity of the ejecta is `v = 60,000 km/s`. The speed of light is `c ≈ 300,000 km/s`. The ejecta's velocity is `v/c = 0.2`, or 20% of the speed of light. This is a relativistic speed, meaning the principles of special relativity, specifically **time dilation**, must be used.\n\n2.  **Define Reference Frames and Proper Time:**\n    *   **Galaxy Frame (S):** This is the \"stationary\" frame of reference from which the distance needs to be measured.\n    *   **Ejecta Frame (S'):** This is the \"moving\" frame of reference.\n    *   **Proper Time (`Δt₀`):** The 50 seconds is measured in the ejecta's frame. Time measured by a clock in its own rest frame is called proper time. Therefore, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n\n3.  **Apply Time Dilation:** An observer in the stationary Galaxy frame (S) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) than the proper time measured in the moving ejecta frame (S'). The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v * Δt`. To find this, we must first calculate `Δt` using the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):** The Lorentz factor quantifies the effect of time dilation.\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    Substituting the ratio `v/c = 0.2`:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Distance:** Now we can calculate the distance (`d`) in the Galaxy's frame.\n    `d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀)`\n    Substituting the known values and the expression for gamma:\n    `d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    `d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √0.96`\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96`\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this to the provided options:\n    *   **A) 3,060,000 km**\n    *   B) 2,880,000 km\n    *   C) 2,940,000 km\n    *   D) 3,000,000 km\n\n    The calculated value is closest to **A) 3,060,000 km**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Non-Relativistic Error:** A common mistake is to ignore relativity and use the classical formula `distance = velocity × time`. This would give `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`, which corresponds to option D. This is incorrect because relativistic effects are significant.\n*   **Logical Check:** Due to time dilation, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) must be *longer* than the 50 seconds of proper time. Therefore, the distance traveled (`d = v * Δt`) must be *greater* than the non-relativistic distance of 3,000,000 km. Of the choices provided, only option A (3,060,000 km) is greater than 3,000,000 km. This logical check strongly confirms that A is the only plausible answer.\n*   **Incorrect Formula Application:** Another potential error is to invert the Lorentz factor, which would imply time \"contraction\" instead of dilation. This would lead to a calculation of `3,000,000 * √0.96 ≈ 2,939,388 km`, which is close to option C and is physically incorrect.\n\nThe unanimous conclusion from all correct analyses is that the distance is approximately 3,061,862 km, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this special relativity problem by first identifying the correct physical principle, which is time dilation.

Identify the Core Physical Principle**\nThe problem involves an object, the supernova ejecta, moving at a velocity of 60,000 km/s. This is 20% of the speed of light (c ≈ 300,000 km/s), a speed at which relativistic effects are significant. Therefore, the principles of Special Relativity, specifically **time dilation**, must be used instead of classical mechanics.\n\n**2. Define the Frames of Reference and Given Information**\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. The question asks for the distance traveled as measured in this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time elapsed in the moving frame (measured by a clock on the ejecta) is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock at rest within its own reference frame.\n\n**3.

This would give `60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`, which corresponds to option C. This is incorrect because the speed is relativistic.\n*   **Proper Time Identification:** It is essential to correctly identify the 50 seconds as the \"proper time\" (`Δt₀`) because it is measured in the moving frame. Confusing the two time variables (`Δt` and `Δt₀`) would lead to an incorrect result.\n*   **Time Dilation vs. Length Contraction:** This problem is about how time is measured differently, so time dilation is the correct principle. Incorrectly applying the length contraction formula (`L = L₀ * √(1 - v²/c²)`) would lead to a distance of `3,000,000 * √0.96 ≈ 2,940,000 km`, which corresponds to option A.\n*   **Logical Check:** Due to time dilation, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) must be *longer* than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame. Therefore, the distance traveled as measured from the Galaxy (`d = v * Δt`) must be *greater* than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km.

This is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock at rest within its own reference frame.\n    *   **Speed of Light (c):** The speed of light is approximately `c = 300,000 km/s`.\n\n2.  **Apply the Principle of Time Dilation:**\n    From the perspective of an observer in the stationary Galaxy frame, time for the moving ejecta will appear to pass more slowly.

Therefore, the Lorentz factor `γ` (which is > 1) must be used as a multiplier for time (`Δt = γ * Δt₀`). Incorrectly inverting this would lead to a distance smaller than 3,000,000 km, such as option C (`~2,940,000 km`), which is physically incorrect.\n*   **Logical Check:** Because of time dilation, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame must be longer than 50 seconds.

At such speeds, relativistic effects are measurable. The key principle is **time dilation**, which states that a clock in a moving reference frame appears to run slower when observed from a stationary reference frame.\n\n2.  **Define Frames and Variables:**\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. The goal is to find the distance (`d`) traveled in this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n    *   **Relative Velocity (`v`):** `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   **Proper Time (`Δt₀`):** The time elapsed in the moving frame is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock at rest within its own frame.\n\n3.  **Apply Time Dilation:** The distance in the Galaxy's frame is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy's frame. Time dilation relates `Δt` to `Δt₀` using the Lorentz factor (`γ`):\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (`γ`):** The formula for the Lorentz factor is:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    *   First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, calculate `γ`:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Distance (`d`):** We can combine the formulas to solve for the distance directly, which avoids intermediate rounding errors:\n    `d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀)`\n    `d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    `d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √0.96`\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96`\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated distance of approximately **3,061,862 km** is closest to option **C) 3,060,000 km**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Non-Relativistic Error:** A common mistake is to ignore relativity and use the classical formula `d = v * t`. This gives `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`, which corresponds to option D. This is incorrect because relativistic effects cannot be ignored.\n*   **Logical Check:** Due to time dilation, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) must be *longer* than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame. Therefore, the distance traveled as measured from the Galaxy (`d = v * Δt`) must be *greater* than the non-relativistic distance of 3,000,000 km. Looking at the options, only C (3,060,000 km) is greater than 3,000,000 km. This logical check confirms that C is the only plausible answer.\n*   **Incorrect Formula Application:** Another potential error is to misapply the Lorentz factor by multiplying instead of dividing (i.e., calculating `d = (v * Δt₀) * √(1 - v²/c²)`). This would imply time \"contraction\" instead of dilation and would yield a result of approximately 2,940,000 km (Option B), which is physically incorrect.\n\nBoth the precise calculation and the logical deduction point to the same conclusion.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nThis problem requires the application of the special theory of relativity, specifically the concept of time dilation, as the ejecta is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physics:** The velocity of the ejecta is 60,000 km/s, which is 20% of the speed of light (c ≈ 300,000 km/s).

To find this, we must first calculate `Δt` using the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):** The Lorentz factor quantifies the effect of time dilation.\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    Substituting the ratio `v/c = 0.2`:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Distance:** Now we can calculate the distance (`d`) in the Galaxy's frame.\n    `d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀)`\n    Substituting the known values and the expression for gamma:\n    `d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    `d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √0.96`\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96`\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n6.  **Compare with Options:** The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**.

This would give `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`, which corresponds to option D. This is incorrect because relativistic effects are significant.\n*   **Logical Check:** Due to time dilation, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) must be *longer* than the 50 seconds of proper time. Therefore, the distance traveled (`d = v * Δt`) must be *greater* than the non-relativistic distance of 3,000,000 km. Of the choices provided, only option A (3,060,000 km) is greater than 3,000,000 km. This logical check strongly confirms that A is the only plausible answer.\n*   **Incorrect Formula Application:** Another potential error is to invert the Lorentz factor, which would imply time \"contraction\" instead of dilation. This would lead to a calculation of `3,000,000 * √0.96 ≈ 2,939,388 km`, which is close to option C and is physically incorrect.\n\nThe unanimous conclusion from all correct analyses is that the distance is approximately 3,061,862 km, which corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nMy plan is to solve this special relativity problem by first identifying the correct physical principle, which is time dilation.

Identify the Core Physical Principle**\nThe problem involves an object, the supernova ejecta, moving at a velocity of 60,000 km/s. This is 20% of the speed of light (c ≈ 300,000 km/s), a speed at which relativistic effects are significant. Therefore, the principles of Special Relativity, specifically **time dilation**, must be used instead of classical mechanics.\n\n**2. Define the Frames of Reference and Given Information**\n*   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. The question asks for the distance traveled as measured in this frame.\n*   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n*   **Relative Velocity (v):** The velocity of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy is `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n*   **Proper Time (Δt₀):** The time elapsed in the moving frame (measured by a clock on the ejecta) is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is the \"proper time\" because it is measured by a clock at rest within its own reference frame.\n\n**3. Formulate the Calculation**\nThe goal is to find the distance (`d`) the ejecta travels as measured in the Galaxy's frame. The formula for distance is `d = v * Δt`, where `Δt` is the time elapsed as measured in the Galaxy's frame.\n\nDue to time dilation, the time `Δt` measured in the stationary Galaxy frame is longer than the proper time `Δt₀`. The relationship is given by the formula:\n`Δt = γ * Δt₀`\nwhere `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\nThe Lorentz factor is calculated as:\n`γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\nCombining these formulas, we can express the distance `d` as:\n`d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀) = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\n*   **Step A:** Calculate the non-relativistic distance, which is the numerator `v * Δt₀`.\n    `v * Δt₀ = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`\n*   **Step B:** Calculate the denominator `√(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   `v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2`\n    *   `v²/c² = 0.2² = 0.04`\n    *   `√(1 - v²/c²) = √(1 - 0.04) = √0.96`\n    *   `√0.96 ≈ 0.9798`\n*   **Step C:** Calculate the final relativistic distance `d`.\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96 ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n**5.

This means the 50 seconds that pass for the ejecta correspond to a longer duration, `Δt`, in the Galaxy's frame. The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is its velocity multiplied by this longer, dilated time: `d = v * Δt`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation:**\n    The relationship between the time in the stationary frame (`Δt`) and the proper time (`Δt₀`) is given by the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n    Combining these formulas, the distance `d` in the Galaxy's frame is:\n    `d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀) = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:**\n    The code interpreter has already performed this calculation precisely:\n    `d = (60,000 * 50) / √(1 - (60,000/300,000)²) = 3,000,000 / √0.96`\n    The output from the code execution is `3061862.18 km`.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:**\n    The calculated distance is `~3,061,862 km`.

This corresponds to option A. This is incorrect because the speed is relativistic.\n*   **Logical Deduction:** Due to time dilation, the time measured in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) must be *longer* than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame.

The speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. The ejecta's speed is therefore 20% of the speed of light (`v = 0.2c`). At such a high velocity, the effects of Einstein's special theory of relativity are significant and must be applied.

The speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. The ejecta's speed is therefore 20% of the speed of light (`v = 0.2c`), a significant fraction that requires the use of special relativity. The core concept needed is **time dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. The question asks for the distance traveled as measured in this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame. The 50-second interval is measured by a clock in this frame.\n\n3.  **Identify Given and Required Values:**\n    *   Relative velocity, `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   Time in the moving frame (proper time), `Δt' = 50 s`.\n    *   The distance in the Galaxy's frame, `d`, is what we need to find.\n\n4.  **Apply the Time Dilation Formula:**\n    From the perspective of the \"stationary\" Galaxy frame, time for the moving ejecta runs slower. This means that the 50 seconds that pass for the ejecta correspond to a longer time interval, `Δt`, in the Galaxy's frame. The distance we want to find is `d = v * Δt`.\n\n    The relationship between the two time intervals is given by the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt'`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):**\n    The formula for the Lorentz factor is `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`.\n    *   First, find the ratio `v/c`:\n        `v/c = 60,000 km/s / 300,000 km/s = 0.2`\n    *   Now, substitute this into the formula:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Distance (d):**\n    We can now combine the formulas to solve for the distance `d`:\n    `d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt')`\n    `d = (v * Δt') / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    *   The numerator is the non-relativistic distance: `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`.\n    *   The denominator is `√0.96`.\n    *   `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96`\n    *   `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:**\n    The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this to the provided options:\n    *   A) 3,060,000 km\n    *   B) 2,940,000 km\n    *   C) 3,000,000 km\n    *   D) 2,880,000 km\n\n    The calculated value is closest to **A) 3,060,000 km**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Relativistic vs. Classical Calculation:** A common mistake is to ignore relativity and simply calculate `distance = velocity × time`. This would give `60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km` (Option C). This is incorrect because the speed is relativistic.\n*   **Proper Time:** It is crucial to correctly identify that the 50 seconds is the \"proper time\" (`Δt'`) because it is measured by a clock in the moving frame.\n*   **Time Dilation Direction:** Time in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is always *longer* than the proper time (`Δt'`). The Lorentz factor `γ` is always greater than or equal to 1. An error would be to think time contracts, which would lead to a distance *smaller* than 3,000,000 km (like Option B).\n*   **Logical Check:** Since time in the Galaxy's frame is dilated (longer than 50s), the distance traveled must be greater than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km. Looking at the options, only A (3,060,000 km) is greater than 3,000,000 km. This simple check confirms that A is the only plausible answer.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nThis is a classic problem in special relativity.

The speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. The ejecta's speed is `v = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2c`, or 20% of the speed of light. At such a high velocity, the effects of special relativity are significant and must be accounted for. The key principle that applies here is **time dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define the Frames of Reference:**\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. We need to find the distance the ejecta travels as measured from this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame. A time of 50 seconds is measured in this frame.\n\n3.  **Identify Proper Time:** The time interval of 50 seconds is measured by a clock moving along with the ejecta. A time interval measured in the rest frame of the event is called the **proper time** (`Δt₀`). Therefore, `Δt₀ = 50 s`.\n\n4.  **Apply Time Dilation:** According to the principle of time dilation, an observer in the stationary frame (the Galaxy) will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) for the event than the proper time measured in the moving frame. The formula is:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Lorentz Factor (γ):** The Lorentz factor quantifies the strength of the relativistic effect.\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    Plugging in the value `v/c = 0.2`:\n    `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame:** The distance (`d`) is the velocity (`v`) multiplied by the time elapsed in the *same* frame (`Δt`).\n    `d = v * Δt`\n    Substituting the formulas for `Δt` and `γ`:\n    `d = v * (γ * Δt₀) = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n    Now, we plug in the numerical values:\n    `d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √0.96`\n    `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96`\n    `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798`\n    `d ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n7.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:** The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**.

This would give `60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km`, which corresponds to option D. This is incorrect because it neglects time dilation.\n*   **Logical Deduction:** Due to time dilation, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) must be *longer* than the 50 seconds measured in the ejecta's frame. Therefore, the distance traveled as measured from the Galaxy (`d = v * Δt`) must be *greater* than the non-relativistic distance of 3,000,000 km. Looking at the options, only option A (3,060,000 km) is greater than 3,000,000 km. This logical check confirms that A is the only plausible answer, even without performing the full calculation.\n*   **Incorrect Formula Application:** Another potential error is to misapply the Lorentz factor (e.g., multiplying by `√0.96` instead of dividing). This would imply time \"contraction\" and lead to a distance smaller than 3,000,000 km (specifically, `~2,940,000 km`, which is option B). This is physically incorrect.\n\nThe analysis of all candidate answers shows a consensus on the correct physical method and the resulting numerical answer.

This is incorrect because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light.\n*   **Proper Time Identification:** It is crucial to recognize that the 50 seconds is the \"proper time\" (`Δt'`) because it is measured in the moving object's own reference frame.\n*   **Logical Check (Time Dilation):** Because of time dilation, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (`Δt`) must be *longer* than 50 seconds.

Applying the length contraction factor incorrectly (`multiplying by √0.96`) would lead to a distance of approximately 2,940,000 km (Option D), which is physically incorrect for this scenario.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer, incorporating the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principle:** The supernova ejecta is moving at a velocity of 60,000 km/s. The speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. The ejecta's speed is therefore 20% of the speed of light (`v = 0.2c`). At such a significant fraction of the speed of light, the effects of Einstein's special theory of relativity are measurable and must be applied. The key concept for this problem is **time dilation**.\n\n2.  **Define the Frames of Reference and Given Information:**\n    *   **Stationary Frame (S):** The Galaxy's reference frame. The goal is to find the distance traveled as measured in this frame.\n    *   **Moving Frame (S'):** The ejecta's reference frame.\n    *   **Relative Velocity (`v`):** `v = 60,000 km/s`.\n    *   **Proper Time (`Δt₀`):** The time elapsed in the moving frame is `Δt₀ = 50 s`. This is designated as the \"proper time\" because it is the time measured by a clock that is at rest within its own reference frame.\n\n3.  **Apply the Time Dilation Formula:**\n    According to special relativity, an observer in the stationary Galaxy frame will measure a longer time interval (`Δt`) for an event that takes a proper time (`Δt₀`) in the moving ejecta frame. The distance we want to find is `d = v * Δt`.\n\n    The relationship between the two time intervals is given by the time dilation formula:\n    `Δt = γ * Δt₀`\n    where `γ` (gamma) is the Lorentz factor.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   **First, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ):**\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n        Given `v/c = 0.2`, we have:\n        `γ = 1 / √(1 - 0.2²) = 1 / √(1 - 0.04) = 1 / √0.96`\n\n    *   **Next, calculate the distance (`d`) in the Galaxy's frame:**\n        We can combine the formulas to avoid intermediate rounding:\n        `d = v * Δt = v * (γ * Δt₀)`\n        `d = (v * Δt₀) / √(1 - v²/c²)`\n        `d = (60,000 km/s * 50 s) / √0.96`\n        `d = 3,000,000 km / √0.96`\n\n    *   **Finally, compute the numerical value:**\n        `√0.96 ≈ 0.9798`\n        `d ≈ 3,000,000 km / 0.9798 ≈ 3,061,862 km`\n\n5.  **Compare with Options and Conclude:**\n    The calculated distance is approximately **3,061,862 km**. Comparing this to the provided options:\n    *   A) 2,880,000 km\n    *   B) 3,060,000 km\n    *   C) 2,940,000 km\n    *   D) 3,000,000 km\n\n    The calculated value of 3,061,862 km is closest to option **B) 3,060,000 km**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Classical Mechanics Error:** A common mistake is to ignore relativity and use the classical formula `distance = velocity × time`. This gives `60,000 km/s × 50 s = 3,000,000 km`, which corresponds to option D. This is incorrect.\n*   **Proper Time Identification:** It is crucial to identify that the 50 seconds is the proper time (`Δt₀`) because it's measured in the moving frame.\n*   **Time Dilation vs. Contraction:** Time in the stationary frame (`Δt`) is always *longer* than the proper time. A conceptual error would be to think time contracts, which would involve multiplying by `√0.96` instead of dividing. This would incorrectly yield a distance of ~2,940,000 km (Option C).\n*   **Logical Check:** Because of time dilation, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame must be *longer* than 50 seconds. Therefore, the distance traveled must be *greater* than the classical distance of 3,000,000 km. Looking at the options, only option B (3,060,000 km) is greater than 3,000,000 km. This logical check confirms that B is the only plausible answer, even without performing the full calculation.\n\nThe unanimous conclusion from all correct analyses is that the distance is slightly over 3,060,000 km.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
