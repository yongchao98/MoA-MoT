  "question": "**Task**: Decide the final answer based on the following answers from other agents.\n\n**Question**:\nYou have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Identify the chemical formula of this unknown compound as either C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.\n\nA) C6H12O\nB) C6H12O2\nC) C6H10O2\nD) C6H10O\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<A>>>\n\n**Candidate answers from several methods**:\n\nAnswer 1:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Evidence\n\nThe first step is to interpret the data from each analytical technique to identify the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** combined with a **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is the O-H stretch, which is extremely broad due to strong hydrogen bonding, and the peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n    *   A **strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an **alkene**.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of **\"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\"** is direct, unambiguous evidence of a C=C double bond, as vinyl hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of the double bond. This corroborates the FTIR data.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a classic diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ fragment (Carbon=12 + Oxygen=16 + Oxygen=16 + Hydrogen=1 = 45). This provides strong, independent confirmation of the -COOH group.\n\n### Step 2: Synthesize the Evidence and Establish Requirements\n\nThe combined data from all three techniques consistently and conclusively show that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This means the correct molecular formula must satisfy two key criteria:\n\n1.  **Oxygen Count:** It must contain a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which requires **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** It must contain one C=O double bond and one C=C double bond. Each double bond counts as one degree of unsaturation, so the molecule must have a **total DoU of 2**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options against these two requirements. The formula for DoU is `C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C6H12O:** Contains 1 oxygen. **Incorrect.**\n*   **B) C6H10O:** Contains 1 oxygen. **Incorrect.**\n*   **C) C6H10O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2 (✓ Correct)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2** (✓ Correct, accounts for both C=O and C=C)\n*   **D) C6H12O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2 (✓ Correct)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1** (✗ Incorrect, not enough for both C=O and C=C)\n\nThe only formula that meets all the requirements derived from the spectroscopic data is **C6H10O2**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Converging Evidence:** The evidence for the carboxylic acid is exceptionally strong, as it is confirmed by three separate pieces of data (broad O-H stretch, C=O stretch, and the m/z=45 fragment). Similarly, the alkene is confirmed by two techniques (C=C stretch and vinyl hydrogens).\n*   **Quantitative Check:** The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is a crucial quantitative check. While both C6H10O2 and C6H12O2 have the correct number of oxygen atoms, only C6H10O2 has the required DoU of 2 to accommodate both the carbonyl and alkene double bonds.\n*   **Mapping Formula to Option:** A review of the candidate answers shows that while the chemical reasoning is almost universally correct in identifying C6H10O2 as the formula, a common error is incorrectly mapping this formula to the lettered choice. Based on the question's list, C6H10O2 corresponds to option C.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe spectroscopic data unambiguously identifies the compound as an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The only formula that has the required two oxygen atoms and the two degrees of unsaturation to account for both the carbonyl and alkene double bonds is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting the most critical points.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Evidence\nThe first step is to interpret the data from each analytical technique to identify the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   The combination of a **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** (O-H stretch) and a **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** (C=O stretch) is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The broadness of the O-H peak is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The **strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an **alkene**.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of **\"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\"** is direct and unambiguous evidence confirming the presence of a **C=C double bond**. This corroborates the FTIR data.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   The **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a classic diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group cation, **[COOH]⁺** (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45). This provides strong, independent confirmation of the -COOH group.\n\n### Step 2: Synthesize the Evidence and Establish Requirements\nThe combined data from all three techniques consistently and conclusively show that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. Therefore, the correct molecular formula must satisfy two key criteria:\n\n1.  **Oxygen Count:** It must contain a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which requires **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** It must contain one C=O double bond (from the acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). Each double bond counts as one degree of unsaturation, so the molecule must have a **total DoU of 2**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas\nNow, we evaluate the original options against these two requirements. The formula for the Degree of Unsaturation is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C6H12O:**\n    *   Fails Requirement 1: Has only one oxygen atom.\n*   **B) C6H12O2:**\n    *   Passes Requirement 1: Has two oxygen atoms.\n    *   Fails Requirement 2: DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1. This only accounts for the C=O bond, not the C=C bond.\n*   **C) C6H10O:**\n    *   Fails Requirement 1: Has only one oxygen atom.\n*   **D) C6H10O2:**\n    *   Passes Requirement 1: Has two oxygen atoms.\n    *   Passes Requirement 2: DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This perfectly accounts for both the C=O and C=C double bonds.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Converging Evidence:** The identification of the carboxylic acid is exceptionally strong because it is supported by three independent pieces of data (broad O-H stretch, C=O stretch, and the m/z=45 fragment).\n*   **Filtering Logic:** The most efficient way to solve the problem is to first use the oxygen count to eliminate half the options, and then use the Degree of Unsaturation to distinguish between the remaining two.\n*   **Mapping the Answer:** A common source of error in the candidate answers was incorrectly mapping the correct formula (C6H10O2) to the lettered choices. It is essential to refer back to the original question's list of options.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence—the presence of a carboxylic acid group, an alkene group, two oxygen atoms, and two degrees of unsaturation—is **C6H10O2**. According to the options provided in the question, this corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Synthesize the Spectroscopic Evidence\nThe first step is to consolidate the interpretation of the raw data, which is consistent across almost all candidate answers.\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** The combination of a very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ (O-H stretch), a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ (C=O stretch), and a strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ (C=C stretch) points unambiguously to an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The presence of \"vinyl-hydrogens\" provides direct, corroborating evidence for the **alkene (C=C)** functional group.\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:** The fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic diagnostic peak for the **[COOH]⁺ fragment**, strongly confirming the presence of a carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion from Data:** The unknown compound must contain both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n### Step 2: Establish Requirements for the Molecular Formula\nBased on the functional groups identified in Step 1, the correct molecular formula must satisfy two non-negotiable criteria:\n1.  **Oxygen Count:** A carboxylic acid group contains **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The molecule contains one C=O double bond and one C=C double bond. Each double bond counts as one degree of unsaturation. Therefore, the molecule must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Options Against the Requirements\nWe will now systematically test each option against the two criteria. The formula for the Degree of Unsaturation is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C6H12O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1 (Fails, not a carboxylic acid)\n*   **B) C6H12O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2 (Passes)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. (Fails, cannot have both a C=O and a C=C bond)\n*   **C) C6H10O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1 (Fails, not a carboxylic acid)\n*   **D) C6H10O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2 (Passes)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. (Passes, can have both a C=O and a C=C bond)\n\nOnly the formula **C6H10O2** satisfies all conditions derived from the spectroscopic data.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Strength of Evidence:** The conclusion is very robust because multiple, independent pieces of data from three different techniques all point to the same functional groups (unsaturated carboxylic acid). For example, the carboxylic acid is confirmed by FTIR (broad O-H and C=O peaks) and Mass Spec (m/z=45 fragment). The alkene is confirmed by FTIR (C=C peak) and ¹H NMR (vinyl hydrogens).\n2.  **Quantitative Check:** The Degree of Unsaturation is a crucial quantitative check. While both C6H12O2 and C6H10O2 have the correct number of oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid, only C6H10O2 has the required DoU of 2 to also include the alkene double bond.\n3.  **Mapping Formula to Choice:** The most significant source of error in the candidate answers is incorrectly mapping the correct chemical formula (C6H10O2) to the lettered choice. The question explicitly lists the options as A) C6H12O, B) C6H12O2, C) C6H10O, and D) C6H10O2. Therefore, the correct formula, C6H10O2, corresponds to option **D**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe analysis of the spectroscopic data leads to the definitive conclusion that the compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The only molecular formula that has the required two oxygen atoms and two degrees of unsaturation is C6H10O2, which is option D.\n\n```python\n# The reasoning is based on chemical principles, not a direct calculation.\n# The final decision is based on the analysis above.\n\n# Step 1: Identify functional groups from spectroscopic data.\n# - FTIR (broad 3000 cm-1, 1700 cm-1) + Mass Spec (m/z=45) => Carboxylic Acid (-COOH)\n# - FTIR (1650 cm-1) + 1H NMR (vinyl hydrogens) => Alkene (C=C)\n\n# Step 2: Determine requirements for the molecular formula.\n# - Requirement 1: Must have 2 oxygen atoms (from -COOH).\n# - Requirement 2: Must have a Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 2 (one for C=O, one for C=C).\n\n# Step 3: Evaluate the options.\n# Options: A) C6H12O, B) C6H12O2, C) C6H10O, D) C6H10O2\n\n# - A) C6H12O: 1 oxygen (FAIL)\n# - B) C6H12O2: 2 oxygens (PASS), DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 1 (FAIL)\n# - C) C6H10O: 1 oxygen (FAIL)\n# - D) C6H10O2: 2 oxygens (PASS), DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2 (PASS)\n\n# Step 4: Conclude the correct choice.\n# The only formula that satisfies all criteria is C6H10O2.\n# This corresponds to option D.\n\nfinal_answer = \"D\"\nprint(f\"The analysis of the spectroscopic data indicates the presence of an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\")\nprint(f\"The only formula with the correct number of oxygen atoms (2) and the correct degree of unsaturation (2) is C6H10O2.\")\nprint(f\"This corresponds to option {final_answer}.\")\nprint(f\"Final Answer Choice: {final_answer}\")\n\n```\n<<<D>>>\nCode Interpreter running results:\nCode output: The analysis of the spectroscopic data indicates the presence of an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\nThe only formula with the correct number of oxygen atoms (2) and the correct degree of unsaturation (2) is C6H10O2.\nThis corresponds to option D.\nFinal Answer Choice: D\n\nErrors: \n\n---\n\nAnswer 4:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n**1. Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum**\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic and definitive signature for the O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is a result of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The combination of this peak with the broad O-H stretch confirms the carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an **alkene**.\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation explicitly confirms the presence of an alkene functional group, corroborating the FTIR data.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum**\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺. (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45). This provides strong, independent evidence for the carboxylic acid group.\n\n**4. Synthesis of Data and Evaluation of Options**\nThe combined data from all three techniques conclusively show that the unknown compound contains both a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** group and an **alkene (C=C)** group. Based on this, we can establish two strict requirements for the correct molecular formula.\n\n*   **Requirement 1: Oxygen Count.** A carboxylic acid group requires **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates any options with only one oxygen atom.\n    *   Eliminate B) C6H10O and C) C6H12O.\n    *   The remaining options are A) C6H10O2 and D) C6H12O2.\n\n*   **Requirement 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU).** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The C=C double bond of the alkene accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule must have a total of **two** degrees of unsaturation.\n\nNow, we calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **For A) C6H10O2:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n    This formula has two oxygen atoms and two degrees of unsaturation. It perfectly matches all the spectroscopic evidence.\n\n*   **For D) C6H12O2:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    This formula has two oxygen atoms but only one degree of unsaturation. It could be a saturated carboxylic acid, but it cannot also have the C=C double bond confirmed by the spectra.\n\n**Careful Points**\n1.  The combination of the very broad O-H stretch (FTIR), the C=O stretch (FTIR), and the m/z=45 fragment (Mass Spec) provides overwhelming evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n2.  The C=C stretch (FTIR) and the vinyl hydrogens (¹H NMR) provide corroborating evidence for an alkene.\n3.  The problem is definitively solved by applying the principles of atom count (requiring two oxygens) and Degree of Unsaturation (requiring a DoU of 2).\n4.  It is crucial to correctly map the derived formula, C6H10O2, to the corresponding lettered option provided in the question.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the provided data is C6H10O2. According to the question's list of options, this corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Data\nThe first step is to interpret the data from each analytical technique to identify the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   The combination of a **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** (O-H stretch) and a **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** (C=O stretch) is the definitive signature of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The extreme broadness of the O-H peak is a key feature caused by strong hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The **strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of \"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\" is direct and unambiguous evidence of a **C=C double bond**. This confirms the conclusion drawn from the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   The **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a classic diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl fragment, **[COOH]⁺** (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45). This provides strong, independent confirmation of the -COOH group.\n\n### Step 2: Synthesize the Evidence\nAll three pieces of spectroscopic evidence converge on a single conclusion: the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This means the molecule must contain both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Requirements for the Chemical Formula\nBased on the identified functional groups, the correct chemical formula must satisfy two critical criteria:\n\n1.  **Oxygen Count:** A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU represents the total number of pi bonds and rings. The evidence shows one C=O double bond (from the acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). Therefore, the molecule must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas\nNow, we evaluate the given options against these two requirements using the formula for Degree of Unsaturation: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C6H12O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2 (✓ Consistent with carboxylic acid)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. (✗ Inconsistent. This DoU only accounts for the C=O bond, not the required C=C bond).\n\n*   **B) C6H10O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1 (✗ Inconsistent. Not a carboxylic acid).\n\n*   **C) C6H12O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1 (✗ Inconsistent. Not a carboxylic acid).\n\n*   **D) C6H10O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2 (✓ Consistent with carboxylic acid)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. (✓ Consistent. This DoU perfectly accounts for both the C=O and C=C double bonds).\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Interpreting Combined Spectra:** The evidence for the carboxylic acid is exceptionally strong because it is supported by three independent pieces of data: the broad O-H stretch (FTIR), the C=O stretch (FTIR), and the m/z = 45 fragment (Mass Spec).\n*   **Corroborating Evidence:** The evidence for the alkene is also strong, with the C=C stretch in the FTIR being directly confirmed by the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the ¹H NMR.\n*   **Using Degree of Unsaturation:** The DoU calculation is the definitive quantitative check. After the oxygen count eliminates two options, the DoU calculation is the tool that distinguishes between the final two possibilities.\n*   **Mapping Formula to Option:** It is crucial to correctly map the derived formula (C6H10O2) to the corresponding lettered option provided in the question. In this case, C6H10O2 is option D.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence—the presence of a carboxylic acid group, an alkene group, two oxygen atoms, and two degrees of unsaturation—is **C6H10O2**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Functional Groups\n\nThe first step is to interpret the data from each analytical technique to understand the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   The combination of a **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** (O-H stretch) and a **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** (C=O stretch) is the definitive signature of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The extreme broadness of the O-H peak is a classic characteristic caused by strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n    *   The **strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, which indicates the presence of an **alkene**.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of \"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\" is direct, unambiguous evidence of a **C=C double bond**. Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of a double bond, and their presence confirms the conclusion from the FTIR data.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   The **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a highly diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group cation, **[COOH]⁺** (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45). This provides strong, independent confirmation of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n### Step 2: Synthesize the Evidence and Establish Requirements\n\nThe combined data from all three techniques consistently and conclusively show that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. Therefore, the correct molecular formula must satisfy two key requirements:\n\n1.  **It must contain two oxygen atoms** to form the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n2.  **It must have a Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 2**. This accounts for the two pi bonds identified: one from the C=O in the carboxylic acid and one from the C=C in the alkene.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas\n\nWe will now test each of the given options against these two requirements. The formula for the Degree of Unsaturation is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C6H10O2:**\n    *   **Oxygen Count:** 2 (✓ Consistent with a carboxylic acid).\n    *   **DoU Calculation:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2** (✓ Consistent with one C=O and one C=C bond).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This formula perfectly matches all experimental evidence.\n\n*   **B) C6H12O:**\n    *   **Oxygen Count:** 1 (✗ Inconsistent with a carboxylic acid).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This formula is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) C6H10O:**\n    *   **Oxygen Count:** 1 (✗ Inconsistent with a carboxylic acid).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This formula is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) C6H12O2:**\n    *   **Oxygen Count:** 2 (✓ Consistent with a carboxylic acid).\n    *   **DoU Calculation:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1** (✗ Inconsistent. This DoU only accounts for the C=O bond, not the required C=C bond).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This formula is incorrect as it cannot be an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Point 1: Interpreting Combined Evidence:** The strength of the conclusion comes from multiple techniques pointing to the same functional groups. The carboxylic acid is confirmed by FTIR (broad O-H and C=O peaks) and Mass Spec (m/z 45 fragment). The alkene is confirmed by FTIR (C=C peak) and ¹H NMR (vinyl hydrogens).\n*   **Point 2: Using Atom Count for Elimination:** The requirement of two oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid is a simple but powerful first step that immediately eliminates half of the options.\n*   **Point 3: Using Degree of Unsaturation for Final Decision:** The DoU calculation is the definitive quantitative step that distinguishes between the final two options. It confirms that the correct formula must accommodate two pi bonds.\n\nBased on this comprehensive analysis, the only chemical formula that fits all the experimental evidence is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Functional Groups\n\nThe first step is to interpret the data from each analytical technique to build a picture of the molecule's structure.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   The combination of a **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** (O-H stretch) and a **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** (C=O stretch) is the definitive signature of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group.

This provides strong, independent confirmation of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n**Conclusion from Data:** All three techniques consistently show that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n### Step 2: Establish Requirements for the Molecular Formula\n\nBased on the identified functional groups, the correct molecular formula must satisfy two key criteria:\n\n1.  **Oxygen Count:** The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) requires the molecule to contain exactly **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU represents the total number of pi bonds and rings. The evidence shows one C=O double bond (from the acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). Therefore, the molecule must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options against these two requirements using the DoU formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C6H12O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1. **Incorrect.** Does not match the requirement for a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **B) C6H12O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2. (✓)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. **Incorrect.** This DoU is insufficient; it can only account for the C=O bond, not the C=C bond.\n\n*   **C) C6H10O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2. (✓)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. (✓) **This formula perfectly matches all requirements.**\n\n*   **D) C6H10O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1. **Incorrect.** Does not match the requirement for a carboxylic acid.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Interpreting Combined Data:** The strength of the conclusion comes from using all three pieces of data together. The FTIR and Mass Spec both strongly indicate a carboxylic acid, while the FTIR and ¹H NMR both strongly indicate an alkene.\n*   **Oxygen Count as a First Filter:** The identification of a carboxylic acid immediately eliminates any formulas with only one oxygen atom, simplifying the problem.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation as the Decisive Factor:** The DoU calculation is the crucial final step to differentiate between the remaining possibilities. It provides a quantitative check that confirms the molecule must contain two pi bonds.\n*   **Avoiding Common Pitfalls:** It is important not to confuse the broad O-H peak of a carboxylic acid with that of an alcohol. The simultaneous presence of the strong C=O peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ and the m/z=45 fragment are definitive for the carboxylic acid.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence—the presence of a carboxylic acid group (two oxygens, one C=O bond) and an alkene group (one C=C bond)—is C6H10O2. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting the critical points.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Data\nThe first step is to interpret the data from each analytical technique to identify the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   The combination of a **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** (O-H stretch) and a **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** (C=O stretch) is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group.

It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group cation, **[COOH]⁺** (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45). This provides strong, independent confirmation of the -COOH group.\n\n**Conclusion from Data:** All three techniques consistently and conclusively indicate that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n### Step 2: Establish Requirements for the Chemical Formula\nBased on the identified functional groups, the correct chemical formula must satisfy two key criteria:\n\n1.  **Oxygen Count:** The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) means the molecular formula **must contain two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU represents the total number of pi bonds and rings.

Therefore, the molecule **must have a total DoU of 2**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas\nNow, we systematically evaluate the given options against these two requirements. The formula for the Degree of Unsaturation is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C6H10O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: **2** (✓ Consistent with a carboxylic acid).\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2** (✓ Consistent with one C=O and one C=C bond).\n    *   **This option is a perfect match for all evidence.**\n\n*   **B) C6H10O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: **1** (✗ Inconsistent with a carboxylic acid).\n\n*   **C) C6H12O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: **1** (✗ Inconsistent with a carboxylic acid).\n\n*   **D) C6H12O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: **2** (✓ Consistent with a carboxylic acid).\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1** (✗ Inconsistent. This DoU only accounts for the C=O bond, not the required C=C bond).\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Synthesizing Data:** The strength of the conclusion comes from combining all pieces of evidence. The FTIR, NMR, and Mass Spec data all corroborate each other to build a definitive profile of the molecule as an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n*   **Using All Requirements:** Both the oxygen count and the Degree of Unsaturation are necessary to find the unique answer. The oxygen count eliminates options B and C, while the DoU calculation definitively eliminates option D.\n*   **Mapping Formula to Option:** A common error seen in the candidate answers is correctly identifying the formula as C6H10O2 but then selecting the wrong letter. Based on the options provided in the question, the correct formula C6H10O2 corresponds to option A.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence—the presence of a carboxylic acid group (requiring 2 oxygens) and an alkene group (contributing to a total DoU of 2)—is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided spectroscopic data and candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Synthesize the Spectroscopic Evidence\nAll candidate answers correctly interpret the spectroscopic data. The key is to combine the information from all three techniques.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** The combination of a very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ (O-H stretch) and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ (C=O stretch) is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The additional strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, meaning the compound is an alkene.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The observation of \"vinyl-hydrogens\" explicitly confirms the presence of the **alkene (C=C)** group, corroborating the FTIR data.\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:** The fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic diagnostic peak for a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the mass of the **[COOH]⁺** fragment.\n\n**Conclusion from Data:** All evidence consistently points to the unknown compound being an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n### Step 2: Establish Requirements for the Chemical Formula\nBased on the conclusion from the data, the correct molecular formula must satisfy two non-negotiable criteria:\n\n1.  **Oxygen Count:** The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) requires the molecule to contain exactly **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU represents the total number of pi bonds and rings. The molecule has one C=O double bond (from the acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). Therefore, the molecule must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas\nWe will now test each of the given options against these two requirements. The formula for DoU is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\nThe options are:\nA) C6H12O\nB) C6H12O2\nC) C6H10O2\nD) C6H10O\n\n*   **A) C6H12O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1.

This would be a saturated carboxylic acid, but our compound is unsaturated).\n*   **C) C6H10O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2. (Passes Requirement 1)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 2. (Passes Requirement 2. This perfectly matches an unsaturated carboxylic acid).\n*   **D) C6H10O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1. (Fails Requirement 1)\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion and Careful Points\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The reasoning across all candidate answers is overwhelmingly correct in identifying the compound as an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The calculation of the Degree of Unsaturation is the critical step that distinguishes between the two formulas containing two oxygen atoms (C6H12O2 and C6H10O2). Only C6H10O2 has the required DoU of 2.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** Several candidate answers have the correct reasoning but select the wrong final letter. This is likely due to clerical errors or inconsistent labeling of the options in their internal processing. Based on the options provided in the question prompt, the correct formula C6H10O2 corresponds to option C.\n\nThe only formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 10:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Evidence\n\nThe first step is to interpret the data from each analytical technique to identify the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   The combination of a **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** (O-H stretch) and a **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** (C=O stretch) is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group.

The oxygen count rule eliminates B and D, and the DoU rule eliminates C.\n3.  **Mapping Formula to Option:** The only formula that satisfies all experimental evidence is C6H10O2. It is crucial to correctly map this formula to the corresponding lettered option provided in the question. C6H10O2 is listed as option A. Many of the candidate answers correctly identified the formula but failed at this final mapping step.\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis, the only chemical formula that fits all the experimental evidence is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct and Interpret the Spectroscopic Evidence\n\nThe first step is to analyze the data from each characterization technique to identify the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   The combination of a **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** (O-H stretch) and a **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** (C=O stretch) is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group.

This provides strong, independent confirmation of the -COOH group.\n\n### Step 2: Synthesize the Evidence and Establish Requirements\n\nThe combined data from all three techniques consistently and conclusively show that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This means the correct molecular formula must satisfy two key criteria:\n\n1.  **Oxygen Count:** It must contain a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which requires the formula to have **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** It must contain one C=O double bond (from the acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene).

This DoU of 2 perfectly matches our requirements, accounting for both the C=O and C=C double bonds.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Final Verification.** The only formula that is consistent with all pieces of spectroscopic evidence is C6H10O2. It has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and the two degrees of unsaturation required for a structure containing both a carbonyl and an alkene. This formula corresponds to option C in the provided list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Evidence\nThe solution requires a systematic interpretation of each piece of data to build a picture of the unknown molecule's structure.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   The combination of a **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** (O-H stretch) and a **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** (C=O stretch) is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The broadness of the O-H peak is a classic indicator of the strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n    *   The **strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an **alkene**.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of \"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\" is direct, unambiguous evidence that confirms the presence of a **C=C double bond**. Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   The **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a highly diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group cation, [COOH]⁺ (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45). This provides strong, independent confirmation of the -COOH group.\n\n### Step 2: Synthesize the Evidence and Establish Requirements\nThe combined data from all three techniques conclusively show that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. Therefore, the correct molecular formula must satisfy two key requirements:\n\n1.  **Oxygen Count:** It must contain a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which requires **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** It must contain one C=O double bond (from the acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). Each double bond counts as one degree of unsaturation, so the molecule must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas\nWe will now test each of the given options against these two requirements. The formula for the Degree of Unsaturation is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C6H10O2:**\n    *   **Oxygen Count:** 2 (✓ Consistent with a carboxylic acid).\n    *   **DoU Calculation:** 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2** (✓ Consistent with one C=O and one C=C bond).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This formula is a perfect match for all the evidence.\n\n*   **B) C6H10O:**\n    *   **Oxygen Count:** 1 (✗ Inconsistent with a carboxylic acid).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This formula is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) C6H12O:**\n    *   **Oxygen Count:** 1 (✗ Inconsistent with a carboxylic acid).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This formula is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) C6H12O2:**\n    *   **Oxygen Count:** 2 (✓ Consistent with a carboxylic acid).\n    *   **DoU Calculation:** 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1** (✗ Inconsistent. This DoU only accounts for the C=O bond, not the required C=C bond).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This formula is incorrect.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Interpreting Combinations:** The key to the FTIR analysis is recognizing the *combination* of the very broad 3000 cm⁻¹ peak and the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak as the signature of a carboxylic acid, not just an alcohol and a ketone.\n*   **Corroborating Evidence:** The conclusion is very strong because the evidence is corroborated across multiple techniques (e.g., the alkene is seen in both FTIR and NMR; the carboxylic acid is seen in both FTIR and Mass Spec).\n*   **Quantitative Check:** The Degree of Unsaturation is a crucial quantitative check. After the oxygen count narrows the options down to two, the DoU calculation is the definitive step that identifies the correct answer.\n*   **Mapping Formula to Option:** It is essential to correctly map the derived formula (C6H10O2) to the corresponding lettered option provided in the question, which is A.\n\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to decide the final answer based on the provided information.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Functional Groups\n\nThe first step is to interpret the data from each analytical technique to understand the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   The combination of a **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** (O-H stretch) and a **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** (C=O stretch) is the definitive signature of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The extreme broadness of the O-H peak is a classic characteristic caused by strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n    *   The **strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, which indicates the presence of an **alkene**.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of \"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\" is direct, unambiguous evidence of a **C=C double bond**. Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of a double bond, and their presence confirms the conclusion from the FTIR data.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   The **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a highly diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group cation, **[COOH]⁺** (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45). This provides strong, independent confirmation of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n**Conclusion from Data:** All three techniques consistently and conclusively show that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n### Step 2: Establish Requirements for the Molecular Formula\n\nBased on the identified functional groups, the correct molecular formula must satisfy two key requirements:\n\n1.  **Oxygen Count:** It must contain a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which requires the formula to have **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** It must have a Degree of Unsaturation of 2. This accounts for the two pi bonds identified: one from the C=O in the carboxylic acid and one from the C=C in the alkene.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas\n\nWe will now test each of the given options against these two requirements. The formula for the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\nThe options are:\nA) C6H12O\nB) C6H12O2\nC) C6H10O2\nD) C6H10O\n\n*   **A) C6H12O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1. **Incorrect.** Fails the oxygen count requirement for a carboxylic acid.\n*   **B) C6H12O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2.

(Passes)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. **Correct.** This formula perfectly matches all experimental evidence.\n*   **D) C6H10O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1. **Incorrect.** Fails the oxygen count requirement for a carboxylic acid.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Convergence of Evidence:** The conclusion is exceptionally strong because multiple, independent pieces of data from three different techniques all point to the same functional groups. The carboxylic acid is confirmed by FTIR (broad O-H and C=O peaks) and Mass Spec (m/z=45 fragment). The alkene is confirmed by FTIR (C=C peak) and ¹H NMR (vinyl hydrogens).\n2.  **Systematic Elimination:** The most logical approach is to first use the oxygen count to eliminate options A and D. Then, the Degree of Unsaturation calculation is used as the decisive factor to distinguish between the remaining options, B and C.\n3.  **The Decisive Role of DoU:** The Degree of Unsaturation is the crucial quantitative check. While both C6H12O2 and C6H10O2 have the correct number of oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid, only C6H10O2 has the required DoU of 2 to also include the alkene double bond confirmed by the spectra.\n4.  **Mapping Formula to Choice:** The chemical reasoning across the candidate answers is almost universally correct. However, many selected the wrong letter. It is critical to map the correct chemical formula (C6H10O2) back to the original list of options provided in the question.

Similarly, the alkene is confirmed by two techniques (C=C stretch and vinyl hydrogens).\n*   **Quantitative Check:** The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is a crucial quantitative check.

The alkene is confirmed by FTIR (C=C peak) and ¹H NMR (vinyl hydrogens).\n2.  **Quantitative Check:** The Degree of Unsaturation is a crucial quantitative check.

Analysis of the FTIR Spectrum**\n*   **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:** This is a classic and definitive signature for the O-H stretching vibration in a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)**. The extreme broadness is a result of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹:** This peak is in the typical range for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The combination of this peak with the broad O-H stretch confirms the carboxylic acid functional group.\n*   **Strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹:** This peak is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an **alkene**.\n*   **Conclusion from FTIR:** The compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n**2. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **Peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:** Vinyl hydrogens are protons directly attached to the carbons of a C=C double bond. This observation explicitly confirms the presence of an alkene functional group, corroborating the FTIR data.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum**\n*   **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:** This is a very common and diagnostic fragment for carboxylic acids. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group fragment, [COOH]⁺. (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45). This provides strong, independent evidence for the carboxylic acid group.\n\n**4. Synthesis of Data and Evaluation of Options**\nThe combined data from all three techniques conclusively show that the unknown compound contains both a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** group and an **alkene (C=C)** group. Based on this, we can establish two strict requirements for the correct molecular formula.\n\n*   **Requirement 1: Oxygen Count.** A carboxylic acid group requires **two oxygen atoms**. This immediately eliminates any options with only one oxygen atom.\n    *   Eliminate B) C6H10O and C) C6H12O.\n    *   The remaining options are A) C6H10O2 and D) C6H12O2.\n\n*   **Requirement 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU).** The DoU indicates the total number of rings and/or pi bonds (double or triple bonds) in a molecule.\n    *   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The C=C double bond of the alkene accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule must have a total of **two** degrees of unsaturation.\n\nNow, we calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **For A) C6H10O2:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**.\n    This formula has two oxygen atoms and two degrees of unsaturation. It perfectly matches all the spectroscopic evidence.\n\n*   **For D) C6H12O2:**\n    DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**.\n    This formula has two oxygen atoms but only one degree of unsaturation. It could be a saturated carboxylic acid, but it cannot also have the C=C double bond confirmed by the spectra.\n\n**Careful Points**\n1.  The combination of the very broad O-H stretch (FTIR), the C=O stretch (FTIR), and the m/z=45 fragment (Mass Spec) provides overwhelming evidence for a carboxylic acid.\n2.  The C=C stretch (FTIR) and the vinyl hydrogens (¹H NMR) provide corroborating evidence for an alkene.\n3.  The problem is definitively solved by applying the principles of atom count (requiring two oxygens) and Degree of Unsaturation (requiring a DoU of 2).\n4.  It is crucial to correctly map the derived formula, C6H10O2, to the corresponding lettered option provided in the question.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the provided data is C6H10O2. According to the question's list of options, this corresponds to option A.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Data\nThe first step is to interpret the data from each analytical technique to identify the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   The combination of a **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** (O-H stretch) and a **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** (C=O stretch) is the definitive signature of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The extreme broadness of the O-H peak is a key feature caused by strong hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The **strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, indicating the presence of an alkene.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of \"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\" is direct and unambiguous evidence of a **C=C double bond**. This confirms the conclusion drawn from the FTIR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   The **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a classic diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl fragment, **[COOH]⁺** (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45). This provides strong, independent confirmation of the -COOH group.\n\n### Step 2: Synthesize the Evidence\nAll three pieces of spectroscopic evidence converge on a single conclusion: the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This means the molecule must contain both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Requirements for the Chemical Formula\nBased on the identified functional groups, the correct chemical formula must satisfy two critical criteria:\n\n1.  **Oxygen Count:** A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU represents the total number of pi bonds and rings. The evidence shows one C=O double bond (from the acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). Therefore, the molecule must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas\nNow, we evaluate the given options against these two requirements using the formula for Degree of Unsaturation: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C6H12O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2 (✓ Consistent with carboxylic acid)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. (✗ Inconsistent. This DoU only accounts for the C=O bond, not the required C=C bond).\n\n*   **B) C6H10O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1 (✗ Inconsistent. Not a carboxylic acid).\n\n*   **C) C6H12O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1 (✗ Inconsistent. Not a carboxylic acid).\n\n*   **D) C6H10O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2 (✓ Consistent with carboxylic acid)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. (✓ Consistent. This DoU perfectly accounts for both the C=O and C=C double bonds).\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Interpreting Combined Spectra:** The evidence for the carboxylic acid is exceptionally strong because it is supported by three independent pieces of data: the broad O-H stretch (FTIR), the C=O stretch (FTIR), and the m/z = 45 fragment (Mass Spec).\n*   **Corroborating Evidence:** The evidence for the alkene is also strong, with the C=C stretch in the FTIR being directly confirmed by the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the ¹H NMR.\n*   **Using Degree of Unsaturation:** The DoU calculation is the definitive quantitative check. After the oxygen count eliminates two options, the DoU calculation is the tool that distinguishes between the final two possibilities.\n*   **Mapping Formula to Option:** It is crucial to correctly map the derived formula (C6H10O2) to the corresponding lettered option provided in the question. In this case, C6H10O2 is option D.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence—the presence of a carboxylic acid group, an alkene group, two oxygen atoms, and two degrees of unsaturation—is **C6H10O2**.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct chemical formula based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Functional Groups\n\nThe first step is to interpret the data from each analytical technique to understand the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   The combination of a **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** (O-H stretch) and a **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** (C=O stretch) is the definitive signature of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The extreme broadness of the O-H peak is a classic characteristic caused by strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n    *   The **strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, which indicates the presence of an **alkene**.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of \"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\" is direct, unambiguous evidence of a **C=C double bond**. Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of a double bond, and their presence confirms the conclusion from the FTIR data.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   The **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a highly diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group cation, **[COOH]⁺** (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45). This provides strong, independent confirmation of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n### Step 2: Synthesize the Evidence and Establish Requirements\n\nThe combined data from all three techniques consistently and conclusively show that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. Therefore, the correct molecular formula must satisfy two key requirements:\n\n1.  **It must contain two oxygen atoms** to form the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n2.  **It must have a Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) of 2**. This accounts for the two pi bonds identified: one from the C=O in the carboxylic acid and one from the C=C in the alkene.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas\n\nWe will now test each of the given options against these two requirements. The formula for the Degree of Unsaturation is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C6H10O2:**\n    *   **Oxygen Count:** 2 (✓ Consistent with a carboxylic acid).\n    *   **DoU Calculation:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2** (✓ Consistent with one C=O and one C=C bond).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This formula perfectly matches all experimental evidence.\n\n*   **B) C6H12O:**\n    *   **Oxygen Count:** 1 (✗ Inconsistent with a carboxylic acid).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This formula is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) C6H10O:**\n    *   **Oxygen Count:** 1 (✗ Inconsistent with a carboxylic acid).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This formula is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) C6H12O2:**\n    *   **Oxygen Count:** 2 (✓ Consistent with a carboxylic acid).\n    *   **DoU Calculation:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1** (✗ Inconsistent. This DoU only accounts for the C=O bond, not the required C=C bond).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This formula is incorrect as it cannot be an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Point 1: Interpreting Combined Evidence:** The strength of the conclusion comes from multiple techniques pointing to the same functional groups. The carboxylic acid is confirmed by FTIR (broad O-H and C=O peaks) and Mass Spec (m/z 45 fragment). The alkene is confirmed by FTIR (C=C peak) and ¹H NMR (vinyl hydrogens).\n*   **Point 2: Using Atom Count for Elimination:** The requirement of two oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid is a simple but powerful first step that immediately eliminates half of the options.\n*   **Point 3: Using Degree of Unsaturation for Final Decision:** The DoU calculation is the definitive quantitative step that distinguishes between the final two options. It confirms that the correct formula must accommodate two pi bonds.\n\nBased on this comprehensive analysis, the only chemical formula that fits all the experimental evidence is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 7:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Data to Identify Functional Groups\n\nThe first step is to interpret the data from each analytical technique to build a picture of the molecule's structure.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   The combination of a **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** (O-H stretch) and a **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** (C=O stretch) is the definitive signature of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The extreme broadness of the O-H peak is due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The **strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an **alkene**.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of \"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\" is direct, unambiguous evidence of a **C=C double bond**. This confirms the finding from the FTIR spectrum.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   A **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a classic diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. This mass corresponds to the [COOH]⁺ fragment (Atomic masses: C=12, O=16, H=1; Total = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45). This provides strong, independent confirmation of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n**Conclusion from Data:** All three techniques consistently show that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n### Step 2: Establish Requirements for the Molecular Formula\n\nBased on the identified functional groups, the correct molecular formula must satisfy two key criteria:\n\n1.  **Oxygen Count:** The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) requires the molecule to contain exactly **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU represents the total number of pi bonds and rings. The evidence shows one C=O double bond (from the acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). Therefore, the molecule must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options against these two requirements using the DoU formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C6H12O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1. **Incorrect.** Does not match the requirement for a carboxylic acid.\n\n*   **B) C6H12O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2. (✓)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. **Incorrect.** This DoU is insufficient; it can only account for the C=O bond, not the C=C bond.\n\n*   **C) C6H10O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2. (✓)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. (✓) **This formula perfectly matches all requirements.**\n\n*   **D) C6H10O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1. **Incorrect.** Does not match the requirement for a carboxylic acid.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Interpreting Combined Data:** The strength of the conclusion comes from using all three pieces of data together. The FTIR and Mass Spec both strongly indicate a carboxylic acid, while the FTIR and ¹H NMR both strongly indicate an alkene.\n*   **Oxygen Count as a First Filter:** The identification of a carboxylic acid immediately eliminates any formulas with only one oxygen atom, simplifying the problem.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation as the Decisive Factor:** The DoU calculation is the crucial final step to differentiate between the remaining possibilities. It provides a quantitative check that confirms the molecule must contain two pi bonds.\n*   **Avoiding Common Pitfalls:** It is important not to confuse the broad O-H peak of a carboxylic acid with that of an alcohol. The simultaneous presence of the strong C=O peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ and the m/z=45 fragment are definitive for the carboxylic acid.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence—the presence of a carboxylic acid group (two oxygens, one C=O bond) and an alkene group (one C=C bond)—is C6H10O2. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 8:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting the critical points.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Data\nThe first step is to interpret the data from each analytical technique to identify the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   The combination of a **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** (O-H stretch) and a **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** (C=O stretch) is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group.

The FTIR, NMR, and Mass Spec data all corroborate each other to build a definitive profile of the molecule as an unsaturated carboxylic acid.\n*   **Using All Requirements:** Both the oxygen count and the Degree of Unsaturation are necessary to find the unique answer. The oxygen count eliminates options B and C, while the DoU calculation definitively eliminates option D.\n*   **Mapping Formula to Option:** A common error seen in the candidate answers is correctly identifying the formula as C6H10O2 but then selecting the wrong letter. Based on the options provided in the question, the correct formula C6H10O2 corresponds to option A.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence—the presence of a carboxylic acid group (requiring 2 oxygens) and an alkene group (contributing to a total DoU of 2)—is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 9:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided spectroscopic data and candidate answers.\n\n### Step 1: Synthesize the Spectroscopic Evidence\nAll candidate answers correctly interpret the spectroscopic data. The key is to combine the information from all three techniques.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:** The combination of a very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ (O-H stretch) and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ (C=O stretch) is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The additional strong peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ indicates a **carbon-carbon double bond (C=C)**, meaning the compound is an alkene.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The observation of \"vinyl-hydrogens\" explicitly confirms the presence of the **alkene (C=C)** group, corroborating the FTIR data.\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:** The fragment peak at m/z = 45 is a classic diagnostic peak for a carboxylic acid, corresponding to the mass of the **[COOH]⁺** fragment.\n\n**Conclusion from Data:** All evidence consistently points to the unknown compound being an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n### Step 2: Establish Requirements for the Chemical Formula\nBased on the conclusion from the data, the correct molecular formula must satisfy two non-negotiable criteria:\n\n1.  **Oxygen Count:** The presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) requires the molecule to contain exactly **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU represents the total number of pi bonds and rings.

Only C6H10O2 has the required DoU of 2.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** Several candidate answers have the correct reasoning but select the wrong final letter. This is likely due to clerical errors or inconsistent labeling of the options in their internal processing.

It is crucial to correctly map this formula to the corresponding lettered option provided in the question. C6H10O2 is listed as option A. Many of the candidate answers correctly identified the formula but failed at this final mapping step.\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis, the only chemical formula that fits all the experimental evidence is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 11:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct and Interpret the Spectroscopic Evidence\n\nThe first step is to analyze the data from each characterization technique to identify the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   The combination of a **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** (O-H stretch) and a **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** (C=O stretch) is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group.

It corresponds to the mass of the [COOH]⁺ fragment (Carbon=12 + Oxygen=16 + Oxygen=16 + Hydrogen=1 = 45). This provides strong, independent confirmation of the -COOH group.\n\n### Step 2: Synthesize the Evidence and Establish Requirements\n\nThe combined data from all three techniques consistently and conclusively show that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This means the correct molecular formula must satisfy two key criteria:\n\n1.  **Oxygen Count:** It must contain a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which requires the formula to have **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** It must contain one C=O double bond (from the acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene).

Then, use the Degree of Unsaturation calculation to definitively select the correct answer from the remaining two.\n*   **Option Mapping:** It is crucial to correctly map the derived formula (C6H10O2) to the corresponding lettered option from the original question. The correct formula is C6H10O2, which is listed as option C.\n\nThe only formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 12:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided spectroscopic data and candidate responses.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Data**\n\nThe first step is to interpret the data from each analytical technique to identify the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   A **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** combined with a **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** is the definitive signature of a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is the O-H stretch, broadened by strong hydrogen bonding, and the peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is the C=O (carbonyl) stretch.\n    *   A **strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an **alkene**.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of **\"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\"** is direct, unambiguous evidence confirming the presence of a C=C double bond, as vinyl hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of the double bond.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   The **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a classic diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group cation, [COOH]⁺ (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45).\n\n**Conclusion from Data:** All three techniques consistently and conclusively indicate that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Requirements for the Chemical Formula**\n\nBased on the identified functional groups, the correct chemical formula must satisfy two key criteria:\n\n1.  **Oxygen Count:** A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) contains **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** The DoU represents the total number of rings and pi bonds. The molecule has one C=O double bond (from the acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene), so it must have a **total DoU of 2**.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas**\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options against these two requirements. The formula for DoU is `C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C6H12O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2 (✓ Consistent with carboxylic acid).\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. (✗ Inconsistent. This DoU only accounts for the C=O bond, not the required C=C bond).\n\n*   **B) C6H12O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1 (✗ Inconsistent with a carboxylic acid).\n\n*   **C) C6H10O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1 (✗ Inconsistent with a carboxylic acid).\n\n*   **D) C6H10O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2 (✓ Consistent with carboxylic acid).\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. (✓ Consistent with one C=O and one C=C bond).\n    *   **This option is a perfect match for all the evidence.**\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Interpreting Combined Spectra:** The evidence for the carboxylic acid is exceptionally strong because it comes from three distinct spectral features: the broad O-H stretch (FTIR), the C=O stretch (FTIR), and the m/z=45 fragment (Mass Spec).\n2.  **Corroborating Evidence:** The presence of the alkene is also strongly supported by two independent techniques: the C=C stretch (FTIR) and the direct observation of vinyl hydrogens (¹H NMR).\n3.  **Oxygen Count as a First Filter:** The requirement of two oxygen atoms is a simple and powerful initial step that immediately eliminates options B and C.\n4.  **Degree of Unsaturation as the Decisive Factor:** The DoU calculation is the crucial quantitative step that definitively distinguishes between the final two candidates (A and D), proving that the molecule must contain two pi bonds.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence—the presence of a carboxylic acid group, an alkene group, two oxygen atoms, and two degrees of unsaturation—is C6H10O2. This corresponds to option D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 13:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided spectroscopic data and candidate responses.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Spectroscopic Evidence\n\nThe first step is to interpret the data from each analytical technique to identify the functional groups present in the unknown compound.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   The combination of a **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** (O-H stretch) and a **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** (C=O stretch) is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The extreme broadness of the O-H peak is a classic characteristic caused by strong hydrogen bonding.\n    *   The **strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an **alkene**.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of \"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\" is direct, unambiguous evidence of a **C=C double bond**. This corroborates the FTIR data.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   The **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a highly diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl cation, [COOH]⁺ (Atomic masses: C=12, O=16, H=1; Total = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45).\n\n### Step 2: Synthesize the Evidence and Establish Requirements\n\nThe data from all three techniques consistently and conclusively show that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This means the correct molecular formula must satisfy two key requirements:\n\n1.  **Oxygen Count:** It must contain a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which requires **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** It must contain one C=O double bond and one C=C double bond. Each double bond counts as one degree of unsaturation, so the molecule must have a **total DoU of 2**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas\n\nWe will now systematically evaluate the given options against these two requirements. The formula for the Degree of Unsaturation is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C6H10O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1. (Fails Requirement 1)\n\n*   **B) C6H12O:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 1. (Fails Requirement 1)\n\n*   **C) C6H10O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2. (Passes Requirement 1)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. (Passes Requirement 2)\n    *   **This formula is fully consistent with all spectroscopic evidence.**\n\n*   **D) C6H12O2:**\n    *   Oxygen Count: 2. (Passes Requirement 1)\n    *   DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. (Fails Requirement 2). A DoU of 1 can only account for the C=O bond, not the additional C=C bond.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Interpreting Combined Data:** The strength of the conclusion comes from using all pieces of data together. The FTIR, NMR, and Mass Spec results all corroborate each other, pointing to the same functional groups.\n*   **Oxygen Count as a First Filter:** The identification of a carboxylic acid immediately eliminates half of the options, simplifying the problem.\n*   **DoU as the Decisive Factor:** The Degree of Unsaturation is the quantitative tool that allows for a definitive choice between the final two options. It mathematically confirms whether a formula can support the number of double bonds and/or rings identified by spectroscopy.\n*   **Avoiding Clerical Errors:** Several candidate answers correctly deduced the formula as C6H10O2 but selected the wrong letter. It is crucial to map the correct formula to the corresponding option letter as presented in the question.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only chemical formula that has the required two oxygen atoms for a carboxylic acid and the two degrees of unsaturation for a carbonyl (C=O) and an alkene (C=C) is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 14:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer, synthesizing the reasoning from the provided candidate answers and highlighting all the careful points.\n\n### Step 1: Interpret the Spectroscopic Data\nThe first step is to translate the raw data from each characterization technique into information about the molecule's functional groups.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   The combination of a **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** (O-H stretch) and a **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** (C=O stretch) is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group.\n    *   The **strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), indicating the presence of an **alkene**.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of **\"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\"** is direct, unambiguous evidence that confirms the presence of the **alkene (C=C)** functional group, corroborating the FTIR data.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   The **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a classic diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl cation, **[COOH]⁺** (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45). This provides strong, independent confirmation of the -COOH group.\n\n### Step 2: Synthesize the Evidence\nThe combined data from all three techniques consistently and conclusively show that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. This means the molecule must contain both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an alkene group (C=C).\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas\nBased on the synthesized evidence, the correct molecular formula must satisfy two key criteria.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Oxygen Count.** The presence of a carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) dictates that the molecular formula **must contain exactly two oxygen atoms**. This allows us to immediately eliminate options with a different number of oxygens.\n    *   A) C6H12O (Incorrect - only one oxygen)\n    *   B) C6H10O (Incorrect - only one oxygen)\n    *   This leaves only options C) C6H10O2 and D) C6H12O2.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU).** The DoU represents the total number of pi bonds and rings in a molecule. The evidence requires a specific DoU.\n    *   The C=O double bond in the carboxylic acid accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The C=C double bond of the alkene accounts for **one** degree of unsaturation.\n    *   Therefore, the correct formula must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n    *   We now calculate the DoU for the remaining options using the formula: `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n        *   **For D) C6H12O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1**. This DoU is insufficient. It can only account for the C=O bond, but not the C=C bond confirmed by FTIR and NMR.\n        *   **For C) C6H10O2:** DoU = 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2**. This DoU of 2 perfectly matches our requirements, accounting for both the C=O and C=C double bonds.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Final Verification.** The only formula that is consistent with all pieces of spectroscopic evidence is C6H10O2. It has the two oxygen atoms required for a carboxylic acid and the two degrees of unsaturation required for a structure containing both a carbonyl and an alkene. This formula corresponds to option C in the provided list.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 15:\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Spectroscopic Evidence\nThe solution requires a systematic interpretation of each piece of data to build a picture of the unknown molecule's structure.\n\n*   **FTIR Spectrum:**\n    *   The combination of a **very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** (O-H stretch) and a **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** (C=O stretch) is a definitive signature for a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** functional group. The broadness of the O-H peak is a classic indicator of the strong hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acid molecules.\n    *   The **strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) stretch, indicating the presence of an **alkene**.\n\n*   **¹H NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The observation of \"peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens\" is direct, unambiguous evidence that confirms the presence of a **C=C double bond**. Vinyl hydrogens are protons attached directly to the carbons of a double bond.\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:**\n    *   The **fragment peak at m/z = 45** is a highly diagnostic fragment for a carboxylic acid. It corresponds to the mass of the carboxyl group cation, [COOH]⁺ (Mass = 12 for C + 16 for O + 16 for O + 1 for H = 45). This provides strong, independent confirmation of the -COOH group.\n\n### Step 2: Synthesize the Evidence and Establish Requirements\nThe combined data from all three techniques conclusively show that the unknown compound is an **unsaturated carboxylic acid**. Therefore, the correct molecular formula must satisfy two key requirements:\n\n1.  **Oxygen Count:** It must contain a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which requires **two oxygen atoms**.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** It must contain one C=O double bond (from the acid) and one C=C double bond (from the alkene). Each double bond counts as one degree of unsaturation, so the molecule must have a total **DoU of 2**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Candidate Formulas\nWe will now test each of the given options against these two requirements. The formula for the Degree of Unsaturation is `DoU = C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n\n*   **A) C6H10O2:**\n    *   **Oxygen Count:** 2 (✓ Consistent with a carboxylic acid).\n    *   **DoU Calculation:** 6 + 1 - (10/2) = 7 - 5 = **2** (✓ Consistent with one C=O and one C=C bond).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This formula is a perfect match for all the evidence.\n\n*   **B) C6H10O:**\n    *   **Oxygen Count:** 1 (✗ Inconsistent with a carboxylic acid).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This formula is incorrect.\n\n*   **C) C6H12O:**\n    *   **Oxygen Count:** 1 (✗ Inconsistent with a carboxylic acid).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This formula is incorrect.\n\n*   **D) C6H12O2:**\n    *   **Oxygen Count:** 2 (✓ Consistent with a carboxylic acid).\n    *   **DoU Calculation:** 6 + 1 - (12/2) = 7 - 6 = **1** (✗ Inconsistent. This DoU only accounts for the C=O bond, not the required C=C bond).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This formula is incorrect.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Interpreting Combinations:** The key to the FTIR analysis is recognizing the *combination* of the very broad 3000 cm⁻¹ peak and the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak as the signature of a carboxylic acid, not just an alcohol and a ketone.\n*   **Corroborating Evidence:** The conclusion is very strong because the evidence is corroborated across multiple techniques (e.g., the alkene is seen in both FTIR and NMR; the carboxylic acid is seen in both FTIR and Mass Spec).\n*   **Quantitative Check:** The Degree of Unsaturation is a crucial quantitative check. After the oxygen count narrows the options down to two, the DoU calculation is the definitive step that identifies the correct answer.\n*   **Mapping Formula to Option:** It is essential to correctly map the derived formula (C6H10O2) to the corresponding lettered option provided in the question, which is A.\n\nThe only chemical formula that is consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence is C6H10O2.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
