Calculate the final value:\n        $v_{21} = -\\frac{1}{7}c \\approx -0.1428c$\n    4.  The relative speed ($v_{rel}$) is the magnitude of this velocity.\n        $v_{rel} = |v_{21}| \\approx 0.1428c$\n    5.  Rounding to two decimal places, we get $v_{rel} = 0.14c$.\n\n**Part B: Calculating the Total Energy of the System ($E_{total}$)**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The total energy of a relativistic particle is not just its kinetic energy or its rest energy ($mc^2$), but the sum of both.

Sum the individual energies:\n        $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n    2.  $E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2 \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\n    3.

The relative speed (`v_rel`) between the two astronauts.\n2.  The total energy (`E`) of the system of two astronauts.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the relative speed (v_rel)**\n\n**Careful Point:** Since the speeds are relativistic (a significant fraction of the speed of light), we cannot use the simple classical formula for relative velocity (`v_rel = v1 - v2`). We must use the Einstein velocity subtraction formula.\n\n**Formula:** The relative velocity `v_rel` of an object with velocity `v1` as seen from a reference frame moving with velocity `v2` (when both velocities are in the same direction) is:\n`v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2) / c^2)`\n\n**Calculation:**\n1.  Substitute the given values `v1 = 0.6c` and `v2 = 0.5c` into the formula.\n    `v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2)`\n2.  Simplify the numerator:\n    `0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c`\n3.  Simplify the term in the denominator's parenthesis:\n    `(0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2 = 0.3 * c^2 / c^2 = 0.3`\n4.  Calculate the denominator:\n    `1 - 0.3 = 0.7`\n5.  Divide the numerator by the denominator:\n    `v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 = (1/7)c`\n6.  Convert the fraction to a decimal:\n    `v_rel ≈ 0.1428c`\n\nSo, the relative speed is approximately **0.14c**.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the total energy (E) of the system**\n\n**Careful Point:** The total energy of the system is the sum of the total relativistic energies of each astronaut. The total energy of a single moving particle is not its rest energy (`mc^2`) but `γmc^2`, where `γ` is the Lorentz factor.\n\n**Formulas:**\n*   Total energy of the system: `E = E1 + E2`\n*   Total relativistic energy of a particle: `E_particle = γ * m_rest * c^2`\n*   Lorentz factor: `γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)`\n\n**Calculation for Astronaut 1:**\n1.  Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ1` for astronaut 1 (`v1 = 0.6c`):\n    `γ1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25`\n2.  Calculate the total energy `E1` of astronaut 1 (`m1 = 2m`):\n    `E1 = γ1 * m1 * c^2 = 1.25 * (2m) * c^2 = 2.5 mc^2`\n\n**Calculation for Astronaut 2:**\n1.  Calculate the Lorentz factor `γ2` for astronaut 2 (`v2 = 0.5c`):\n    `γ2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.866 = 1.1547`\n2.  Calculate the total energy `E2` of astronaut 2 (`m2 = 3m`):\n    `E2 = γ2 * m2 * c^2 ≈ 1.1547 * (3m) * c^2 ≈ 3.464 mc^2`\n\n**Calculation for Total System Energy:**\n1.  Sum the energies of the two astronauts:\n    `E = E1 + E2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.464 mc^2`\n    `E = 5.964 mc^2`\n\nSo, the total energy of the system is approximately **5.96 mc^2**.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Answer Selection**\nOur calculated values are:\n*   `v_rel ≈ 0.14c`\n*   `E ≈ 5.96 mc^2`\n\nComparing these results with the given options:\nA) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2 (Incorrect energy)\nB) v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2 (Incorrect velocity and energy)\nC) v_rel = 0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2 (Incorrect velocity and energy)\nD) v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2 (Matches both our calculations)\n\nThe correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 20:\nThe problem asks for two quantities: the relative speed (`v_rel`) and the total energy (`E`) of a system of two astronauts.\n\n**1.

We must use the Lorentz velocity transformation formula for relative velocity.\n\n*   **Formula:** The relative velocity of object 2 as seen from object 1's reference frame ($v_{21}$) is given by:\n    $v_{21} = \\frac{v_2 - v_1}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Substitute the given values into the formula:\n        $v_{21} = \\frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n    2.

Calculate the final value:\n        $v_{21} = -\\frac{1}{7}c \\approx -0.1428c$\n    4.  The relative speed ($v_{rel}$) is the magnitude of this velocity.\n        $v_{rel} = |v_{21}| \\approx 0.1428c$\n    5.  Rounding to two decimal places, we get $v_{rel} = 0.14c$.\n\n**Part B: Calculating the Total Energy of the System ($E_{total}$)**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The total energy of a relativistic particle is not just its kinetic energy or its rest energy ($mc^2$), but the sum of both. The formula for the total energy of a single particle is $E = \\gamma mc^2$, where $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor. The total energy of the system is the sum of the total energies of the individual astronauts.\n\n*   **Formula:**\n    *   Total energy of a particle: $E = \\gamma mc^2$\n    *   Lorentz factor: $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$\n    *   Total energy of the system: $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2$\n\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 1:**\n    1.

Calculate the total energy of astronaut 1 ($E_1$):\n        $E_1 = \\gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = (1.25) \\times (2m) \\times c^2 = 2.5 mc^2$\n\n*   **Calculation for Astronaut 2:**\n    1.  Calculate the Lorentz factor for astronaut 2 ($\\gamma_2$):\n        $\\gamma_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (v_2/c)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.75}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}/2} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 1.1547$\n    2.  Calculate the total energy of astronaut 2 ($E_2$):\n        $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = (\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}) \\times (3m) \\times c^2 = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{3}}mc^2 = 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2 \\approx 3.464 mc^2$\n\n*   **Calculation for Total System Energy:**\n    1.  Sum the individual energies:\n        $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 2\\sqrt{3} mc^2$\n    2.  $E_{total} = (2.5 + 2\\sqrt{3}) mc^2 \\approx (2.5 + 3.464) mc^2 = 5.964 mc^2$\n    3.  Rounding to two decimal places, we get $E_{total} = 5.96 mc^2$.\n\n**4.

Simplify the term in the denominator's parenthesis:\n    `(0.6c * 0.5c) / c^2 = 0.3 * c^2 / c^2 = 0.3`\n4.  Calculate the denominator:\n    `1 - 0.3 = 0.7`\n5.

Analyze the Question and Identify Given Information**\n\n*   We have two astronauts moving in the same direction (+x direction).\n*   Astronaut 1: mass $m_1 = 2m$, velocity $v_1 = 0.6c$.\n*   Astronaut 2: mass $m_2 = 3m$, velocity $v_2 = 0.5c$.\n*   `c` is the speed of light.\n*   We need to find two quantities:\n    1.  The relative speed ($v_{rel}$) between the two astronauts.\n    2.  The total energy ($E_{total}$) of the system.\n\n**2. Calculate the Relative Speed ($v_{rel}$)**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Since the speeds are relativistic (a significant fraction of the speed of light), we cannot simply subtract the velocities (Galilean transformation: $0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c$). We must use the Einstein velocity subtraction formula for objects moving in the same direction.\n*   **Formula:** The formula for the relative velocity ($v_{rel}$) of object 1 with respect to object 2 is:\n    $v_{rel} = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \\frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}$\n*   **Step-by-step Calculation:**\n    1.  Substitute the given values into the formula:\n        $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \\frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}$\n    2.  Simplify the numerator:\n        $0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c$\n    3.  Simplify the denominator:\n        $1 - \\frac{0.3c^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7$\n    4.  Calculate the final relative speed:\n        $v_{rel} = \\frac{0.1c}{0.7} \\approx 0.142857c$\n    5.

Calculate the energy $E_2$:\n        $E_2 = \\gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \\approx 1.1547 \\times (3m) c^2 \\approx 3.4641 mc^2$\n\n*   **Step-by-step Calculation for Total Energy ($E_{total}$):**\n    1.  Sum the individual energies:\n        $E_{total} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2$\n    2.  $E_{total} = (2.5 + 3.4641) mc^2 = 5.9641 mc^2$\n    3.

The formula for the total relativistic energy of a single particle is:\n\n**E = γmc²**\n\nwhere:\n*   **γ (gamma)** is the Lorentz factor, calculated as **γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)**.\n*   **m** is the rest mass of the particle.\n*   **c** is the speed of light.\n\n**For the first astronaut (mass = 2m, velocity = 0.6c):**\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ₁):\n*   γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - (0.6c)²/c²)\n*   γ₁ = 1 / √(1 - 0.36)\n*   γ₁ = 1 / √0.64\n*   γ₁ = 1 / 0.8\n*   **γ₁ = 1.25**\n\nNow, calculate the energy (E₁) of the first astronaut:\n*   E₁ = γ₁ * (2m) * c²\n*   E₁ = 1.25 * 2m * c²\n*   **E₁ = 2.5mc²**\n\n**For the second astronaut (mass = 3m, velocity = 0.5c):**\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor (γ₂):\n*   γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - (0.5c)²/c²)\n*   γ₂ = 1 / √(1 - 0.25)\n*   γ₂ = 1 / √0.75\n*   γ₂ ≈ 1 / 0.866\n*   **γ₂ ≈ 1.1547**\n\nNow, calculate the energy (E₂) of the second astronaut:\n*   E₂ = γ₂ * (3m) * c²\n*   E₂ ≈ 1.1547 * 3m * c²\n*   **E₂ ≈ 3.4641mc²**\n\n**Total Energy of the System (E_total):**\n\nThe total energy is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts.\n*   E_total = E₁ + E₂\n*   E_total ≈ 2.5mc² + 3.4641mc²\n*   **E_total ≈ 5.9641mc²**\n\nThis rounds to **5.96mc²**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated relative speed is approximately **0.14c**, and the total energy of the system is approximately **5.96mc²**.
