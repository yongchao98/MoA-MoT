A key feature of this process is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of the atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed.\n\nTherefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes has no impact on its probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes. The problem is equivalent to asking: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\nLet's solve this step-by-step:\n\n1.  **Define the Survival Probability:**\n    The probability that an atom survives (does not decay) for a time `t` is given by the formula:\n    `P_survival(t) = e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant for this type of atom.\n\n2.  **Use the Given Information to Find a Key Value:**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    The probability of decay is `1 - P_survival`.\n    So, `P_decay(100) = 1 - P_survival(100) = 0.32`\n    This means the probability of surviving for 100 minutes is:\n    `P_survival(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    From the formula in step 1, we have:\n    `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Required Probability:**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in a 150-minute interval. This is `P_decay(150)`.\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - P_survival(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\n4.  **Relate the Probabilities:**\n    We can express `e^(-λ * 150)` in terms of the known value `e^(-λ * 100)`.\n    Notice that `150 = 100 * 1.5`. So, we can write:\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    Substituting the value from step 2:\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Now, we calculate the value of `(0.68)^1.5`:\n    `(0.68)^1.5 = 0.68 * sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607`\n    This is the probability of the atom surviving for 150 minutes.\n\n    The probability of it decaying within 150 minutes is:\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - P_survival(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n\n    This probability is 43.93%, which is closest to 44%.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 2:\nThis problem is about the probability of radioactive decay, a process that is fundamentally \"memoryless\". This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already survived. The fact that the atom has not decayed for 50 minutes does not influence its future decay probability. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the probability that a new atom will decay within 150 minutes.\n\nTo solve this, we first need to determine the decay constant (λ), which represents the probability that a single nucleus will decay per unit of time. The probability `P` that an atom will decay within a time `t` is given by the formula for exponential decay:\n\n*P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)*\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this information to find λ:\n\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)\ne^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32\ne^(-100λ) = 0.68\n\nNow, we can solve for λ by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n-100λ = ln(0.68)\nλ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\nNow we can use this decay constant to calculate the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes. As mentioned, due to the memoryless property, this is the same as the probability of a new atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n\n*P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)*\n\nSubstitute the expression for λ we found earlier:\n\n*P(150) = 1 - e^((-ln(0.68) / 100) * 150)*\n*P(150) = 1 - e^(1.5 * ln(0.68))*\n\nUsing the property of logarithms that `a * ln(b) = ln(b^a)`:\n\n*P(150) = 1 - e^(ln(0.68^1.5))*\n\nSince `e^ln(x) = x`:\n\n*P(150) = 1 - 0.68^1.5*\n\nNow, we calculate the value:\n\n0.68^1.5 = 0.68 * √0.68 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607\n\nFinally, we find the probability:\n\n*P(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393*\n\nThis probability of approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%, is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 3:\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Model the Decay:** Radioactive decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that an atom has *not* decayed by time `t` is given by the survival function `S(t) = exp(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant. The probability that it *has* decayed by time `t` is `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - exp(-λt)`.\n\n2.  **Find the Decay Constant (λ):** We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this information to find `λ`.\n    *   `P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - exp(-λ * 100)`\n    *   `exp(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    *   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: `-100λ = ln(0.68)`\n    *   `λ = -ln(0.68) / 100`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Required Probability:** We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes. A key property of radioactive decay is that it is a \"memoryless\" process.

The probability of decay is constant over time, which means the process follows an exponential distribution. A crucial characteristic of the exponential distribution is that it is **memoryless**.\n\n2.  **The \"Memoryless\" Property:**\n    This property means that the probability of an event occurring in the future is independent of its past history. In this context, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is not affected by the fact that it has already survived for 50 minutes. The atom doesn't \"age\" or get \"tired\". Its chance of decaying in any given second is always the same. Therefore, the problem simplifies to: \"What is the probability that a newly formed atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\n3.  **Define the Decay Probability Function:**\n    Let P(t) be the probability that the atom decays within a time interval of length `t`. The survival probability, S(t), is the probability it has *not* decayed by time `t`.\n    *   P(t) = 1 - S(t)\n    The survival probability for exponential decay is given by the formula:\n    *   S(t) = e^(-λt)\n    where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    So, the decay probability is:\n    *   P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n4.  **Use the Given Information to Characterize the Atom:**\n    We are given that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%.\n    *   P(100) = 0.32\n    This means the survival probability for 100 minutes is:\n    *   S(100) = 1 - P(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n    Using the survival formula:\n    *   e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability:**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. As established by the memoryless property, this is equivalent to calculating P(150) for a new atom.\n    *   P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n    We can find the value of e^(-150λ) using the information from the previous step. We can express -150λ as (-100λ) * 1.5.\n    *   e^(-150λ) = e^((-100λ) * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5\n    Now, substitute the value we found for e^(-100λ):\n    *   e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5\n\n6.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   (0.68)^1.5 = 0.68 * √0.68\n    *   √0.68 ≈ 0.8246\n    *   (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607\n    Now, calculate the final decay probability:\n    *   P(150) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393\n\n7.  **Final Answer Selection:**\n    The calculated probability is 0.4393, which is 43.93%. This value is closest to the given option of 44%.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Memoryless Property:** This is the most critical point. Forgetting this would lead to incorrect calculations involving conditional probability that are unnecessarily complex and might lead to errors if not handled carefully. The fact that 50 minutes have passed is extraneous information.\n*   **Decay vs. Survival Probability:** Be careful to distinguish between the probability of decay (P(t)) and the probability of survival (S(t)). The exponential formula e^(-λt) directly gives the survival probability.\n*   **Exponent Manipulation:** The calculation relies on correctly manipulating the exponents (e.g., e^(a*b) = (e^a)^b) to avoid explicitly calculating the decay constant λ, which simplifies the arithmetic and reduces rounding errors.\n\nThe probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 5:\nThis problem involves the concept of radioactive decay, which follows an exponential distribution. A key feature of this process is that it is **memoryless**.\n\n### **Reasoning**\n\n1.  **The Memoryless Property:** The most crucial concept here is that radioactive decay is a memoryless process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The atom does not \"age\" or become \"more likely\" to decay just because it has survived for a while. Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes has no bearing on its future decay probability.\n\n2.  **Simplifying the Question:** Because of the memoryless property, the question \"What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived 50 minutes?\" is equivalent to the simpler question: \"What is the probability a new atom will decay in 150 minutes?\"\n\n3.  **Mathematical Formulation:**\n    *   Let `P(t)` be the probability that the atom decays within time `t`. The formula for this is `P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    *   The probability of survival beyond time `t` is `S(t) = e^(-λt)`.\n\n4.  **Using the Given Data:**\n    *   We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   `P(100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n    *   From this, we can find the survival probability for 100 minutes: `e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Required Probability:**\n    *   We need to find the probability of decay within 150 minutes, which is `P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n    *   We can rewrite `e^(-λ * 150)` using the value we found in the previous step:\n        `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    *   Substituting the known value:\n        `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n    *   Now, we can calculate the final probability:\n        `P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\n6.  **Computation:**\n    *   Calculating `(0.68)^1.5` gives approximately `0.5607`.\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`.\n    *   This probability, `0.4393`, is equal to `43.93%`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The calculated probability is 43.93%, which is closest to the answer choice 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe defining characteristic of radioactive decay is that it is a \"memoryless\" process.

The \"clock\" effectively resets at any point we observe the atom is still present.\nTherefore, the fact that 50 minutes have already passed is irrelevant to the future probability.\nThe problem simplifies to: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the required probability.**\nWe need to find the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval, which is $P_{decay}(150)$.\n$P_{decay}(150) = 1 - P_{survive}(150) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150}$\nNow, we use the information from Step 2 to solve this. We know that $e^{-100\\lambda} = 0.68$. We can rewrite the exponent in our target equation:\n$e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150} = e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100 \\cdot 1.5} = (e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100})^{1.5}$\nNow substitute the value we found:\n$e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150} = (0.68)^{1.5}$\nSo, the probability of decay in 150 minutes is:\n$P_{decay}(150) = 1 - (0.68)^{1.5}$\n\n**Step 5: Perform the final calculation.**\nCalculate the value of $(0.68)^{1.5}$:\n$(0.68)^{1.5} = 0.68 \\times \\sqrt{0.68} \\approx 0.68 \\times 0.8246 \\approx 0.5607$\nNow, calculate the final probability:\n$P_{decay}(150) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393$\n\n**Step 6: Convert to a percentage and choose the correct option.**\nThe probability is 0.4393, which is equivalent to 43.93%.\nThis value is closest to 44%.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n*   Do not get confused by the 50 minutes that have passed.

The most important characteristic of this process for this problem is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed without decaying.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Physics and Mathematics**\n\n*   Let T be the lifetime of the atom. The probability that the atom survives past time `t` is given by the survival function: `S(t) = P(T > t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n*   The probability that the atom decays by time `t` is the cumulative distribution function: `F(t) = P(T ≤ t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n**Step 2: Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant (λ)**\n\nWe are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n*   `P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32`\n*   `1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n*   `e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\nThis equation gives us a way to find `λ`, but we don't need to find its explicit value. We can use the expression `e^(-λ * 100)` directly.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the Question Mathematically**\n\nWe want to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\nThis is a conditional probability: `P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50)`.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Memoryless Property**\n\nBecause radioactive decay is a memoryless process, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes has no impact on its future decay probability. The clock \"resets,\" so to speak.\nTherefore, the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of a brand-new atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n*   `P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50) = P(T ≤ 150)`\n\nSo, we just need to calculate `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Probability**\n\nWe need to calculate `1 - e^(-λ * 150)`. We can relate `e^(-λ * 150)` to our known value from Step 2:\n*   `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n*   Substituting the value from Step 2: `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\nNow, we can calculate the final probability:\n*   `Probability of decay = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\nThe code execution confirms this calculation: `1 - (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.439`.\n\nConverting this to a percentage gives `43.9%`, which is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nThe problem of calculating the decay probability of a single atom is based on the principles of exponential decay. A key feature of this process is that it is \"memoryless,\" meaning the probability of decay in a future time interval is independent of how long the atom has already survived. The fact that the atom has not decayed for 50 minutes does not influence its future decay probability.\n\nTo solve this, we first determine the decay constant (λ), which represents the probability of decay per unit of time.\n\n**1. Calculate the Survival Probability:**\nThe probability of the atom decaying within 100 minutes is given as 32% (or 0.32). Therefore, the probability of it *surviving* (not decaying) in the same period is:\nP(survival in 100 min) = 1 - P(decay in 100 min) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\n**2. Determine the Decay Constant (λ):**\nThe probability of a single nucleus surviving for a time *t* is given by the formula P(survival) = e^(-λt). We can use the information from the previous step to find λ:\n0.68 = e^(-λ * 100)\n\nTo solve for λ, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\nln(0.68) = -100λ\nλ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\n**3. Calculate the Decay Probability for the Next 150 Minutes:**\nDue to the memoryless nature of radioactive decay, the 50 minutes that have already passed are irrelevant to the future probability. We need to calculate the probability of the atom decaying in a new 150-minute interval.\n\nFirst, we find the survival probability for 150 minutes:\nP(survival in 150 min) = e^(-λ * 150)\n\nNow, substitute the expression for λ we found earlier:\nP(survival in 150 min) = e^((-(-ln(0.68) / 100)) * 150)\nP(survival in 150 min) = e^((ln(0.68) / 100) * 150)\nP(survival in 150 min) = e^(1.5 * ln(0.68))\n\nUsing the property of logarithms that a * ln(b) = ln(b^a):\nP(survival in 150 min) = e^(ln(0.68^1.5))\nP(survival in 150 min) = 0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.56\n\nThe probability of decay is 1 minus the probability of survival:\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - P(survival in 150 min)\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44\n\nThis corresponds to a 44% probability.\n\n<<<A>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 22:\nHere is a step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1.

Calculate the Required Probability\n\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Because the decay process is memoryless, this is equivalent to calculating the decay probability for a fresh atom over a 150-minute period.\n\nThe probability of decay in 150 minutes is:\n*P(decay in 150 min)* = 1 - e^(-150λ)\n\nWe can use the value we found in the previous step to solve this. We know that e^(-100λ) = 0.68. We can rewrite e^(-150λ) as:\ne^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5\n\nNow, substitute the known value:\ne^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5\n\nLet's calculate the value of (0.68)^1.5:\n(0.68)^1.5 = 0.68 * √0.68 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607\n\nFinally, calculate the decay probability:\n*P(decay in 150 min)* = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393\n\n### 4.

The probability that a single nucleus will decay in a given time interval is constant and independent of the age of the nucleus. This is known as the \"memoryless\" property. The process is governed by the exponential decay law.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Mathematical Model**\nLet P(t) be the probability that the atom has *not* decayed by time t (i.e., it survives until at least time t). This is called the survival function. The exponential decay law states:\nP(t) = e^(-λt)\nwhere λ is the decay constant, a positive value characteristic of the atom.\n\nThe probability that the atom *has* decayed by time t is given by:\nP_decay(t) = 1 - P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n**Step 3: Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant (λ)**\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\nP_decay(100) = 0.32\nUsing the formula from Step 2:\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)\n\nWe can rearrange this to find the survival probability for 100 minutes:\ne^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\nThis tells us that the probability of the atom surviving for 100 minutes is 68%. We don't need to solve for λ explicitly; we can use this relationship directly.\n\n**Step 4: Address the Specific Question**\nThe question asks for the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The \"Memoryless\" Property**\nBecause radioactive decay is a memoryless process, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes has no impact on its future decay probability. The atom does not \"get old\" or become \"more likely\" to decay. Therefore, the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that a brand-new atom of the same type would decay in 150 minutes.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Required Probability**\nWe need to calculate the probability of decay within a 150-minute interval. Let's call this P_decay(150).\nP_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nTo calculate this, we use the information from Step 3:\nWe know e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\nWe need to find the value of e^(-λ * 150). We can do this using properties of exponents:\ne^(-λ * 150) = e^((-λ * 100) * (150/100)) = (e^(-λ * 100))^(1.5)\n\nNow, substitute the value we found:\ne^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5\n\n**Careful Point 2: Calculation**\nLet's calculate (0.68)^1.5:\n(0.68)^1.5 = 0.68 * (0.68)^0.5 = 0.68 * √0.68\n√0.68 ≈ 0.8246\n(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607\n\nSo, the probability of the atom *surviving* for 150 minutes is approximately 0.5607.\n\n**Step 6: Find the Final Answer**\nThe probability of the atom *decaying* in the next 150 minutes is:\nP_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\nP_decay(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607\nP_decay(150) ≈ 0.4393\n\nConverting this to a percentage:\n0.4393 * 100% = 43.93%\n\nThis value is closest to 44%.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points:\n1.  **Memoryless Property:** The most crucial point is recognizing that the 50 minutes that have already passed are irrelevant to the future probability of decay.\n2.  **Formulation:** Correctly set up the decay probability as P_decay(t) = 1 - e^(-λt) and the survival probability as P(t) = e^(-λt).\n3.  **Using Given Data:** Use the 32% decay in 100 minutes to find the value of e^(-λ * 100), which is 0.68. It is simpler and more accurate to work with this expression than to calculate a numerical value for λ.\n4.  **Exponent Math:** Correctly manipulate the exponents to find e^(-λ * 150) from e^(-λ * 100). The key is that e^(-λ * 150) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5.\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Ensure you are calculating the decay probability (1 - survival probability), not the survival probability itself.\n\nThe probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nThe problem describes a classic scenario of exponential decay, which is characteristic of radioactive decay.

Applying the Memoryless Property:**\nThe question asks for the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given it has already survived for 50 minutes. The memoryless property states that the past has no bearing on the future probability. The fact that the atom survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay probability.\nTherefore, the problem simplifies to finding the probability that a new atom will decay within a 150-minute interval.

A key feature of this process is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. In other words, an atom does not \"age\". The fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes does not alter its intrinsic probability of decaying in any subsequent period.\n\n### Calculation Steps\n\nTo solve the problem, we first need to determine the decay constant (λ), which represents the probability per unit time for a single nucleus to decay.\n\n1.  **Find the decay constant (λ):**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%. The probability of decay, P(decay), is related to the decay constant λ and time *t* by the formula:\n    *P(decay) = 1 - e^(-λt)*\n\n    Given P(decay in 100 min) = 0.32, we have:\n    0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)\n\n    First, solve for e^(-λ * 100):\n    e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32\n    e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\n    Now, solve for λ by taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    -100λ = ln(0.68)\n    λ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n    λ ≈ -(-0.3857) / 100\n    λ ≈ 0.003857 per minute\n\n2.  **Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes:**\n    Now we use the calculated decay constant to find the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval.

The crucial property of this distribution is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of an event happening in the future is independent of what has happened in the past.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Define the decay probability:** The probability `P(t)` that an atom decays by time `t` is given by the formula `P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant. The probability that it survives beyond time `t` is `S(t) = e^(-λt)`.\n\n2.  **Use the given data to find the decay parameter:** We are told that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%.\n    *   `P(100) = 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32`\n    *   This means the probability of survival for 100 minutes is `S(100) = e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the question:** We want to find the probability that the atom decays in the *next* 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes. Let `T` be the time of decay. We are looking for the conditional probability `P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50)`.\n\n4.  **Apply the memoryless property:** Because radioactive decay is a memoryless process, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not influence its future probability of decay.

A key characteristic of this process is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. Therefore, the fact that the atom has not decayed for 50 minutes does not influence its future decay probability. We need to calculate the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes, treating it as if we started monitoring it at t=0.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n### 1. Understand the Formula for Radioactive Decay\n\nThe probability `P(t)` that an atom will decay within a certain time `t` is given by the formula:\n*   `P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `λ` (lambda) is the decay constant, a value representing the decay probability per unit of time.\n*   `e` is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\nThe probability of an atom *surviving* (not decaying) is `S(t) = e^(-λt)`.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Decay Constant (λ)\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n\n*   `P(100) = 0.32`\n\nUsing the formula:\n*   `0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)`\n\nFirst, solve for `e^(-100λ)`:\n*   `e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32`\n*   `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`\n\nNow, solve for λ by taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n*   `-100λ = ln(0.68)`\n*   `λ = -ln(0.68) / 100`\n\nCalculating the value:\n*   `ln(0.68) ≈ -0.3857`\n*   `λ ≈ -(-0.3857) / 100`\n*   `λ ≈ 0.003857` per minute\n\n### 3.

The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its future decay probability.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n### 1. Determine the Decay Constant (λ)\nThe probability `P(t)` that an atom decays within a time `t` is given by the formula:\n`P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\nwhere `λ` is the decay constant.\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or 0.32.\n`0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)`\n\nFrom this, we can find the probability of the atom *not* decaying (surviving) in 100 minutes:\n`e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32`\n`e^(-100λ) = 0.68`\n\nThis value, `e^(-100λ)`, represents the survival probability over 100 minutes. We can use this to find the probability of decay over a different time interval without explicitly solving for λ.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Probability of Decay in the Next 150 Minutes\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Due to the memoryless property, this is simply the probability of an atom decaying in any 150-minute period.\n\n`P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\nTo calculate this, we can manipulate the expression to use the survival probability we found earlier:\n`e^(-150λ) = (e^(-100λ))^(150/100) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n\nNow, substitute the value of `e^(-100λ)`:\n`P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\nCalculating the value:\n`0.68^1.5 = 0.68 * √0.68 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607`\n\nFinally, calculate the decay probability:\n`P(150) = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393`\n\n### 3.

A key feature of this process is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is completely independent of how long it has already survived. The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its inherent probability of decaying in any future period.\n\n2.  **Determine the decay constant (λ):** The probability of decay is governed by the decay constant, λ. The relationship between the number of atoms at time `t`, N(t), and the initial number of atoms, N(0), is given by the formula: `N(t) = N(0) * e^(-λt)`.\n\n    The probability that an atom *survives* up to time `t` is `P(survival) = N(t) / N(0) = e^(-λt)`.\n    Therefore, the probability that it *decays* within time `t` is `P(decay) = 1 - P(survival) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this to find λ:\n    `0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)`\n    `e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32`\n    `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`\n\n3.  **Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes:** We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Because of the memoryless property, this is simply the probability of a fresh atom decaying in a 150-minute interval.\n\n    `P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\n    To solve this, we can manipulate the expression we found in the previous step:\n    From `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`, we can write `(e^(-λ))^100 = 0.68`, which means `e^(-λ) = (0.68)^(1/100)`.\n\n    Now substitute this into the formula for the 150-minute decay probability:\n    `P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - (e^(-λ))^150`\n    `P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - ((0.68)^(1/100))^150`\n    `P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - (0.68)^(150/100)`\n    `P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\n4.  **Perform the final calculation:**\n    `(0.68)^1.5 = 0.68 * √0.68 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607`\n    `P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%.

Consequently, the probability of an atom decaying within a time `t` is `P_decay(t) = 1 - P_survive(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n2.  **Use the Given Information to Characterize the Atom:** We are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    `P_decay(100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n    From this, we can find the probability of survival for 100 minutes:\n    `P_survive(100) = e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    This equation links the decay constant `λ` to a known probability and time.\n\n3.  **Apply the \"Memoryless\" Property:** The core principle of radioactive decay is that it's a \"memoryless\" process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval does not depend on how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future behavior. The problem is equivalent to asking: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay in 150 minutes?\"\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Probability:** We need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, which is `P_decay(150)`.\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - P_survive(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\n5.  **Solve for the Probability:** We can solve this without explicitly finding the value of `λ`. We use the relationship we found in step 2:\n    `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`\n    We can write `e^(-λ * 150)` in terms of this known value:\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    Now, substitute the known value (0.68):\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n    The probability of survival for 150 minutes is `(0.68)^1.5`.\n\n    Therefore, the probability of decay in 150 minutes is:\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\n6.  **Numerical Calculation:** The Python code from the reasoning step calculated this value:\n    `1 - (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 1 - 0.5606... ≈ 0.4393`\n    Converting this to a percentage gives 43.93%.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The calculated probability is approximately 44%.

The key feature of such a process is that it is \"memoryless.\"\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Decay Model**\n\nThe probability of an atom surviving for a time `t` without decaying is given by the survival function `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant. The probability of the atom decaying within time `t` is `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Decay Constant (λ)**\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n*   P(100) = 0.32\n*   1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n*   e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\nTo find `λ`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n*   -100λ = ln(0.68)\n*   λ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Memoryless Property**\n\nThe problem asks for the probability that the atom will decay in the *next* 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes. This can be written as a conditional probability: `P(decay in next 150 mins | survived 50 mins)`.\n\nRadioactive decay is a memoryless process. This means the probability of a future event does not depend on the history of the process. The atom does not \"age\" or \"get tired.\" Therefore, the fact that it has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay probability.\n\nSo, the question simplifies to finding the probability that the atom will decay in any given 150-minute interval.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Probability**\n\nWe need to calculate the probability of decay within 150 minutes, `P(150)`.\n*   P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nSubstitute the expression for `λ` we found in Step 2:\n*   P(150) = 1 - e^([-ln(0.68) / 100] * 150)\n*   P(150) = 1 - e^(1.5 * ln(0.68))\n\nUsing the logarithm property `a * ln(b) = ln(b^a)`:\n*   P(150) = 1 - e^(ln(0.68^1.5))\n\nSince `e^ln(x) = x`:\n*   P(150) = 1 - 0.68^1.5\n\nUsing a calculator (as was done by the Python code):\n*   0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607\n*   P(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393\n\nConverting this to a percentage, we get 43.93%.\n\n**Step 5: Compare with Options**\nThe calculated probability is 43.93%, which is closest to the given option D) 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning for solving this problem:\n\n**1.

Its probability of decaying in any future time interval is constant and completely independent of how long it has already existed.\n\n**2. Simplify the Question Based on this Principle**\n\nThe problem states that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. Because of the memoryless property, this information is irrelevant to the atom's future. The atom's \"internal clock\" has effectively reset. Therefore, the complex-sounding question:\n\n> \"What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has already survived 50 minutes?\"\n\nis perfectly equivalent to the much simpler question:\n\n> \"What is the probability that a brand-new atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\n**3.

We can use the properties of exponents to relate `S(150)` to `S(100)`:\n*   `S(150) = e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n\nSince we found in Step 4 that `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`, we can substitute this value:\n*   `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n**6. Compute the Final Answer**\n\nNow we can calculate the final decay probability, `F(150)`:\n*   `F(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\nUsing a calculator:\n*   `(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.559`\n*   `F(150) = 1 - 0.559 = 0.441`\n\nConverting this probability to a percentage gives 44.1%, which is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nThe problem describes a radioactive decay process, which follows an exponential distribution.

This is a conditional probability: `P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50)`.\n\nBecause the decay process is memoryless, the 50 minutes that have already passed do not affect the future probability.\n`P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50) = P(T ≤ 150)`\nSo, we simply need to calculate the probability that a \"fresh\" atom would decay within 150 minutes.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Required Probability**\n\nWe need to calculate `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - P(T > 150) = 1 - S(150)`.\n*   We know `S(150) = e^(-λ * 150)`.\n*   We can use the value we found in Step 2 to solve for this:\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n*   Substitute the known value `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`:\n    `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\nNow we calculate the decay probability:\n*   `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n*   `P(T ≤ 150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607`\n*   `P(T ≤ 150) ≈ 0.4393`\n\n**Step 5: Convert to Percentage and Choose the Answer**\n\nThe probability of decay is approximately 0.4393, which is 43.93%. This value is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 56:\nHere is the step-by-step solution to the problem:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Principle: The Memoryless Property of Radioactive Decay\n\nRadioactive decay is a random process governed by the exponential distribution. A key characteristic of this distribution is the \"memoryless property\". This principle states that the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is constant and is not affected by how long the atom has already existed. In this problem, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay probability.\n\n### 2. Determining the Decay Constant (λ)\n\nThe probability of an atom surviving (not decaying) for a time `t` is given by the formula:\nP(survival) = e^(-λt)\n\nWhere λ is the decay constant. The probability of decay is therefore:\nP(decay) = 1 - P(survival) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this information to find the decay constant λ.\n\n*   P(decay in 100 min) = 0.32\n*   1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n*   e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32\n*   e^(-100λ) = 0.68\n\n### 3. Calculating the Probability for the New Time Interval\n\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Because of the memoryless property, this is equivalent to calculating the decay probability for a fresh atom over a 150-minute period.\n\n*   P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nTo solve this, we can use the value of `e^(-100λ)` that we found in the previous step. We can rewrite the exponent `-150λ` as `(-100λ) * 1.5`.\n\n*   e^(-150λ) = e^((-100λ) * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5\n\nNow, substitute the value `0.68` for `e^(-100λ)`:\n\n*   e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\n\nLet's calculate the value of (0.68)^1.5:\n\n*   (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.56073\n\nThis is the probability of the atom *surviving* for 150 minutes. To find the probability of it *decaying*, we subtract this value from 1:\n\n*   P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - 0.56073 ≈ 0.43927\n\nConverting this to a percentage gives approximately 43.93%.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe calculated probability of 43.93% is closest to 44%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 57:\nThe phenomenon of radioactive decay is governed by exponential decay, which has a key characteristic known as the \"memoryless property\". This principle states that the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not influence its future decay probability. The problem reduces to finding the probability of a new atom decaying within 150 minutes.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Determine the survival probability and decay constant.**\n    The initial information states that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%.\n    *   Probability of decay in 100 minutes: P(decay) = 0.32\n    *   This means the probability of *survival* in 100 minutes is: P(survival) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n\n    The survival probability P(t) over a time (t) is given by the formula P(t) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.\n    *   For t = 100 minutes, P(100) = 0.68.\n    *   So, e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68.\n\n2.  **Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.**\n    Due to the memoryless property, the 50 minutes that have passed are irrelevant. We need to calculate the probability of the atom decaying in a 150-minute interval.\n    *   The probability of survival over 150 minutes is P(150) = e^(-λ * 150).\n    *   We can rewrite e^(-λ * 150) as (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5.\n    *   Since we know e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68, we can substitute this value: P(survival in 150 min) = (0.68)^1.5.\n\n3.  **Compute the final value.**\n    *   P(survival in 150 min) ≈ 0.5607.\n    *   The probability of decay in 150 minutes is 1 minus the probability of survival.\n    *   P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393.\n\n4.  **Convert to a percentage.**\n    The probability of 0.4393 is equivalent to 43.93%, which is approximately 44%.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is about 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 58:\nThe correct approach to this problem relies on the fundamental principle that radioactive decay is a \"memoryless\" process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed without decaying. Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not affect its future decay probability.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1.  **Determine the Decay Constant (λ):**\n    The probability of a nucleus surviving for a time *t* is given by the formula P(survival) = e⁻ˡᵗ, where λ is the decay constant. The probability of decay is therefore P(decay) = 1 - e⁻ˡᵗ.\n\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   P(decay in 100 min) = 0.32\n    *   P(survival in 100 min) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\n    We can now set up the equation to find λ:\n    0.68 = e⁻ˡ⁽¹⁰⁰⁾\n    Taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    ln(0.68) = -100λ\n    λ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n    λ ≈ -(-0.3857) / 100\n    λ ≈ 0.003857 per minute\n\n2.  **Calculate the Probability of Decay in the Next 150 Minutes:**\n    We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Since the process is memoryless, we calculate the probability for a 150-minute interval, regardless of the previous 50 minutes.\n\n    Using the decay probability formula with t = 150 minutes and the value of λ we just found:\n    P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e⁻ˡ⁽¹⁵⁰⁾\n    P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e⁻⁽⁰∙⁰⁰³⁸⁵⁷⁾⁽¹⁵⁰⁾\n    P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e⁻⁰∙⁵⁷⁸⁵⁵\n    P(decay in 150 min) ≈ 1 - 0.5607\n    P(decay in 150 min) ≈ 0.4393\n\n3.  **Compare with the Options:**\n    The calculated probability is approximately 0.4393, which is 43.93%. This value is closest to 44%.\n\n    *Alternatively, without calculating the explicit value of λ, we can use a more direct mathematical approach:*\n    From Step 1, we have e⁻¹⁰⁰ˡ = 0.68.\n    The probability of decay in 150 minutes is P = 1 - e⁻¹⁵⁰ˡ.\n    We can rewrite e⁻¹⁵⁰ˡ as (e⁻¹⁰⁰ˡ)¹∙⁵.\n    Substituting the known value: P = 1 - (0.68)¹∙⁵.\n    P ≈ 1 - 0.5598\n    P ≈ 0.4402\n    This confirms the probability is approximately 44%.\n\nThe correct option is therefore 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>.",

    "Based on the analysis of the provided answers, here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Physical Principle:** The problem concerns radioactive decay, a process governed by the exponential distribution. The most critical principle here is that this process is **\"memoryless\"**. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is entirely independent of how long it has already existed without decaying. An atom does not \"age\" or get \"closer\" to decaying.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Question:** Because of the memoryless property, the information that \"50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed\" is extraneous to the calculation of its future probability. The question can be simplified from \"What is the probability it will decay in the *next* 150 minutes, given it has survived 50 minutes?\" to the much simpler \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay within a 150-minute period?\".\n\n3.  **Establish the Mathematical Model:**\n    *   Let the probability of an atom *surviving* for a time `t` be `S(t)`. The formula for this is `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    *   Let the probability of an atom *decaying* within a time `t` be `P(t)`. This is the complement of survival: `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n4.  **Use the Given Data to Find a Key Parameter:**\n    *   We are given that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, or `P(100) = 0.32`.\n    *   This allows us to find the survival probability for 100 minutes: `S(100) = 1 - P(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n    *   Using the formula from the previous step, we have `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Required Probability:**\n    *   As established in Step 2, we need to calculate the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval, which is `P(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n    *   We can find `e^(-λ * 150)` by using the value we found in Step 4 and the properties of exponents:\n        `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    *   Now, substitute the known value of `e^(-λ * 100)`:\n        `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n6.  **Perform the Numerical Calculation:**\n    *   First, calculate the survival probability for 150 minutes:\n        `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607`\n    *   Next, calculate the decay probability for 150 minutes by subtracting the survival probability from 1:\n        `P(150) = 1 - S(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`\n\n7.  **Select the Closest Answer:**\n    The calculated probability is `0.4393`, or `43.93%`.

Recognizing that this information is irrelevant is the key to simplifying the problem correctly.\n*   **Decay vs. Survival:** It's important to distinguish between the probability of survival `S(t)` and the probability of decay `P(t)`. The exponential term `e^(-λt)` directly gives the survival probability. The final answer requires the decay probability, `1 - S(t)`.\n*   **Exponent Rules:** Using the relationship `e^(-λ * 150) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5` is more direct and less prone to rounding errors than first calculating a numerical value for `λ` and then plugging it back into another equation.\n\n<<<D>>>"

The probability of decay is constant over time, which means the process follows an exponential distribution. A crucial characteristic of the exponential distribution is that it is **memoryless**.\n\n2.  **The \"Memoryless\" Property:**\n    This property means that the probability of an event occurring in the future is independent of its past history. In this context, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is not affected by the fact that it has already survived for 50 minutes. The atom doesn't \"age\" or get \"tired\".

This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. The atom does not \"age\" or become \"more likely\" to decay just because it has survived for a while. Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes has no bearing on its future decay probability.\n\n2.  **Simplifying the Question:** Because of the memoryless property, the question \"What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived 50 minutes?\" is equivalent to the simpler question: \"What is the probability a new atom will decay in 150 minutes?\"\n\n3.  **Mathematical Formulation:**\n    *   Let `P(t)` be the probability that the atom decays within time `t`. The formula for this is `P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n    *   The probability of survival beyond time `t` is `S(t) = e^(-λt)`.\n\n4.  **Using the Given Data:**\n    *   We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    *   `P(100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n    *   From this, we can find the survival probability for 100 minutes: `e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Required Probability:**\n    *   We need to find the probability of decay within 150 minutes, which is `P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n    *   We can rewrite `e^(-λ * 150)` using the value we found in the previous step:\n        `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    *   Substituting the known value:\n        `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n    *   Now, we can calculate the final probability:\n        `P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\n6.  **Computation:**\n    *   Calculating `(0.68)^1.5` gives approximately `0.5607`.\n    *   `P(150) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393`.\n    *   This probability, `0.4393`, is equal to `43.93%`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The calculated probability is 43.93%, which is closest to the answer choice 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 6:\nThe defining characteristic of radioactive decay is that it is a \"memoryless\" process.

We don't need to calculate the value of $\\lambda$ itself.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the \"memoryless\" property of exponential decay.**\nThe question asks for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes.\nRadioactive decay is a memoryless process. This means the probability of decay in any future time interval does not depend on how long the atom has already existed. The \"clock\" effectively resets at any point we observe the atom is still present.\nTherefore, the fact that 50 minutes have already passed is irrelevant to the future probability.\nThe problem simplifies to: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the required probability.**\nWe need to find the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval, which is $P_{decay}(150)$.\n$P_{decay}(150) = 1 - P_{survive}(150) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150}$\nNow, we use the information from Step 2 to solve this. We know that $e^{-100\\lambda} = 0.68$. We can rewrite the exponent in our target equation:\n$e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150} = e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100 \\cdot 1.5} = (e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100})^{1.5}$\nNow substitute the value we found:\n$e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150} = (0.68)^{1.5}$\nSo, the probability of decay in 150 minutes is:\n$P_{decay}(150) = 1 - (0.68)^{1.5}$\n\n**Step 5: Perform the final calculation.**\nCalculate the value of $(0.68)^{1.5}$:\n$(0.68)^{1.5} = 0.68 \\times \\sqrt{0.68} \\approx 0.68 \\times 0.8246 \\approx 0.5607$\nNow, calculate the final probability:\n$P_{decay}(150) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393$\n\n**Step 6: Convert to a percentage and choose the correct option.**\nThe probability is 0.4393, which is equivalent to 43.93%.\nThis value is closest to 44%.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n*   Do not get confused by the 50 minutes that have passed.

The most important characteristic of this process for this problem is that it is **memoryless**. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed without decaying.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Physics and Mathematics**\n\n*   Let T be the lifetime of the atom. The probability that the atom survives past time `t` is given by the survival function: `S(t) = P(T > t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant.\n*   The probability that the atom decays by time `t` is the cumulative distribution function: `F(t) = P(T ≤ t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n**Step 2: Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant (λ)**\n\nWe are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n*   `P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32`\n*   `1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n*   `e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\nThis equation gives us a way to find `λ`, but we don't need to find its explicit value. We can use the expression `e^(-λ * 100)` directly.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the Question Mathematically**\n\nWe want to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\nThis is a conditional probability: `P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50)`.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Memoryless Property**\n\nBecause radioactive decay is a memoryless process, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes has no impact on its future decay probability. The clock \"resets,\" so to speak.\nTherefore, the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of a brand-new atom decaying in 150 minutes.\n*   `P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50) = P(T ≤ 150)`\n\nSo, we just need to calculate `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Probability**\n\nWe need to calculate `1 - e^(-λ * 150)`. We can relate `e^(-λ * 150)` to our known value from Step 2:\n*   `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n*   Substituting the value from Step 2: `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\nNow, we can calculate the final probability:\n*   `Probability of decay = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\nThe code execution confirms this calculation: `1 - (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.439`.\n\nConverting this to a percentage gives `43.9%`, which is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 21:\nThe problem of calculating the decay probability of a single atom is based on the principles of exponential decay.

Understanding the \"Memoryless\" Property**\n\nThe fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes has no bearing on its probability of decaying in the future. The atom doesn't \"age\" or \"get tired\". At any given moment, its probability of decaying in the next interval of time is the same, regardless of how long it has already existed.

We can relate this to the value we found in the previous step using the properties of exponents:\n`e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n\nNow we can substitute the value we found for `e^(-100λ)`:\n`e^(-150λ) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\nLet's calculate this value:\n` (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.5607 `\n\nThis is the probability of the atom surviving for 150 minutes. Now we can find the probability of it decaying within 150 minutes:\n`P_decay(150) = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393`\n\nConverting this to a percentage gives approximately 43.93%.\n\n**5.

The probability that a single nucleus will decay in a given time interval is constant and independent of the age of the nucleus. This is known as the \"memoryless\" property. The process is governed by the exponential decay law.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Mathematical Model**\nLet P(t) be the probability that the atom has *not* decayed by time t (i.e., it survives until at least time t). This is called the survival function. The exponential decay law states:\nP(t) = e^(-λt)\nwhere λ is the decay constant, a positive value characteristic of the atom.\n\nThe probability that the atom *has* decayed by time t is given by:\nP_decay(t) = 1 - P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)\n\n**Step 3: Use the Given Information to Find the Decay Constant (λ)**\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\nP_decay(100) = 0.32\nUsing the formula from Step 2:\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)\n\nWe can rearrange this to find the survival probability for 100 minutes:\ne^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\nThis tells us that the probability of the atom surviving for 100 minutes is 68%. We don't need to solve for λ explicitly; we can use this relationship directly.\n\n**Step 4: Address the Specific Question**\nThe question asks for the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The \"Memoryless\" Property**\nBecause radioactive decay is a memoryless process, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes has no impact on its future decay probability. The atom does not \"get old\" or become \"more likely\" to decay. Therefore, the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that a brand-new atom of the same type would decay in 150 minutes.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Required Probability**\nWe need to calculate the probability of decay within a 150-minute interval. Let's call this P_decay(150).\nP_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nTo calculate this, we use the information from Step 3:\nWe know e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\nWe need to find the value of e^(-λ * 150). We can do this using properties of exponents:\ne^(-λ * 150) = e^((-λ * 100) * (150/100)) = (e^(-λ * 100))^(1.5)\n\nNow, substitute the value we found:\ne^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5\n\n**Careful Point 2: Calculation**\nLet's calculate (0.68)^1.5:\n(0.68)^1.5 = 0.68 * (0.68)^0.5 = 0.68 * √0.68\n√0.68 ≈ 0.8246\n(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607\n\nSo, the probability of the atom *surviving* for 150 minutes is approximately 0.5607.\n\n**Step 6: Find the Final Answer**\nThe probability of the atom *decaying* in the next 150 minutes is:\nP_decay(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\nP_decay(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607\nP_decay(150) ≈ 0.4393\n\nConverting this to a percentage:\n0.4393 * 100% = 43.93%\n\nThis value is closest to 44%.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points:\n1.  **Memoryless Property:** The most crucial point is recognizing that the 50 minutes that have already passed are irrelevant to the future probability of decay.\n2.  **Formulation:** Correctly set up the decay probability as P_decay(t) = 1 - e^(-λt) and the survival probability as P(t) = e^(-λt).\n3.  **Using Given Data:** Use the 32% decay in 100 minutes to find the value of e^(-λ * 100), which is 0.68. It is simpler and more accurate to work with this expression than to calculate a numerical value for λ.\n4.  **Exponent Math:** Correctly manipulate the exponents to find e^(-λ * 150) from e^(-λ * 100). The key is that e^(-λ * 150) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5.\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Ensure you are calculating the decay probability (1 - survival probability), not the survival probability itself.\n\nThe probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 33:\nThe problem describes a classic scenario of exponential decay, which is characteristic of radioactive decay. The key principle to solve this problem is the \"memoryless\" property of the exponential distribution.\n\n**1. Summary of the Model:**\n*   Let *T* be the random variable for the lifetime of the atom.\n*   The probability of the atom decaying by time *t* is P(T ≤ t) = 1 - e^(-λt).\n*   The probability of the atom surviving beyond time *t* is P(T > t) = e^(-λt).\n*   λ is the decay constant.\n\n**2. Using the Given Data:**\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n*   P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32\n*   1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32\n*   This implies the probability of survival for 100 minutes is e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.\n\n**3. Applying the Memoryless Property:**\nThe question asks for the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given it has already survived for 50 minutes. The memoryless property states that the past has no bearing on the future probability. The fact that the atom survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay probability.\nTherefore, the problem simplifies to finding the probability that a new atom will decay within a 150-minute interval. We need to calculate P(T ≤ 150).\n\n**4. Calculation:**\n*   We need to find P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - e^(-150λ).\n*   We can relate e^(-150λ) to the value we found earlier, e^(-100λ) = 0.68.\n*   e^(-150λ) = e^(-100λ * 1.5) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5 = (0.68)^1.5\n*   The probability of decay is P = 1 - (0.68)^1.5.\n\nThe code provided in the previous steps correctly calculates this value:\n`1 - (0.68 ** 1.5) = 0.439257...`\n\nThis probability is approximately 43.93%.\n\n**5.

This \"memoryless\" property means that the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is completely independent of how long it has already existed. Therefore, the fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not influence its future decay probability.\n\nThe decay of radioactive atoms is described by exponential decay law. The probability that a nucleus will decay per unit of time is a constant, known as the decay constant (λ). We can determine this constant from the initial information provided.\n\nFirst, let's establish the survival probability, which is the probability that an atom has *not* decayed by a certain time *t*. This is given by the formula:\n\n*P(survival)* = e^(-λt)\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or 0.32. This means the probability of survival for 100 minutes is:\n\n*P(survival for 100 min)* = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\nNow we can find the decay constant, λ:\n\n0.68 = e^(-λ * 100)\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n\nln(0.68) = -100λ\n\nSo, the decay constant is:\n\nλ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\nThe question asks for the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes.

A key principle is that the decay probability of a single atomic nucleus is constant over any given time interval and does not depend on how long the atom has already existed. This is known as the \"memoryless\" property of exponential decay. Therefore, the fact that the atom has not decayed for 50 minutes does not influence its future decay probability.\n\nTo solve the problem, we first determine the decay constant (λ), which is the probability of decay per unit time. We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n\nThe probability of an atom *surviving* a time interval *t* is given by the formula:\nP(survival) = e^(-λt)\n\nFrom the given data, the probability of surviving 100 minutes is:\nP(survival in 100 min) = 1 - P(decay in 100 min) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\nNow we can find the decay constant λ:\n0.68 = e^(-λ * 100)\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\nln(0.68) = -100λ\nλ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\nNext, we need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Because of the memoryless nature of radioactive decay, this is equivalent to finding the decay probability of a new atom over a 150-minute period.\n\nThe probability of decay within 150 minutes is:\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - P(survival in 150 min)\nP(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nSubstituting the expression we found for λ:\nP = 1 - e^([-ln(0.68) / 100] * 150)\nP = 1 - e^(1.5 * ln(0.68))\nUsing the logarithm property x * ln(y) = ln(y^x):\nP = 1 - e^(ln(0.68^1.5))\nSince e^ln(x) = x:\nP = 1 - (0.68)^1.5\n\nCalculating the final value:\nP ≈ 1 - 0.5607\nP ≈ 0.4393\n\nThis probability is approximately 43.93%, which rounds to 44%.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is D.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 36:\nThe problem asks for the probability of a single atomic nucleus decaying within a specific future time frame, given that it has already survived for a certain period. This is a classic problem involving the principles of radioactive decay.\n\n### The Memoryless Nature of Radioactive Decay\n\nRadioactive decay is a stochastic process governed by the exponential distribution. A key feature of this process is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is independent of how long it has already existed. In other words, an atom does not \"age\". The fact that the atom has survived for 50 minutes does not alter its intrinsic probability of decaying in any subsequent period.\n\n### Calculation Steps\n\nTo solve the problem, we first need to determine the decay constant (λ), which represents the probability per unit time for a single nucleus to decay.\n\n1.  **Find the decay constant (λ):**\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%. The probability of decay, P(decay), is related to the decay constant λ and time *t* by the formula:\n    *P(decay) = 1 - e^(-λt)*\n\n    Given P(decay in 100 min) = 0.32, we have:\n    0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)\n\n    First, solve for e^(-λ * 100):\n    e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32\n    e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68\n\n    Now, solve for λ by taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n    -100λ = ln(0.68)\n    λ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n    λ ≈ -(-0.3857) / 100\n    λ ≈ 0.003857 per minute\n\n2.  **Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes:**\n    Now we use the calculated decay constant to find the probability of decay in a 150-minute interval. As noted, the 50 minutes that have already passed are irrelevant to this future probability.\n\n    *P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)*\n\n    Substitute the value of λ:\n    *P(decay) = 1 - e^(-0.003857 * 150)*\n    *P(decay) = 1 - e^(-0.57855)*\n\n    Calculate the value of the exponential term:\n    e^(-0.57855) ≈ 0.5607\n\n    Finally, calculate the decay probability:\n    *P(decay) = 1 - 0.5607*\n    *P(decay) = 0.4393*\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    The probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 0.4393, which is 43.93%.

The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its future decay probability.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n\n### 1. Determine the Decay Constant (λ)\nThe probability `P(t)` that an atom decays within a time `t` is given by the formula:\n`P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\nwhere `λ` is the decay constant.\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or 0.32.\n`0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)`\n\nFrom this, we can find the probability of the atom *not* decaying (surviving) in 100 minutes:\n`e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32`\n`e^(-100λ) = 0.68`\n\nThis value, `e^(-100λ)`, represents the survival probability over 100 minutes. We can use this to find the probability of decay over a different time interval without explicitly solving for λ.\n\n### 2. Calculate the Probability of Decay in the Next 150 Minutes\nWe need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Due to the memoryless property, this is simply the probability of an atom decaying in any 150-minute period.\n\n`P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\nTo calculate this, we can manipulate the expression to use the survival probability we found earlier:\n`e^(-150λ) = (e^(-100λ))^(150/100) = (e^(-100λ))^1.5`\n\nNow, substitute the value of `e^(-100λ)`:\n`P(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\nCalculating the value:\n`0.68^1.5 = 0.68 * √0.68 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607`\n\nFinally, calculate the decay probability:\n`P(150) = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393`\n\n### 3.

A key feature of this process is that it is \"memoryless\". This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval is completely independent of how long it has already survived. The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes does not change its inherent probability of decaying in any future period.\n\n2.  **Determine the decay constant (λ):** The probability of decay is governed by the decay constant, λ. The relationship between the number of atoms at time `t`, N(t), and the initial number of atoms, N(0), is given by the formula: `N(t) = N(0) * e^(-λt)`.\n\n    The probability that an atom *survives* up to time `t` is `P(survival) = N(t) / N(0) = e^(-λt)`.\n    Therefore, the probability that it *decays* within time `t` is `P(decay) = 1 - P(survival) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n    We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32). We can use this to find λ:\n    `0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)`\n    `e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32`\n    `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`\n\n3.  **Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes:** We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes. Because of the memoryless property, this is simply the probability of a fresh atom decaying in a 150-minute interval.\n\n    `P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\n    To solve this, we can manipulate the expression we found in the previous step:\n    From `e^(-100λ) = 0.68`, we can write `(e^(-λ))^100 = 0.68`, which means `e^(-λ) = (0.68)^(1/100)`.\n\n    Now substitute this into the formula for the 150-minute decay probability:\n    `P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - (e^(-λ))^150`\n    `P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - ((0.68)^(1/100))^150`\n    `P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - (0.68)^(150/100)`\n    `P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\n4.  **Perform the final calculation:**\n    `(0.68)^1.5 = 0.68 * √0.68 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607`\n    `P(decay in 150 min) = 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is approximately 0.4393, or 43.93%. This value is closest to 44%.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 52:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Define the Decay Law:** Radioactive decay follows an exponential law. The probability `P_survive(t)` that an atom survives for a time `t` is given by:\n    `P_survive(t) = e^(-λt)`\n    where `λ` is the decay constant, a value specific to the type of atom. Consequently, the probability of an atom decaying within a time `t` is `P_decay(t) = 1 - P_survive(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n2.  **Use the Given Information to Characterize the Atom:** We are told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n    `P_decay(100) = 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32`\n    From this, we can find the probability of survival for 100 minutes:\n    `P_survive(100) = e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n    This equation links the decay constant `λ` to a known probability and time.\n\n3.  **Apply the \"Memoryless\" Property:** The core principle of radioactive decay is that it's a \"memoryless\" process. This means the probability of an atom decaying in a future time interval does not depend on how long it has already existed. The fact that the atom has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future behavior. The problem is equivalent to asking: \"What is the probability that a new atom of this type will decay in 150 minutes?\"\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Probability:** We need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, which is `P_decay(150)`.\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - P_survive(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\n5.  **Solve for the Probability:** We can solve this without explicitly finding the value of `λ`. We use the relationship we found in step 2:\n    `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`\n    We can write `e^(-λ * 150)` in terms of this known value:\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n    Now, substitute the known value (0.68):\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n    The probability of survival for 150 minutes is `(0.68)^1.5`.\n\n    Therefore, the probability of decay in 150 minutes is:\n    `P_decay(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\n6.  **Numerical Calculation:** The Python code from the reasoning step calculated this value:\n    `1 - (0.68)^1.5 ≈ 1 - 0.5606... ≈ 0.4393`\n    Converting this to a percentage gives 43.93%.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The calculated probability is approximately 44%. This matches option B.\n\n<<<B>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 53:\nThis problem is about the probability of radioactive decay, which is a classic example of a process that can be modeled by an exponential distribution. The key feature of such a process is that it is \"memoryless.\"\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Decay Model**\n\nThe probability of an atom surviving for a time `t` without decaying is given by the survival function `S(t) = e^(-λt)`, where `λ` is the decay constant. The probability of the atom decaying within time `t` is `P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Decay Constant (λ)**\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%.\n*   P(100) = 0.32\n*   1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32\n*   e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\nTo find `λ`, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n*   -100λ = ln(0.68)\n*   λ = -ln(0.68) / 100\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Memoryless Property**\n\nThe problem asks for the probability that the atom will decay in the *next* 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes. This can be written as a conditional probability: `P(decay in next 150 mins | survived 50 mins)`.\n\nRadioactive decay is a memoryless process. This means the probability of a future event does not depend on the history of the process. The atom does not \"age\" or \"get tired.\" Therefore, the fact that it has already survived for 50 minutes is irrelevant to its future decay probability.\n\nSo, the question simplifies to finding the probability that the atom will decay in any given 150-minute interval.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Probability**\n\nWe need to calculate the probability of decay within 150 minutes, `P(150)`.\n*   P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)\n\nSubstitute the expression for `λ` we found in Step 2:\n*   P(150) = 1 - e^([-ln(0.68) / 100] * 150)\n*   P(150) = 1 - e^(1.5 * ln(0.68))\n\nUsing the logarithm property `a * ln(b) = ln(b^a)`:\n*   P(150) = 1 - e^(ln(0.68^1.5))\n\nSince `e^ln(x) = x`:\n*   P(150) = 1 - 0.68^1.5\n\nUsing a calculator (as was done by the Python code):\n*   0.68^1.5 ≈ 0.5607\n*   P(150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393\n\nConverting this to a percentage, we get 43.93%.\n\n**Step 5: Compare with Options**\nThe calculated probability is 43.93%, which is closest to the given option D) 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 54:\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning for solving this problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Core Physical Principle: The Memoryless Nature of Decay**\n\nThe most crucial concept for this problem is that radioactive decay is a **memoryless process**. This is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics and processes described by exponential decay. It means that an atom does not \"age\" or \"get closer to decaying\" over time. Its probability of decaying in any future time interval is constant and completely independent of how long it has already existed.\n\n**2. Simplify the Question Based on this Principle**\n\nThe problem states that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. Because of the memoryless property, this information is irrelevant to the atom's future. The atom's \"internal clock\" has effectively reset. Therefore, the complex-sounding question:\n\n> \"What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has already survived 50 minutes?\"\n\nis perfectly equivalent to the much simpler question:\n\n> \"What is the probability that a brand-new atom of this type will decay within 150 minutes?\"\n\n**3. Set up the Mathematical Framework**\n\nThe probability that an atom *survives* for a period `t` is given by the survival function, `S(t)`:\n*   `S(t) = e^(-λt)`\nwhere `λ` is the decay constant for that particular type of atom.\n\nThe probability that an atom *decays* within a period `t` is the complement, `F(t)`:\n*   `F(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt)`\n\n**4. Use the Provided Data to Find a Key Value**\n\nWe are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (or 0.32).\n*   `F(100) = 0.32`\n\nThis tells us that the probability of the atom *surviving* for 100 minutes is:\n*   `S(100) = 1 - F(100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68`\n\nUsing our formula from Step 3, we now know:\n*   `S(100) = e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`\n\n**5. Calculate the Probability for the Required Time Interval**\n\nWe need to find the probability of decay within 150 minutes, which is `F(150)`.\n*   `F(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150)`\n\nWe can find the value of `S(150)` without explicitly solving for `λ`. We can use the properties of exponents to relate `S(150)` to `S(100)`:\n*   `S(150) = e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n\nSince we found in Step 4 that `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`, we can substitute this value:\n*   `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\n**6. Compute the Final Answer**\n\nNow we can calculate the final decay probability, `F(150)`:\n*   `F(150) = 1 - S(150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n\nUsing a calculator:\n*   `(0.68)^1.5 ≈ 0.559`\n*   `F(150) = 1 - 0.559 = 0.441`\n\nConverting this probability to a percentage gives 44.1%, which is closest to 44%.\n\n<<<C>>>\n\n---\n\nAnswer 55:\nThe problem describes a radioactive decay process, which follows an exponential distribution.

This is a conditional probability: `P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50)`.\n\nBecause the decay process is memoryless, the 50 minutes that have already passed do not affect the future probability.\n`P(T ≤ 50 + 150 | T > 50) = P(T ≤ 150)`\nSo, we simply need to calculate the probability that a \"fresh\" atom would decay within 150 minutes.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Required Probability**\n\nWe need to calculate `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - P(T > 150) = 1 - S(150)`.\n*   We know `S(150) = e^(-λ * 150)`.\n*   We can use the value we found in Step 2 to solve for this:\n    `e^(-λ * 150) = e^(-λ * 100 * 1.5) = (e^(-λ * 100))^1.5`\n*   Substitute the known value `e^(-λ * 100) = 0.68`:\n    `S(150) = (0.68)^1.5`\n\nNow we calculate the decay probability:\n*   `P(T ≤ 150) = 1 - (0.68)^1.5`\n*   `P(T ≤ 150) ≈ 1 - 0.5607`\n*   `P(T ≤ 150) ≈ 0.4393`\n\n**Step 5: Convert to Percentage and Choose the Answer**\n\nThe probability of decay is approximately 0.4393, which is 43.93%.

This value is closest to 44%.\n\n    *Alternatively, without calculating the explicit value of λ, we can use a more direct mathematical approach:*\n    From Step 1, we have e⁻¹⁰⁰ˡ = 0.68.\n    The probability of decay in 150 minutes is P = 1 - e⁻¹⁵⁰ˡ.\n    We can rewrite e⁻¹⁵⁰ˡ as (e⁻¹⁰⁰ˡ)¹∙⁵.\n    Substituting the known value: P = 1 - (0.68)¹∙⁵.\n    P ≈ 1 - 0.5598\n    P ≈ 0.4402\n    This confirms the probability is approximately 44%.\n\nThe correct option is therefore 44%.\n\n<<<D>>>\n\n---\n\nBased on the candidates above, analyze the question step by step and try to list all the careful points.In the end of your response, directly output the answer to the question with the format <<<answer content>>>."
