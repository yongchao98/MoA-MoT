    "To solve the expression `False or not (True) and False`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order is:\n\n1. Parentheses\n2. NOT\n3. AND\n4. OR\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: `(True)` which is `True`.\n2. Apply the NOT operator: `not (True)` becomes `False`.\n3. Evaluate the AND operation: `False and False` is `False`.\n4. Finally, evaluate the OR operation: `False or False` is `False`.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to evaluate this expression and print the result in the specified format.\n\n```python\nresult = False or not (True) and False\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```"
