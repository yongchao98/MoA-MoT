    "To solve the expression `True or not False and True and False`, we need to follow the order of operations for logical expressions, which is similar to arithmetic operations. The order is:\n\n1. `not`\n2. `and`\n3. `or`\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Evaluate `not False`: This becomes `True`.\n2. Evaluate `True and True`: This becomes `True`.\n3. Evaluate `True and False`: This becomes `False`.\n4. Finally, evaluate `True or False`: This becomes `True`.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to evaluate this expression and print the result in the specified format.\n\n```python\nresult = True or not False and True and False\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```"

Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    True or not False and True and False is\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>."
