    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to the goal positions, following the rules of only moving the top block of any stack. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - stack1: \n   - stack2: \n   - stack3: A B\n\n2. **Goal State**: \n   - stack1: A B\n   - stack2: \n   - stack3: \n\n3. **Steps to achieve the goal**:\n   - Move B from stack3 to stack1.\n   - Move A from stack3 to stack1.\n\nBy following these steps, we will achieve the goal state. Now, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move B from 3 to 1\nMove A from 3 to 1>>>\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant.

Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
