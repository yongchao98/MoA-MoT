    "To solve the expression \\(9^3 + 3(9^2) + 3(9) + 1\\), we can break it down into smaller parts and calculate each part step by step:\n\n1. Calculate \\(9^3\\).\n2. Calculate \\(3 \\times 9^2\\).\n3. Calculate \\(3 \\times 9\\).\n4. Add all the results together along with 1.\n\nFinally, we will print the result in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Calculate 9^3\npart1 = 9**3\n\n# Step 2: Calculate 3 * 9^2\npart2 = 3 * (9**2)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate 3 * 9\npart3 = 3 * 9\n\n# Step 4: Add all parts together with 1\nresult = part1 + part2 + part3 + 1\n\n# Output the result in the specified format\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the value of $9^3 + 3(9^2) + 3(9) + 1$?\n\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>> such as <<<123.42>>>, <<<125.0>>>, <<<-9867>>>.\nYour answer: "
