    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen point \\((x, y)\\) from the rectangular region satisfies the condition \\(x > 2y\\).\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1. **Understand the Region**: The rectangular region is defined by the vertices \\((0,0)\\), \\((2008,0)\\), \\((2008,2009)\\), and \\((0,2009)\\). This means \\(0 \\leq x \\leq 2008\\) and \\(0 \\leq y \\leq 2009\\).\n\n2. **Equation of the Line**: The inequality \\(x > 2y\\) can be rewritten as \\(y < \\frac{x}{2}\\). This represents a region below the line \\(y = \\frac{x}{2}\\).\n\n3. **Intersection Points**: Determine where the line \\(y = \\frac{x}{2}\\) intersects the boundaries of the rectangle:\n   - At \\(x = 2008\\), \\(y = \\frac{2008}{2} = 1004\\).\n   - At \\(y = 2009\\), \\(x = 2 \\times 2009 = 4018\\), but since \\(x\\) is limited to 2008, this point is outside the rectangle.\n\n4. **Area Calculation**: The area of the rectangle is \\(2008 \\times 2009\\). The area below the line \\(y = \\frac{x}{2}\\) within the rectangle is a right triangle with vertices at \\((0,0)\\), \\((2008,0)\\), and \\((2008,1004)\\).\n\n5. **Area of the Triangle**: The base of the triangle is 2008 (along the x-axis), and the height is 1004 (along the y-axis). The area of the triangle is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2008 \\times 1004\\).\n\n6. **Probability Calculation**: The probability is the area of the triangle divided by the area of the rectangle.\n\nNow, let's calculate this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Dimensions of the rectangle\nwidth = 2008\nheight = 2009\n\n# Area of the rectangle\narea_rectangle = width * height\n\n# Base and height of the triangle\nbase_triangle = width\nheight_triangle = width / 2  # 1004\n\n# Area of the triangle\narea_triangle = 0.5 * base_triangle * height_triangle\n\n# Probability\nprobability = area_triangle / area_rectangle\n\n# Output the probability as a common fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability_fraction = Fraction(probability).limit_denominator()\n\nprint(f\"<<<{probability_fraction}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code calculates the probability and outputs it as a common fraction."
