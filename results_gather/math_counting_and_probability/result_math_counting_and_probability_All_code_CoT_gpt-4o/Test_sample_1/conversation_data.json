    "To solve this problem, we need to consider the symmetries of the star. A regular five-pointed star has rotational and reflectional symmetries. Specifically, it can be rotated by multiples of 72 degrees (since 360/5 = 72) and reflected across lines through its center.\n\n1. **Rotational Symmetry**: There are 5 rotations (0, 72, 144, 216, and 288 degrees) that map the star onto itself.\n\n2. **Reflectional Symmetry**: There are 5 lines of reflectional symmetry.\n\nUsing Burnside's Lemma, which helps in counting distinct objects under group actions, we can calculate the number of distinct arrangements. Burnside's Lemma states that the number of distinct arrangements is the average number of points fixed by each group action.\n\n- **Identity rotation (0 degrees)**: All 10! arrangements are fixed.\n- **Rotations by 72, 144, 216, 288 degrees**: No arrangement is fixed because no arrangement of 10 distinct shells can be invariant under these rotations.\n- **Reflections**: Each reflection swaps pairs of points, so no arrangement of 10 distinct shells can be invariant under reflection.\n\nThus, the only fixed arrangements are under the identity rotation.\n\nLet's calculate the number of distinct arrangements using Burnside's Lemma:\n\n```python\nfrom math import factorial\n\n# Total number of arrangements without considering symmetry\ntotal_arrangements = factorial(10)\n\n# Number of symmetries (5 rotations + 5 reflections)\nnum_symmetries = 10\n\n# Using Burnside's Lemma\ndistinct_arrangements = total_arrangements / num_symmetries\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"<<<{distinct_arrangements}>>>\")\n```"
