    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that two randomly picked shoes are of the same color and consist of one left shoe and one right shoe.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Total Number of Shoes**: Sue has 11 pairs of shoes, which means she has 22 shoes in total.\n\n2. **Total Ways to Pick Two Shoes**: The total number of ways to pick any two shoes from 22 is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items to choose from, and k is the number of items to choose. So, C(22, 2).\n\n3. **Ways to Pick Two Shoes of the Same Color and Different Sides**:\n   - **Black Shoes**: There are 6 pairs, so 6 left and 6 right shoes. The number of ways to pick one left and one right shoe is 6 (since for each left shoe, there is exactly one matching right shoe).\n   - **Brown Shoes**: There are 3 pairs, so 3 left and 3 right shoes. The number of ways to pick one left and one right shoe is 3.\n   - **Gray Shoes**: There are 2 pairs, so 2 left and 2 right shoes. The number of ways to pick one left and one right shoe is 2.\n\n4. **Total Ways to Pick Two Shoes of the Same Color and Different Sides**: Add the ways for each color: 6 (black) + 3 (brown) + 2 (gray).\n\n5. **Probability Calculation**: The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python to calculate the probability.\n\n```python\nfrom math import comb\n\n# Total number of shoes\ntotal_shoes = 22\n\n# Total ways to pick any two shoes\ntotal_ways = comb(total_shoes, 2)\n\n# Ways to pick two shoes of the same color and different sides\nblack_pairs = 6\nbrown_pairs = 3\ngray_pairs = 2\n\nsame_color_different_sides = black_pairs + brown_pairs + gray_pairs\n\n# Probability calculation\nprobability = same_color_different_sides / total_ways\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"<<<{probability}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will calculate and print the probability in the required format."
