There is a dismantling engineer who has old machines A, B, and C. He discovered that he can obtain a batch of new parts X, Y, and Z through the following methods:
Method 1: Each round, one machine A breaks down into two part X and one part Y.
Method 2: Dismantling two machine B units produces one part X each cycle.
Method 3: Two units of machine C can be dismantled into one unit of part Y per round.
Method 4: One unit of machine B and one unit of machine C can be combined into one unit of machine A per round.
Method 5: Each round, one part X and one part Y merge to form one part Z.

Xiao Li continuously cycles through these methods in the given order, executing one method at a time. After Method 5, start again from Method 1. Continue this cycle until no method can be executed. Initially, there are 10 units of Machine A, 8 units of Machine B, and 9 units of Machine C. How many parts X, Y, and Z can Li ultimately obtain, and how many machines A, B, and C will remain?

Generate the answer in the format <<<a string representing the outcome in the order of machines A, B, C, parts X, Y, Z>>>. For example, if Machine A has 1 unit, Machine B has 0 units, Machine C has 1 unit, Part X has 1 unit, Part Y has 1 unit, and Part Z has 1 unit, it should be represented as ["1", "0", "1", "1", "1", "1"].
