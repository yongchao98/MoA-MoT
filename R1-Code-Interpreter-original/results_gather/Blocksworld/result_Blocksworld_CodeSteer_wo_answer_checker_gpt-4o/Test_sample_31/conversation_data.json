    "To solve the Blocksworld task, we need to move blocks from their initial positions to match the goal state. We can only move the top block from any stack to another stack. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - stack1: \n   - stack2: B E\n   - stack3: C F D\n   - stack4: A\n\n2. **Goal State:**\n   - stack1: A B F\n   - stack2: C\n   - stack3: D E\n\n3. **Plan:**\n   - Move A from stack4 to stack1.\n   - Move D from stack3 to stack2.\n   - Move F from stack3 to stack1.\n   - Move E from stack2 to stack3.\n   - Move B from stack2 to stack1.\n   - Move C from stack3 to stack2.\n\nNow, let's write the moves in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<Move A from 4 to 1\nMove D from 3 to 2\nMove F from 3 to 1\nMove E from 2 to 3\nMove B from 2 to 1\nMove C from 3 to 2>>>\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Blocksworld Task:\n\nInitial State:\nstack1: \nstack2: B E\nstack3: C F D\nstack4: A\n\nGoal State:\nstack1: A B F\nstack2: C\nstack3: D E\n\nPlease provide a series of moves to reach the goal state.
