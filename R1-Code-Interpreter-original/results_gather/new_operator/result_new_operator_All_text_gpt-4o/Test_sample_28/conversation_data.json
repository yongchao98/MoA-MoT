    "To solve the expression (3~4)$5@6 using the defined operations, we need to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the operations:**\n   - The operation `a~b` is defined as `1 * a * b`.\n   - The operation `a$b` is defined as `(a + b) / b`.\n   - The operation `a@b` is defined as `(a + b) / b`.\n\n2. **Calculate 3~4:**\n   - Using the definition of `a~b`, we have `3~4 = 1 * 3 * 4`.\n   - Calculate: `1 * 3 * 4 = 12`.\n\n3. **Calculate (3~4)$5:**\n   - We have already calculated `3~4` as 12.\n   - Now, using the definition of `a$b`, we have `12$5 = (12 + 5) / 5`.\n   - Calculate: `(12 + 5) / 5 = 17 / 5 = 3.4`.\n\n4. **Calculate ((3~4)$5)@6:**\n   - We have already calculated `(3~4)$5` as 3.4.\n   - Now, using the definition of `a@b`, we have `3.4@6 = (3.4 + 6) / 6`.\n   - Calculate: `(3.4 + 6) / 6 = 9.4 / 6 ≈ 1.5667`.\n\n5. **Format the answer:**\n   - The final answer should be presented in the format `<<<list of values and symbols>>>`.\n   - The list of values and symbols used in the calculation are: `3, ~, 4, $, 5, @, 6`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3, ~, 4, $, 5, @, 6>>>"
