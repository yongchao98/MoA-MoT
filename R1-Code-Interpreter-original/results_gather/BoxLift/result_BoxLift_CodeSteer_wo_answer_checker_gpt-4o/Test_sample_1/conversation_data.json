    "To solve this problem, we need to assign lifters to boxes in such a way that we minimize the number of steps required to lift all the boxes. We have to consider the constraints that each lifter can only lift one box at a time, but multiple lifters can combine to lift a single box if needed.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Sort the Boxes and Lifters**: Start by sorting the boxes in descending order of weight and the lifters in descending order of capacity. This helps in efficiently matching the heaviest boxes with the strongest lifters or combination of lifters.\n\n2. **Assign Lifters to Boxes**: For each step, try to assign the heaviest available boxes to the available lifters. If a single lifter cannot lift a box, combine lifters to match or exceed the box's weight.\n\n3. **Repeat Until All Boxes Are Lifted**: Continue this process until all boxes are lifted, ensuring that the number of steps does not exceed 5.\n\n4. **Output the Steps**: For each step, output the boxes lifted and the indices of the lifters used.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\nboxes = [71, 58, 105, 85, 123, 125, 84, 105, 141, 73, 102, 46]\nlifters = [77, 45, 120, 109]\n\n# Sort boxes and lifters in descending order\nboxes.sort(reverse=True)\nlifters.sort(reverse=True)\n\nsteps = []\nwhile boxes:\n    step = []\n    used_lifters = [False] * len(lifters)\n    \n    for i, box in enumerate(boxes[:]):\n        for j, lifter in enumerate(lifters):\n            if not used_lifters[j] and lifter >= box:\n                step.append((box, [j]))\n                used_lifters[j] = True\n                boxes.remove(box)\n                break\n        else:\n            # Try to combine lifters if a single lifter can't lift the box\n            for j in range(len(lifters)):\n                if used_lifters[j]:\n                    continue\n                total_capacity = lifters[j]\n                lifter_indices = [j]\n                for k in range(j + 1, len(lifters)):\n                    if used_lifters[k]:\n                        continue\n                    if total_capacity >= box:\n                        break\n                    total_capacity += lifters[k]\n                    lifter_indices.append(k)\n                if total_capacity >= box:\n                    for idx in lifter_indices:\n                        used_lifters[idx] = True\n                    step.append((box, lifter_indices))\n                    boxes.remove(box)\n                    break\n    \n    steps.append(step)\n\n# Print the steps\noutput = \"\"\nfor i, step in enumerate(steps):\n    output += f\"Step {i + 1}: {step}\\n\"\n\nprint(f\"<<<{output.strip()}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the steps required to lift all the boxes using the given lifters, ensuring that the number of steps is minimized and does not exceed 5."
