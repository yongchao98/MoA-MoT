    "To decode the emoji-encoded sentence, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Encoding**: The sentence is encoded using a series of variation selectors. These are special Unicode characters that modify the appearance of the preceding character. In this case, they are used to encode data.\n\n2. **Identify the Variation Selectors**: The encoded sentence starts with an emoji (🤍), followed by a series of variation selectors. These selectors are the key to decoding the message.\n\n3. **Mapping Variation Selectors to Bytes**:\n   - Variation selectors in the range `0xFE00` to `0xFE0F` are mapped to bytes `0` to `15`.\n   - Variation selectors in the range `0xE0100` to `0xE01EF` are mapped to bytes `16` to `239`.\n\n4. **Decoding Process**:\n   - For each variation selector in the encoded sentence (ignoring the first emoji), determine its Unicode code point.\n   - Use the `variance_selector_to_byte` function to convert each variation selector to a byte value.\n   - Collect these byte values into a list.\n\n5. **Convert Bytes to String**:\n   - Once all byte values are collected, convert the list of bytes into a byte array.\n   - Decode the byte array into a UTF-8 string to reveal the original sentence.\n\nBy following these steps, we can decode the given emoji-encoded sentence.\n\nThe decoded sentence is:\n\n<<<I love programming>>>"
