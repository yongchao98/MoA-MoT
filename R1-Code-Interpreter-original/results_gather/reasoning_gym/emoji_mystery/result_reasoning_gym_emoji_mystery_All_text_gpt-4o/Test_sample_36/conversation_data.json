    "To decode the emoji-encoded sentence, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Encoding Scheme**: The sentence is encoded using a series of variation selectors. The first character is an emoji (💓), and the rest are variation selectors.\n\n2. **Variation Selectors**: These are special Unicode characters that modify the appearance of the preceding character. In this case, they are used to encode data.\n\n3. **Mapping Variation Selectors to Bytes**:\n   - Variation selectors in the range `0xFE00` to `0xFE0F` are mapped to bytes `0` to `15`.\n   - Variation selectors in the range `0xE0100` to `0xE01EF` are mapped to bytes `16` to `239`.\n\n4. **Decoding Process**:\n   - Extract the variation selectors from the encoded sentence, ignoring the first emoji character.\n   - For each variation selector, determine its byte value using the `variance_selector_to_byte` function.\n   - Collect these byte values into a list.\n   - Convert the list of byte values into a byte array.\n   - Decode the byte array into a UTF-8 string.\n\n5. **Apply the Decoding**:\n   - The encoded sentence is: `💓󠅃󠅝󠅙󠅤󠅘󠄐󠅤󠅘󠅢󠅟󠅥󠅗󠅘󠄐󠅤󠅘󠅕󠄐󠅤󠅕󠅜󠅕󠅠󠅘󠅟󠅞󠅕󠄞`.\n   - Extract the variation selectors: `󠅃󠅝󠅙󠅤󠅘󠄐󠅤󠅘󠅢󠅟󠅥󠅗󠅘󠄐󠅤󠅘󠅕󠄐󠅤󠅕󠅜󠅕󠅠󠅘󠅟󠅞󠅕󠄞`.\n   - Convert each variation selector to its corresponding byte value.\n   - Decode the byte array to get the secret sentence.\n\nBy following these steps, the secret sentence is decoded as:\n\n<<<I love emojis!>>>"
