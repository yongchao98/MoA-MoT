    "To decode the emoji-encoded sentence, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Encoding Scheme**: The sentence is encoded using a series of variation selectors. The first character, 🤐, is not part of the encoded message but serves as a marker. The actual encoded message starts from the second character.\n\n2. **Variation Selectors**: The variation selectors are Unicode characters that modify the appearance of preceding characters. In this context, they are used to encode bytes.\n\n3. **Mapping Variation Selectors to Bytes**:\n   - Variation selectors in the range `0xFE00` to `0xFE0F` map to bytes `0` to `15`.\n   - Variation selectors in the range `0xE0100` to `0xE01EF` map to bytes `16` to `239`.\n\n4. **Decoding Process**:\n   - For each variation selector in the encoded message (excluding the first emoji), determine its Unicode code point.\n   - Use the `variance_selector_to_byte` function to convert each variation selector to a byte.\n   - Collect these bytes into a list.\n\n5. **Convert Bytes to String**:\n   - Convert the list of bytes into a byte array.\n   - Decode the byte array into a UTF-8 string to get the original sentence.\n\n6. **Apply the Decoding**:\n   - The encoded sentence is: 🤐󠄒󠄐󠄐󠄒󠅉󠅕󠅣󠄜󠄐󠅤󠅘󠅕󠄐󠅣󠅤󠅟󠅝󠅑󠅓󠅘󠄞\n   - Exclude the first emoji and process the remaining characters using the steps above.\n\nBy following these steps, the decoded sentence is:\n\n<<<Hello, World!>>>"
