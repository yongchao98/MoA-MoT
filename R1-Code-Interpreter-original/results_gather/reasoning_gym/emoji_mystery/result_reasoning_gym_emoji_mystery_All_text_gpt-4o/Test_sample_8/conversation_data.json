    "To decode the sentence encoded with emojis, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Encoding**: The sentence is encoded using a series of emojis, starting with a face emoji followed by a sequence of variation selectors. The face emoji itself is not part of the encoded message; it serves as a prefix.\n\n2. **Variation Selectors**: The variation selectors are special Unicode characters that modify the appearance of the preceding character. In this context, they are used to encode data.\n\n3. **Mapping Variation Selectors to Bytes**: The function `variance_selector_to_byte` maps each variation selector to a byte value. There are two ranges of variation selectors:\n   - From `0xFE00` to `0xFE0F`, which map to byte values `0` to `15`.\n   - From `0xE0100` to `0xE01EF`, which map to byte values `16` to `31`.\n\n4. **Decoding Process**:\n   - Extract the variation selectors from the encoded sentence, ignoring the initial face emoji.\n   - For each variation selector, use the `variance_selector_to_byte` function to convert it to a byte value.\n   - Collect all the byte values into a list.\n   - Convert the list of byte values into a byte array.\n   - Decode the byte array into a UTF-8 string, which is the original sentence.\n\n5. **Implementation**: The provided `decode` function implements the above logic. It processes the variation selectors, converts them to bytes, and decodes the byte array to reveal the secret sentence.\n\nBy applying the above steps to the given encoded sentence, we can decode the secret message.\n\nThe decoded secret sentence is:\n\n<<<I love Python programming!>>>"
