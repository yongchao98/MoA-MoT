  "question": "Your task is to count how many rectangles are present in an ASCII grid.\n\nSingle rectangles are outlined with a '#', overlapping rectangles (max 2) are shown with '█'.\n\nYour output should be a single number, representing the total count of rectangles, enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the total count of rectangles>>>.\n\nNow, it's your turn.

When finding a '#', checking if it forms a complete rectangle by verifying:\n   - The horizontal edges (top and bottom)\n   - The vertical edges (left and right)\n   - The corners\n3. Counting each valid rectangle exactly once by only counting from its top-left corner\n\nSince there are no overlapping rectangles (which would be marked with '█') and only one clear rectangle formed by '#' characters, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
