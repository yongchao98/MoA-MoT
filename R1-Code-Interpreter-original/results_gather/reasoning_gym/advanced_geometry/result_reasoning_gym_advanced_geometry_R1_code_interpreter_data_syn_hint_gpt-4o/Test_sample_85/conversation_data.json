    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to determine the intersection of the altitudes. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line from a vertex to the opposite side (or its extension).\n\nGiven the vertices of the triangle:\n- A = (-5, -5)\n- B = (-4, 2)\n- C = (-5, 7)\n\nLet's determine the equations of the altitudes:\n\n1. **Altitude from A to BC:**\n   - The line BC has endpoints B(-4, 2) and C(-5, 7).\n   - The slope of BC is \\((7 - 2) / (-5 + 4) = 5 / -1 = -5\\).\n   - The perpendicular slope (altitude from A) is the negative reciprocal, which is \\(1/5\\).\n   - The equation of the line through A(-5, -5) with slope \\(1/5\\) is:\n     \\[ y + 5 = \\frac{1}{5}(x + 5) \\]\n\n2. **Altitude from B to AC:**\n   - The line AC has endpoints A(-5, -5) and C(-5, 7).\n   - The slope of AC is \\((7 + 5) / (-5 + 5) = 12 / 0\\), which is undefined (a vertical line).\n   - The perpendicular line (altitude from B) is horizontal, so it has a slope of 0.\n   - The equation of the line through B(-4, 2) with slope 0 is:\n     \\[ y = 2 \\]\n\n3. **Altitude from C to AB:**\n   - The line AB has endpoints A(-5, -5) and B(-4, 2).\n   - The slope of AB is \\((2 + 5) / (-4 + 5) = 7 / 1 = 7\\).\n   - The perpendicular slope (altitude from C) is the negative reciprocal, which is \\(-1/7\\).\n   - The equation of the line through C(-5, 7) with slope \\(-1/7\\) is:\n     \\[ y - 7 = -\\frac{1}{7}(x + 5) \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the intersection of any two of these altitudes. Let's find the intersection of the first two altitudes:\n\n- Altitude from A: \\( y + 5 = \\frac{1}{5}(x + 5) \\)\n- Altitude from B: \\( y = 2 \\)\n\nSubstitute \\( y = 2 \\) into the equation of the altitude from A:\n\n\\[ 2 + 5 = \\frac{1}{5}(x + 5) \\]\n\nLet's solve this equation to find the x-coordinate of the orthocenter.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Equation for the intersection of the altitudes\nequation = Eq(2 + 5, (1/5)*(x + 5))\n\n# Solve for x\nx_value = solve(equation, x)[0]\n\n# y is already known from the altitude from B\ny_value = 2\n\n# Print the orthocenter coordinates\nprint((round(x_value, 3), round(y_value, 3)))\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will obtain the coordinates of the orthocenter.",
