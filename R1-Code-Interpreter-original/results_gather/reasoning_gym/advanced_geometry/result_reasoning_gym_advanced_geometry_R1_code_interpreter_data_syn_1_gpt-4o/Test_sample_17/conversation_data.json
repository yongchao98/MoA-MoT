    "To find the orthocenter of a triangle, we need to find the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle. An altitude of a triangle is a perpendicular line segment from a vertex to the line containing the opposite side.\n\nGiven the vertices of triangle ABC:\n- A = (1, 3)\n- B = (-7, 0)\n- C = (7, 6)\n\nWe will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the slopes of the sides of the triangle:**\n   - Slope of BC\n   - Slope of AC\n   - Slope of AB\n\n2. **Find the slopes of the altitudes:**\n   - The slope of the altitude from A is the negative reciprocal of the slope of BC.\n   - The slope of the altitude from B is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AC.\n   - The slope of the altitude from C is the negative reciprocal of the slope of AB.\n\n3. **Find the equations of the altitudes:**\n   - Use the point-slope form of the line equation for each altitude.\n\n4. **Find the intersection of any two altitudes:**\n   - Solve the system of equations formed by the equations of two altitudes to find the orthocenter.\n\nLet's calculate these step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the slopes of the sides\n\n- Slope of BC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n- Slope of AC: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n- Slope of AB: \\((y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)\\)\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the slopes of the altitudes\n\n- Slope of altitude from A: Negative reciprocal of slope of BC\n- Slope of altitude from B: Negative reciprocal of slope of AC\n- Slope of altitude from C: Negative reciprocal of slope of AB\n\n### Step 3: Find the equations of the altitudes\n\n- Use the point-slope form: \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\)\n\n### Step 4: Solve for the intersection of two altitudes\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the orthocenter.\n\n```python\n# Coordinates of the vertices\nA = (1, 3)\nB = (-7, 0)\nC = (7, 6)\n\n# Function to calculate slope\ndef slope(p1, p2):\n    return (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])\n\n# Slopes of the sides\nslope_BC = slope(B, C)\nslope_AC = slope(A, C)\nslope_AB = slope(A, B)\n\n# Slopes of the altitudes (negative reciprocals)\nslope_altitude_A = -1 / slope_BC\nslope_altitude_B = -1 / slope_AC\nslope_altitude_C = -1 / slope_AB\n\n# Equations of the altitudes using point-slope form\n# Altitude from A: y - 3 = slope_altitude_A * (x - 1)\n# Altitude from B: y - 0 = slope_altitude_B * (x + 7)\n\n# Solving for intersection of altitudes from A and B\n# y = slope_altitude_A * (x - 1) + 3\n# y = slope_altitude_B * (x + 7)\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nx, y = symbols('x y')\neq1 = Eq(y, slope_altitude_A * (x - 1) + 3)\neq2 = Eq(y, slope_altitude_B * (x + 7))\n\n# Solve the system of equations\northocenter = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\northocenter_rounded = (round(orthocenter[x], 3), round(orthocenter[y], 3))\n\nprint(orthocenter_rounded)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the orthocenter of the triangle by finding the intersection of two altitudes.
