    "The initial search results are not directly about the condition that the sumset `A+A` contains no square numbers.\n*   Results discuss the opposite problem: when a sumset `A+B` *is* a subset of the squares.\n*   Results are about square-difference-free sets, where `a-b` is not a square for `a, b` in `A`. This is related, but not the same. `A-A` is `A+(-A)`.\n*   Result is about square-sum-free sets, where no *subset* of A sums to a square. This is also different from `A+A` being square-free.\n*   Results are on various other topics in additive combinatorics and number theory that are too general or not directly relevant.\n\nIt seems I need to refine my search to be more specific to the condition on `A+A`. The original query was good, but the results were not as expected. Let me try to find constructions or density results specifically for sets `A` where `A+A` avoids squares. This might be a less-studied problem than square-difference-free sets, so I should look for more niche sources.\n\nI will try a new set of queries to narrow down the search. I will focus on finding constructions of sets `A` where `A+A` is square-free and any known density bounds.The searches are still not directly answering the question. However, some useful concepts and related results were found.\n\nFrom the search results, I can infer the following:\n- The problem of `A+A` being square-free is not as well-studied as square-difference-free sets or sum-free sets. I couldn't find a direct answer or a paper that studies this specific problem.\n- There are results on the density of sets `A` such that `A+A` contains a square. For example, a result by T. Schoen is mentioned, stating that if the asymptotic density `d(A) > 2/5`, then `A+A` must contain a square. This provides an upper bound on `c`, `c <= 2/5`.\n- A construction for a set `A` where `A+A` is square-free can be made using modular arithmetic. Let's explore this. Consider a modulus `m`. We want to find a set `S` of residues modulo `m` such that for any `s1, s2` in `S`, `s1+s2` is not a quadratic residue modulo `m`. If we can find such a set `S`, we can construct `A` as the set of all integers congruent to some element of `S` modulo `m`. The density of this set `A` would be `|S|/m`.\n- I will try to construct such a set `A` using modular arithmetic and try to maximize its density. Let's try small values of `m`.\n  - m=3: Squares mod 3 are 0 and 1. We want to avoid sums being 0 or 1. Let `S` be a subset of `{0, 1, 2}`.\n    - If `S={2}`, then `2+2 = 4 \\equiv 1` (a square). No.\n    - So we can't have any elements in `A`. This isn't helpful.\n  - m=4: Squares mod 4 are 0 and 1. We want to avoid sums being 0 or 1. Let `S` be a subset of `{0, 1, 2, 3}`.\n    - Let's try to choose `S` so that `s1+s2 \\equiv 2 or 3 (mod 4)`.\n    - If we take `S={1}`, then `1+1=2`. Works. density 1/4.\n    - If we take `S={3}`, then `3+3=6 \\equiv 2`. Works. density 1/4.\n    - If we take `S={1,3}`, then `1+1=2`, `3+3=2`, `1+3=4 \\equiv 0`. Fails.\n    - If we take `S={1,2}`, `1+1=2`, `2+2=4\\equiv 0`. Fails.\n    - So with m=4, the best we can do is `c=1/4`.\n  - m=5: Squares mod 5 are 0, 1, 4. We want to avoid these. `s1+s2 \\in \\{2, 3\\}`.\n    - Let `S=\\{1\\}`. `1+1=2`. Works. `c=1/5`.\n    - Let `S=\\{4\\}`. `4+4=8 \\equiv 3`. Works. `c=1/5`.\n    - Let `S=\\{1,4\\}`. `1+1=2`, `4+4=3`, `1+4=5 \\equiv 0`. Fails.\n    - Let `S=\\{1,x\\}`. `1+1=2`. `x+x` should be 2 or 3. if x=2, `2+2=4`, Fails. if x=3, `3+3=6 \\equiv 1`. Fails.\n - This suggests that finding a good modulus `m` and a corresponding set `S` is key.\n\nLet's try to formalize the construction. Let `A = \\{n \\in \\{1,...,N\\} | n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4\\}`. Then for any `a_1, a_2 \\in A`, we have `a_1 = 4k_1 + 1` and `a_2 = 4k_2 + 1`. So `a_1 + a_2 = 4(k_1+k_2) + 2`. Numbers of the form `4k+2` can never be a perfect square. A perfect square is either `(2m)^2=4m^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4` or `(2m+1)^2=4m^2+4m+1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4`. So a number that is `2 \\pmod 4` cannot be a square.\nThe size of this set `A` is `N/4 + O(1)`. So `c=1/4` is a possible value.\n\nCan we do better?\nLet's try other congruences. Let `A = \\{n | n \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4\\}`. Then `a_1+a_2 = 4(k_1+k_2) + 6 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4`. Again, this sum cannot be a square. `|A|` is also `N/4+O(1)`.\n\nWhat if we combine them? Let `A = \\{n | n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4 \\text{ or } n \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4 \\}`. This is the set of odd numbers. If `a_1=1, a_2=3`, `a_1+a_2=4`, which is a square. So this doesn't work.\n\nLet's consider a different modulus. How about `m=9`? Squares mod 9 are `0, 1, 4, 7`. We want to choose `S` such that `S+S` avoids these.\nLet's try `A = \\{n | n \\equiv c \\pmod m\\}`. `a_1+a_2 = 2c \\pmod m`. So we need to find `c, m` such that `2c` is not a quadratic residue mod `m`.\nWith `m=4`, `2c \\pmod 4`. if c=1, 2c=2. 2 is not a QR mod 4. OK. if c=3, 2c=6=2. 2 is not a QR mod 4. OK.\nWith `m=9`, `2c \\pmod 9`. We need to avoid `0, 1, 4, 7`.\n- c=1, 2c=2. OK.\n- c=2, 2c=4. Fails.\n- c=3, 2c=6. OK.\n- c=4, 2c=8. OK.\n- c=5, 2c=10=1. Fails.\n- c=6, 2c=12=3. OK.\n- c=7, 2c=14=5. OK.\n- c=8, 2c=16=7. Fails.\nSo `c \\in \\{1, 3, 4, 6, 7\\}` might work. The size of these sets `A` would be `N/9`. This is smaller than `N/4`.\n\nWhat if we choose `A` to be a union of congruence classes?\nLet `m` be a prime `p`. Quadratic residues mod p are `(p-1)/2` values (plus 0). Non-residues are `(p-1)/2`.\nLet's try to choose a set `S` such that `S+S` only contains non-residues.\nLet `p=5`. QR are {1,4}, NR are {2,3}. We want `s_1+s_2 \\in \\{2,3\\}`.\n- Let `S=\\{1\\}`. `1+1=2` (NR). OK. `c=1/5`.\n- Let `S=\\{x\\}` such that `2x` is a NR. If `x` is a QR, `2x` may be a NR. If `x` is a NR, `2x` may be a QR or NR.\nThis approach of picking a single congruence class seems to give `c=1/m`. To get a large `c`, we need a small `m`. So `m=4` with `c=1/4` seems to be the best from this simple construction.\n\nI need to search for more advanced constructions or proofs of upper bounds.\nA result by T. Schoen mentioned in one of the search results states that if d(A) > 2/5 then A+A contains a square. This implies that c cannot be larger than 2/5. This is a crucial piece of information. This is an upper bound. `c \\le 2/5`.\n\nThe construction `A = \\{ n | n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4 \\}` gives `c \\ge 1/4`.\nThe construction `A = \\{ n | n \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4 \\}` gives `c \\ge 1/4`.\nLet's try to construct a set with density higher than 1/4.\n\nConsider `A = \\{ n \\in \\{1,..,N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3 \\}`.\nThen `a_1+a_2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3`.\nThe squares modulo 3 are `0^2=0`, `1^2=1`, `2^2=4 \\equiv 1`.\nSo `2 \\pmod 3` is not a square. So any `a_1, a_2 \\in A` have `a_1+a_2` not a square.\nThe size of `A` is `(1/3+o(1))N`. So `c \\ge 1/3`.\n\nThis is better than 1/4. Can we do even better?\nLet's try `m=8`. Squares mod 8 are 0, 1, 4. We want `S+S` to be in `{2,3,5,6,7}`.\nLet `A = \\{n | n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8\\}`. `a_1+a_2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 8`. This is not a square. So `c \\ge 1/8`.\nLet `A = \\{n | n \\equiv 5 \\pmod 8\\}`. `a_1+a_2 \\equiv 10 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 8`. Not a square. `c \\ge 1/8`.\nLet `A = \\{n | n \\equiv 1, 5 \\pmod 8\\}`.\n`1+1=2`, `5+5=10 \\equiv 2`, `1+5=6`. None of these are squares mod 8.\nSo `A = \\{ n | n \\equiv 1 \\text{ or } 5 \\pmod 8\\}` gives a set where `A+A` contains no squares.\nThe size of this set is `(2/8+o(1))N = (1/4+o(1))N`. So `c \\ge 1/4`.\n\nWhat about `A = \\{n \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 5\\}`? `a_1+a_2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 5`. Squares mod 5 are 0, 1, 4. 2 is not a square. So `c \\ge 1/5`.\nWhat about `A = \\{n \\mid n \\equiv 4 \\pmod 5\\}`? `a_1+a_2 \\equiv 8 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 5`. 3 is not a square. `c \\ge 1/5`.\n\nLet's try to combine congruence classes modulo a prime `p`.\nLet `p` be a prime. Let `Q` be the set of quadratic residues mod p, and `N` be the set of non-residues.\nWe need a set `S \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}_p` such that `S+S \\subseteq N`.\nIf `S = \\{s\\}` then we need `2s \\in N`.\nIf `s \\in Q`, then `2 \\in N` is required.\nIf `s \\in N`, then `2` can be a QR or NR.\nWe want to find the largest such `S`.\n\nLet's reconsider Schoen's result `d(A)>2/5 => A+A` has a square. This strongly suggests `c=2/5` might be the answer, but it's an upper bound, and there could be a gap. The problem states `|A|=(c+o(1))N`, so we are looking for the supremum of possible densities.\n\nLet's look at `c=1/3` construction again.\n`A = \\{ n \\in \\{1,...,N\\} | n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}`. Then `a_1, a_2 \\in A` implies `a_1+a_2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3`.\nA number `k` is a perfect square iff `k \\not\\equiv 2 \\pmod 3`. So, `A+A` contains no square.\n`|A| = N/3 + O(1)`. Thus `c \\ge 1/3`.\n\nLet's try to improve on `c=1/3`.\nWhat if `A` consists of numbers congruent to `2 \\pmod 3`? Then `a_1+a_2 \\equiv 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3`. But `1 \\pmod 3` can be a square. `1, 4, 7, 10, ...`. For instance `1+1 \\pmod 3` is not helpful since `1+1=2`. But `a_1=2, a_2=2 \\implies a_1+a_2 = 4` (a square). No.\nLet's stick with `A = \\{3k+1\\}`.\n\nLet's look at the problem from the other side.\nSuppose `a_1+a_2 = k^2`.\nIf we take `A` to be a set of numbers in an arithmetic progression with difference `d`. `A=\\{x_0, x_0+d, ..., x_0 + (m-1)d\\}`.\n`a_1+a_2 = (x_0+id)+(x_0+jd) = 2x_0+(i+j)d`.\nWe want this to not be a square for all `i,j`.\nIn our `c=1/3` example, `A=\\{1,4,7,...\\}`. `x_0=1, d=3`. `2(1)+(i+j)3 = 2+3(i+j)`.\nThis number is always `2 \\pmod 3`, hence not a square.\n\nIs there any way to build a set with a density larger than `1/3`?\nIf `c` was larger than `1/3`, say `1/3 + \\epsilon`. Then by Roth's theorem, `A` must contain a 3-term arithmetic progression. Let `x, x+d, x+2d` be in `A`. Then the sums are `2x, 2x+d, 2x+2d, 2x+3d, 2x+4d`. One of these could be a square. This seems too general.\n\nLet's go back to Schoen's result. Is it possible `c` is exactly `2/5`? This would imply there's a construction. Let's try to imagine what it might look like.\n`A` cannot be a simple congruence class `mod m`. Because that would give density `1/m`. For `1/m` to be close to `2/5`, `m` must be small. We already checked small `m`.\n`m=3`: `c=1/3`.\n`m=4`: `c=1/4`.\n`m=5`: `c=1/5`. No, wait. `A=\\{5k+c\\}`. `2c \\pmod 5`. Squares mod 5 are 0,1,4. So `2c \\in \\{2,3\\}`.\nc=1 -> 2c=2 (NR). `c \\ge 1/5`.\nc=2 -> 2c=4 (QR). Fails.\nc=3 -> 2c=6=1 (QR). Fails.\nc=4 -> 2c=8=3 (NR). `c \\ge 1/5`.\n\nWhat about a union of congruence classes?\nMod 5: `S+S \\subseteq \\{2,3\\}`.\nIf `S=\\{1,3\\}`: `1+1=2`, `3+3=6\\equiv 1`. No.\nIf `S=\\{1,4\\}`: `1+4=0`. No.\nIf `S=\\{2,2\\}`: `2+2=4`. No.\nIf `S=\\{3,3\\}`: `3+3=1`. No.\nIf `S=\\{4,4\\}`: `4+4=3`. Works.\nIf `S=\\{1\\}` size 1, `S+S=\\{2\\}`. Works. `c=1/5`.\nIf `S=\\{4\\}` size 1, `S+S=\\{3\\}`. Works. `c=1/5`.\nIt is hard to construct a dense set `S` this way.\n\nThe problem seems to boil down to finding the largest density `\\alpha` of a set of integers `A` such that `A+A` contains no squares.\nI have a construction for `c = 1/3` and an upper bound `c \\le 2/5`.\nIs there any published result between `1/3` and `2/5`?\n\nI will search for \"density of sumsets avoiding squares\" and similar phrases, maybe adding the names of researchers in the field like Sárközy, Pintz, Steiger, Szemerédi, Schoen.\nLet's try to look for the original paper by T. Schoen.\n\"if A is a set of positive integers with asymptotic density d(A) > 2/5 then the sumset A + A contains a perfect square\" - this is cited in a paper by Dubickas. Let me try to find this result.\n\nI will try another search for Schoen's result.The search results have been very fruitful this time. I have found a paper by T. Schoen, \"On sets of natural numbers whose sumset is free of squares\", which seems to directly address the question.\n\nThe abstract of a paper by T. Schoen mentioned in a search result states: \"if A is a set of positive integers with asymptotic density d(A) > 2/5 then the sumset A + A contains a perfect square.\". This provides the upper bound $c \\le 2/5$.\n\nAnother result from the search, in a paper by J.-C. Schlage-Puchta on \"Sumsets avoiding squarefree integers\" mentions a construction by Schoen: \"Schoen constructed a set A of density 1/36 + 0.00025... such that A + A contains no squarefree integer\". This is about square*free* integers, not squares, so this is a different problem. However, the reference is to the same author, suggesting he works on these types of problems.\n\nThe key result appears to be in the paper \"On sets of natural numbers whose sumset is free of squares\" by T. Schoen. The search result provided a citation, but not the full text. Based on the title and the other related results, it is highly likely that this paper contains the answer.\n\nI have found a lower bound of `c >= 1/3` by considering the set `A = {n | n = 3k+1}`. For any two elements `a_1, a_2` in this set, their sum is `a_1+a_2 = 3k_1+1 + 3k_2+1 = 3(k_1+k_2)+2`. A number congruent to `2 \\pmod 3` can never be a square, as squares are congruent to `0` or `1 \\pmod 3`. So, for this set `A`, `A+A` contains no squares, and `|A| \\approx N/3`.\n\nThis gives us `1/3 \\le c \\le 2/5`.\n\nThe question asks for the largest number `c`. It's possible the value is `1/3` and the `2/5` bound is not tight for this specific problem (sum of two elements from the same set). Schoen's result seems to be for `A+B` and here we have the special case `A+A`.\n\nLet me re-examine the results for any other constructions.\nA paper by Schoen titled \"Squarefree numbers in sumsets\" was also found. This is about square-free numbers, not squares.\nLet's analyze the `c \\ge 1/3` construction again. It is solid.\nLet's assume the question asks for the exact value of `c`, it's likely one of these bounds is the answer. The problem is a \"largest number c\", which suggests a specific value is known.\nLet's assume for a moment the answer is `1/3`.\nIs it possible to construct a set with density larger than 1/3?\n\nLet `A` be the set of numbers whose base 3 representation contains only digits 0 and 1. The sum `a_1+a_2` will have digits 0, 1, 2. No carries. This does not seem to restrict the sum from being a square. This is not the right direction.\n\nLet's assume the question refers to a known, established result in additive number theory. The result `c \\le 2/5` by Schoen is a candidate for an upper bound. The construction `A = \\{3k+1\\}` gives `c \\ge 1/3`.\n\nIt appears a more recent result by A. Dubickas (2006, citing Schoen) states that if `d(A)>2/5` the `A+A` has a square. So `c \\le 2/5` seems correct.\n\nThere is a paper by Z. Chen and L. B. Chen, \"On the largest density of a set of integers whose sumset is square-free\", which seems to be exactly on topic. Unfortunately, I cannot access the full text of this paper. The abstract might contain the value of `c`. I will perform one last search for this paper or its abstract. If I can't find it, I'll have to conclude based on the information I have. The value 1/3 is a rigorous lower bound. The value 2/5 is a known upper bound. It is very likely that the answer is one of these, or a value in between. The question phrasing suggests a single value.\n\nThe question is about `A+A` containing no square numbers. The `c >= 1/3` construction `A = {n: n = 1 (mod 3)}` is valid. So `c` is at least `1/3`. The upper bound from Schoen's work is `2/5`. Is there any construction that improves on `1/3`?\n\nI will check `m=11`. Squares mod 11 are `{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9}`. Non-squares are `{2, 6, 7, 8, 10}`. We need a set `S \\subset \\mathbb{Z}_{11}` such that `S+S` is a subset of the non-squares.\nLet `S=\\{s_1, ..., s_k\\}`.\nTry `S = \\{1, 2, 7\\}`.\n`1+1=2` (NS)\n`1+2=3` (S) - fails.\n\nTry `S=\\{1, 6\\}`. `1+1=2`, `6+6=12 \\equiv 1` - fails.\nTry `S = \\{3, 4\\}`. `3+3=6`, `4+4=8`, `3+4=7`. This seems to work. The density is `2/11 < 1/3`.\n\nWhat about `S=\\{s | s \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}`. The density is `1/3`. Can we add more elements to this set?\nLet `A_0 = \\{n | n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}`. Let's try to add a number `x \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod 3`.\nIf `x \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3`. Let `a \\in A_0`. `x+a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3`. This can be a square. `1 \\pmod 3` is not forbidden.\nWe need `x+a` not to be a square for all `a \\in A_0`.\ne.g. `x=3`. Let `a=1 \\in A_0`, `3+1=4`. So `3` cannot be in the set.\ne.g. `x=6`. Let `a=1 \\in A_0`, `6+1=7`. `a=4 \\in A_0`, `6+4=10`. `a=10 \\in A_0`, `6+10=16`. No.\nThis approach is not working well.\n\nThe construction using `n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3` gives a density of `1/3`. This is a solid lower bound. The Schoen result provides an upper bound of `2/5`. Without access to the paper \"On sets of natural numbers whose sumset is free of squares\" by Schoen or other specific papers on this exact question, it's hard to close the gap between `1/3` and `2/5`.\n\nHowever, the problem as stated is a well-defined mathematical question, so a precise answer should exist. Given the available search results, the most likely scenario is that `c` is a known constant. `1/3` is the best constant I was able to construct. It's possible this is the answer. Let's assume for now that the simplest construction gives the best result, unless there's evidence to the contrary.\nThere's no indication of a simple construction yielding a `c` value between 1/3 and 2/5.\n\nGiven the information, `c=1/3` is the largest value for which I have a proven construction. It is a possibility that this is the final answer.\nI will do a final check to see if there is any other simple modular construction I overlooked.\nLet `A` be the set of integers congruent to `a \\pmod m`. Then `A+A` will be integers congruent to `2a \\pmod m`. We need `2a \\pmod m` to be a class of numbers that contains no squares.\nFor `m=3`, `2a \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3`. This works, gives `c=1/3`.\nFor `m=4`, `2a \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4`. This works for `a=1` and `a=3`. So `A=\\{4k+1\\}` or `A=\\{4k+3\\}`. `c=1/4`.\nFor `m=5`, `2a \\pmod 5` should not be `0,1,4`. So `2a \\in \\{2,3\\}`. This works for `a=1` (`2a=2`) and `a=4` (`2a=8\\equiv 3`). `c=1/5`.\nFor `m=6`, `2a \\pmod 6` should not be a square mod 6 (0, 1, 3, 4). `2a \\in \\{2,5\\}`. `a=1` -> `2a=2` ok. `a=2`->`4` no. `a=3`->`6=0` no. `a=4`->`8=2` ok. `a=5`->`10=4` no. This works for `a=1` and `a=4`. density `1/6`.\nFor `m=7`, squares are 0,1,2,4. Non-squares are 3,5,6. `2a \\in \\{3,5,6\\}`. `a=1` `2a=2` no. `a=2` `2a=4` no. `a=3` `2a=6` ok. `a=4` `2a=8\\equiv1` no. `a=5` `2a=10\\equiv3` ok. `a=6` `2a=12\\equiv5` ok. This works for a=3,5,6, so `c=1/7`.\n\nIt seems that among these simple constructions, `c=1/3` is the largest.\n\nFinal check on what I know:\n- Lower bound: `c \\ge 1/3` with `A = \\{n \\in \\{1,...,N\\} : n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}`.\n- Upper bound: `c \\le 2/5` from a result by T. Schoen.\n\nThere's no information that closes this gap in the search results. A math problem like this posed in this way usually has a precise, known answer. Without access to specialized databases or full-text articles, I may be stuck. The simplest, provable answer I have is 1/3. Perhaps this is the intended answer. It is the largest value for which a simple modular construction works. It's possible that `c=1/3`.\nI cannot be more accurate than `1/3 \\le c \\le 2/5`. I have a solid construction for 1/3, and a referenced upper bound of 2/5. Let's assume the question expects the best possible *construction* that is simple to state. That would be the one giving `c=1/3`.\n\nReconsidering the question, `|A|= (c+o(1))N `. This implies we're looking for the supremum of possible densities. It's very likely that a paper on this topic would have been published if the value was known and the proof non-trivial. The paper by Schoen seems to be the one. The fact that the search results bring up the 2/5 upper bound several times, but no specific construction between 1/3 and 2/5, leads me to believe that either the gap is open, or the answer is one of the bounds.\n\nLet's assume the answer is `1/3`. This would mean that the `2/5` bound cannot be improved to `1/3`.\nI think I have gathered enough information. The `1/3` construction is simple and correct. It is the best I can find. The `2/5` is an upper bound on a slightly more general problem. The problem may be that `A+A` is more restrictive. But it's the best information I have. I will present the answer based on the construction, which is a rigorous lower bound. There's no further information to be gained from more general searches.Based on my research, the largest number $c$ for which there exists a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ with $|A| = (c+o(1))N$ such that $A+A$ contains no perfect squares has a known lower bound and a potential upper bound.\n\n**Lower Bound Construction**\n\nA simple and effective construction gives a lower bound of $c \\ge 1/3$. Consider the set $A$ consisting of all integers in $\\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ that are congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n$A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\}$\nThe size of this set is $|A| = N/3 + O(1)$, which corresponds to a density of $1/3$.\n\nFor any two elements $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, we can write them as $a_1 = 3k_1 + 1$ and $a_2 = 3k_2 + 1$ for some integers $k_1, k_2$. Their sum is:\n$a_1 + a_2 = (3k_1 + 1) + (3k_2 + 1) = 3(k_1 + k_2) + 2$\nThis means that every element in the sumset $A+A$ is congruent to 2 modulo 3.\n\nA number is a perfect square if and only if its remainder modulo 3 is 0 or 1.\n*   If a number $m$ is a multiple of 3, $m=3k$, then $m^2 = 9k^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$.\n*   If a number $m$ is $3k+1$, then $m^2 = (3k+1)^2 = 9k^2+6k+1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$.\n*   If a number $m$ is $3k+2$, then $m^2 = (3k+2)^2 = 9k^2+12k+4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$.\n\nSince any sum of two elements from $A$ is congruent to 2 modulo 3, it cannot be a perfect square. Thus, $A+A$ contains no squares, and we have established that $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\n**Upper Bound**\n\nA result by Tomasz Schoen states that if a set of positive integers $A$ has an asymptotic density greater than $2/5$, then its sumset $A+A$ must contain a perfect square. This implies an upper bound on $c$:\n$c \\le 2/5$\n\nThis leaves a gap between the constructed lower bound and the known upper bound: $1/3 \\le c \\le 2/5$. The problem of determining the exact value of $c$ appears to be open or, at the least, not widely published in easily accessible sources. Without further specific literature on this exact question, the largest value of c that has been explicitly constructed is 1/3.\n\nGiven the information, the most definitive value that can be provided with a constructive proof is the lower bound.\n\n<<<1/3>>>"
